ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Unless the context suggests otherwise, references in this Annual Report to “Aircastle,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Aircastle Limited and its subsidiaries. References in this Annual Report to “Aircastle Bermuda” refer to Aircastle Holding Corporation Limited and its subsidiaries. Throughout this Annual Report, when we refer to our aircraft, we include aircraft that we have transferred into grantor trusts or similar entities for purposes of financing such assets through securitizations and term financings. These grantor trusts or similar entities are consolidated for purposes of our financial statements. All amounts in this Annual Report are expressed in U.S. dollars and the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”).
Aircastle acquires, leases, and sells commercial jet aircraft to airlines throughout the world. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and managed on behalf of our joint ventures 236 aircraft leased to 81 lessees located in 43 countries. Our aircraft are managed by an experienced team based in the United States, Ireland and Singapore. Our aircraft are subject to net leases whereby the lessee is generally responsible for maintaining the aircraft and paying operational, maintenance and insurance costs. In many cases, however, we are obligated to pay a portion of specified maintenance or modification costs. As of December 31, 2017, the net book value of our flight equipment (including flight equipment held for lease and net investment in finance and sales-type leases, or “net book value”) was $6.73 billion compared to $6.51 billion at the end of 2016. Our revenues and net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $796.6 million and $147.9 million, respectively, and for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $177.4 million and $55.1 million, respectively.
Growth in commercial air traffic is broadly correlated with world economic activity. In recent years, commercial air traffic growth has expanded at a rate 1.5 to 2 times that of global GDP growth. The expansion of air travel has driven a rise in the world aircraft fleet. There are currently approximately 21,000 commercial mainline passenger and freighter aircraft in operation worldwide. This fleet is expected to continue expanding at a three to four percent average annual rate over the next twenty years. Aircraft leasing companies own approximately 42% of the world’s commercial jet aircraft.
Notwithstanding the sector’s long-term growth, the aviation markets have been, and are expected to remain, subject to economic variability due to changes in macroeconomic variables, such as fuel price levels and foreign exchange rates. The aviation industry is also susceptible to external shocks, such as regional conflicts and terrorist events. Mitigating these risks is the portability of the assets, allowing aircraft to be redeployed to locations where demand is higher.
Air traffic data for the past several years has shown strong passenger market growth.  According to the International Air Transport Association, during 2017, global passenger traffic increased 7.6% compared to 2016. During 2017, air cargo traffic increased 9.0% compared to 2016.
Demand for air travel varies considerably by region. Emerging market economies have generally been experiencing greater increases in air traffic, driven by rising levels of per capita income. Air traffic growth is also being driven by the proliferation of low cost carriers, which have stimulated demand through lower prices. Mature markets, such as North America and Western Europe, are likely to grow more slowly in tandem with their economies. Airlines operating in areas with political instability or weakening economies are under pressure, and their near-term outlook is more uncertain. On balance, we believe air travel will increase over time and, as a result, we expect demand for modern aircraft will continue to remain strong over the long-term.
Fuel prices and interest rates have had a substantial effect on our industry. The price of oil dropped by $67 to $36 per barrel in the four years prior to December 2015. This allowed airlines to reduce ticket prices and stimulate aircraft traffic while retaining enough of this benefit to achieve record profit levels. A low interest rate environment and the strong overall performance of the aircraft financing sector attracted significant new capital, increasing competition for new investments. The downward trend in fuel prices and interest rates appears to have ended as fuel prices started rising in 2016. In 2017, the price of fuel has averaged approximately $52 per barrel. Likewise, interest rates have started to rise in the U.S., with Federal Reserve guidance suggesting multiple future rate hikes in the Federal Funds rate in 2018.
Capital availability for aircraft has varied over time, and we consider this variability to be a basic characteristic of our business. If pursued properly, this represents an important source of opportunity. Strong U.S. debt capital market conditions benefit borrowers by permitting access to financing at historic lows while export credit agency (“ECA”) availability has 
1

been curtailed, both in the U.S. and in Europe, due to political issues. Commercial bank debt continues to play a critical role for aircraft finance, although we believe regulatory pressures may limit its role over time.
While financial market conditions remain attractive, geopolitical issues may increase capital costs and limit availability going forward. We believe these market forces should generate attractive additional investment and trading opportunities for which we are well placed to capitalize given our access to different financing sources, our limited capital commitments and our reputation as a reliable trading partner. Over the longer term, our strategy is to achieve an investment grade credit rating, which we believe will reduce our borrowing costs and enable more reliable access to debt capital throughout the business cycle.
We believe our business approach is differentiated from those of other large leasing companies. Our investment strategy is to seek out the best risk-adjusted return opportunities across the commercial jet market, so our acquisition targets and growth rates will vary with market conditions. We prefer to have capital resources available to capture investment opportunities that arise in the context of changing market circumstances. As such, we limit large, long-term capital commitments and are therefore much less reliant on orders for new aircraft from aircraft manufacturers as a source of new investments.
Competitive Strengths
We believe that the following competitive strengths will allow us to capitalize on future growth opportunities in the global aviation industry:

• | Diversified portfolio of modern aircraft. We have a portfolio of modern aircraft that is diversified with respect to lessees, geographic markets, lease maturities and aircraft types. As of December 31, 2017, our aircraft portfolio consisted of 236 aircraft, comprising a variety of aircraft types leased to 81 lessees located in 43 countries and lease expirations for our owned aircraft are well dispersed, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 5.0 years. This provides the company with a long-dated base of contracted revenues. We believe our focus on portfolio diversification reduces the risks associated with individual lessee defaults and adverse geopolitical or economic issues, and results in generally predictable cash flows. 


• | Flexible, disciplined acquisition approach and broad investment sourcing network. Since our formation, we have acquired 430 aircraft for approximately $14.0 billion. Our investment strategy is to seek out the best risk-adjusted return opportunities across the commercial jet market, so our acquisition targets vary with market opportunities. We source our acquisitions through well-established relationships with airlines, other aircraft lessors, manufacturers, financial institutions and other aircraft owners. Since our formation in 2004, we built our aircraft portfolio through more than 155 transactions with 88 counterparties. 


• | Significant experience in successfully selling aircraft throughout their life cycle. Since our formation, we sold 206 aircraft for approximately $4.9 billion. These sales produced net gains of $286 million and involved a wide range of aircraft types and buyers. Our team is adept at managing and executing the sale of aircraft. We sold 140 aircraft that were over fourteen years old at the time of sale; many of these being sold on a part-out disposition basis, where the airframe and engines may be sold to various buyers. We believe our competence in selling older aircraft is an essential portfolio management skill and one of the capabilities that sets us apart from many of our larger competitors. 


• | Strong capital raising track record and access to a wide range of financing sources. Aircastle is a publicly listed company, and our shares have traded on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) since 2006. Since our inception in late 2004, we raised approximately $1.7 billion in equity capital from private and public investors. Our largest shareholder is Marubeni Corporation (“Marubeni”), with whom we maintain a strong, strategic relationship. We also obtained $13.4 billion in debt capital from a variety of sources including the unsecured bond market, commercial banks, export credit agency-backed debt, and the aircraft securitization market. The diversity and global nature of our financing sources demonstrates our ability to adapt to changing market conditions and seize new opportunities. 


• | Our capital structure is long-dated and provides investment flexibility. Our business is currently financed under debt financings with a weighted-average debt maturity of 3.5 years. We also have $635 million available from unsecured revolving credit facilities that expire in 2019 and 2020, thereby limiting our near-term financial markets exposure. Given our relatively limited future capital commitments, we have the resources to take advantage of future investment opportunities. Our access to the unsecured bond market and our unsecured revolving lines of credit, due to our large unencumbered asset base, allow us to pursue a flexible and opportunistic investment 

2

strategy.

• | Experienced management team with significant expertise. Each member of our management team has more than twenty years of industry experience and we have expertise in the acquisition, leasing, financing, technical management, restructuring/repossession and/or sale of aviation assets. This experience spans several industry cycles and a wide range of business conditions and is global in nature. We believe our management team is highly qualified to manage and grow our aircraft portfolio and to address our long-term capital needs. 


• | Global and scalable business platform. We operate through offices in the United States, Ireland and Singapore, using a modern asset management system designed specifically for aircraft operating lessors and capable of handling a significantly larger aircraft portfolio. We believe that our current facilities, systems and personnel are capable of supporting an increase in our revenue base and asset base without a proportional increase in overhead costs. 

Business Strategy
Aircraft owners have benefited from the low interest rate environment in recent years. Particularly strong conditions in the debt capital markets have provided select borrowers, including Aircastle, access to attractively priced, flexible financing. This provides us a competitive advantage over many airlines and lessors that lack similar access. Geopolitical and macroeconomic events may increase the cost of capital and limit its availability in the future, which may provide more attractive investment opportunities for Aircastle.
We plan to grow our business and profits over the long-term while maintaining a countercyclical orientation, a bias towards limiting long-dated capital commitments and maintaining a conservative and flexible capital structure. Our business strategy entails the following elements:

• | Pursuing a disciplined and differentiated investment strategy. In our view, aircraft values change in different ways over time. We carefully evaluate investments across different aircraft models, ages, lessees and acquisition sources and re-evaluate these choices as market conditions and relative investment values change. We believe the financing flexibility offered through unsecured debt and our team’s experience with a wide range of asset types provides us with a competitive advantage. We view orders from equipment manufacturers to be part of our investment opportunity set, but choose to keep our long term capital commitments limited. 


• | Originating investments from many different sources across the globe. Our strategy is to seek out worthwhile investments by leveraging our team’s wide range of contacts. We utilize a multi-channel approach to sourcing acquisitions and have purchased aircraft from a large number of airlines, lessors, original equipment manufacturers, lenders and other aircraft owners. Since our formation in 2004, we have acquired aircraft from 88 different sellers. 


• | Selling assets when attractive opportunities arise. We sell assets with the aim of realizing profits and reinvesting proceeds when a sale generates the greatest expected cash flow or when more accretive investments are available. We also use asset sales for portfolio management purposes, such as reducing lessee specific concentrations and lowering residual value exposures to certain aircraft types. 


• | Maintaining efficient access to capital from a wide set of sources while targeting an investment grade credit rating. We believe the aircraft investment market is influenced by the business cycle. Our strategy is to increase our purchase activity when prices are low and to emphasize asset sales when competition for assets is high. To implement this approach, we believe it is important to maintain access to a wide variety of financing sources. Our objective is to improve our corporate credit ratings to an investment grade level by maintaining strong portfolio and capital structure metrics while achieving a critical size through accretive growth. We believe improving our credit rating will not only reduce our borrowing costs, but also facilitate more reliable access to both secured and unsecured debt capital throughout the business cycle. 


• | Leveraging our strategic relationships. We intend to capture the benefits provided through the extensive global contacts and relationships maintained by Marubeni, which is our biggest shareholder and one of the largest Japanese trading companies. Marubeni has enabled greater access to Japanese-based financing and helped source and develop our joint venture with the leasing arm of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Limited (“IBJL”). We also have a joint venture (“Lancaster”) with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (“Teachers'”), currently our second largest shareholder. 


• | Capturing the value of our efficient operating platform and strong operating track record. We believe our team’s capabilities in the global aircraft leasing market places us in a favorable position to source and manage 

3

new income-generating activities. We intend to continue to focus our efforts in areas where we believe we have competitive advantages, including new direct investments as well as ventures with strategic business partners.

• | Intending to pay quarterly dividends to our shareholders based on the Company’s sustainable earnings levels. Aircastle has paid dividends each quarter since our initial public offering in 2006. On October 31, 2017, our Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.28 per common share, or an aggregate of $22.0 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, which was paid on December 15, 2017 to holders of record on November 30, 2017. These dividend amounts may not be indicative of any future dividends. Our ability to pay quarterly dividends will depend upon many factors, including those as described in Item 1A. “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.

We believe our team’s capabilities in the global aircraft leasing market place us in a favorable position to explore new income-generating activities as capital becomes available for such activities. We intend to continue to focus our efforts on investment opportunities in areas where we believe we have competitive advantages and on transactions that offer attractive risk/return profiles after taking into consideration available financing options. In any case, there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital on a cost-effective basis and a failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Acquisitions and Sales
We originate acquisitions and sales through well-established relationships with airlines, other aircraft lessors, financial institutions and brokers, as well as other sources. We believe that sourcing such transactions globally through multiple channels provides for a broad and relatively consistent set of opportunities.
Our objective is to develop and maintain a diverse operating lease portfolio. We review our operating lease portfolio to sell aircraft opportunistically, to manage our portfolio diversification and to exit from aircraft investments when we believe selling will achieve better expected risk-adjusted cash flows than reinvesting in and re-leasing the aircraft. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Overview — Acquisitions and Sales.”
We have an experienced acquisition and sales team based in Stamford, Connecticut; Dublin, Ireland and Singapore that maintains strong relationships with a wide variety of market participants throughout the world. We believe that our seasoned personnel and extensive industry contacts facilitate our access to acquisition and sales opportunities and that our strong operating track record facilitates our access to debt and equity capital markets.
Potential investments and sales are evaluated by teams comprised of marketing, technical, risk management, finance and legal professionals. These teams consider a variety of aspects before we commit to purchase or sell an aircraft, including price, specification/configuration, age, condition and maintenance history, operating efficiency, lease terms, financial condition and liquidity of the lessee, jurisdiction, industry trends and future redeployment potential and values. We believe that utilizing a cross-functional team of experts to consider investment parameters helps us assess more completely the 
4

overall risk and return profile of potential acquisitions and helps us move forward expeditiously on letters of intent and acquisition documentation.
Finance
We believe that cash on hand, payments received from lessees and other funds generated from operations, unsecured borrowings, borrowings from our revolving credit facilities, secured borrowings for aircraft, and other borrowings and proceeds from future aircraft sales will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity and capital resource needs over the next twelve months. We may repay all or a portion of such borrowings from time to time with the net proceeds from subsequent long-term debt financings, additional equity offerings or cash generated from operations and asset sales. Therefore, our ability to execute our business strategy, particularly the acquisition of additional commercial jet aircraft or other aviation assets, depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain additional debt and equity capital on terms we deem attractive.
See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources — Secured Debt Financings” and “ — Unsecured Debt Financings” under Item 7.
Segments
The Company manages, analyzes and reports on its business and results of operations on the basis of one operating segment: leasing, financing, selling and managing commercial flight equipment. Our chief executive officer is the chief operating decision maker.
Aircraft Leases
Nearly all of our aircraft are contracted on operating leases. Under an operating lease, we retain the benefit, and bear the risk, of re-leasing and of the residual value of the aircraft at the end of the lease. Operating leasing can be an attractive alternative to ownership for an airline because leasing increases an airline's fleet flexibility, requires lower capital commitments, and significantly reduces aircraft residual value risks for the airline. Under an operating lease, the lessee agrees to lease an aircraft for a fixed term, although certain of our operating leases allow the lessee the option to extend the lease for an additional term or, in rare cases, terminate the lease prior to its expiration. As a percentage of lease rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, our four largest customers, Lion Air, Avianca Brazil, LATAM Airlines Group and South African Airways, accounted for 7%, 7%, 6% and 5%, respectively.
The scheduled maturities of our aircraft leases by aircraft type grouping currently are as follows, taking into account lease placement and renewal commitments as of February 8, 2018:

 | 2018 | 2019 | | 2020 | 2021 | 2022 | | 2023 | 2024 | 2025 | | 2026 | 2027 | 2028 | | 2029 | Sale Agreement | Total

2018 Lease Expirations and Lease Placements
We began 2018 with eight aircraft having scheduled lease expirations in 2018 and one off-lease aircraft. As of February 8, 2018, we have agreements to lease four and to sell one of these aircraft. The remaining four aircraft, which account for 1.3% of our net book value at December 31, 2017, represent our best estimate for the aircraft which we will need to place on lease or sell this year.
5

2019-2022 Lease Expirations and Lease Placements
Taking into account lease and sale commitments, we currently have the following number of aircraft with lease expirations scheduled in the period 2019-2022, representing the percentage of our net book value at December 31, 2017, specified below:

• | 2019: 22 aircraft, representing 8%;


• | 2020: 28 aircraft, representing 9%;


• | 2021: 35 aircraft, representing 13%; and


• | 2022: 27 aircraft, representing 10%.

Lease Payments and Security. Each of our leases requires the lessee to pay periodic rentals during the lease term. As of December 31, 2017, rentals on more than 93% of our leases then in effect, as a percentage of net book value, are fixed and do not vary according to changes in interest rates. For the remaining leases, rentals are payable on a floating interest-rate basis. Virtually all lease rentals are payable monthly in advance, and all lease rentals are payable in U.S. dollars.
Under our leases, the lessee must pay operating expenses accrued or payable during the term of the lease, which normally include maintenance, overhaul, fuel, crew, landing, airport and navigation charges, certain taxes, licenses, consents and approvals, aircraft registration and insurance premiums. Typically, the lessee is required to make payments for heavy maintenance, overhaul or replacement of certain high-value components of the aircraft. These maintenance payments are based on hours or cycles of utilization or on calendar time, depending upon the component, and are required to be made monthly in arrears or at the end of the lease term. Our determination of whether to permit a lessee to make a single maintenance payment at the end of the lease term, or requiring such payments to be made monthly, depends on a variety of factors, including the creditworthiness of the lessee, the amount of security deposit which may be provided by the lessee and market conditions at the time. If a lessee is making monthly maintenance payments, we would typically be obligated to use the funds paid by the lessee during the lease term to reimburse the lessee for costs they incur for heavy maintenance, overhaul or replacement of certain high-value components, usually following completion of the relevant work. If a lease requires an end of lease term maintenance payment, typically the lessee would be required to pay us for its utilization of the aircraft during the lease. In some cases, however, we may owe a net payment to the lessee in the event heavy maintenance is performed and the aircraft is returned to us in better condition than at lease inception.
Many of our leases also contain provisions requiring us to pay a portion of the cost of modifications to the aircraft performed by the lessee at its expense, if such modifications are mandated by recognized airworthiness authorities. Typically, these provisions would set a threshold, below which the lessee would not have a right to seek reimbursement and above which we may be required to pay a portion of the cost incurred by the lessee. The lessees are obliged to remove liens on the aircraft other than liens permitted under the leases.
Our leases generally provide that the lessees’ payment obligations are absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and require lessees to make payments without withholding payment on account of any amounts the lessor may owe the lessee or any claims the lessee may have against the lessor for any reason, except that under certain of the leases a breach of quiet enjoyment by the lessor may permit a lessee to withhold payment. The leases also generally include an obligation of the lessee to gross up payments under the lease where lease payments are subject to withholding and other taxes, although there may be some limitations to the gross up obligation, including provisions which do not require a lessee to gross up payments if the withholdings arise out of our ownership or tax structure. In addition, changes in law may result in the imposition of withholding and other taxes and charges that are not reimbursable by the lessee under the lease or that cannot be so reimbursed under applicable law. Lessees may fail to reimburse us even when obligated under the lease to do so. Our leases also generally require the lessee to indemnify the lessor for tax liabilities relating to the leases and the aircraft, including in most cases, value added tax and stamp duties, but excluding income tax or its equivalent imposed on the lessor.
Portfolio Risk Management
Our objective is to build and maintain a lease portfolio which is balanced and diversified and delivers returns commensurate with risk. We have portfolio concentration objectives to assist in portfolio risk management and highlight areas where action to mitigate risk may be appropriate, and take into account the following:

• | individual lessee exposures;


• | geographic concentrations;

6


• | aircraft type concentrations;


• | portfolio credit quality distribution; and


• | lease maturity distribution.

We have a risk management team which undertakes detailed due diligence on lessees when aircraft are being acquired with a lease already in place and for placement of aircraft with new lessees following lease expiration or termination.
Lease Management and Remarketing
Our aircraft re-leasing strategy is to develop opportunities proactively, well in advance of scheduled lease expiration, to enable consideration of a broad set of alternatives, including deployment, sale or part-out, and to allow for reconfiguration or maintenance lead times where needed. We also take a proactive approach to monitoring the credit quality of our customers, and may seek early return and redeployment of aircraft if we feel that a lessee is unlikely to perform its obligations under a lease. We have invested significant resources in developing and implementing what we consider to be state-of-the-art lease management information systems and processes to enable efficient management of aircraft in our portfolio.
Other Aviation Assets and Alternative New Business Approaches
We believe investment opportunities may arise in related areas such as financing secured by commercial jet aircraft as well as jet engine and spare parts leasing, trading and financing. In the future, we may make opportunistic investments in these or other sectors or in other aviation-related assets, and we intend to continue to explore other income-generating activities and investments.
We source and service investments for Lancaster and IBJ Air and provide marketing, asset management and administrative services to them. We are paid market based fees for these services, which are recorded in Other revenue in our Consolidated Statements of Income.
We believe we have a world class servicing platform and may also pursue opportunities to capitalize on these capabilities such as providing aircraft management services for third party aircraft owners.
Competition
The aircraft leasing and trading industry is highly competitive with a significant number of active participants. We face competition for the acquisition of aircraft from airlines and other aircraft owners, for the placement of aircraft on lease with airlines and for buyers of aircraft assets which we may wish to divest.
Competition for aircraft acquisitions comes from many sources, ranging from large established aircraft leasing companies to smaller players and new entrants. Competition has increased across most asset types and has drawn many new investors to our business.
Larger lessors are generally more focused on acquiring new aircraft via purchase and lease-back transactions with airlines and through direct orders with the original equipment manufacturers. These larger lessors include GE Capital Aviation Services, AerCap Holdings, Air Lease Corporation, Aviation Capital Group, SMBC Aviation Capital, BOC Aviation and Avolon Holdings/Bohai Leasing. In addition, several major Asian financial institutions' leasing subsidiaries are aggressively pursuing business, including Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (“ICBC”) and China Development Bank (“CDB”). In August 2017, Dubai Aerospace Enterprise completed its acquisition of AWAS and in December 2017, Tokyo Century Corporation, part of the Mizuho Group, acquired a 20% interest in Aviation Capital Group.
Competition for mid-aged and older aircraft typically comes from other competitors that, in many cases, rely on private equity or hedge fund capital sources. Such competitors include Apollo Aviation Group, Deucalion, Castlelake, Alterna Capital Partners and other players funded by alternative investment funds and companies. These companies are typically fund-based, rather than having permanent capital structures, and have benefited from the substantially improved availability of debt financing for mid-aged aircraft.
Competition for leasing or re-leasing of aircraft, as well as aircraft sales, is based principally upon the availability, type and condition of aircraft, user base, lease rates, prices and other lease terms. Aircraft manufacturers, airlines and other operators, distributors, equipment managers, leasing companies, financial institutions and other parties engaged in leasing, managing, marketing or remarketing aircraft compete with us, although their focus may be on different market segments 
7

and aircraft types.
Some of our competitors have, or may obtain, greater financial resources and may have a lower cost of capital. A number also commit to speculative orders of new aircraft to be placed on operating lease upon delivery from the manufacturer, which compete with new and used aircraft offered by other lessors. However, we believe that we are able to compete favorably in aircraft acquisition, leasing and sales activities due to the reputation of our team of experienced professionals, extensive market contacts and expertise in sourcing and acquiring aircraft. We also believe our access to unsecured debt provides us with a competitive advantage in pursuing investments quickly and reliably and in acquiring aircraft in situations where it may be more difficult to finance on a secured, non-recourse basis.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 111 employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that we maintain excellent employee relations. We provide certain employee benefits, including retirement benefits, and health, life, disability and accident insurance plans.
Insurance
We require our lessees to carry airline general third-party legal liability insurance, all-risk aircraft hull insurance (both with respect to the aircraft and with respect to each engine when not installed on our aircraft) and war-risk hull and legal liability insurance. We are named as an additional insured on liability insurance policies carried by our lessees, and we or one of our lenders would typically be designated as a loss payee in the event of a total loss of the aircraft. We maintain contingent hull and liability insurance coverage with respect to our aircraft which is intended to provide coverage for certain risks, including the risk of cancellation of the hull or liability insurance maintained by any of our lessees without notice to us, but which excludes coverage for other risks such as the risk of insolvency of the primary insurer or reinsurer.
We maintain insurance policies to cover non-aviation risks related to physical damage to our equipment and property, as well as with respect to third-party liabilities arising through the course of our normal business operations (other than aircraft operations). We also maintain limited business interruption insurance to cover a portion of the costs we would expect to incur in connection with a disruption to our main facilities, and we maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance providing coverage for liabilities related to the service of our directors, officers and certain employees. Consistent with industry practice, our insurance policies are generally subject to deductibles or self-retention amounts.
We believe the insurance coverage currently carried by our lessees and by Aircastle provides adequate protection against the accident-related and other covered risks involved in the conduct of our business. However, there can be no assurance that we have adequately insured against all risks, that lessees will at all times comply with their obligations to maintain insurance, that our lessees’ insurers and re-insurers will be or will remain solvent and able to satisfy any claims, that any particular claim will ultimately be paid or that we will be able to procure adequate insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates in the future.
Government Regulation
The air transportation industry is highly regulated. In general, we are not directly subject to most air transportation regulations because we do not operate aircraft. In contrast, our lessees are subject to extensive, direct regulation under the laws of the jurisdictions in which they are registered and under which they operate. Such laws govern, among other things, the registration, operation, security, and maintenance of our aircraft, as well as environmental and financial oversight regulation of their operations.
Our customers may also be subject to noise or emissions regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate our aircraft. In July 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) determined that Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions from certain aircraft engines contribute to the pollution that causes climate change and endangers the public's health and the environment. The findings are for carbon dioxide (“CO2”), methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride. At that time, the EPA indicated its intention to promulgate new rules to adopt GHG standards promulgated by the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”). In October 2016, ICAO adopted a global market-based measure to control CO2 emissions from international aviation. The pilot phase of this measure will begin in 2021, and the mandatory phase begins in 2027. In June 2017, the United States indicated that it is reviewing whether it will remain fully committed to the ICAO rules. No firm date for conclusion of this review has been announced. In addition, European countries generally have strict environmental regulations, and, in particular, the European Union (“E.U.”)

has included flights originating or landing in the E.U. in the European Emissions Trading Scheme (“ETS”). The United States, China and other countries continue to oppose the inclusion of aviation emissions in ETS. Other environmental regulations our customers may be subject to include those relating to discharges to surface and subsurface waters, management of hazardous substances, oils, and waste materials, and other regulations affecting their aircraft operations.
