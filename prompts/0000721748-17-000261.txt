Item 1. Business.
 
With respect to this discussion, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “Ironclad” and the “Company” refer to Ironclad Performance Wear Corporation, a Nevada corporation and its wholly-owned subsidiary Ironclad Performance Wear Corporation, a California corporation, or “Ironclad California.”
 
General
 
Founded in 1998, we design and manufacture branded performance work wear for a variety of construction, do-it-yourself, industrial, sporting goods and general services markets. Since inception, we have leveraged our proprietary technologies to design task-specific technical gloves and performance apparel designed to improve the wearer’s ability to safely, efficiently and comfortably perform specific job functions. Our goal is to establish and maintain a reputation in the construction, do-it-yourself, industrial, sporting goods and general services markets as a leader in performance gloves.
 
We manufacture our performance gloves using functional materials, including DuPont™ Kevlar®, Nomex® and Teflon®, Clarino® Synthetic Leather, CT-5® Cut Resistant Fabric and Duraclad®. We incorporate these materials in the manufacturing process to create products that meet the functional and protective requirements of our consumers. Since inception, we have employed an in-house research and development department responsible for identifying and creating new products and applications, and improving and enhancing existing products.

We currently sell our products in all 50 states and internationally through an estimated 10,000 retail outlets. Our gloves are priced at retail between $12 and $89 per unit.
 
Glove Products
 
Currently, our primary products are our task-specific technical gloves. Glove products are specially designed for individual user groups. Currently, we produce and sell over 100 distinct glove types in a variety of sizes and colors which cater to the specific demands and requirements of industrial, construction, do-it-yourself, and sporting goods consumers, including carpenters, machinists, package handlers, plumbers, welders, roofers, oil and gas workers, mechanics, hunters, gardeners and do-it-yourself users. Gloves are available in multiple levels of protection and abrasion that allow the wearer to choose a product based on the task demands, weather and ease of motion. Glove products are currently manufactured by multiple suppliers operating in China, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia. The manufacturing capabilities necessary for the manufacturing of our gloves is not particularly specialized and we believe that we would be able to replace our current manufacturers without significant disruption in supply, if necessary. Raw material suppliers and substitute materials are readily available and we believe that our manufacturers would be able to replace their current raw material suppliers without significant disruption in supply.
Competition
 
Ironclad competes in the following principal markets: industrial, construction and sport.
 
Ironclad faces competition from other specialty gloves and apparel companies, such as Custom Leathercraft Manufacturing Company, Ergodyne, Hex Armour, Mechanix Wear and Ringer’s. Compared generally, we believe our material selection and construction provides for superior protection, durability, quality and repeat customers affording a substantial, sustainable advantage in the category.
Mainstream Product Channels
 
To date, we have established our reputation, customer loyalty and brand by selling our products through hardware stores (including do-it-yourself (DIY) chains), lumber yards, big box home centers, industrial distributors and automotive and sporting goods retailers. We intend to continue to expand into additional large retailers and distributors in 2017.
International Expansion
 
We began distributing products internationally in 2005 in Australia and Japan. In 2006, we entered the Canadian market through a distributor. We expanded into the United Kingdom in 2007 and into Spain and the Netherlands in 2008. In 2010 we expanded into Sweden through a direct customer. Several of our domestic distributors market our gloves into other international markets through their own networks. In 2013 we established a third party Free Trade Zone (“FTZ”) warehouse in Singapore in order to better service our international customers. We plan to expand further into Europe and additional international markets in the future.
 
Private-Label and Co-Branded Products and Relationships
 
We have selectively teamed up with several existing brands in our marketplace to produce private-label gloves (co-branded with a “Built Tough by Ironclad” tag). In addition, we have also developed co-branded gloves with qualified partners to penetrate alternate marketplaces, such as the oil & gas industry (i.e. the KONG™ glove). We have also licensed brand names whereby we have the right to use their logo or patterns on gloves we produce for sale to our customers.
 
Ironclad Branding
 
We place an emphasis on the establishment and maintenance of our brand equity. Since the inception of our business, our products have carried the “Ironclad” brand. In addition, we have built a significant market presence for our other trademarked brand “Kong”. We believe that our success in building a dedicated following of users with substantial product penetration across a large number of retailers and storefronts was instrumental in allowing us to gain entry into larger retailers, and providing the foundation to expand internationally and into broader industrial distributors.

We have been expanding our efforts on Web sales and marketing through a redesigned Ironclad Website and a dedicated KONG™ website and will continue to focus on e-commerce (i.e. offering our complete line of gloves, in all sizes, directly to the end consumer).
 
Sales and Customer Analysis
 
We are currently distributing our products through an estimated 10,000 outlets that cater to the professional tradesman, do-it-yourself consumer, industrial user and sporting goods consumer, including “Big Box” home centers, hardware co-ops, lumber yards, industrial distributors, national auto retailers and sporting goods retailers. Currently, we estimate that our products are sold in only 25% of the retail and distribution outlets identified by our management as viable Ironclad outlets. We intend to continue to emphasize and expand our relationships with these retailers and distributors.
 
Sales through industrial distributors accounted for approximately 69% and 66% of our sales revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively. One distributor, Customer “A”, accounted for approximately 4% of our sales in 2016 and approximately 20% of our sales in 2015. Another distributor, Customer “B”, accounted for approximately 15% of our sales in 2016 and approximately 12% of our sales in 2015. Another distributor, Customer “C”, accounted for approximately 34% of our sales in 2016 and approximately 6% of our sales in 2015.
 
Selected Analysis of “Big Box” and International Retailers
 
We plan to continue our expansion by increasing selling efforts through “Big Box” home centers, large industrial distributors and international channels, which we believe creates significant opportunities for strengthening our brand and expanding our product penetration in the various markets.
Geographic Information
 
Domestic sales accounted for 79% of our revenue in 2016 and 74% in 2015. International sales through our independent distributors in Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Netherlands, Sweden and other countries, accounted for our remaining revenue in each year. All of our fixed assets are located in the United States, principally in Texas at our headquarters. Our products are currently manufactured in China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam and Cambodia. Most of our inventory is held in our main, third party warehouse in California, however, we do maintain a small, varying amount in our FTZ warehouse in Singapore.

We currently have thirteen U.S. patents, eleven international patent and five U.S. and multiple international patents pending, which are intended to protect the design and technical innovations found in our performance work gloves. Following are descriptions of the patents or patents pending.
