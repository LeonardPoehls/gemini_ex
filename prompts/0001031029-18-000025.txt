ITEM 1. BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW

STARTEK is a customer engagement business process outsourcing (BPO) services provider, delivering customer care solutions in a different and more meaningful way. We use “engagement” design principles vs. traditional contact center methods, resulting in added value services that create deeper customer relationships through better customer insights and interactions for our clients. Our unique approach to Omni Channel design and service, and training innovation and analytics, allows STARTEK to deliver full life-cycle care solutions through our engagement centers around the world. Our employees, whom we call Brand Warriors, are at the forefront of our customer engagement services and represent our greatest asset. For over 30 years, STARTEK Brand Warriors have been committed to enhancing the customer experience, providing higher value and making a positive impact for our clients’ business results. 
Our vision is to be the most trusted global service provider to customer-centric companies who are looking for more effective ways to engage their customers, on their terms and preferred channels with solutions that are not always available via traditional “contact center” companies. 
The STARTEK Advantage System, the sum total of our customer engagement culture, customized solutions, and processes, allows us to always remain focused on enhancing our clients’ customer experience, increasing customer lifetime value and reducing total cost of ownership. STARTEK has proven results for the multiple services we provide, including sales, order management and provisioning, customer care, technical support, receivables management, and retention programs.  We service client programs using a variety of multi-channel customer interaction capabilities, including voice, chat, email, social media, interactive voice response, and back-office support.  STARTEK has engagement centers in the United States, Canada, Honduras, Jamaica, and the Philippines.
We operate our business within three reportable segments, based on the geographic regions in which our services are rendered: Domestic, Nearshore, and Offshore.  As of December 31, 2017, our Domestic segment included the operations of thirteen facilities in the United States and one facility in Canada; our Offshore segment included the operations of four facilities in the Philippines; and our Nearshore segment included the operations of two facilities in Honduras and one facility in Jamaica.

Our Solutions Team engages with clients to understand their specific goals and anticipate the needs of their customers.  By leveraging the STARTEK Advantage System, the Team customizes solutions to meet clients' goals.

CUSTOMER TRENDS

Our clients are increasingly focused on improving customer engagement and reducing total overall cost of ownership.  STARTEK delivers a high level of customer satisfaction, as evidenced by our clients’ customer service awards and our ranking relative to other outsourced partners.  Our clients also value a combination of onshore, nearshore, and offshore delivery platforms to optimize customer support costs.
Clients are also trying to decrease the number of contacts it takes for their customers to enjoy their products or services as well as increasing the channel options that are available.  Process improvement and a push for more omni channel solutions has driven further efficiencies for resolution of those contact issues. We are committed to delivering solutions through which we partner with our clients to achieve and deliver these efficiency gains.  We believe we are positioned to benefit from this trend as we have developed a comprehensive suite of services and multi-channel solutions that will drive continuous improvement and customer experience on front and back-office transactions.
KEY COMPETITIVE DIFFERENTIATORS

STARTEK Advantage System

Our culture, “Customer Engagement” Operating Platform and custom solutions for every client program combined with our continuous improvement process is the sum total of our STARTEK Advantage System.  The STARTEK Advantage System empowers and enables our leaders to constantly look for new ways to deliver consistent execution of operational results while meeting and/or exceeding our clients’ current and future critical business requirements.

STARTEK’s culture is built on trust and servant leadership. Servant leadership puts the employees first and leads with a focus on solving problems and promoting personal development.   We are a gathering of like-minded professionals determined to make a positive impact for our employees, our clients and our stakeholders.

It includes execution and innovation in every area of the operation including on-boarding and enabling employees, executing against goals, evaluating and improving performance, and enhancing the total experience of our clients’ customers.
STARTEK deploys solutions that leverage what we know, what we have learned from experience across a breadth of clients and industries, and what we hear and understand from the market and most importantly our clients.  We will deliver the right people with the right leadership enabled by the right technology and empowered by the right tools to make a meaningful impact on each and every one of our clients’ businesses. Our customer engagement philosophy offers a solution for improving customer interactions and, subsequently, customer satisfaction. We have developed a unique methodology for training and measuring how we can better engage with customers to improve the customer experience. 
We offer a variety of customer engagement management solutions that provide front to back-office capabilities utilizing the right delivery platform including onshore, nearshore, and offshore alternatives. We also offer multi-channel customer interactions, including voice, chat, email and social media.

Consistent Performance

Performance is core to the STARTEK Operating Platform.  Our clients expect consistent performance against the fundamentals of the business no matter the location or method of the service delivery.  The operating platform sets the stage for us to drive continuous improvement and focus on the added-value aspects of our clients’ businesses.
Cost Competitive

We are confident in our ability to be cost competitive with solutions that meet our clients’ needs. Through clearly understanding their needs and striving to reach goal congruency, we can assure that our collective financial goals are aligned in the most efficient way.
STRATEGY

STARTEK views successful outsourcing partnerships as those that strike a balance by delivering a better customer experience to clients through an efficient, effective and ever improving support model while generating a fair return for our stakeholders.  The STARTEK Advantage System and Brand Warrior mindset is behind everything we do. Our managers and customer engagement specialists all have a STARTEK Brand Warrior mindset, because they are on the front lines for our clients’ brands and have the opportunity to create and improve loyalty for our clients’ products and services each and every day. Our mission is to return value to our stakeholders by promoting and protecting our clients' brands by enabling and empowering us, as Brand Warriors, through servant leadership. Our clients’ business objectives become our business objectives, as we seek to become their trusted partner.  Every day, we strive to better understand our clients’ markets and competitive challenges so that we can play a more effective role as trusted partner and success driver in their businesses.  We seek to build customer loyalty and reduce clients' costs through specific actionable continuous improvement efforts in all areas.  We believe that empowering and enabling our engagement center management and front line employees is the most important way we can deliver the best possible consistent customer experience.  STARTEK’s leadership team is committed to driving year-over-year continuous improvement and constantly striving for the success of our clients’ businesses.
We seek to become the trusted partner to our clients and provide meaningful customer engagement BPO services. Our approach is to develop relationships with our clients that are truly collaborative in nature where we are focused, flexible and proactive to their business needs.  The end result is the delivery of the highest quality customer experience to our clients’ customers. To achieve sustainable, predictable, profitable growth, our strategy is to:
•grow our existing client base by deepening and broadening our relationships;
•diversify our client base by adding new clients and verticals;
•improve our market position by becoming the leader in customer engagement services;
•improve profitability through operational improvements, increased utilization and higher margin accounts;
•expand our global delivery platform to meet our clients' needs; and
•broaden our service offerings through more innovative, technology-enabled and added-value solutions.
We have made a number of strategic acquisitions in the past few years that have enabled us to expand the scope of our service offerings while also bringing expertise to a wider range of verticals. This has driven improvement in revenue diversity, and provided the potential for increased revenue from new high-growth verticals such as financial services, retail and healthcare. 
During 2015, STARTEK acquired Accent Marketing Services, L.L.C. ("ACCENT"), a business process outsourcing company with a business model that focuses on data, analytics, and interaction with customers and their constituents to provide excellent service. ACCENT's business model and attention to customer engagement provides an excellent complement to STARTEK's Ideal Dialogue practice. Additionally, the acquisition of ACCENT expands our footprint into Jamaica and enhances our flexibility in meeting customer demands, including more use of internet-based customer service delivery.
HISTORY OF THE BUSINESS

STARTEK was founded in 1987.  At that time, our business was centered on supply chain management services, which included packaging, fulfillment, marketing support and logistics services.  After our initial public offering on June 19, 1997, we continued to focus on operating customer care contact centers and grew to include our current suite of offerings as described in the “Business Overview” section of this Form 10-K.

SEASONALITY
Our business can be seasonal, dependent on our clients' marketing programs and product launches, which are often geared toward the end of summer and the winter holiday buying season. Healthcare and Educational clients also have some seasonal demands which are somewhat counter to retail.
INDUSTRY

The worldwide outsourced customer care services industry is now projected to be over $70 billion and growing at over 5% per year.  Over the past several years, the number of companies handling their own customer care requirements has continued to decrease.  Clients are recognizing the value and expertise that can be found by outsourcing activities, such as those we provide.  Outsourcing allows them to focus on core competencies, leverage economies of scale and control variable costs of their business while accessing new technology and expert personnel.  We believe outsourced service providers, including ourselves, will continue to benefit from these outsourcing trends.  The industry continues to be very fragmented with the five largest competitors combined capturing less than 20% of the global market.  
COMPETITION

We compete with a number of companies that provide similar services on an outsourced basis, including business process outsourcing companies such as Teleperformance; Convergys Corporation; Transcom; Sitel Corporation; Sykes Enterprises, Incorporated; TeleTech Holdings, Inc. and Alorica.  Many of these competitors are significantly larger than us in revenue, income, number of contact centers and customer service agents, number of product offerings and market capitalization.  We believe that while smaller than many of our competitors, we are able to compete because of our focus and scale as well as our ability to add value to our clients' business.  We believe our success is contingent more on our targeted service offering and performance delivery to our clients than our overall size.  Several of our competitors merged during recent years, which may affect our competitive position.  There are also many companies actively pursuing sale, indicating further consolidation in the industry is likely.  There are integration challenges involved in consolidations, which may provide us with an opportunity to deliver superior customer service to existing and new clients. We have maintained an opportunistic view of acquisitions, primarily focused on diversification and value in line with our strategic plan. 
Some competitors offer a broader range of services than we do, which may result in clients and potential clients consolidating their use of outsourced services with larger competitors, rather than using our services.  We primarily compete with the aforementioned companies on the basis of price and quality.  As such, our strategy is to execute the STARTEK Advantage System on our clients’ metrics and rank among the top of all of their outsourced vendors, while continuing to be a cost-effective solution and driving year over year improvement.  We view our competitive advantage as being a large enough company to offer the breadth of service offerings that are often requested by clients while being agile enough to respond quickly to their needs.
CLIENTS
We provide service to clients from locations in the United States, Canada, Honduras, Jamaica, and the Philippines. Approximately 51% of our revenue is derived from clients within the telecommunications industry and 22% from clients within the cable and media industry. These percentages have decreased slightly from the previous year as we continue to focus on diversifying the industries that we serve by targeting sales efforts to verticals such as technology, retail or ecommerce, financial services, education, and healthcare.
Our three largest customers, T-Mobile USA, Inc. (“T-Mobile”), Sprint / United Management Co. ("Sprint"), and AT&T Inc. (“AT&T”), account for a significant percentage of our revenue. While we believe that we have good relationships with these clients, a loss of a large program from one of these clients, a significant reduction in the amount of business we receive from a principal client, renegotiation of pricing on several programs simultaneously for one of these clients, the delay or termination of a principal client's product launch or service offering, or the complete loss of one or more of these principal clients would adversely affect our business and our results of operations (See Item 1A. "Risk Factors"). 
We enter into master service agreements (MSAs) that cover all of our work for each client.  These MSAs are typically multi-year contracts that include auto-renewal provisions. They typically do not include contractual minimum volumes and are generally terminable by the customer without penalty upon prior written notice.

GOVERNMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION

We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws in the states and territories in which we operate, including tax, employment, environmental and other laws that govern the way we conduct our business.  There are risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including significant changes in domestic government programs, policies, regulatory requirements, and taxation with respect to foreign operations; unexpected changes in foreign government programs, policies, regulatory requirements and labor laws; and difficulties in staffing and effectively managing foreign operations.
EMPLOYEES AND TRAINING
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 13,300 employees. Approximately 4,700 were employed in the United States and approximately 8,600 were employees in foreign countries. None of our employees were members of a labor union or were covered by a collective bargaining agreement during 2017. We believe the overall relations with our workforce are good.
