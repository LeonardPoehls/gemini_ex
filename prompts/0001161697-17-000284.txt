ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Executive Summary of Our Business

Tyme Technologies, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing cancer therapeutics that are intended to be broadly effective across tumor types and have low toxicity profiles.  Unlike targeted therapies that attempt to regulate specific mutations within cancer, our therapeutic approach is designed to take advantage of a cancer cell’s innate metabolic weaknesses to compromise its defenses, leading to cell death through oxidative stress and exposure to the body’s natural immune system. Our lead clinical program, SM-88, is a first-in-class combination therapy in Phase II development for prostate cancer, and we are preparing to initiate an additional Phase II clinical trial for pancreatic cancer.

We believe SM-88 can be broadly effective across multiple cancer types based on results from 106 advanced-stage patients treated with SM-88 through first-in human and compassionate use programs. Our first-in-human study began as a three-month safety study of SM-88, which was approved by an Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), and enrolled 30 end-stage metastatic cancer patients; based on patient response during this three-month period, SM-88 treatment was continued for multiple years under IRB oversight (collectively, “our “First Human Study”). Additionally, as of March 31, 2017, SM-88 had been used with 76 patients as part of a separate compassionate use program under IRB oversight where most of these 76 patients had failed or refused possible available therapies and were treated with SM-88 as a monotherapy (collectively, the “Compassionate Use Patients”).

Through these two programs, SM-88 has shown complete and partial responses for over 13 different cancer types, including some of the most common and difficult-to-treat cancers, such as pancreatic, prostate, breast, lung, glioma, ovarian, Ewing’s sarcoma, sarcoma and colon cancer. Based on our First Human Study, where 30 subjects had failed or refused possible available therapies and were estimated by treating physicians to have three-to-six months to live, median overall survival (“OS”) with SM-88 monotherapy was 25.7 months and median progression-free survival (“PFS”) was 14.7 months.

To date, SM-88 has not been associated with any drug-related serious adverse events (“SAEs”), and SM-88 patients have experienced relatively few grade 1 or 2 adverse events (“AEs”). We believe that SM-88 may be appropriate for a wide range of cancers prior to the end-stage setting, based on preliminary data from our First Human Study and Compassionate Use Patients that indicate SM-88’s broad applicability and relatively low toxicity. The Company has an ongoing Phase II trial in biochemically-recurrent localized prostate cancer to evaluate earlier-stage effectiveness. Preliminary in-progress data from this Phase II trial presented at the June 2017 American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting (“ASCO 2017”) indicated SM-88’s potential effectiveness as prostate cancer maintenance therapy without significant toxicity and without quality-of-life altering characteristics.

We believe, based on SM-88’s mechanism of action (described below) and proof-of-concept study data, that our lead candidate may ultimately improve overall response rates, clinical outcomes and survival rates in cancer patients. Based on its proposed mechanism of action and the factors described below, SM-88 may prove particularly beneficial to cancer patients who have relapsed following traditional cancer therapies or cancer patients and clinicians who seek an effective, low toxicity treatment option between an observation strategy and toxic treatment options.

 Tyme’s Mechanism of Action and Platform Overview

We believe SM-88’s mechanism of action (“MOA”) can be broadly effective across different cancer types because it has a unique composition that is designed to selectively invade a cancer cell, weaken a cancer cell’s defenses, and expose a cancer cell’s microenvironment to oxidative stress and host immune system defenses, regardless of a tumor’s origin. SM-88, including our proprietary tyrosine derivative compound, is designed to be selective to tumors with minimal impact on normal healthy cells. We believe our research, as well as independent studies, suggest that cancer cells have a high affinity for tyrosine, especially in a glucose-deprived or cellular ketosis state, while normal cells have less affinity to tyrosine and do not significantly use tyrosine as a metabolite.

Our product development strategy is based on using “biological circuits” to selectively destroy tumor cells with minimal toxicity. In this regard, the term biological circuit is meant to describe a cascading process of cellular function when a cancer cell is in its natural state. SM-88 is designed to increase the “current” of this circuit and then cause a break at a critical juncture to induce a catastrophic collapse of the cancer cell. We believe this can be a highly effective strategy against cancer since all cancers have an altered glycolytic metabolism, known as the Warburg Effect, involving glucose breakdown. SM-88 is designed as a therapeutic treatment to utilize a cancer cell’s glycolytic process and create a potential universal entry point for producing cancer cell death through oxidative stress and the body’s immune system defenses.

The following diagram describes our proposed MOA for SM-88 – a biological circuit that uses metabolism to break down a tumor’s defense to apoptosis-causing oxidative stress.

The backbone component of SM-88 is a proprietary dysfunctional tyrosine derivative. Tyrosine is a non-essential amino acid that has a high affinity with cancer cells, but has minimal uptake by healthy cells. The tyrosine derivative used in SM-88 is designed to interact with the cancer cell as if it were a functional tyrosine but, after uptake, cause any cellular process using the tyrosine derivative, such as protein synthesis, to fail.

 One of the critical proteins in cancer that uses tyrosine as an important building block is mucin. Mucin acts as a protective layer around the cancer cell that defends the tumor from external elements, such as the host immune system, and also helps maintain a stable balance inside of the cancer cells. Cancers have an internal microenvironment that would be toxic to healthy cells and we believe that mucins help keep the microenvironment in a state of balance. SM-88 is intended to disrupt the cancer cell’s unique microenvironment following uptake of our tyrosine derivative.

We believe that when the cancer cell attempts to use the dysfunctional tyrosine derivative for protein synthesis to create mucin, the process fails and the mucin layer begins to deteriorate. Without a stable protective coating from mucin, tumor cells become exposed to the host immune system as well as internal toxicity. This can result in a heightened state of oxidative stress, when the number of free-radicals, or reactive oxygen species (“ROS”), increases to a dangerous level. ROS can cause catastrophic cancer cell damage, leading to apoptosis, by pulling electrons from otherwise stable molecules, such as DNA or proteins.

We believe the effectiveness of our tyrosine derivative in effecting cancer cell death is substantially enhanced by combining it with small doses of three repurposed agents that may increase the uptake of the tyrosine derivative and enhance oxidative stress against the tumor cells. 

One repurposed agent, sirolimus, is administered with the intent to increase the rate at which a cell exhausts its supply of glucose and, as a result, must use amino acids and lipids for metabolism. We believe that by decreasing glucose supply with sirolimus, cancer cells will more quickly exhaust their glucose supply and begin pulling in preferred amino acids, such as tyrosine. Because it is estimated that cancer cells utilize glucose at less than 1/15th the efficiency of normal cells, cancer cells are expected to deplete their glucose far more rapidly than normal cells, causing a dramatic increase in tyrosine uptake, including SM-88’s tyrosine derivative.

The other two repurposed agents, methoxsalen and phenytoin, are administered to increase the oxidative stress on cancer cells. We believe that phenytoin can stimulate the production of reactive lipid species and increase the overall level of oxidation surrounding a cancer cell. We believe that methoxsalen can promote an electron transfer process and enhance the effect of ROS and the ability to catalyze oxygen into the cancer cell, which produces cell death within the cancer cell microenvironment.

All three of these repurposed agents are administered at doses that are approximately 25% or less than their recommended therapeutic dosing levels. We believe that small doses of these repurposed agents should have too little of an effect to cause disruption of normal cellular function, but in combination should meaningfully increase the effectiveness of SM-88 therapy against cancer.

By using SM-88 to disrupt cancer’s metabolic circuit, our intention is to create a therapy that is:


• | Broadly effective across different cancer types – Since all cancers use the same metabolic process, they also have the same potential entry point for therapy, regardless of origin; 
• | Highly specific to cancer – As supported by recent advances in radiographic imaging that use tyrosine to selectively image cancer cells, cancer has a high affinity for tyrosine while normal cells have minimal uptake; 
• | Relatively non-toxic – Studies in relatively healthy individuals have not shown significant side effects; 
• | An effective treatment for patients who have failed other therapeutic options – Due to its a novel MOA and low toxicity profile, we believe SM-88 can be an effective alternative to existing standard of care treatments that have failed and many previous therapies should not produce enhanced resistance to SM-88;
• | Suitable for monotherapy or combination therapy – Although most of Tyme’s clinical and compassionate use experience has been in monotherapy, SM-88’s differentiated MOA and safety profile could allow it to be effective in combination with other cancer therapeutics; and 
• | Less likely to create cancer resistance – By taking advantage of cancer’s natural state rather than trying to target specific mutations, cancer may have less ability to find alternate pathways to function.

 We intend to develop other products for oncology using our biological circuit approach, both by means of alternate delivery platforms as well as alternate product compositions. SM-88 is intended in general, as an oral therapy that is broadly applicable to cancers; however, alternate routes of delivery may be more appropriate for certain patients or cancers. For example, our First Human Study patients were administered with small SM-88 subcutaneous doses in combination with an oral SM-88 dose. In addition, treating physicians for SM-88 Compassionate Use Patients had discretion over bedside administration of SM-88, and we believe that a significant number of these patients received SM-88 by subcutaneous and/or oral delivery. Given the potential need for alternative administration of patient doses, we have developed an injectable formulation that, for example, may be beneficial for patients with a compromised digestive system and who are not able to absorb the oral formulation. We also have other alternative formulations, such as topical, transdermal and nasal, at various stages of development that we believe could provide an effective alternative therapeutic effect for certain forms of cancer, including, for example, breast cancer and glioblastoma. In addition, we plan to advance novel products under development that are intended to either improve on the effectiveness seen in SM-88 or be used in combination with other cancer therapies.

The SM-88 First Human Study and Compassionate Use Patients Background; Our Phase II Clinical Trial Program Objectives

We have focused our research and development efforts on a proprietary platform technology, for which we retain global IP and commercial rights, for use in creating drugs to treat the unmet medical needs of human oncology patients. This population includes patients with limited life expectancy and scarce therapeutic options, such as those with refractory cancer (i.e., cancer that is unresponsive to treatment with standard therapies), those who are undergoing salvage therapy for metastatic disease or patients who have refused additional toxic therapies. We believe this development strategy directed at this patient population could allow for faster regulatory approval and could require smaller clinical trials, as compared to those indications with more therapeutic options and/or larger patient populations.

Our completed past programs and our on-going clinical initiatives have been focused on use of SM-88 in variable treatment settings, as summarized below and in the following sections:


• | Our First Human Study began as an IRB-approved protocol initially designed as a three-month safety study of SM-88 in 30 end-stage metastatic cancer patients. This study, which commenced without our submission concerning, or receipt of, United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval of an investigational new drug application (“IND”), was continued under IRB supervision over multiple years given the clinical benefit experienced by a large portion of these patients who were treated with SM-88. 
• | In addition to the First Human Study, 76 Compassionate Use Patients who had failed-or-refused possible available treatments were treated with SM-88 through IRB-reviewed compassionate use. Some of these patients had been treated for over four years, demonstrating complete and partial responses across a multitude of cancer types. We intend to publish additional data on Compassionate Use Patients through peer-reviewed publications and medical conferences during the course of 2017 and 2018. 
• | We are currently enrolling an open-label Phase II trial in localized prostate cancer for biomarker-recurrent maintenance therapy. We expect to complete enrollment by year-end 2017 with a seven-month treatment and follow-up period. Preliminary data from this trial was presented at ASCO 2017 and additional data may be presented prior to final completion. 
• | We intend to initiate a Phase II pancreatic cancer trial by the first quarter of calendar 2018. The trial is expected to be focused on refractory subjects who have failed or refused possible available treatment options. Data on 11 refractory pancreatic cancer subjects treated in either our First Human Study or as Compassionate Use Patients were reported at ASCO 2017, showing clinical benefit as follows: complete response (n=1/11), partial response (n=2/11) or stable disease (n=8/11). Some of these patients demonstrated duration of response for over a year. We believe SM-88 could be a viable treatment for this usually terminal disease and it is also our intention to seek breakthrough therapy designation in this treatment population, as appropriate. 
• | We intend to initiate additional trials in other treatment populations as resources are available. SM-88 has shown efficacy in 13 different cancer types, and our current priorities for additional trials include lung, breast, bone and brain cancers.

 Our First Human Study

Our First Human Study, we believe, demonstrated that SM-88 was well-tolerated and showed preliminary activity across a number of different cancer types in terms of tumor regression, biomarker improvement, and overall survival. The 30-subject study was initially designed for a three-month period to determine safety of SM-88 in the end-stage treatment setting. When multiple patients showed “Clinical Benefit” (consisting of complete response, partial response or stable disease), treatment was continued for some patients for multiple years. This study was conducted under IRB supervision without FDA approval of an IND. Summary results of the study are shown below:

Summary of Completed First Human Study
Population | 30 progressive metastatic cancer subjects that had failed or refused available treatments. Physician estimated survival of 3-6 months 
Treatment | Monotherapy with SM-88 after 60-day wash-out of prior therapy 
Results | Overall Survival: Median of 25.7 months Progression Free Survival: Median of 14.7 months - 2.1x longer PFS than penultimate PFS where data was available 90% clinical benefit based on RECIST criteria - Complete response (n=2), partial response (n=6), stable disease (n=19) 
Safety | No drug-related serious AEs and few grade 1 or 2 AEs 


The study commenced in January 2012 as a single-center, monotherapy, open-label, proof-of-concept study conducted under an IRB reviewed protocol. Enrollment was restricted to 30 metastatic cancer patients who had failed or refused possible available treatments with physician-estimation of three-to-six months survival. In addition, patients had to have at least a 60-day washout period from any prior therapy before initiating monotherapy with SM-88. Subjects received one to ten six-week cycles of treatment, each consisting of small-dose subcutaneous plus oral daily administration, five days per week. Metastatic breast cancer was the most common site of origin (n=14), with lung (n=5), pancreatic (n=3) and seven other cancer types also enrolling.

Based on Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors 1.1 (“RECIST”) radiographic criteria assessed by two independent reviewers, median progression free survival was 15 months with 90% of subjects (27/30) showing Clinical Benefit, including complete response (n=2), partial response (n=6) or stable disease (n=19). We believe that stable disease is an important clinical outcome in this patient population setting since all subjects were enrolled with progressive disease and had a short period of estimated survival. Median overall survival was 25.7 months in comparison to physician expectation of three-to-six month survival at the initiation of therapy. 

In evaluating SM-88’s safety, improvements were noted at the end of cycle one for patients: in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (“ECOG PS”) (83.3% of patients) and statistically significant changes in European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life (“EORTC QoL”) scores, including global health status/QoL, physical functioning, role functioning, emotional functioning, cognitive functioning, social functioning, fatigue, pain and insomnia. SM-88 was well tolerated, and drug-related AEs in cycle one were mild to moderate and self-limiting, with no therapy required. Most AEs occurred within the first cycle of treatment, with the exception of hyperpigmentation, which eventually occurred in all subjects.

More complete First Human Study data is included in the “Prior Studies” section below.

Compassionate Use Patients

As of March 31, 2017, SM-88 has been used with 76 patients as part of a compassionate use program under IRB oversight. This treatment regimen was initiated in 2012 using a protocol similar to the First Human Study protocol initiated in January 2012, with the largest difference relating to the initiation of SM-88 to the advanced-stage Compassionate Use Patients without any 60-day

 washout period from prior therapy. Nearly all the Compassionate Use Patients enrolled had metastatic disease, had failed or refused possible available therapies and were treated with SM-88 in monotherapy. We were generally able to receive regularly detailed information on the treatment of Compassionate Use Patients; however, their treatment is not part of a clinical trial under our control and there can be variations in the treatment administration, as the treating physicians deem appropriate.

We have presented limited initial data at ASCO 2017 or previously, and we intend to continue releasing Compassionate Use Patients data in peer-reviewed publications and conferences over the next 18 months.

In early 2016, we performed a retrospective analysis on the first 53 (of the 76) Compassionate Use Patients that had received treatment, which was later updated to 57 patients, including three additional pancreatic patients. These patients had their scans reviewed by two independent radiologists to determine Clinical Benefit, and 79% of these patients were deemed to have experienced Clinical Benefit, including eight complete responses, 19 partial responses and 18 stable disease designations. The safety profile of these subjects was evaluated with no drug-related SAEs reported and few grade one or two AEs attributed to SM-88 treatment.

More complete data is included in the “Prior Studies” section below.

Our Currently Enrolling Phase Ib/II Prostate Clinical Trial Design and Objectives

On June 13, 2016, we announced that we began recruiting for a Phase Ib/II clinical trial, using our proprietary compound, SM-88, to treat prostate cancer. Unlike traditional chemotherapy, SM-88 is designed to target only active cancer calls. The trial is designed, among other things, to confirm SM-88’s earlier reported activity in reducing the prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”) without causing the medical castration-like effects often experienced with a current standard of care treatment, androgen deprivation therapy (“ADT”).

Our Phase Ib/II prostate cancer trial is treating an earlier stage patient population than failed-or-refused patient population targeted in SM-88’s First Human Study and Compassionate Use Patients. All subjects in our Phase Ib/II trial (1) had prostate cancer and achieved remission with previous therapy, (2) had subsequently experienced recurrence at enrollment biochemically with circulating tumor cells (“CTCs”) or PSA, and (3) have not yet progressed to radiographically visible lesions. Subjects enrolling in our trial would be generally otherwise put on ADT therapy, inducing a chemical castration, or other more toxic therapies. By treating this patient population with SM-88 monotherapy, we hope to show:


1. | Ability to prevent disease progression without chemically reducing testosterone 
2. | Ability to maintain quality-of-life 
3. | Reduction or elimination of CTCs, which we believe are a component in developing metastatic cancer
4. | SM-88’s minimal side effect profile in a relatively healthy patient population.

 Initial Phase Ib data showed non-detectable or declining circulating tumor cells (or CTCs) in all evaluable subjects, with no drug-related SAEs. This trial progressed from Phase Ib to Phase II following the initial dose escalation phase. The first subject enrolled received the lowest dose (230mg of tyrosine derivative) and experienced therapeutic benefit with no significant side effects. As a result, the dose was doubled to twice daily dosing with 230 mg of tyrosine derivative in the next three subjects. All three of these subjects also experienced therapeutic benefit with no significant side effects. The twice daily 230 mg dose was then taken into the Phase II trial, where we have initiated enrollment and intend to complete enrollment at 30 subjects.

Endpoints of our Phase II prostate study include:


• | Prevention of radiographically-detectable lesions (i.e. maintained rPFS)
• | Reduction in circulating tumor cells 
• | Safety and patient reported outcomes 
• | PSA-doubling time (PCWG3 definition) 
• | Relevant biomarkers. 


We presented initial data from the Phase Ib/II trial at ASCO 2017. The following table summarizes our preliminary data in patients (n=8) that had been on treatment long enough for evaluation.


Summary of Ongoing Phase Ib/II Trial in Biomarker Recurrent Prostate Cancer
Endpoint | Evaluable subject response
CTC count undetectable or significantly improved | 87.5% 
Radiographic progression free survival (rPFS) | 100% 
Need for subsequent toxic therapy | None 
PSA doubling stable or improved | All subjects 
Patient reported outcomes (PROs) improved or stable | All subjects 


While this represents encouraging initial data, there can be no guarantee that future results in the trial will be similar or that the overall trial will be successful in achieving its stated goals.

Planned Phase II Trial for Pancreatic Cancer

At ASCO 2017, we presented a retrospective review of 11 late-stage pancreatic cancer patients who were treated in our First Human Study or as Compassionate Use Patients, each of whom had failed or refused other available therapies. Clinical Benefit was documented for all subjects. Overall reduction in tumor size was seen in 27.3% (3/11) of patients, including one complete response (“CR”) with progression free survival (or PFS) of at least six months duration, and two partial responses with one known PFS of 15 weeks. 72.7% (8/11) of patients had stable disease ranging from six-61 weeks. Two subjects who were listed as stable disease had an overall survival of 43.2 and 23.3 months, with no further treatment. All 11 subjects had quality-of-life benefits, including 1-3 points improvement in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (“ECOG PS”); 1-5 point mean improvement on EORTC questionnaire (scale 1-7); weight gain (1-5 lbs.); and reduction in pain levels (1-9 points/10 scale) with cessation of all analgesics by the end of cycle 1 (six weeks) in 36% of subjects (4/11). 

Pancreatic cancer is one of the deadliest major cancers, with a one-year survival rate of 20% at diagnosis according to the American Cancer Society. The poor prognosis is partially due to more than 80% of cases being metastatic at the time of diagnosis. In the refractory setting, such as the setting where all 11 of the noted SM-88 patients were treated, survival is often only a few months and clinical response rates are very low. Because of our encouraging initial results described above and the dire state of the disease, we are preparing to initiate a Phase II trial in refractory pancreatic cancer patients by first quarter 2018.

 Other Clinical Plans

We intend to focus expanding clinical activities as a next priority to certain failed-and-refused end-stage cancer patient populations. We believe this strategy combines our objectives to address substantial unmet need with a more clear and rapid regulatory pathway. We believe lung, breast, bone and brain cancers may be appropriate additional indications given the demonstrated effect of SM-88 on these cancer types in our First Human Study and Compassionate Use Patients. We intend to initiate additional Phase II studies in these or other cancers as resources become available. 
Our Strengths

We believe we can become a leader in developing cancer therapies with our platform technology for the following reasons:


• | We are using low-toxicity combination therapies to disrupt cancer’s normal metabolic reaction in order to cause tumor cell death; 
• | Our lead drug candidate, SM-88, is believed to be a first-in-class metabolic-oxidative cancer therapy; 
• | SM-88 has demonstrated its potential as an effective and selective combination drug product treatment, with encouraging antitumor activity that has not, to date, shown significant toxic side effects at current therapeutic dose levels;
• | We have a technology base and patent portfolio supporting SM-88 and have filed patents for additional drug candidates to provide a pipeline of oncology drug development programs based on our technology platform; and 
• | We currently retain all commercial rights for SM-88 and have undertaken an extensive multinational patent effort to protect those rights. 

Our Strategy

Our goal is to develop and commercialize metabolically-targeted cancer therapies aimed at improving and extending lives. Key elements of our strategy to achieve this goal are:

• | Successfully advance SM-88 through clinical development, including registration trials and commercial launch. We intend to pursue a worldwide development and commercialization plan for SM-88. 
• | Continue to invest in our technology platform and IP portfolio to further build our pipeline. We plan to expand our R&D efforts to encompass multiple indications and products within the oncology field. We have undertaken additional early development programs for improved formulations of SM-88 as well as wholly new compounds. 
• | Build a balanced portfolio of proprietary and partnered programs. We plan to independently develop and commercialize multiple drug candidates for human indications within the oncology field. For targets outside our core areas of interest or where a partner can contribute specific expertise, we intend to evaluate potential collaborations with strategic partners and/or potential acquisitions of other companies who can augment our expertise and technology, as well as a means to acquire rights or ownership of additional IP. We also contemplate exploring global development partners and arrangements, where appropriate. 

Clinical Trials

Clinical trials to support New Drug Applications (“NDA”) for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and is tested to assess pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, AEs associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products targeted for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, initial human testing may be conducted in the intended patient population. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, as well as identification of common adverse effects and safety risks.

- 8 -

 If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II, Phase III trials are initiated to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase III clinical trials are intended to establish data sufficient to demonstrate substantial evidence of the efficacy and safety of the product to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. Trials conducted outside of the U.S. under similar, GCP-compliant conditions in accordance with local applicable laws may also be acceptable to the FDA in support of product approval.

Prior Studies

Our First Human Study

We completed in 2014 a 30-patient, single-center, open-label, First Human Study using SM-88 for the treatment of advanced metastatic cancer. The purpose of our proof-of-concept study was to determine the safety, tolerability and efficacy of SM-88 in subjects with advanced metastatic cancer. The goals of the study were to:

• | Assess Progression-Free Survival (or PFS) in patients treated with SM-88; 
• | Assess secondary measures of efficacy including Objective Response Rate (“ORR”), Duration of Response (“DR”) and overall survival (or OS);
• | Evaluate safety and tolerability of SM-88; and 
• | Explore Patient Reported Outcomes, including health-related Quality-of-Life (“QoL”) and disease/treatment-related symptoms. 


Between January and December 2012, 30 subjects with stage IV cancer and distant metastasis, including bone and central nervous system involvement, enrolled and were included in the trial. The patient population was comprised of patients who refused or failed other available anticancer treatments. Of the 30 patients, 16 patients had had prior surgery, 10 had had prior radiation therapy and 20 had had prior chemotherapy, including six patients with three or more prior regimens, four patients with two prior regimens and 10 patients with one prior regimen. Cancer types, subjects and RECIST results are presented below.

Best Overall Response Data from First Human Study

Using best overall response criteria, the following data was derived from the patients who participated in our First Human Study.

 Penultimate PFS Data from First Human Study

Many patients experienced an extended duration of response (or DOR) with median progression free survival (“PFS”) of 14.7 months. In order to provide a comparison to evaluate subject PFS, the following chart shows the subjects’ PFS on the therapy where available (n=23) just prior to initiation of SM-88, which is known as penultimate PFS. Certain subjects in the First Human Study (24/30) were censored in the PFS analysis, meaning that their data collection was stopped due to the conclusion of the study or loss of contact. Penultimate PFS for certain of these censored subjects is based on the date of the last radiological analysis for the subject and they are shown in green below. Subjects that had progression events (3/23) are shown in dark blue and subjects that died without cancer progression (5/23) are shown in light blue. Including all three subject groups, the PFS on SM-88 monotherapy was more than twice as long as the penultimate PFS.

 Dosing, Adverse Events, and Patient Improvement Detail

Subjects received between one to ten cycles of treatment with SM-88, each cycle consisting of daily administration, five days per week for six weeks. The therapy was well-tolerated with all drug-related AEs occurring within the first cycle of treatment, with the exception of hyperpigmentation, which eventually occurred in all subjects. Drug-related AEs in Cycle 1 were mild to moderate, self-limiting and did not require therapy. They are presented in the following table:

Drug-related Adverse Events Reported in SM-88, Cycle 1
Adverse Events | Number of Treated Subjects (N = 30)
Hyperpigmentation | 8 
Fatigue | 15 
Lethargy | 1 
Pain | 4 
Paresthesia | 1 
Pigmentation change | 2 
Pruritus | 1 


Subjects experienced improvements in ECOG PS, EORTC QoL questionnaire and self-reported pain scores during Cycle 1. A measurable improvement in self-reported pain was seen in all subjects and most subjects reported an improved ECOG PS, as described below. As shown in the pain score table below for all treated subjects, at the end of Cycle 1, an additional eight subjects no longer experienced pain after treatment with SM-88.

We believe that SM-88 is a promising treatment for advanced metastatic cancer. It was well-tolerated among 30 subjects with a variety of cancers in our proof-of-concept clinical trial. We believe that SM-88 is not only unique, but thus far has shown no significant adverse side effects except for cutaneous hyperpigmentation.

We believe that the results of this study indicate that SM-88 holds promise as a successful monotherapy and likely has utility in combinations with both cytotoxic and current immunotherapies. We further believe that the magnitude of the positive clinical response in this end-stage cancer population, as well as the amelioration of disease-related symptoms, an increase in performance status and QoL, provides a solid rationale for further development of SM-88 as a potential cancer treatment.

 Compassionate Use Patients

In addition to the 30-subject First Human Study, 76 individuals have been treated as Compassionate Use Patients. The first 53 of which were analyzed in a retrospective study in early 2016, with an additional four patients analyzed as a part of a 2017 retrospective pancreatic cancer analysis. RECIST response data from these 57 Patients included eight CRs and 19 PRs, as summarized below:

Our Ongoing and Planned Phase II Clinical Trials

On September 21, 2015, we submitted a SM-88 IND to the FDA for advanced metastatic breast cancer patients.  On October 23, 2015, the FDA accepted the IND and authorized the breast trial to proceed (the “Anticipated Breast Trial”), including a pharmacokinetic (“PK”) study of the four components of SM-88. We subsequently determined to advance, instead of the Anticipated Breast Trial, a Phase Ib/II trial for prostate cancer patients and submitted this prostate protocol to the FDA on April 15, 2016 using the IND number assigned to the Anticipated Breast Trial.  Subsequent to this, we received comments from the FDA on May 12, 2016, responded on May 17, 2016, received additional comments from the FDA on May 31, 2016, and responded on June 3, 2016.  We submitted the final protocol to the FDA on June 10, 2016 and received no further comments.  Pursuant to 21 CFR 312.40, the IND for prostate went into effect 30 days after submission of the final protocol. 

Tyme subsequently initiated a Phase Ib/II trial in patients with recurrent, non-metastatic prostate cancer and reported initial data at ASCO 2017. Phase Ib was the dose ranging portion of the trial. After the first subject experienced therapeutic benefit, as measured by a decline of circulating tumor cells to an undetectable level within the first two months, and did not exhibit material side effects, a second cohort was launched that doubled the dose of Tyme’s proprietary tyrosine derivative (the other repurposed agents maintained the same dosage). The next three subjects also demonstrated therapeutic benefit, as measured by CTCs, without material side effects. At this point, the Phase II portion of the trial was initiated and the first patient was enrolled in February 2017. Targeted enrollment for the Phase II portion is 30 subjects. 

In addition, we are planning to launch a Phase II trial in refractory pancreatic cancer by first calendar quarter 2018. As described above and presented at ASCO 2017, we believe there is compelling evidence of efficacy for SM-88 monotherapy in pancreatic cancer as well as a substantial market need for any improved therapy. We have partnered with a large, international contract research organization (“CRO”) to oversee the trial’s launch and management. We have also recently hired a Clinical Operations Officer with over 15 years’ experience in managing oncology trials while at Quintiles and Eli Lilly. We are currently evaluating clinical trial sites and intend to open more than 30 sites across North America as a part of the trial. 

Further, we are in various levels of discussion with cancer treatment centers and physicians for potential clinical trials in lung, breast, bone and brain cancers, although there can be no guarantee that we will pursue trials in these areas.

 Pursuing FDA Fast Track Program/Breakthrough Status

The FDA’s Fast Track program, a provision of the FDA Modernization Act of 1997, is designed to facilitate interactions between a sponsoring company and the FDA before and during submission of a NDA for an investigational agent that, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for that disease or condition. Under the Fast Track program, the FDA may consider reviewing portions of a marketing application before the sponsor submits the complete application if the FDA determines, after a preliminary evaluation of the clinical data, that a fast track product may be effective. A Fast Track designation provides the opportunity for more frequent interactions with the FDA and a fast track product could be eligible for priority review if supported by clinical data at the time of submission of the NDA. We intend to engage the FDA in future discussions concerning SM-88 qualification for FDA Fast Track designation, particularly in pancreatic cancer. However, there can be no assurance that such designation will be granted.

On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) was signed into law. FDASIA provides a new designation for an expedited FDA review process called Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A breakthrough therapy is a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug for trial and market approval. All requests for Breakthrough Therapy Designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt and FDA will either grant or deny the request. When appropriate, we intend to hold discussions with the FDA regarding SM-88’s qualification for Breakthrough Therapy designation. However, there can be no assurance that such designation will be granted.

Target Markets

Cancer

Cancer is a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled growth and spread of abnormal cells.  In January 2017, the American Cancer Society projected that there will be an estimated 1,688,780 new cancer cases diagnosed and 600,920 cancer deaths in the United States in 2017.  Current treatments for cancer include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and immunotherapy.  The IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics reported in 2016 that total global spending on oncology medicines, including therapeutic treatments and supportive care, reached the $107 billion threshold in 2015.

Cancer is often referred to by Stage, ranging from I to IV, which indicates the size and location of tumors. Stages I, II and III are various sizes of localized tumors, meaning that they have not spread beyond the organ or area of origin, with Stage III indicating the largest tumors. Stage IV is metastatic cancer, meaning that tumors have been identified beyond the original location of the cancer. Stage IV typically has the poorest treatment outcomes since the cancer has aggressively spread within the patient. For example, the American Cancer Society estimates that patients diagnosed with Stage Ia pancreatic cancer has a five-year survival rate of approximately 14% in comparison to approximately 1% for patients diagnosed with Stage IV pancreatic cancer.

Many marketed products and product candidates for treating cancer patients are cytotoxic chemotherapies that exert their anti-tumor effect on cancer generally through nonspecific damage to cellular components with the goal of causing cancer cell malfunction and cell death.  Other products and product candidates alter cell metabolism or internal repair mechanisms leading to the demise of the cancer cell.  More recently, targeted anti-cancer agents have been designed by scientists to inhibit the action of specific molecules within cancer cells that are driving the aberrant growth responsible for tumor development.

All of these approaches may be associated with various side effects experienced by cancer patients that result from the treatments having an adverse impact on normal functioning cells and organ systems.  Some of the more common side effects of cancer therapy include nausea, vomiting or emesis, infections, fatigue and diarrhea.  Of common therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapies often have the most extensive side effect profiles given their effect on both healthy and cancer cells. Targeted therapies are usually designed to have fewer toxicities than cytotoxic chemotherapies, although drug-related cancer therapies commonly have some level of side effects.

- 14 -

 Treatment centers (such as hospitals and community cancer centers) and the healthcare professionals who treat cancer patients (physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, nurses and pharmacists) utilize various combinations of medical procedures, cancer therapeutics and supportive care products to extend and improve the quality of life of these patients.  The most common methods of treating patients with cancer, including surgery, radiation and drug therapy, can be used as a standalone treatment or in combination at the discretion of the physician depending on type and stage of disease. In more advanced cancers, especially when initial therapies have failed and more toxic therapies would be required, treatment may be modified or reduced to balance aggressiveness of drug therapy with quality-of-life for the cancer patient.

Revenue/Payment Structure within the Healthcare Industry

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement

In the U.S. and other countries, the level of sales of any product for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Increasingly, third-party payers examine the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. Third-party reimbursement is necessary to adequately realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development, but may not be available for our products.

Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status for SM-88 in the U.S. and international markets once the drug candidate has been approved by the applicable regulatory authorities. Commercial sale of SM-88 will depend, in part, on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. The process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate. Third-party payers may limit coverage to the specific drug products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approval. It is possible that SM-88 may not be considered as medically necessary or cost-effective by one or more third party payers. A decision by a third-party payer to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved.

In 2003, the U.S. government enacted legislation providing a partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare beneficiaries, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, drug manufacturers are required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation, which likely carry discounted prices.

The Healthcare Reform Law of 2010 substantially changed the way healthcare is financed in the U.S. by both government and private insurers. Among other cost containment measures, the Healthcare Reform Law established:


• | An annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; 
• | A new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which pharmaceutical manufacturers who wish to have their drugs covered under Part D must offer discounts to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period (the “donut hole”); and
• | A new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. 


We expect that federal, state and local governments in the U.S. will continue to consider legislation to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Future legislation could limit payments for pharmaceuticals such as SM-88.

The marketability of SM-88, if and when approved, may suffer if government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for SM-88, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates could be implemented in the future.

- 15 -

 Competition

Our business strategy is intended to effectively position SM-88 for competition with products manufactured by other companies in the highly fragmented and competitive cancer treatment market. Our competition comes from other commercial and research enterprises working in the field of cancer research. This includes pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government research institutes around the globe.

Important competitive factors include patient safety, effectiveness, quality-of-life and ease of use of products; price and demonstrated cost-effectiveness; marketing effectiveness; and research and development of new products and processes. Most new products we intend to market, assuming regulatory approval, will and must compete with other products already on the market as well as products that are later developed by existing or new competitors. If competitors introduce new products or delivery systems with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products would be subject to progressive price reductions, decreased volume of sales or both. Increasingly, to obtain favorable reimbursement and formulary positioning with government payers, managed care organizations and pharmacy benefits managers, we would be required to demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also more value as compared with other treatment regimens.

The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, development and regulatory plans in addition to proprietary scientific knowledge provide us with certain competitive advantages, we currently have limited financial resources and face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, each of whom has significantly greater financial resources than us. Any drugs that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new potential therapies that may become available in the future.

Our products, if approved for sale, would eventually be subject to competition from generic drug manufacturers. Manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals generally invest far less than R&D companies such as us. We anticipate that any manufacturer of a generic version of our drugs will invest far less than we have in the past and intend to do in the future in R&D and marketing our products, including SM-88. They therefore, have the advantage in that they can price their drugs much lower than the brand-name drugs for which we obtain approval. Additionally, in many countries outside the U.S., IP protection is weak or nonexistent and we would be forced to compete with generic or counterfeit versions of our products in such countries whether or not we hold legal exclusivity.

The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy. Our products once approved, would compete not only with other drugs, but also with such other types of therapies and treatments.

There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. Some of the currently approved drug therapies are branded and subject to patent protection and others are available on a generic basis. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies and widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payers. In general, although there has been considerable progress over the past few decades in the treatment of cancer with currently marketed therapies providing benefits to many patients, these therapies often are limited to some extent by a lack of efficacy and/or the significance or frequency of AEs.

In addition to currently marketed therapies, there are also a number of medicines in late-stage clinical development to treat cancer. These medicines in development may provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that are not provided by currently marketed therapies. As a result, they may provide significant, additional competition for SM-88.

Intellectual Property

We will strive to protect and enhance our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including through seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights (when required), whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also intend to rely on trade secrets related to our proprietary technology platform and our know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of cancer treatment, which may be important for the development of our business. We additionally may rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions, where available.

- 16 -

 Our commercial success may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable licenses, patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both our owned and licensed IP, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing such products, as well as being held valid if challenged.

Tyme has filed 67 patent applications in the US and abroad, with six U.S. patents issued thus far. The patents encompass SM-88 as well as citing inventions that fight cancer and aid in the creation of novel mechanisms to further that effort. Filed patents include additional metabolic approaches as well as hormonal and fluid transfer techniques. Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions and improvements to inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We have and will continue to seek U.S. and international patent protection for a variety of technologies, including: pharmaceutical compositions, methods for treating diseases of interest, methods for manufacturing the pharmaceutical compositions and research tools and methods. We also intend to seek patent protection or rely upon trade secret rights to protect other technologies that may be used to discover and validate targets and that may be used to identify and develop novel products. We will also seek protection, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements.

We believe we have no need to license any technologies for SM-88 to be commercially viable. We believe our Company owns all the IP necessary for our SM-88 to perform as intended and to be commercially marketed, once all applicable regulatory requirements have been obtained. Additionally, we believe the drug substances utilized in SM-88 are not covered by any patents that would impede our use of such drug substances.

Regulatory Process

Government Regulation and Product Approval

Government authorities in all major pharmaceutical markets extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. Although our initial focus will be in the U.S. and Europe, we intend to develop and seek marketing approval for our products in other countries and territories, such as Canada and Japan and for markets that follow the leading authorities, such as Brazil and South Korea. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S., Europe and in other countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, will require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
FDA Approval Process

SM-88 is subject to regulation in the U.S. by the FDA as a drug product. The FDA subjects drug products to extensive pre- and post-market regulation. The Public Health Service Act (“PHSA”), the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and the import and export of drugs. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending new drug applications (“NDAs”), withdrawal of approvals, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions and/or fines or civil or criminal penalties.

The PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases in the U.S. and between states.

The drug development process required by the FDA before a new drug may be marketed in the U.S. is long, expensive and inherently uncertain. Drug development in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal testing, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Developing the data to satisfy FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.

- 17 -

 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conducting of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices (“GLP”). The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.

An IND must become effective before U.S. clinical trials may begin. A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND submission within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.

Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or subjects with the condition under investigation, all under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practices (“GCP”), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the ongoing IND file.

The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to clinical trial subjects. The study protocol and informed consent information for subjects in clinical trials must be submitted to an IRB for review and approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at a clinical site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or may impose other conditions to assure subject safety. The study sponsor may also suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a determination that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.

Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap or be combined. In Phase I, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and is tested to assess pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, AEs associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products targeted for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer treatments, initial human testing may be conducted in the intended patient population. Phase II usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, as well as identification of common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase II, Phase III trials are initiated to obtain additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of subjects, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase III clinical trials are intended to establish data sufficient to demonstrate substantial evidence of the efficacy and safety of the product to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. Trials conducted outside of the U.S. under similar, GCP-compliant conditions in accordance with local applicable laws may also be acceptable to the FDA in support of product licensing.

Sponsors of clinical trials for investigational drugs must publicly disclose certain clinical trial information, including detailed trial design and trial results, in FDA public databases. These requirements are subject to specific timelines and apply to most controlled clinical trials of FDA-regulated products.

After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. The FDA review and approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology and CMC and must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product based on these results. The NDA must also contain extensive manufacturing information. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial and is in addition to the costs of conducting clinical trials. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, as well as annual product and establishment user fees, which may total several million dollars and are typically increased annually.

The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that the NDA is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drugs are reviewed within 10 months from the date the application is accepted for filing. Although the FDA often meets its user fee performance goals, it can extend these timelines if necessary and its review may not occur on a timely basis at all. The FDA usually refers applications for novel drugs, which present complex questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee - typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts - for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it 

- 18 -

 generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the drug product unless it verifies that compliance with current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) standards is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication(s) being studied.

After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional nonclinical or clinical testing or supplemental information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If or when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two to six months depending on the type of information that was included. The FDA approval is never guaranteed and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied.

Under the PHSA, the FDA may approve a NDA if it determines that the product is safe, pure and potent and the facility where the product will be manufactured meets standards designed to ensure that it continues to be safe, pure and potent. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. The approval for a drug may be significantly more limited than requested in the application, including limitations on the specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. The FDA may also require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, as a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) to further ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (“ETASU”). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS or use of a companion diagnostic with a drug can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require, as a condition of approval, substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.

In September of 2015, we submitted an IND to the FDA for our SM-88 drug candidate for use in treatment of breast cancer, which we referred to earlier as the Anticipated Breast Trial. In October of 2015, the FDA advised us that it had completed its 30-day safety review of the IND and concluded that we may proceed with our proposed clinical investigation of SM-88 for breast cancer. The FDA further noted that it had certain comments for our consideration, including matters regarding CMC compliance and clinical pharmacology. Among such comments, the FDA requested clarification regarding a clinical batch’s identifiable impurity; notification for monitoring release and stability testing levels; specifications for impurities meeting regulatory guidelines; revisions to a proposed protocol for monitoring plasma concentrations or justification for not making revisions to applicable proposed protocols; and, in the development of SM-88, characterizing single and proportional dosage PK levels, develop valid age analytical methods used to determine concentrations of study drugs and their active metabolite(s), if any, conduct population PK analyses to evaluate intrinsic and extrinsic factors, and explore the exposure/response relationships for measures of effectiveness, toxicity and PD biomarkers. We have taken such comments under advisement. The FDA also requested stability data for the drug substance as soon as it becomes available.

We subsequently determined to advance, instead of the Anticipated Breast Trial, a Phase Ib/II trial for prostate cancer patients and submitted this prostate protocol to the FDA on April 15, 2016 using the IND number assigned to the Anticipated Breast Trial.  Subsequent to this, we received comments from the FDA on May 12, 2016, responded on May 17, 2016, received additional comments from the FDA on May 31, 2016, and responded on June 3, 2016.  We submitted the final protocol to the FDA on June 10, 2016 and received no further comments.  Pursuant to 21 CFR 312.40, the IND for prostate went into effect 30 days after submission of the final protocol. As previously disclosed, Tyme completed the Ib dose ranging portion of the trial and the Phase II portion of the trial was initiated with the first patient enrolled in February 2017. Targeted enrollment for the Phase II portion is 30 subjects. 

Priority Review/Standard Review (U.S.) and Accelerated Review (EU)

The FDA may grant a New Drug Application a priority review designation based both upon the request of an applicant and the results of the Phase III clinical trial(s) submitted in the NDA. This designation sets the target date at six months for FDA action on the application. Priority review is granted where preliminary trial results indicate that a product, if approved, has the potential to provide a safe and effective therapy for a situation where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or where the product is possibly a significant improvement over existing marketed products. If these criteria are not met for priority review, the NDA is subject to the standard FDA review period of ten months. However, priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for regulatory approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.

- 19 -

 Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application is 210 days, which excludes clock stops when additional written or oral information needs to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, such as when a medicinal product is expected to be a major public health interest, as defined by three cumulative criteria: the seriousness of the disease to be treated (e.g., heavily disabling or life-threatening); the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and an anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. Under these circumstances, the European Medicines Agency ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is delivered within 150 days, excluding clock stops.

There can be no assurance that we would be able to satisfy any of these requirements to conduct preclinical or clinical trials or receive any regulatory approvals including priority or accelerated evaluation.

Breakthrough Therapy Approvals

On July 9, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (“FDASIA”) was signed into law. FDASIA provides a new designation for an expedited FDA review process called Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A breakthrough therapy is a drug that is intended alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug for trial and market approval. All requests for Breakthrough Therapy Designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt and FDA will either grant or deny the request.

As with the Fast Track program, promising results from early phase clinical studies indicate that SM-88 may qualify as an FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation while the clinical testing program continues. When appropriate, we intend to hold discussions with the FDA regarding SM-88’s qualification for Breakthrough Therapy Designation. There can be no assurance that such designation will be granted.

The Hatch-Waxman Act

Under the Hatch-Waxman Act, newly approved drugs and indications may benefit from a statutory period of non-patent marketing exclusivity. The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five-year marketing exclusivity to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity, meaning that the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety. The Hatch-Waxman Act prohibits having an effective approval date for an Abbreviated New Drug Application or a Section 505(b)(2) NDA for another version of such drug during the five-year exclusive period; however, submission of an ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA containing a paragraph IV certification is permitted after four years, which may trigger a 30-month stay of approval of the ANDA or Section 505(b)(2) NDA. Protection under the Hatch-Waxman Act will not prevent the submission or approval of another “full” NDA; however, the applicant for the “full” NDA would be required to conduct its own preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for the approval of new and supplemental NDAs, including Section 505(b)(2) NDAs, for, among other things, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug, if new clinical investigations that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are determined by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application.

In addition to non-patent marketing exclusivity, the Hatch-Waxman Act amended the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to require each NDA sponsor to submit with its application information on any patent that claims the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product (formulation and composition) and method-of-use for which the applicant submitted the NDA and with respect to which a claim of patent infringement could reasonably be asserted if a person not licensed by the owner engaged in the manufacture, use or sale of the drug. Generic applicants that wish to rely on the approval of a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to each listed patent. The Orange Book is a listing of all drug products that have been approved by the FDA and their generic equivalences. We intend to submit for Orange Book listing all relevant patents for SM-88 and to vigorously defend any Orange Book-listed patents for our approved products.

The Hatch-Waxman Act also permits a patent term extension of up to five years as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, a patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years after the FDA approves a marketing application. The patent term extension period is generally equal to the sum of one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA and all of the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, up to a total of five years. Only one patent applicable to a regulatory review period that represents the first commercial marketing of that drug is eligible for the extension and it

 must be applied for prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for patent term extension. We will consider applying for a patent term extension for some of our patents, to add patent life beyond the expiration date, depending on our ability to meet certain legal requirements permitting such extension and the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of an NDA. There can be no assurance that such an extension, if applied for, will be granted.

Advertising and Promotion

Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to continuing post-approval regulatory requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in significant penalties, including the issuance of warning letters directing a company to correct deviations from FDA standards, a requirement that future advertising and promotional materials are pre-cleared by the FDA and federal and state civil and criminal investigations and prosecutions.

Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes to indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing original and resubmitted NDAs.

AE Reporting and cGMP Compliance

AE reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase IV testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, storage and distribution procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain manufacturing subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals, request product recalls or impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or product removals if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if the product encounters problems following initial marketing or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.

Orphan Drug

Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition; generally, a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not necessarily convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive FDA approval for a product to treat a particular disease with FDA orphan drug designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for the product for treatment of the specified indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee. When appropriate, we intend to hold discussions with the FDA regarding pursuing orphan drug designation for SM-88. There can be no assurance given that such discussions, if commenced, would result in our pursuing orphan drug designation for SM-88 or that, if pursued, the FDA would grant SM-88 an orphan drug designation.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements

In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice and state and local governments.

 EU Approval Process

The EMA is a decentralized scientific agency of the EU. It coordinates the evaluation and monitoring of centrally authorized medicinal products. It is responsible for the scientific evaluation of applications for EU marketing authorizations, as well as the development of technical guidance and the provision of scientific advice to sponsors. The EMA decentralizes its scientific assessment of medicines by working through a network of about 4,500 experts throughout the EU, nominated by the Member States. The EMA draws on resources of over 40 National Competent Authorities of European Member States.

The process regarding regulatory approval of medicinal products in the EU follows roughly the same lines as in the U.S. and likewise generally involves satisfactorily completing each of the following:


• | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the applicable European GLP regulations; 
• | submission to the relevant national authorities of a clinical trial application (“CTA”) for each trial in humans, which must be approved before the trial may begin; 
• | performance of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product for each proposed indication; 
• | submission to the relevant competent authorities of a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”), which includes the data supporting safety and efficacy as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product in clinical development and proposed labeling;
• | satisfactory completion of an inspection by the relevant national authorities of the manufacturing facility or facilities, including those of third parties, at which the product is produced to assess compliance with strictly enforced cGMPs; 
• | potential audits of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the MAA; and 
• | review and approval by the relevant competent authority of the MAA before any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the product. 

Preclinical Studies

The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with the relevant European regulations and requirements. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animal studies in order to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product. The results of the preclinical tests, together with relevant manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of the CTA.
Clinical Trial Approval

Pursuant to the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, as amended, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the EU has been implemented through national legislation of the Member States. Under this system, approval must be obtained from the competent national authority of each European Member State in which a study is planned to be conducted. To this end, a CTA is submitted, which must be supported by an investigational medicinal product dossier (IMPD) and further supporting information prescribed by the Clinical Trials Directive and other applicable guidance documents. Furthermore, a clinical trial may only be started after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion on the clinical trial application in that country.

Manufacturing and import into the EU of investigational medicinal products is subject to the holding of appropriate authorizations and must be carried out in accordance with cGMPs.

Health Authority Interactions

During the development of a medicinal product, frequent interactions with the EU regulators are vital to make sure all relevant input and guidelines/regulations are taken into account in the overall program.

 Pediatric Studies

Regulation (EC) 1901/2006, which came into force in the EU on January 26, 2007, aims to facilitate the development and accessibility of medical products for use in children without subjecting children to unnecessary trials or delaying the authorization of medicinal products for use in adults. The regulation established the Pediatric Committee (“PDCO”), which is responsible for coordinating the EMA’s activities regarding medicines for children. The PDCO’s main role is to determine which studies that marketing authorization applicants need to complete in the pediatric population as part of the so-called Pediatric Investigation Plans (“PIP”). All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines that were not authorized in the EU before January 26, 2007 have to include either the results of studies carried out in children of different ages (as agreed with the PDCO) or proof that a waiver or a deferral of these studies has been obtained from the PDCO. As indicated, the PDCO determines what pediatric studies are necessary and describes them in a PIP. This requirement for pediatric studies also applies when a company wants to add a new indication, pharmaceutical form or route of administration for a medicine that is already authorized. The PDCO can grant deferrals for some medicines, allowing a company to delay development of the medicine in children until there is enough information to demonstrate its effectiveness and safety in adults and can also grant waivers when development of a medicine in children is not needed or is not appropriate, such as for diseases that only affect the elderly population.

Before an MAA can be filed or an existing marketing authorization can be varied, the EMA checks that companies are in compliance with the agreed studies and measures listed in each relevant PIP.

Regulation (EC) 1901/2006 also introduced several incentives for the development of medicines for children in the EU:


• | medicines that have been authorized across the EU in compliance with an agreed PIP are eligible for an extension of their patent protection by six months (this is the case even when the pediatric studies’ results are negative);
• | for orphan medicines, the incentive is an additional two years of market exclusivity, extending the typical 10-year period to 12 years; 
• | scientific advice and protocol assistance at the EMA are free of charge for questions relating to the development of medicines for children; and 
• | medicines developed specifically for children that are already authorized but are not protected by a patent or supplementary protection certificate, may be eligible for a pediatric use marketing authorization (PUMA); and 
• | if a PUMA is granted, the product will benefit from 10 years of market protection as an incentive for the development of the product for use in children. 

MAA

Authorization to market a product in the EU member states proceeds under one of four procedures: a centralized authorization procedure, a mutual recognition procedure, a decentralized procedure or a national procedure.
Centralized Authorization Procedure

Certain drugs, including medicinal products developed by means of biotechnological processes, must be approved via the centralized authorization procedure for marketing authorization. A successful application under the centralized authorization procedure results in a marketing authorization from the European Commission, which is automatically valid in all EU member states. The other European Economic Area member states (namely Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) are also obligated to recognize the Commission decision. The EMA and the European Commission administer the centralized authorization procedure.

Under the centralized authorization procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (“CHMP”) serves as the scientific committee that renders opinions about the safety, efficacy and quality of human products on behalf of the EMA. The CHMP is composed of experts nominated by each member state’s national drug authority, with one of them appointed to act as Rapporteur for the co-ordination of the evaluation with the possible assistance of a further member of the Committee acting as a Co-Rapporteur. After approval, the Rapporteur(s) continue to monitor the product throughout its life cycle. The CHMP is required to issue an opinion within 210 days of receipt of a valid application, though the clock is stopped if it is necessary to ask the applicant for clarification or further supporting data. The process is complex and involves extensive consultation with the regulatory authorities of member states and a number of experts. Once the procedure is completed, a European Public Assessment Report is produced. If the CHMP concludes that the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product are sufficiently proven, it adopts a positive opinion. The CHMP’s opinion is sent to the European Commission, which uses the opinion as the basis for its decision whether or not to grant a marketing authorization. If the opinion is negative, information is given as to the grounds on which this conclusion was reached.

- 23 -

 After a drug has been authorized and launched, it is a condition of maintaining the marketing authorization that all aspects relating to its quality, safety and efficacy must be kept under review. Sanctions may be imposed for failure to adhere to the conditions of the marketing authorization. In extreme cases, the authorization may be revoked, resulting in withdrawal of the product from sale.

Mutual Recognition Procedure and Decentralized National Procedure

Under a Mutual Recognition Procedure (“MRP”) or a Decentralized Procedure (“DCP”), the applicant must select which and how many EU member states in which to seek approval. In the case of an MRP, the applicant must initially receive national approval in one EU member state. This will be the so-called reference member state (“RMS”) for the MRP. Then, the applicant seeks approval for the product in other EU member states, the so-called concerned member states (“CMS”) in a second step.

For the DCP, the applicant will approach all chosen Member States at the same time. To do so, the applicant will identify the RMS that will assess the submitted MAA and provide the other selected Member States with the conclusions and results of the assessment. In principle, the applicant can choose any EU Member State as the RMS; however, in almost all Member States, the applicant needs to send a request for a time slot when the applicant will be allowed to submit the application. Depending on the Member State selected as RMS, the interval between submission of the request to the actual submission date can be two years or longer.

Accelerated Assessment Procedure

When an application is submitted for a marketing authorization in respect of a drug for human use, which is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation, the applicant may request an accelerated assessment. Under the accelerated assessment procedure, the CHMP is required to issue an opinion within 150 days of receipt of a valid application, subject to clock stops. We believe that SM-88 may qualify for this provision and we will take advantage of this provision, if appropriate.
Conditional Approval

Under EU regulations, a medicine that would fulfill an unmet medical need may, if its immediate availability is in the interest of public health, be granted a conditional marketing authorization on the basis of less complete clinical data than are normally required, subject to specific obligations being imposed on the authorization holder. These specific obligations are to be reviewed annually by the EMA. The list of these obligations is to be made publicly accessible. Such an authorization shall be valid for one year, on a renewable basis.

Period of Authorization and Renewals

A marketing authorization is initially valid for five years and may then be renewed on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the authorizing member state. To this end, the marketing authorization holder is to provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the file in respect of quality, safety and efficacy, including all variants introduced since the marketing authorization was granted, at least six months before the marketing authorization ceases to be valid. Once renewed, the marketing authorization shall be valid for an unlimited period, unless the Commission or the competent authority decides, on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one additional five-year renewal. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the drug on the European market (in case of centralized procedure) or on the market of the authorizing Member State within three years after authorization shall cease to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).

Orphan Drug Designation

EU regulations also provide for an orphan drug designation. This designation is granted if its sponsor can establish:


(a) | (i) that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made; or 
 | (ii) that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment; and
(b) | that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. 


- 24 -

 An application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. However, this period may be reduced to six years if at the end of the fifth year it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify continued market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinically relevant superiority” by a similar medicinal product or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a Member State in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs are eligible for incentives made available by the EU and by its Member States to support research into and the development and availability of orphan drugs. It is not our current intention to pursue orphan drug designation for SM-88.

Regulatory Data Protection

Without prejudice to the law on the protection of industrial and commercial property, marketing authorizations for new medicinal products in the EU benefit from an 8+2+1 year period of regulatory protection.

This regime consists of a regulatory data protection period of eight years plus a concurrent market exclusivity of ten years plus an additional market exclusivity of one further year if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing approval holder obtains an approval for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their approval, are determined to bring a significant Clinical Benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Under the current rules, a third party may reference the preclinical and clinical data of the reference product beginning eight years after first approval, but the third party may market a generic version only after ten (or eleven) years have lapsed. Additional regulatory data protection can be applied for when an applicant has complied with all requirements as set forth in an approved PIP.

International Conference on Harmonization (ICH)

The International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (“ICH”) is a project that brings together the regulatory authorities of Europe, Japan and the U.S. and experts from the pharmaceutical industry in the three regions to discuss scientific and technical aspects of pharmaceutical product registration. The purpose of ICH is to reduce or obviate the need to duplicate the testing carried out during the research and development of new medicines by recommending ways to achieve greater harmonization in the interpretation and application of technical guidelines and requirements for product registration. Harmonization would lead to a more economical use of human, animal and material resources, the elimination of unnecessary delay in the global development and availability of new medicines, while maintaining safeguards on quality, safety, efficacy and regulatory obligations to protect public health.

ICH guidelines have been adopted as law in many countries, but are only used as guidance in the U.S. by the FDA. In many areas of drug regulation, ICH has resulted in comparable requirements, for instance with respect to the Common Technical Document, which has become the core document for filings for market authorization in several jurisdictions. In this manner, ICH has facilitated a more efficient path to markets.

Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement

As previously noted, in the U.S. and other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers, including government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The division of competences within the EU leaves to its Member States the power to organize their own social security systems, including health care policies to promote the financial stability of their health care insurance systems.

In this context, each of the Member States’ national authorities is free to set the prices of medicinal products and to designate the treatments that they wish to reimburse under their social security system. However, the EU has defined a common procedural framework through the adoption what is generally known as the “Transparency Directive.” This directive aims to ensure that national pricing and reimbursement decisions are made in a transparent manner and do not disrupt the operation of the internal market.

The pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement systems established by Member States are usually quite complex. Each country uses different schemes and policies, adapted to its own economic and health needs. We would have to develop or access special expertise in this field to prepare health economic dossiers on our medicinal products if we would market our products, if and when approved, in the EU.

 Manufacturing

We do not own or operate, and currently have no near-term plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely on and expect to continue to rely on, third party contract manufacturers for supplies of SM-88 for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for the initial commercial manufacture of any products that we may market following regulatory approval.

We currently purchase all our drug substance and drug products from contract manufacturers and intend to continue to do so on an as-needed purchase order basis. We do not have long-term supply arrangements in place at this time. We intend to identify and qualify any further necessary contract manufacturers to provide all active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) and finished drug product services during the IND stages and prior to submission of an NDA to the FDA.

Our current intention is that, during the course of the IND program through the End-of-Phase II (“EOP2”), we will conduct the manufacturing, CMC and GMP programs towards commercial manufacturing. The overall manufacturing program includes, but is not limited to, the development of product and process specifications, producing and validating standards and the development of suitable analytical methods for test and release, as well as stability testing. Before and during the use of contract manufacturers, we (or qualified designee) will conduct audits to ensure compliance with the mutually agreed process descriptions and cGMP regulations. Our manufacturers themselves must comply with their in-house quality assurance programs and be available for inspections by regulatory agencies, including the FDA and European drug regulatory agencies. During the development of our drug candidates, we will scale the manufacturing process to a suitable size. Such scaling up involves several steps and may involve modification of the process, in which case modifications to our CMC sections will occur, with continuous submissions to the FDA and EU regulatory authorities.

As we progress through the regulatory approval process, there is a possibility that our intended manufacturing process will undergo modifications, primarily based on initial manufacturing results and data generated during the manufacture of drug substance and product to be used in our clinical trials. Such modifications could cause delays to our obtaining regulatory approval of SM-88, if at all, as well as an increase our research and development and manufacturing costs and could make such product cost prohibitive to our intended end users and their medical insurance providers.

SM-88 is a combination drug that is comprised of four active ingredients. Three of the components of SM-88 previously received regulatory approval in areas other than cancer treatment. The four active ingredients that comprise SM-88 are organic compounds of low molecular weight, generally called small molecules. They can be manufactured in reliable and reproducible synthetic processes from readily available starting materials. The chemistry is amenable to scale-up and we believe does not require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process.

Our tyrosine-based component is a derivative product that has been modified by a proprietary process to modify its functionality. This drug substance is being manufactured on an exclusive-basis by a leading, FDA-audited contract manufacturer that has previously manufactured tyrosine-based products on a commercial scale. This manufacturer currently is our sole supplier of this drug substance. To our knowledge, the current manufacturer of this drug substance is the only FDA-approved supplier of this drug. We believe this cGMP contract manufacturer has sufficient capacity to meet our projected needs into the near future and we maintain inventory on hand to meet our immediate clinical needs. In the event of a catastrophic event or if this contract manufacturer is unable to meet our needs, we will need to find an alternative source. This will likely result in delays for the clinical development program. It is not impossible to find a substitute for this supplier in the event that it becomes necessary, but it may be costly in terms of development time. We do not currently have arrangements in place for a redundant supply of the drug substance.

To date, we have, through an FDA-audited contract manufacturer, produced cGMP drug substance for use in our planned clinical trials. In addition, we have produced cGMP clinical trial materials utilizing such drug substance, through a FDA-audited contract manufacturer. Such newly produced drug substance and clinical trial materials are currently undergoing long term regulatory testing. We believe we have produced enough drug substance to create an inventory to meet our immediate needs regarding our planned clinical trials. 

For future work involving the drug product, it is anticipated that manufacture process development work will continue, with focus of manufacturing improvements, and scale up. It is anticipated that future manufacturing of clinical trial materials may be required to fill clinical trial needs. Additional tyrosine derivative drug product variations have also been developed for research purposes and some are being validated and tested for clinical purposes.

The remaining three active pharmaceutical ingredients (“APIs”) in SM-88 are available from several contract manufacturers, each holding Drug Master Files at the FDA for their respective API’s. We believe that the loss of or the inability of, any of single source to provide our required ingredients would not have any substantive delaying effect on our research program, clinical trials or future commercial sale of SM-88, as we believe other sources are readily available.

 Employees

As of March 31, 2017, we had a total of 9 full-time employees, all located in the United States. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Of the 9 employees, 5 perform research and development activities and 4 serve in general and administrative functions. Our Chief Executive Officer, Steve Hoffman, is also our Chief Science Officer and, as such, may be considered engaged in R&D activities, for purposes of the immediately preceding sentence, as well as his being categorized as serving in an administrative capacity. Where necessary, we have entered into consulting contracts to provide us with subject matter expertise. We believe there is available a sufficient number of contractors with appropriate subject matter expertise for our current and near-term needs.
Corporate Information

We were reincorporated on September 18, 2014 under the laws of the State of Delaware, after being incorporated in Florida as Global Group Enterprises Corp. on November 22, 2011, as discussed further below under Corporate History; Significant Organizational Events. Our principal executive offices are located at 44 Wall Street – 12th Floor, New York, New York 10005. Our telephone number is 646-205-1603. Our website address is www.tymetechnologiesinc.com.
Corporate History; Significant Organizational Events

Overview

We were originally incorporated in Florida as Global Group Enterprises Corp. on November 22, 2011. Effective as of September 18, 2014, we reincorporated in the State of Delaware and later engaged in a merger and certain other transactions (described under the sub-captions below). As a result of these events, among other things,

• | we changed our jurisdiction of incorporation from Florida to Delaware; 
• | we changed our name from Global Group Enterprises Corp. to Tyme Technologies, Inc.; 
• | we increased our authorized capital stock from 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, to 300,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share and 10,000,000 shares of “blank check” preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share.


Subsequent to this organizational merger, we entered into a merger in 2015, whereby we acquired our current clinical-stage pharmaceutical business. The effects of such 2015 merger and associated financing transactions are described below under “Merger Agreement.”

Merger Agreement

On March 5, 2015, we, our wholly-owned subsidiary formed for the purposes of completing the merger (which we refer to as “Acquisition Sub”), Tyme, Inc. (“Tyme”) and certain other parties entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”). Simultaneous with the execution of the Merger Agreement, we and the other parties to the Merger Agreement consummated the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Merger”). We refer to the date that the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including the Merger, were consummated as the “Closing Date.” Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Acquisition Sub merged with and into Tyme. Tyme was the surviving corporation in the Merger and thus became our wholly-owned subsidiary.

In accordance with the Merger Agreement, we also completed a split-off transaction whereby we transferred all of our pre-Merger assets and liabilities to a newly formed subsidiary, Global Group Enterprises Corp., a Florida corporation (“Split-Off Subsidiary”), and transferred our entire equity interest in Split-Off Sub to our pre-Merger principal stockholder, who was a founder and former executive officer (the “Split-Off”). The Split-Off was effected in consideration for the surrender to us for cancellation of all of this founder’s 13,000,200 shares of our Common Stock. For further details, see “Split-Off Transaction” below. As a result of the consummation of the Merger and Split-Off Transaction, our sole business became the business of Tyme, a research and development company focused on developing drug candidates for the treatment of cancer in humans.

- 27 -

 At the closing of the Merger, the shares of Tyme’s common stock that were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Merger were converted into shares of our Common Stock, resulting in an aggregate of 68 million shares of our Common Stock being issued in connection with the Merger to the holders of Tyme’s common stock immediately preceding the effective time of the Merger (the “Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders”).

The Merger Agreement contained representations and warranties and pre- and post-closing covenants of each party and customary closing conditions. Breaches of the representations and warranties under the Merger Agreement are subject to indemnification provisions. Each of the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders initially received in the Merger 95% of the shares to which each such stockholder was entitled under the terms of the Merger Agreement, with the remaining 5% of such shares being held in escrow for two years to satisfy post-closing claims for indemnification by the Company (“Indemnity Shares”), pursuant to an Indemnification Shares Escrow Agreement. As the Company and the indemnification representative are aware of no post-closing claims during the two-year period, a joint instruction was sent on April 7, 2017 asking for the release of the Indemnity Shares. The Company expects all of the Indemnity Shares to be distributed to the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders on a pro rata basis in June of 2017. The Merger Agreement also contained a provision providing for a post-Merger share issuance, as a means for which claims for indemnity may be made by the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders. Pursuant to this provision, up to one million additional shares (“R&W Shares”) of our Common Stock may be issued to the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders during the one-year period following the Merger for breaches of representations and warranties of the pre-Merger Company contained in the Merger Agreement. The foregoing mechanisms are the exclusive remedies of the Company on the one hand and the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders on the other hand for satisfying indemnification claims under the Merger Agreement, other than claims based on fraud or willful misconduct.

The Merger Agreement also called for the surrender for cancellation, effective as of the Merger Closing, of a number of shares of our Common Stock by the owners of such shares. In addition to the surrender and cancellation of 13,000,200 shares in connection with the Split-Off transaction, a further 26,276,600 shares (the “Merger Related Surrendered Shares”) were surrendered by their owners and canceled.

The Merger was treated as a recapitalization or reverse acquisition for financial accounting purposes. Tyme is considered the acquirer for accounting purposes and our historical financial statements before the Merger will be replaced with the historical financial statements of Tyme before the Merger in all future filings with the SEC.

The Merger is intended to be treated as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.

The issuance of shares of our Common Stock to holders of Tyme’s common stock in connection with the Merger was not registered under the Securities Act, in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, which exempts transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. These securities may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirement and are subject to further contractual restrictions on transfer as described below.

We and the Pre-Merger Tyme Stockholders entered into additional agreements concerning the registration or sale of shares of our Common Stock, in certain circumstances, the terms of which have expired prior to March 31, 2017. 

All descriptions of the Merger Agreement, Indemnification Shares Escrow Agreement and Lock-Up Agreements herein are qualified in their entireties by reference to the texts thereof incorporated by reference herein and listed as exhibits hereto.

Split-Off Transaction

Immediately prior to the closing of the Merger, under the terms of a Split-Off Agreement and a General Release Agreement, we effected the Split-Off, whereby we (x) transferred all of our pre-Merger operating assets and liabilities to Split-Off Subsidiary, our wholly-owned special-purpose subsidiary and (y) transferred all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Split-Off Subsidiary to Andrew Keck, our founder and a principal stockholder of our Company prior to the consummation of the Merger, in consideration of and in exchange for (i) the surrender for cancellation of an aggregate of 13,000,200 shares of our Common Stock owned by him and (ii) certain representations, covenants and indemnities (the “Split-Off”). Mr. Keck served as our sole executive officer and director from our initial formation through April 26, 2013.

All descriptions of the Split-Off Agreement and the General Release Agreement herein are qualified in their entireties by reference to the texts thereof incorporated by reference herein and listed as exhibits hereto.

 Bridge Financing by Tyme

In July 2014, Tyme offered and sold to an accredited investor a Tyme senior subordinated secured convertible note in the principal amount of $1.1 million. The note bore interest at 10% per annum and was payable on October 11, 2015, subject to earlier conversion as described below. In November of 2014, the holder of such note loaned Tyme an additional $250,000 and the note was amended and restated to reflect a principal amount of $1.35 million. In January of 2015, the holder of such note loaned Tyme an additional $960,000 and the note was further amended and restated to reflect a principal amount of $2.31 million. In February of 2015, the note was further amended to reflect a change in its mandatory conversion feature to a fixed amount, as further discussed below. The note as amended and restated is referred to in this report as the “Bridge Note.”

Interest on the Bridge Note would have been payable at maturity; however, upon conversion of the Bridge Note as described below, accrued interest was, in accordance with the terms of the Bridge Note, forgiven. The Bridge Note was secured by a security interest on all of the assets of Tyme and its Luminant Biosciences, LLC wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyme (“Luminant”), subject to certain limited exceptions, as well as a pledge of certain shares of stock of Tyme then held by two principal stockholders of Tyme and Tyme’s membership interest in Luminant.

Upon the closing of the Merger and the private placement offering (the “PPO”) (described below), the outstanding principal amount of the Bridge Note was automatically converted into 2.31 million shares (the “Conversion Shares”) of our Common Stock, at a rate of one share for every $1.00 of Bridge Note principal then outstanding. The security interest and pledges terminated upon conversion of the Bridge Note.

All descriptions of the Bridge Note original and as amended and restated, herein are qualified in their entireties by reference to the texts thereof incorporated by reference herein and listed as exhibits hereto.

The PPO

Concurrently with the closing of the Merger and in contemplation of the Merger, we held a closing of a PPO in which we sold 2.716 million shares of our Common Stock at a purchase price of $2.50 per share for gross proceeds of $6.79 million. Only $4.29 million of such gross proceeds was paid in cash. The remaining $2.5 million was paid by the delivery to us of a 90-day, limited recourse promissory note in the principal amount of $2.5 million (the “PPO Note”). The PPO Note was secured by an escrow of five million shares of our Common Stock, pursuant to a Subscription Note Shares Escrow Agreement among us, the purchaser in the PPO and an escrow agent (the “PPO Note Escrow Agreement”).

The PPO Note had an original maturity date of June 5, 2015. Under an Omnibus Amendment, dated as of June 5, 2015, among Christopher Brown, GEM Global Yield Fund LLC SCS (“GEM”) and us, among other matters, GEM made a payment to us equal to one-half of the original principal amount of the PPO Note and we extended the maturity date with respect to the balance due under the PPO Note ($1,250,000 in principal amount) to July 6, 2015. Following such receipt of one-half of the PPO Note, 2,500,000 of such shares were released from escrow and the remaining 2,500,000 shares remained in escrow. We entered into a Second Omnibus Amendment as of July 23, 2015 (the “Second Omnibus Amendment”), pursuant to which, among other matters, we agreed to the extension of the maturity date of the remaining $1,250,000 outstanding amount due under the PPO Note to a date which is five business days following our providing the maker of the PPO Note of written evidence that the IND for our SM-88 drug candidate has been submitted by us to the FDA. The IND was received by the FDA on September 21, 2015 and notice of such was given to the maker of the PPO Note on September 25, 2015. Subsequently, the remaining $1,250,000 PPO Note balance was paid and we authorized the release of the 2,500,000 shares then remaining in escrow.

The PPO investor and the Bridge Note purchaser who received the Conversion Shares upon the automatic conversion of the Bridge Note, which occurred simultaneous with the closing of the PPO, were granted, pursuant to the subscription agreement for the PPO and pursuant to the Bridge Note, anti-dilution protection on the shares purchased in the PPO and the Conversion Shares (as the case may be) such that, if within two years after the closing of the Merger, our Company issues additional shares of our Common Stock or Common Stock equivalents (subject to customary exceptions, including but not limited to Exempt Securities (defined below)) for a consideration per share less than $0.50 (the “Lower Price”), the PPO investor and former Bridge Note holder would be entitled to receive from the Company additional shares of our Common Stock (the “Lower Price Shares”) in an amount such that, when added to the number of shares initially purchased by such investor or received upon conversion of the Bridge Note, will equal the number of shares that such investor’s PPO subscription amount would have purchased or the Bridge Note holder would have received upon conversion of the Bridge Note at the Lower Price, respectively. “Exempt Securities” include: (a) options and other equity awards issued under our 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (as discussed below); (b) shares of our Common Stock, options or convertible securities issued pursuant to or in conjunction with a joint venture, development, technology license or similar type of collaboration or strategic partnership agreement; (c) shares issued in the Merger and (d) securities issued to financial institutions, institutional investors or

 lessors in connection with credit arrangements, equipment financings, lease arrangements or similarly transaction (in each case, subject to a maximum number equal to 10% of the number of shares of our Common Stock outstanding at the time of issuance); provided, however, no such issuance shall include any type of anti-dilutive “death spiral” provision. The anti-dilution rights described above have expired in March 2017.

The PPO was exempt from registration under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act. The sole investor in the PPO was GEM Global Yield Fund LLC SCS, a “société en commaudite simple” formed under the laws of Luxembourg (“GEM”). The Bridge Note investor designated GEM as the party to receive the Conversion Shares. GEM was a principal stockholder of our pre-Merger company, and the purchaser of the Bridge Note is the manager of GEM.

The closing of the PPO and the closing of the Merger were conditioned upon each other.

All descriptions herein of the subscription agreement for the PPO, PPO Note and PPO Note Escrow Agreement are qualified in their entireties by reference to the texts thereof incorporated by reference herein and listed as exhibits hereto.

Adjustment Shares Escrow Agreement

The Merger Agreement provided that, in the event we raise additional capital in a public or private offering (in one or more closings) for gross proceeds of at least $20 million (a “Qualified Offering”), based on a pre-money valuation of our Company of at least $200 million, within five months of the earlier of the (i) date on which the PPO Note has been fully satisfied and (ii) PPO Note Maturity Date, subject to certain conditions (the “Qualified Offering Trigger Termination Date”), we will issue to the holders of record of our Common Stock as of the Closing Date (the “Pre-Merger Company Stockholders”), pro rata, 1,333,333 additional restricted shares of our Common Stock (the “Qualified Offering Shares”).

The Merger Agreement further provides that:


• | if the pre-money valuation of our Company upon a Qualified Offering is $150 million or more but less than $200 million, the Pre-Merger Company Stockholders will surrender to us for cancellation without consideration 1 million shares of our Common Stock; 
• | if the pre-money valuation of our Company upon a Qualified Offering is $100 million or more but less than $150 million, the Pre-Merger Company Stockholders will surrender to us for cancellation without consideration 2 million shares of our Common Stock; and 
• | if the pre-money valuation of the Company upon a Qualified Offering is less than $100 million (which Qualified Offering may be rejected in the Company’s sole and absolute discretion) or if no Qualified Offering occurs within five months of the Qualified Offering Trigger Termination Date, the Pre-Merger Company Stockholders will surrender to us for cancellation without consideration 3.5 million shares of our Common Stock.


The Pre-Merger Company Stockholders placed into escrow, (the “Adjustment Shares Escrow Agreement”), 3.5 million shares of our Common Stock (the “Adjustment Shares”) to secure such surrender obligations. 

We had the sole authority to determine all matters relating to the Qualified Offering, including the subscription price, pre-money valuation and whether or not to accept any subscriber’s subscription offer. No Qualified Offering occurred by the Qualified Offering Trigger Termination Date. The Adjustment Shares were released to the Company on March 1, 2017, subsequent to the initiation of litigation by the Company to compel the escrow agent’s release of the Adjustment Shares. See Item 3 – “Legal Proceedings.”
