Overview
PetroQuest Energy, Inc. is an independent oil and gas company incorporated in the State of Delaware with primary operations in Texas, Louisiana and the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. We seek to grow our production, proved reserves, cash flow and earnings at low finding and development costs through a balanced mix of exploration, development and acquisition activities. From the commencement of our operations through 2002, we were focused exclusively in the Gulf Coast Basin with onshore properties principally in southern Louisiana and offshore properties in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico shelf. During 2003, we began the implementation of our strategic goal of diversifying our reserves and production into longer life and lower risk onshore properties with our acquisition of the Carthage Field in East Texas. As part of the strategic shift to diversify our asset portfolio and lower our geographic and geologic risk profile, we refocused our opportunity selection processes to reduce our average working interest in higher risk projects, shift capital to higher probability of success onshore wells and mitigate the risks associated with individual wells by expanding our drilling program across multiple basins. From 2005 through 2015, we 
#4#

were actively acquiring acreage and drilling wells primarily in the Woodford Shale play in Oklahoma. We divested all of our acreage and producing wells in Oklahoma in three transactions that closed in June 2015, April 2016 and October 2016 (the "Oklahoma Divestitures"). See Note 2 - Acquisitions and Divestitures.
Our liquidity position has been negatively impacted by the prolonged decline in commodity prices that began in late 2014. In response, we executed the following actions during 2015 and 2016 aimed at preserving liquidity, reducing overall debt levels and extending debt maturities:

• | Completed the Oklahoma Divestitures for $292.6 million;


• | Reduced our 2016 capital expenditures by 75% as compared to 2015 capital expenditures of approximately $65 million;


• | Completed two debt exchanges reducing debt maturing in 2017 from $350 million to $22.7 million;


• | Reduced total debt 32% from $425 million at December 31, 2014 to $290.3 million at December 31, 2016;


• | Entered into a new $50 million Multidraw Term Loan Agreement maturing in 2020;


• | Suspended the quarterly dividend on our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock saving $5.1 million annually; and


• | Secured a new drilling joint venture in East Texas.

In addition to extending the maturity on approximately $113.0 million of debt due in 2017 to 2021, our September 2016 debt exchange permits us to reduce our cash interest expense on $243.5 million of debt from 10% cash to 1% cash and 9% payment-in-kind for the first three semi-annual interest payments, which is expected to provide us with more than $30 million of cash interest savings during 2017 and 2018. To enhance our liquidity and provide capital to refinance the remaining 10% Senior Notes due 2017 (the "2017 Notes"), in October 2016, we entered into a new $50 million Multidraw Term Loan Agreement (the "Multidraw Term Loan Agreement") maturing in 2020, that replaced our prior bank credit facility which had no borrowing base on the date of termination. We currently have a more favorable outlook on oil and gas prices for 2017 than prices experienced in 2016. We have recently recompleted our Thunder Bayou well in South Louisiana into a larger sand package and commenced the East Texas joint venture drilling program where we expect to drill eight to ten gross wells during 2017. As a result, we expect to begin growing production during 2017 as compared to 2016.
Business Strategy
Preserve Our Liquidity and Strengthen Our Balance Sheet. Our 2017 capital expenditures, which include capitalized interest and overhead but exclude acquisitions, are expected to range between $40 million and $48 million, a 176% increase at the midpoint of that range from our spending in 2016, and are expected to be funded through cash flow from operations and cash on hand. Because we operate approximately 75% of our total estimated proved reserves and manage the drilling and completion activities on an additional 16% of such reserves, we expect to be able to control the timing of a substantial portion of our capital investments. We also may continue to opportunistically dispose of certain assets or enter into joint venture arrangements to provide additional liquidity and plan to maintain our commodity hedging program, as in prior years. As a result of the debt exchanges mentioned above and the suspension of the quarterly dividend payments on our outstanding Series B Preferred Stock, we expect to see cash savings on interest and dividends of approximately $25 million during 2017.
Pursue Balanced Growth and Portfolio Mix. We plan to pursue a risk-balanced approach to the growth and stability of our reserves, production, cash flows and earnings. Our goal is to weight our capital allocation to lower risk development activities to balance the capital allocated to higher risk and higher impact exploration activities. We plan to allocate our capital investments in a manner that continues to geographically and operationally diversify our asset base. Through our portfolio diversification efforts, at December 31, 2016, approximately 72% of our estimated proved reserves were located in longer life and lower risk basins in East Texas and 28% were located in the shorter life, but higher flow rate reservoirs in the Gulf Coast Basin. In terms of production diversification, during 2016, 46% of our production was derived from longer life basins. Our 2016 production was comprised of 71% natural gas, 13% oil and 16% natural gas liquids. 
Focus Capital Toward More Predictable Onshore Assets. We plan to focus the majority of our capital spending developing our lower-risk Cotton Valley acreage in East Texas. Since beginning horizontal drilling in the Carthage Field in 2011, we have a 100% drilling success rate on 20 gross wells drilled. Approximately 77% of our 2017 capital expenditures are allocated to operations in East Texas where we believe the less complex geology, combined with the large inventory of offsetting vertical and horizontal well data, offers greater predictability in increasing production and proved reserves. Additionally, our East Texas acreage position 
#5#

provides a significant inventory of future drilling locations, which we expect to develop over a long-term drilling campaign. We plan to apply the latest drilling and completion techniques to consistently improve the economic development of this resource potential.
Concentrate in Core Operating Areas and Build Scale. We plan to continue focusing on our operations in East Texas and the Gulf Coast Basin. Operating in concentrated areas helps to better control our overhead by enabling us to manage a greater amount of acreage with fewer employees and minimize incremental costs of increased drilling and production. We have substantial geological and reservoir data, operating experience and partner relationships in these regions. We believe that these factors, combined with the existing infrastructure and favorable geologic conditions with multiple known oil and gas producing reservoirs in these regions, will provide us with attractive investment opportunities.
Manage Our Risk Exposure. We plan to continue several strategies designed to mitigate our operating risks. We have adjusted the working interest we are willing to hold based on the risk level and cost exposure of each project. For example, we typically reduce our working interests in higher risk exploration projects while retaining greater working interests in lower risk development projects. Our partners often agree to pay a disproportionate share of drilling costs relative to their interests, allowing us to allocate our capital spending to maximize our return and reduce the inherent risk in exploration and development activities. We also strive to retain operating control of the majority of our properties to control costs and timing of expenditures and we expect to continue to actively hedge a portion of our future planned production to mitigate the impact of commodity price fluctuations and achieve more predictable cash flows. We may also enter into joint venture arrangements designed to develop our properties while limiting our capital requirements and preserving our liquidity.
2016 Financial and Operational Summary
During 2016, we invested $15.9 million in exploratory, development and acquisition activities. We drilled 5 gross development wells realizing an overall success rate of 100%. These activities were financed through cash on hand and our cash flow from operations. During 2016, our production decreased 31% to 23.5 Bcfe as a result of the Oklahoma Divestitures and normal production declines at our East Texas and Gulf Coast fields. Our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 decreased 35% from 2015 as discussed in greater detail below.
Oil and Gas Reserves
Our estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2016 decreased 35% from 2015 totaling 1.4 MMBbls of oil, 26.6 Bcfe of natural gas liquids (Ngls) and 81 Bcf of natural gas. At December 31, 2016, our standardized measure of our discounted cash flows, which includes the estimated impact of future income taxes, totaled $67.3 million. We had a pre-tax present value, discounted at 10%, of the estimated future net revenues based on 12-month, first day of month, average prices during 2016 (“PV-10”) of $67.3 million. The decrease in our estimated proved reserves during 2016 was primarily the result of the divestiture of our remaining Oklahoma assets, which represented 20 Bcfe of our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2015 as well as the 75% reduction in capital spending during 2016, as compared to 2015. See the reconciliation of standardized measure of discounted cash flows to PV-10 below. Our standardized measure of discounted cash flows and PV-10 utilized prices (adjusted for field differentials) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as follows:

 | 12/31/2016 | 12/31/2015
Oil per Bbl | $40.85 | $50.29 
Natural gas per Mcf | $2.40 | $2.41 
Ngl per Mcfe | $1.82 | $2.24 

 Ryder Scott Company, L.P., a nationally recognized independent petroleum engineering firm, prepared the estimates of our proved reserves and future net cash flows (and present value thereof) attributable to such proved reserves at December 31, 2016. Our internal reservoir engineering staff is managed by an individual with 35 years of industry experience as a reservoir and production engineer, including fourteen years as a reservoir engineering manager with PetroQuest. This individual is responsible for overseeing the estimates prepared by Ryder Scott.

Our internal controls that are used in our reserve estimation process are designed to provide reasonable assurance that our reserve estimates are computed and reported in accordance with SEC rules and regulations and generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP"). These internal controls are regularly tested in connection with our annual assessment of internal controls over financial reporting and include:
•Utilizing documented process workflows;
•Employing qualified professional engineering, geological, land, financial and marketing personnel; and
•Providing continuing education and training for all personnel involved in our reserve estimation process.
Each quarter, our Reservoir Engineering Manager presents the status of the changes to our reserve estimates to our executive team, including our Chief Executive Officer.  These reserve estimates are then presented to our Board of Directors in connection with quarterly meetings.  In addition, our reserve booking policies and procedures are reviewed annually by one of the members of our Board of Directors, acting on behalf of our Audit Committee.
With respect to proved undeveloped reserves (“PUD reserves”), we maintain a five year development plan that is updated and approved annually by our PUD Review Committee (as described below) with input from our executive team and asset managers and reviewed quarterly by our executive team and asset managers. Our development plan includes only PUDs that we are reasonably certain will be drilled within five years of booking based upon qualitative and quantitative factors including estimated risk-based returns, current pricing forecasts, recent drilling results, availability of services, equipment and personnel, seasonal weather patterns and changes in drilling and completion techniques and technology. Our PUD reserves are based upon our substantial basin-specific technical and operating experience relative to the location of the reserves. Over the last five years, we have realized a 100% drilling success rate on 20 gross wells drilled in East Texas where 100% of our PUD reserves are currently booked. Furthermore, because all of our longer life, onshore PUD reserves are direct offsetting locations to producing wells, we have comprehensive data available, which enables us to forecast economic results, including drilling and operating costs, with reasonable certainty. 
During 2014, we established a committee that annually reviews our PUD reserves. Our PUD Review Committee (the “Committee”) is comprised of our Executive Vice President of Operations, Chief Financial Officer and Reservoir Engineering Manager and meets annually in connection with each year-end reserve report. The Committee is responsible for reviewing all PUD locations, not only in terms of technical and financial merits as reviewed by our independent petroleum engineering firm, but also to apply a robust evaluation of the timing and reasonable certainty of the development plan in light of all known circumstances including our budget, the outlook for commodity prices and the location of ongoing drilling programs. The Committee’s evaluation of reasonable certainty of the development plan includes a thorough assessment of near term drilling plans to develop PUDs, a review of adherence to previously adopted development plans and a review of historical PUD conversion rates. 
The following table sets forth certain information about our estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2016:

 | Oil (MBbls) | NGL (Mmcfe) | | Natural Gas (Mmcf) | Total Mmcfe*
Proved Developed | 1,212 | | 13,073 | | 47,349 | 67,694 
Proved Undeveloped | 185 | | 13,502 | | 33,175 | 47,787 
Total Proved | 1,397 | | 26,575 | | 80,524 | 115,481


* | Oil conversion to Mcfe at one Bbl of crude oil, condensate or natural gas liquids to six Mcf of natural gas.

As of December 31, 2016, our PUD reserves totaled 47.8 Bcfe, a 36% decrease from our PUD reserves at December 31, 2015. During 2016, we spent $2.1 million converting 5.4 Bcfe of PUD reserves at December 31, 2015 to proved developed reserves at December 31, 2016. 
The following table presents an analysis of the change in our PUD reserves from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016:

 | MMcfe 
PUD Reserve balance at December 31, 2015 | 74,389 | 
Conversions to proved developed | (5,392 | )
Divestitures | (6,524 | )
Revisions of previous estimates | (14,686 | )
PUD Reserve balance at December 31, 2016 | 47,787 | 

#7#

All of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2016 were associated with the future development of our East Texas properties. The revisions of previous estimates reflected in the table above include the reclassification of approximately 10.7 Bcfe of PUDs to probable reserves due to our expectation that those locations would not be developed within five years from initial booking. We expect all of our PUD reserves at December 31, 2016 to be developed over the next five years. However, our PUD reserve inventory does not encompass all drilling activities over the next five years. For example, during 2016 we converted 1.5 Bcfe of reserves that were classified as probable reserves at December 31, 2015 to proved developed producing at December 31, 2016 and therefore were not included in the above table. We expect to continue to allocate capital to projects that do not have proved reserves ascribed to them. At December 31, 2016, we had no PUD reserves booked for longer than five years. Estimated future costs related to the development of PUD reserves are expected to total $13.5 million in 2017, $4.3 million in 2018, $14.6 million in 2019 and $8.8 million in 2020. During 2017, we expect to convert approximately 18.1 Bcfe of PUDs at December 31, 2016 to proved developed reserves.
The estimated cash flows from our proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were as follows:

 | Proved Developed(M$) | | ProvedUndeveloped(M$) | Total Proved(M$)
Estimated pre-tax future net cash flows (1) | $ | 66,920 | | $ | 31,111 | $ | 98,031
Discounted pre-tax future net cash flows (PV-10) (1) | $ | 57,709 | | $ | 9,560 | $ | 67,269
Total standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows | | | | $ | 67,269


(1) | Estimated pre-tax future net cash flows and discounted pre-tax future net cash flows (PV-10) are non-GAAP measures because they exclude income tax effects. Management believes these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors as they are based on prices, costs and discount factors which are consistent from company to company, while the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is dependent on the unique tax situation of each individual company. As a result, the Company believes that investors can use these non-GAAP measures as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of the Company’s reserves to other companies. The Company also understands that securities analysts and rating agencies use these non-GAAP measures in similar ways.

The following table reconciles undiscounted and discounted future net cash flows to standardized measure of discounted cash flows as of December 31, 2016:

 | Total Proved (M$)
Estimated pre-tax future net cash flows | $ | 98,031
10% annual discount | 30,762 | 
Discounted pre-tax future net cash flows | 67,269 | 
Future income taxes discounted at 10% | — | 
Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows | $ | 67,269

We have not filed any reports with other federal agencies that contain an estimate of total proved net oil and gas reserves.
Core Areas
The following table sets forth estimated proved reserves and annual production from each of our core areas (in Bcfe) for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

 | 2016 | 2015 
 | Reserves | Production | | Reserves | Production
Gulf Coast Basin | 32.9 | | 12.8 | | 43.9 | 13.8
East Texas | 82.6 | | 9.0 | | 114.1 | 11.1
Oklahoma Woodford (1) | — | | 1.7 | | 20.0 | 9.2 
Other | — | | — | | — | 0.1 
 | 115.5 | | 23.5 | | 178.0 | 34.2

(1) In June 2015, we divested the majority of our Oklahoma Woodford assets (representing 227.2 Bcfe of proved reserves at December 31, 2014) which contributed 7.0 Bcfe of production in 2015. In April and October 2016, we divested the remainder of our Oklahoma assets (representing 20 Bcfe of proved reserves at December 31, 2015) which contributed 1.7 Bcfe of production in 2016.

East Texas
During 2016, we invested $3.9 million in our East Texas properties where we drilled one gross well, achieving a 100% success rate. Net production from our East Texas assets averaged 24.7 MMcfe per day during 2016, a 19% decrease from 2015 average daily production, and our estimated proved reserves decreased 28% from 2015 due to the reduced capital spending in this core area during 2016 as well as the reclassification of certain PUD reserves to probable reserves. We have allocated approximately 77% of our 2017 capital budget to drilling and performing various re-completions at our Carthage Field.
Gulf Coast Basin
During 2016, we invested $6.1 million in this core area. Production from this area decreased 8% from 2015 totaling 34.9 MMcfe per day in 2016 due to normal production declines in the Gulf Coast area offset by a full year of production from our Thunder Bayou discovery. Our estimated proved reserves in this area decreased 25% from 2015 primarily as a result of the 12.8 Bcfe of production in 2016. We have allocated approximately 23% of our 2017 capital budget to performing various re-completions and plugging and abandonment projects in the Gulf Coast Basin.
Oklahoma - Woodford
During 2016, we invested $0.3 million and completed four gross wells, achieving a 100% success rate. Average daily production from our Oklahoma properties during 2016 totaled 5 MMcfe per day, an 82% decrease from 2015 average daily production primarily as a result of the Oklahoma Divestitures. During 2016, we sold 21.9 Bcfe of proved reserves in connection with our exit from this core area.
Markets and Customers
We sell our oil and natural gas production under fixed or floating market contracts. Customers purchase all of our oil and natural gas production at current market prices. The terms of the arrangements generally require customers to pay us within 30 days after the production month ends. As a result, if the customers were to default on their payment obligations to us, near-term earnings and cash flows would be adversely affected. However, due to the availability of other markets and pipeline connections, we do not believe that the loss of these customers or any other single customer would adversely affect our ability to market production. Our ability to market oil and natural gas from our wells depends upon numerous factors beyond our control, including:

• | the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas;


• | the proximity of the natural gas production to pipelines;


• | the availability of capacity in such pipelines;


• | the demand for oil and natural gas by utilities and other end users;


• | the availability of alternative fuel sources;


• | the effects of inclement weather;


• | state and federal regulation of oil and natural gas production; and


• | federal regulation of gas sold or transported in interstate commerce.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to market all of the oil or natural gas we produce or that favorable prices can be obtained for the oil and natural gas we produce.
A portion of the natural gas production that we operate in East Texas is committed to a minimum volumetric delivery contract with a third party pipeline company. Under the terms of the agreement, we are required to deliver 11.0 Bcfe of natural gas during the eighteen-month period from July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2018 and each of the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2019, 2020 and 2021, respectively. Based upon our projected drilling plans, current estimated proved developed reserves and production, we expect that this commitment will be met.
In view of the many uncertainties affecting the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and refined petroleum products, we are unable to predict future oil and natural gas prices and demand or the overall effect such prices and demand will have on the Company. During 2016, one customer accounted for 23%, one accounted for 17%, one accounted for 14% and one accounted for 10% of our oil and natural gas revenue. During 2015, one customer accounted for 21%, one accounted for 18%, one accounted 
#9#

for 17% and one accounted for 10% of our oil and natural gas revenue. During 2014, one customer accounted for 30%, one accounted for 24% and one accounted for 14% of our oil and natural gas revenue. These percentages do not consider the effects of commodity hedges. We do not believe that the loss of any of our oil or natural gas purchasers would have a material adverse effect on our operations due to the availability of other purchasers.

Leasehold Acreage
The following table shows our approximate developed and undeveloped (gross and net) leasehold acreage as of December 31, 2016:

 | Leasehold Acreage
 | Developed | Undeveloped
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net 
Kansas | — | | — | | 160 | 80 
Louisiana | 4,378 | | 1,550 | | 731 | 78 
Texas | 39,803 | | 20,860 | | 9,844 | 5,896

Total | 75,713 | | 45,608 | | 17,155 | 12,474

Leases covering 5% of our net undeveloped acreage are scheduled to expire in 2017, 9% in 2018, 5% in 2019 and 82% thereafter. At December 31, 2016, we do not have any PUD reserves attributed to acreage that has an expiration date preceding the scheduled date for initial development. Of the acreage subject to leases scheduled to expire during 2017, 84% relates to undeveloped acreage in the Carthage area in East Texas where we plan to drill eight to ten wells during 2017. 
Title to Properties
Title to properties is subject to contractual arrangements customary in the oil and gas industry, liens for taxes not yet due and, in some instances, other encumbrances. We believe that such burdens do not materially detract from the value of properties or from the respective interests therein or materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business.
As is customary in the industry, other than a preliminary review of local records, little investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisitions of undeveloped properties. Investigations, which generally include a title opinion of outside counsel, are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Our properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:

• | royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and gas leases;


• | overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;


• | a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles;


• | back-ins and reversionary interests existing under purchase agreements and leasehold assignments;


• | liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements; pooling, unitization and communitization agreements, declarations and orders; and


• | easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property.

To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the size and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our properties are conventional in the industry for properties of the kind that we own.
Federal Regulations
Sales and Transportation of Natural Gas. Historically, the transportation and sales for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulations. Effective January 1, 1993, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act deregulated the price for all “first sales” of natural gas. Thus, all of our sales of gas may be made at market prices, subject to applicable contract provisions. Sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of pipeline transportation. Since 1985, the FERC has implemented regulations intended to make natural gas transportation more accessible to gas buyers and sellers on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. We cannot predict what further action the FERC will take on these matters. Some of the FERC's more recent proposals may, however, adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation 
#13#

service on interstate pipelines. We do not believe that we will be affected by any action taken materially differently than other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
The Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (the “OCSLA”), which was administered by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (the “BOEMRE”) and, after October 1, 2011, its successors, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (the “BOEM”) the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (the “BSEE”), and the FERC, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the shelf provide open-access, non-discriminatory service. There are currently no regulations implemented by the FERC under its OCSLA authority on gatherers and other entities outside the reach of its NGA jurisdiction. Therefore, we do not believe that any FERC, BOEM or BSEE action taken under OCSLA will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.
Our natural gas sales are generally made at the prevailing market price at the time of sale. Therefore, even though we sell significant volumes to major purchasers, we believe that other purchasers would be willing to buy our natural gas at comparable market prices.
Natural gas continues to supply a significant portion of North America's energy needs and we believe the importance of natural gas in meeting this energy need will continue. The impact of the sudden drop in crude oil prices has not yet had a significant impact on gas prices, but a continued drop in crude oil prices could eventually impact gas markets. At this time, we are not in a position to predict the scope of any loss of market due to lower crude oil prices.
On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the “2005 EPA”) was signed into law. This comprehensive act contains many provisions that intended to encourage oil and gas exploration and development in the U.S. The 2005 EPA directs the FERC, BOEM and other federal agencies to issue regulations that will further the goals set out in the 2005 EPA. The 2005 EPA amends the NGA to make it unlawful for “any entity”, including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. On January 20, 2006, the FERC issued rules implementing this provision. The rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. It therefore reflects a significant expansion of the FERC's enforcement authority. To date, we do not believe we have been, nor do we anticipate we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.
In 2007, the FERC issued a final rule on annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”). Under Order 704, wholesale buyers and sellers of more than 2.2 million MMBtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines, natural gas gatherers, natural gas processors and natural gas marketers are now required to report, on May 1 of each year, beginning in 2009, aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. The monitoring and reporting required by these rules have increased our administrative costs. To date, we do not believe we have been, nor do we anticipate that we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.
Sales and Transportation of Crude Oil. The spot markets for oil, gas and natural gas liquids ("NGLs") are subject to volatility and supply and demand factors fluctuations. Our sales of crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated, and are subject to applicable contract provisions made at market prices and typically under short term agreements with third parties. Additionally, we may periodically enter into financial hedging arrangements or fixed-price contracts associated with a portion of our oil, gas or natural gas liquids production. In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to the FERC's jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act. In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes.
The regulation of pipelines that transport crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids is generally more light-handed than the FERC's regulation of gas pipelines under the NGA. Regulated pipelines that transport crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids are subject to common carrier obligations that generally ensure non-discriminatory access. With respect to interstate pipeline transportation subject to regulation of the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act, rates generally must be cost-based, although market-based rates or negotiated settlement rates are permitted in certain circumstances. Pursuant to FERC Order No. 561, pipeline rates are subject to an indexing methodology. Under this indexing methodology, pipeline rates are subject to changes in 
#14#

the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, minus one percent. A pipeline can seek to increase its rates above index levels provided that the pipeline can establish that there is a substantial divergence between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rate resulting from application of the index. A pipeline can seek to charge market based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power. In addition, a pipeline can establish rates pursuant to settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. A pipeline can seek to establish initial rates for new services through a cost-of-service proceeding, a market-based rate proceeding, or through an agreement between the pipeline and at least one shipper not affiliated with the pipeline.
Federal Leases. We maintain operations located on federal oil and natural gas leases, which are administered by the BOEM or the BSEE, pursuant to the OCSLA. The BOEM and the BSEE regulate offshore operations, including engineering and construction specifications for production facilities, safety procedures, plugging and abandonment of wells on the Gulf of Mexico shelf, and removal of facilities.
The BOEM handles offshore leasing, resource evaluation, review and administration of oil and gas exploration and development plans, renewable energy development, National Environmental Policy Act analysis and environmental studies, and the BSEE is responsible for the safety and enforcement functions of offshore oil and gas operations, including the development and enforcement of safety and environmental regulations, permitting of offshore exploration, development and production activities, inspections, offshore regulatory programs, oil spill response and newly formed training and environmental compliance programs. Our federal oil and natural gas leases are awarded based on competitive bidding and contain relatively standardized terms. These leases require compliance with detailed regulations and orders that are subject to interpretation and change by the BOEM or BSEE. We are currently subject to regulations governing the plugging and abandonment of wells located offshore and the installation and removal of all production facilities, structures and pipelines, and the BOEM or the BSEE may in the future amend these regulations. Please read “Risk Factors” beginning on page 20 for more information on new regulations.
To cover the various obligations of lessees on the Outer Continental Shelf (the “OCS”), the BOEM generally requires that lessees have substantial net worth or post bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be satisfied. While we have been exempt from such supplemental bonding requirements in the past, beginning in 2014 we were required to post supplemental bonding or alternate form of collateral for certain of our offshore properties. We have been able to satisfy the collateral requirements using a combination of our existing cash on hand and the issuance of supplemental bonds. Under some circumstances, the BOEM may require any of our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. As a result of certain bankruptcies of Gulf of Mexico operations, BSEE and BOEM are currently reassessing decommissioning liability and supplemental bonding requirements for all operations on the Gulf of Mexico OCS with respect to decommissioning wells and platforms in the Gulf of Mexico and are updating all decommissioning costs in the Gulf of Mexico. The Department of the Interior through the BOEM and BSEE has made enforcement of decommissioning liabilities one of its top priorities. Recent Department of Interior guidance has indicated that well abandonment and decommissioning requirements are not necessarily tied to lease termination. Based on the ongoing review of such decommissioning and abandonment costs, the Company’s potential liability for such costs has become more expensive and as a result supplemental bonding costs may continue to increase, which along with any future directives or changes to BOEM’s current supplemental bonding requirements, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, cash flows, and results of operations. Because we are not exempt from the BOEM’s supplemental bonding requirements, we engage a number of surety companies to post the requisite bonds. Pursuant to the terms of our agreements with these surety companies, we are required to post collateral at the outset of the agreement or subsequently on demand, the amount of which typically may be increased at the surety companies’ discretion. Two of our surety companies requested that we post collateral to support certain of the bonds that are issued on our behalf and to date, we have provided cash deposits totaling $6.2 million to satisfy these requests. We cannot assure you that we will be able to satisfy future demands for collateral for the requisite bonds or comply with new supplemental bonding requirements. If we fail to do so, we may be in default under the Multidraw Term Loan Agreement and potentially the indentures governing the 10% second-lien senior secured notes due 2021 (the" 2021 Notes") and the 10% second lien senior secured PIK notes due 2021 (the "2021 PIK Notes").
In addition, on July 14, 2016, the BOEM issued a notice to lessees ("NTL") No. 2016-N01 effective September 12, 2016 to clarify the procedures and criteria that the BOEM will use to determine if and when additional security is required for OCS leases. This notice may result in an increase to the amount of surety bonds or other security required to be posted by us pursuant to these updated BOEM financial assurance and risk management requirements. On January 6, 2017, the BOEM announced that it was extending the implementation timeline for NTL No. 2016-N01 by an additional six months as to leases, rights-of-way and rights of use and easement for which there are co-lessees and/or predecessors in interest, except in circumstances in which the BOEM determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder's decommissioning liabilities. All of our decommissioning liabilities as of the date hereof have co-lessees and/or predecessors in interest and are expected to be included in this extended implementation timeline. We can provide no assurance that we can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases given these new expenses and updated BOEM requirements or that we will have sufficient liquidity to support such supplemental bonding requirements. If we are unable to obtain the additional required bonds, assurances or the increased amount of required collateral as requested, the BOEM may require any of our operations on federal leases to be suspended, canceled or 
#15#

otherwise impose monetary penalties, and one or more of such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.
Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico can have a significant impact on oil and gas operations on the OCS. The effects from past hurricanes have included structural damage to pipelines, wells, fixed production facilities, semi-submersibles and jack-up drilling rigs. The BOEM and the BSEE will continue to be concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms. In an effort to reduce the potential for future damage, the BOEMRE historically issued guidance aimed at improving platform survivability by taking into account environmental and oceanic conditions in the design of platforms and related structures. It is possible that similar, if not more stringent, requirements will be issued by the BOEM or the BSEE for future hurricane seasons. New requirements, if any, could increase our operating costs due to future storms.
The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (the “ONRR”) in the U.S. Department of the Interior administers the collection of royalties under the terms of the OCSLA and the oil and natural gas leases issued thereunder. The amount of royalties due is based upon the terms of the oil and natural gas leases as well as the regulations promulgated by the ONRR.
Federal, State or American Indian Leases. In the event we conduct operations on federal, state or American Indian oil and gas leases, such operations must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions, including various nondiscrimination statutes, and certain of such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other appropriate permits issued by the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) or the BOEM or other appropriate federal or state agencies.
The Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (“Mineral Act”) prohibits direct or indirect ownership of any interest in federal onshore oil and gas leases by a foreign citizen of a country that denies “similar or like privileges” to citizens of the United States. Such restrictions on citizens of a “non-reciprocal” country include ownership of holding or controlling stock in a corporation that holds a federal onshore oil and gas lease. If this restriction is violated, the corporation's lease can be cancelled in a proceeding instituted by the United States Attorney General. Although the regulations of the BLM (which administers the Mineral Act) provide for agency designations of non-reciprocal countries, there are presently no such designations in effect. We own interests in numerous federal onshore oil and gas leases. It is possible that holders of our equity interests may be citizens of foreign countries, which at some time in the future might be determined to be non-reciprocal under the Mineral Act.
State Regulations
Most states regulate the production and sale of oil and natural gas, including:


• | requirements for obtaining drilling permits;


• | the method of developing new fields;


• | the spacing and operation of wells;


• | the prevention of waste of oil and gas resources; and


• | the plugging and abandonment of wells.

The rate of production may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from both oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis or both.
We may enter into agreements relating to the construction or operation of a pipeline system for the transportation of natural gas. To the extent that such gas is produced, transported and consumed wholly within one state, such operations may, in certain instances, be subject to the jurisdiction of such state’s administrative authority charged with the responsibility of regulating intrastate pipelines. In such event, the rates that we could charge for gas, the transportation of gas, and the construction and operation of such pipeline would be subject to the rules and regulations governing such matters, if any, of such administrative authority.
Legislative Proposals
In the past, Congress has been very active in the area of natural gas regulation. New legislative proposals in Congress and the various state legislatures, if enacted, could significantly affect the petroleum industry. At the present time it is impossible to predict what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, such proposals might have on our operations.
#16#

Environmental Regulations
General. Our activities are subject to existing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality and pollution control. Although no assurances can be made, we believe that, absent the occurrence of an extraordinary event, compliance with existing federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules regulating the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of human health, safety and the environment will not have a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position with respect to our existing assets and operations. We cannot predict what effect additional regulation or legislation, enforcement policies, and claims for damages to property, employees, other persons and the environment resulting from our operations could have on our activities.
Our activities with respect to exploration and production of oil and natural gas, including the drilling of wells and the operation and construction of pipelines and other facilities for extracting, transporting or storing natural gas and other petroleum products, are subject to stringent environmental regulation by state and federal authorities, including the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “USEPA”). Such regulation can increase the cost of planning, designing, installing and operating such facilities. Although we believe that compliance with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on us, risks of substantial costs and liabilities are inherent in oil and gas production operations, and there can be no assurance that significant costs and liabilities will not be incurred. Moreover it is possible that other developments, such as spills or other unanticipated releases, stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from oil and gas production, would result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.
Solid and Hazardous Waste.  We own or lease numerous properties that have been used for production of oil and gas for many years. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or solid wastes may have been disposed or released on or under these properties. In addition, many of these properties have been operated by third parties that controlled the treatment of hydrocarbons or solid wastes and the manner in which such substances may have been disposed or released. State and federal laws applicable to oil and gas wastes and properties have gradually become stricter over time. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators) or to perform remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination.
Wastes, including hazardous wastes, are subject to regulation under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and state statutes. Much of the waste we generate in our operations at exploration and production sites, including hazardous waste, is exempt from regulation under RCRA, but generally remains subject to state storage, treatment and disposal requirements. We also generate wastes not subject to the RCRA exemption. The USEPA has limited the disposal options for certain hazardous wastes. It is possible that certain wastes generated by our oil and gas operations which are currently exempt from regulation under RCRA as “hazardous wastes” may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes, and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements.
Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) are radioactive materials which precipitate on production equipment or area soils during oil and natural gas extraction or processing. NORM wastes are regulated under the RCRA framework, although such wastes may qualify for the oil and gas hazardous waste exclusion. Primary responsibility for NORM regulation has been a state function. Standards have been developed for worker protection; treatment, storage and disposal of NORM waste; management of waste piles, containers and tanks; and limitations upon the release of NORM-contaminated land for unrestricted use. We believe that our operations are in material compliance with all applicable NORM standards.
Superfund. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain persons with respect to the release or threatened release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a site and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances at a site. CERCLA also authorizes the USEPA and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible persons the costs of such action. State statutes impose similar liability.
Under CERCLA, the term “hazardous substance” does not include “petroleum, including crude oil or any fraction thereof,” unless specifically listed or designated and the term does not include natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas, or synthetic gas usable for fuel. While this “petroleum exclusion” lessens the significance of CERCLA to our operations, we may generate waste that may fall within CERCLA's definition of a “hazardous substance” in the course of our ordinary operations. We also currently own or lease properties that for many years have been used for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas. Although we and, to our knowledge, our predecessors have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, “hazardous substances” may have been disposed or released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us or on, under or from other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal. At this time, we do not believe that we have any liability associated with any Superfund site, and we have not been notified of any claim, liability or damages under CERCLA.
#17#

Endangered Species Act. Federal and state legislation including, in particular, the federal Endangered Species Act of 1973 (“ESA”), impose requirements to protect imperiled species from extinction by conserving and protecting threatened and endangered species and the habitat upon which they depend. With specified exceptions, the ESA prohibits the “taking,” including killing, harassing or harming, of any listed threatened or endangered species, as well as any degradation or destruction of its habitat. In addition, the ESA mandates that federal agencies carry out programs for conservation of listed species. Many state laws similarly protect threatened and endangered species and their habitat. We operate in areas in which listed species may be present. As a result, we may be required to adopt protective measures, obtain incidental take permits, and otherwise adjust our drilling plans to comply with ESA requirements.
Oil Pollution Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (the “OPA”) and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in United States waters. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of a facility or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. The OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of federal safety, construction or operating regulations. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by the OPA.
The OPA establishes a liability limit for onshore facilities of $633.8 million and for offshore facilities of all removal costs plus $133.65 million, and lesser limits for some vessels depending upon their size. The regulations promulgated under OPA impose proof of financial responsibility requirements that can be satisfied through insurance, guarantee, indemnity, surety bond, letter of credit, qualification as a self-insurer, or a combination thereof. The amount of financial responsibility required depends upon a variety of factors including the type of facility or vessel, its size, storage capacity, oil throughput, proximity to sensitive areas, type of oil handled, history of discharges and other factors. We carry insurance coverage to meet these obligations, which we believe is customary for comparable companies in our industry. A failure to comply with OPA's requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to civil or criminal enforcement actions.
As a result of the explosion and sinking of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, Congress considered but did not enact legislation that would eliminate the current cap on liability for damages and increase minimum levels of financial responsibility under OPA. If enacted, such legislation could increase our obligations and potential liability, but adoption of such legislation is uncertain. We are not aware of the occurrence of any action or event that would subject us to liability under OPA, and we believe that compliance with OPA's financial responsibility and other operating requirements will not have a material adverse effect on us.
Discharges. The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) regulates the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States, including wetlands, and requires a permit for the discharge of pollutants, including petroleum, to such waters. The CWA also requires a permit for the discharge of dredged or fill material into wetlands. A revised regulatory definition of “Waters of the United States” that would expand requirements for CWA permitting, has been promulgated, but these regulations have been stayed pending the outcome of judicial challenges. Certain facilities that store or otherwise handle oil are required to prepare and implement Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plans and Facility Response Plans relating to the possible discharge of oil to surface waters. We are required to prepare and comply with such plans and to obtain and comply with discharge permits. We believe we are in substantial compliance with these requirements and that any noncompliance would not have a material adverse effect on us. The CWA also prohibits spills of oil and hazardous substances to waters of the United States in excess of levels set by regulations and imposes liability in the event of a spill. State laws further provide civil and criminal penalties and liabilities for spills to both surface and groundwaters and require permits that set limits on discharges to such waters.
Hydraulic Fracturing. Our exploration and production activities may involve the use of hydraulic fracturing techniques to stimulate wells and maximize natural gas production. Citing concerns over the potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water, human health and the environment, and in response to a Congressional directive, the USEPA commissioned a study to identify potential risks associated with hydraulic fracturing and to improve scientific understanding to guide USEPA’s regulatory oversight, guidance and, where appropriate, rulemaking related to hydraulic fracturing. A final report for this study was released in December 2016 and provided information regarding potential vulnerability of drinking water resources to hydraulic fracturing, but did not reach conclusions regarding the frequency or severity of impacts due to data gaps and uncertainties. Some states now regulate utilization of hydraulic fracturing and others are in the process of developing, or are considering development of, such rules to address the potential for drinking water impacts, induced seismicity, and other concerns. In several localities and in New York, use of hydraulic fracturing has been banned, although local fracking bans are prohibited in Texas and Louisiana. These states currently address hydraulic fracturing concerns by requiring disclosures of the content of fluids used in the process. Our drilling activities could be subjected to new or enhanced federal, state and/or local requirements governing hydraulic fracturing.
Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to local, state and federal regulations for the control of emissions from sources of air pollution. Administrative enforcement actions for failure to comply strictly with air regulations or permits may be resolved 
#18#

by payment of monetary fines and correction of any identified deficiencies. Alternatively, regulatory agencies could impose civil or criminal liability for non-compliance. An agency could require us to forego construction or operation of certain air emission sources. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with air pollution control requirements.
According to certain scientific studies, emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide and other gases commonly known as greenhouse gases (“GHG”) may be contributing to global warming of the earth's atmosphere and to global climate change. In response to the scientific studies, legislative and regulatory initiatives have been underway to limit GHG emissions. The U.S. Supreme Court determined that GHG emissions fall within the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) definition of an “air pollutant”, and in response the USEPA promulgated an endangerment finding paving the way for regulation of GHG emissions under the CAA. The USEPA has also promulgated rules requiring large sources to report their GHG emissions. Sources subject to these reporting requirements include on- and offshore petroleum and natural gas production and onshore natural gas processing and distribution facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year in aggregate emissions from all site sources. We are not subject to GHG reporting requirements. In addition, the USEPA promulgated rules that significantly increase the GHG emission threshold that would identify major stationary sources of GHG subject to CAA permitting programs. As currently written and based on current Company operations, we are not subject to federal GHG permitting requirements. Regulation of GHG emissions is developing and highly controversial, and further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. Such developments may affect how these GHG initiatives will impact the Company. Due to the uncertainties surrounding the regulation of and other risks associated with GHG emissions, the Company cannot predict the financial impact of related developments on the Company. 
The USEPA has promulgated rules to limit air emissions from many hydraulically fractured natural gas wells. These regulations require use of equipment to capture gases that come from the well during the drilling process, mandate tighter standards for emissions associated with gas production, storage and transport, and seek to limit flaring. Such regulations have been highly controversial, have been challenged, and their future is uncertain. While such requirements would be expected to increase the cost of natural gas production, we do not anticipate that we will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas.
Coastal Coordination. There are various federal and state programs that regulate the conservation and development of coastal resources. The federal Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”) was passed to preserve and, where possible, restore the natural resources of the Nation's coastal zone. The CZMA provides for federal grants for state management programs that regulate land use, water use and coastal development.
The Louisiana Coastal Zone Management Program (“LCZMP”) was established to protect, develop and, where feasible, restore and enhance coastal resources of the state. Under the LCZMP, coastal use permits are required for certain activities, even if the activity only partially infringes on the coastal zone. Among other things, projects involving use of state lands and water bottoms, dredge or fill activities that intersect with more than one body of water, mineral activities, including the exploration and production of oil and gas, and pipelines for the gathering, transportation or transmission of oil, gas and other minerals require such permits. General permits, which entail a reduced administrative burden, are available for a number of routine oil and gas activities. The LCZMP and its requirement to obtain coastal use permits may result in additional permitting requirements and associated project schedule constraints.
The Texas Coastal Coordination Act (“CCA”) provides for coordination among local and state authorities to protect coastal resources through regulating land use, water, and coastal development and establishes the Texas Coastal Management Program that applies in the nineteen counties that border the Gulf of Mexico and its tidal bays. The CCA provides for the review of state and federal agency rules and agency actions for consistency with the goals and policies of the Coastal Management Plan. This review may affect agency permitting and may add a further regulatory layer to some of our projects.
OSHA. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the USEPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act, and similar state statutes require us to organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. Certain of this information must be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and local citizens.
Management believes that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations described above and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us.
Corporate Offices
Our headquarters are located in Lafayette, Louisiana, in approximately 46,600 square feet of leased space, with an exploration office in The Woodlands, Texas in approximately 13,100 square feet of leased space. We also maintain owned or leased field offices in the areas of the major fields in which we operate properties or have a significant interest. Replacement of any of our leased offices would not result in material expenditures by us as alternative locations to our leased space are anticipated to be readily available.
