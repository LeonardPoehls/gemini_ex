ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation
 
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (the Company), a bank holding company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida, is a Maryland corporation incorporated in 2007. Through our principal wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic Coast Bank (the Bank), we serve the Northeast Florida, Central Florida and Southeast Georgia markets.
 
The Company does not maintain offices separate from those of the Bank or utilize personnel other than certain of the Bank’s officers. Any officer that serves as a director of the Company is not separately compensated for his or her service as a director.
 
Atlantic Coast Bank
 
The Bank was established in 1939 as a credit union to serve the employees of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad. On November 1, 2000, after receiving the necessary regulatory and membership approvals, Atlantic Coast Federal Credit Union converted to a federal mutual savings bank (and subsequently a federally-chartered savings bank) known as Atlantic Coast Bank. The conversion allowed the Bank to diversify its customer base by marketing products and services to individuals and businesses in its market areas and make loans to customers who did not have a deposit relationship with the Bank. On December 27, 2016, the Bank consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to that of a Florida state-chartered commercial bank supervised by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (the OFR) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC).

The Bank has traditionally focused on attracting deposits and investing those funds primarily in loans, including commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences and home equity loans. Additionally, the Bank invests funds in multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans, and commercial and residential construction loans. The Bank also invests funds in investment securities, primarily those issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies or entities, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.
 
Revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and other interest-earning assets, such as investment securities. To a lesser extent, revenue is generated from service charges, gains on the sale of loans and other income.
 
The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms, which generally include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and money market, and time deposit accounts with terms ranging from three months to five years. Deposits are primarily solicited in the Bank’s market areas of the Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia to fund loan demand and other liquidity needs; however, the Bank also solicits deposits in Central Florida.
 
The Bank is headquartered at 4655 Salisbury Road, Suite 110, Jacksonville, Florida, 32256 and its telephone number is (800) 342-2824. Its website is www.AtlanticCoastBank.net. The Bank’s website is not incorporated into this Report.

Competition
 
The Bank is competitive in attracting deposits and originating real estate and other loans, but faces strong competition in both areas. Historically, most of the Bank’s direct competition for deposits has come from credit unions, community banks, large commercial banks, and thrift institutions within our primary market areas. There are more than 1,700 branches operating in the Bank’s markets, the majority of which are in the Jacksonville, Orlando and Tampa markets.
 
In recent years, competition also has come from institutions that largely deliver their services over the Internet. Internet banking has the competitive advantage of lower infrastructure costs. Particularly during times of extremely low or extremely high interest rates, the Bank has faced significant competition for customers’ funds from short-term money market securities and other corporate and government securities. During periods of increasing volatility in interest rates, competition for interest-bearing deposits increases as customers, particularly time-deposit customers, tend to move their accounts between competing businesses to obtain the highest rates in the market. The Bank competes for these deposits by offering convenient locations, superior service, competitive rates and attractive deposit products. An arrangement that gives all of our customers access to over 900 ATMs, at no charge, has proven to be a positive competitive advantage for the Bank. Additionally, the Bank’s “High Tide” deposit account is also a competitive advantage for the Bank, as it provides customers the ability to obtain refunds for ATM surcharges.
 
As of June 30, 2017 (the most recent date for which market share peer data is available), the Bank was ranked number 13 in Jacksonville deposit market share, holding $372 million, or less than 1% of total deposits in the area. As of June 30, 2017, the Bank had $20 million in deposits in Orlando and $2 million in Tampa. In Waycross, the Bank was ranked number two with 22% of the deposit market share, holding $199 million as of June 30, 2017. The Bank holds approximately 5% of total deposit market share in Douglas, with $38 million as of June 30, 2017.
 
Competition within our geographic markets also affects the Bank’s ability to obtain loans through origination or purchase and to originate loans at rates that provide an attractive yield. Competition for loans comes principally from mortgage bankers, commercial banks, national homebuilders, and credit unions. Internet-based lenders also have become a greater competitive factor in recent years. Such competition for the origination and purchase of loans may limit the Bank’s future growth and earnings potential. However, the Bank’s website should help the Bank’s competitiveness in the electronic banking arena.
 
Lending Activities
 
General
 
Historically, the Bank has originated portfolio one- to four-family residential first and second mortgage loans, home-equity loans, and commercial real estate loans and, to a lesser extent, commercial and residential construction loans, multi-family real estate loans, commercial business loans, and automobile and other consumer loans. We have not originated any land loans since 2008 except for those associated with the development of property for a residential or commercial end user. We have not and currently do not originate or purchase non-QM loans (i.e., loans that do not comply with “Qualified Mortgage” rules), or offer “teaser” rate loans (i.e., loans with low, temporary introductory rates). Our current strategy has been to expand commercial real estate, one- to four-family mortgage and warehouse lending.
 
The Bank originates commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans with small to mid-size businesses for the purposes of purchasing real estate and inventory, financing equipment, and providing working capital.

The Bank also originates warehouse lines of credit secured by one- to four-family residential loans originated by third party originators under purchase and assumption agreements (warehouse loans held-for-investment). Warehouse lending uses mortgage bankers to originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans for sale in the secondary market. The third-party originator sells the loans and servicing rights to investors in order to repay the outstanding balance on warehouse loans held-for-investment. The Bank earns interest until the loan is sold and typically earns fee income as well. Loans originated within the warehouse lending program generally have commitments to purchase from investors, are sold with no recourse, and are sold with servicing released to the investor. The weighted average number of days outstanding of warehouse loans held-for-investment was 10 days during 2017.
 
The Bank originates commercial loans through the Small Business Administration’s (SBA) 7(a) and 504 Programs, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) Business & Industry (B&I) Program. The SBA 7(a) loans are guaranteed by the SBA up to 75% of the loan amount up to a maximum guaranty cap of $3,750,000. The Bank typically, but not always, sells the guaranteed portion of the SBA 7(a) loans into the secondary market at a premium. The Bank earns a 1% servicing fee on the amount sold. These loans are non-recourse, other than for proof of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the lender. The Bank generally retains the unguaranteed portion of SBA 7(a) loans. In the 504 program, the Bank and the SBA are in different lien positions. The typical structure of an SBA 504 loan is that the Bank is in a first lien position at a 50% loan-to-value (LTV), and the SBA is in a second lien position at a 40% LTV. The remaining 10% is an equity investment from the borrower. USDA B&I loans are guaranteed on a scaled basis from 60% to 80% based on the size of the originated loan. The Bank typically, but not always, sells the guaranteed portion of the B&I loans on the secondary market at a premium. The Bank retains servicing for the B&I loan, but only earns a servicing fee on the portion that is sold. The servicing fees are determined by the secondary market, and range from 0.25% to 1%. These loans are non-recourse, other than for proof of fraud or misrepresentation on the part of the lender. The Bank generally retains the unguaranteed portion of the USDA B&I loans.
 
At December 31, 2017, the net loan portfolio totaled $757.5 million, which constituted 77.0% of total assets. Loans carry either a fixed or adjustable rate of interest. Mortgage loans have a longer-term amortization, with maturities generally up to 30 years, with principal and interest due each month. Commercial real estate loans, commercial and industrial loans, commercial construction loans, and multi-family real estate loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans.
 
Consumer loans are generally shorter in term and amortize monthly or have interest payable monthly. Warehouse loans held-for-investment are underwritten and funded on an individual loan basis. A percentage of loans are randomly selected for advanced quality control or a third-party fraud-risk analysis report in addition to the standard underwriting process. SBA loans are underwritten in accordance with SBA guidelines and the Bank’s commercial credit policy.
 
At December 31, 2017, the maximum amount we could have loaned to any one borrower and related entities under applicable regulations was approximately $13.7 million, a 15% limit for unsecured loans, and $22.9 million, a 25% limit for amply and entirely secured loans. At December 31, 2017, there were no portfolio loans or group of portfolio loans to related borrowers with outstanding balances in excess of either of these amounts.

One- to Four-Family Real Estate Portfolio Lending
 
As of December 31, 2017, one- to four-family residential mortgage loans totaled $286.7 million, or 37.8% of gross portfolio loans. Generally, one- to four-family residential loans are underwritten based on the applicant’s employment, income, credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. The Bank underwrites all loans on a fully indexed, fully amortizing basis. The Bank will generally lend up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price for one- to four-family residential loans. Should a loan be granted with a loan-to-value ratio in excess of 80%, private mortgage insurance would be required to reduce overall exposure to below 80%. Such collateral requirements are intended to protect the Bank from loss in the event of foreclosure.
 
Properties securing one- to four-family residential mortgage loans are appraised by independent fee appraisers. Borrowers are required to obtain title and hazard insurance, and flood insurance, if necessary, in an amount not less than the value of the property improvements. Management’s pricing strategy for one- to four-family mortgage loans includes setting interest rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions and consistent with the Bank’s internal needs. Adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) loans are tied to a variety of indices, including rates based on U.S. Treasury securities. The majority of ARM loans carry an initial fixed rate of interest for between three and seven years, which then converts to an interest rate that is adjusted based upon the applicable index and in accordance with the promissory note. As of December 31, 2017, the total amount of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans allowing for interest only payments totaled $1.4 million, or 0.5% of the total one- to four-family mortgage loan portfolio, and 0.2% of the total portfolio loans. We do not currently originate or purchase interest-only one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and discontinued such activity in December 2007.
 
The Bank’s home mortgages are structured with five to 30-year maturities and with amortizations up to 30 years. The majority of the one- to four-family mortgage loans originated are secured by properties located in Northeast Florida, Central Florida and Southeast Georgia. During 2008 and continuing through and including 2017, the Bank implemented stricter underwriting guidelines related to the origination of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans secured by investment property.

All residential real estate loans contain a “due on sale” clause allowing the Bank to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the underlying property that serves as collateral for the loan, subject to certain laws. Loans originated or purchased are generally underwritten and documented pursuant to Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae guidelines.
 
The Bank also originates investor loans for one- to four-family properties, and the majority of our lending activity has focused on owner-occupied property. We have not in the past, nor do we currently, originate sub-prime loans, option-ARM loans, or other similar loans. We do not currently originate non-QM loans for the Bank’s loan portfolio.
 
Multi-Family Loans
 
As of December 31, 2017, multi-family residential loans totaled $65.4 million, or 8.6% of gross portfolio loans. The majority of the loans are to borrowers who are experienced, in-market real estate investors, and are secured by properties located in New York, New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The majority of the loans were purchased in two separate transactions during 2015; however, the Bank also began originating multi-family residential loans in 2017. The underwriting for multi-family residential loans is based on the cash flow of the property and includes underwriting stresses for interest rate increases and a rise in cap rates. Multi-family residential loans are generally originated with adjustable interest rates based on the prime rate, U.S. Treasury securities, or regional Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) indices. Loan-to-value ratios on multi-family residential loans do not exceed 75% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. These loans require monthly payments, amortize up to 30 years, and generally have maturities of up to 10 years and may carry pre-payment penalties.
 
The net operating income must be sufficient to cover the payments related to the outstanding debt. Assignments of rents and leases are required in order for us to be assured the cash flow from the project will be used to repay the debt. Appraisals on properties securing multi-family residential loans are performed by independent, state-licensed fee appraisers. Payments on loans secured by multi-family real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties and, as such, repayment of these loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. If the cash flow from the project is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
 
Commercial Real Estate Lending
 
The Bank offers commercial real estate loans for both permanent financing and construction/mini-perm financing. Our current strategy has been to focus primarily on permanent financing for owner occupied businesses and income producing properties. These loans are typically secured by single tenant or small retail establishments, office buildings, or other income producing properties located in the Bank’s primary market areas. As of December 31, 2017, permanent commercial real estate loans totaled $220.3 million, or 29.0% of gross portfolio loans.
 
The Bank originates both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate commercial real estate loans. The interest rate on adjustable-rate loans is tied to a variety of indices, including rates based on the prime rate, LIBOR, and U.S. Treasury securities. The majority of the Bank’s adjustable-rate loans carry an initial fixed-rate of interest, for either five, seven or ten years, and then convert to an interest rate that is adjusted based upon the current index rate for another period up to ten years. Loan-to-value ratios on commercial real estate loans generally do not exceed 80% of the appraised value of the property securing the loan. These loans require monthly payments, amortize up to 25 years, and generally have maturities of up to 10 years and may carry pre-payment penalties.

Loans secured by commercial real estate are underwritten based on the cash flow of the borrower or income producing potential of the property and the financial strength of the borrower and guarantors. Loan guarantees are generally obtained from financially capable parties based on a review of personal financial statements. The Bank generally requires commercial real estate borrowers with aggregate balances in excess of $500,000 to submit financial statements, including rent rolls if applicable, annually. The net operating income, which is the income derived from the operation of the property less all operating expenses, must be sufficient to cover the payments related to the outstanding debt. The Bank generally requires an income-to-debt service ratio of 1.25 times debt. Additionally, the Bank considers interest and cap rate stresses to account for the potential of rising interest rates and the effect on the borrower’s ability to repay and valuation of the collateral. Assignments of rents and leases are required in order for us to be assured the cash flow from the project will be used to repay the debt. Appraisals on properties securing commercial real estate loans are performed by independent, state-licensed fee appraisers. The majority of the properties securing commercial real estate loans are located in the Bank’s market areas.
 
Loans secured by commercial real estate properties are generally larger and involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation and management of the owner’s business or successful management of the property, repayment of such loans may be subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. If the cash flow from the project or business is reduced, or if leases are not obtained or renewed, the borrower’s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.
 
Land Loans
 
As of December 31, 2017, land loans totaled $13.8 million, or 1.8% of gross portfolio loans. In an effort to prevent potential exposure to additional credit risk, the Bank no longer originates new land loans unless the borrower is acquiring the land as part of the development of a property for individual residential or commercial use. Generally, these loans carry a higher rate of interest than permanent residential loans. The Bank generally assesses the borrower’s ability to repay, credit history, appraised value of the subject property, and the intended end use of the property to underwrite land loans.
 
Loans secured by land generally involve a greater degree of credit risk than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and commercial real estate loans.
 
Real Estate Construction Lending
 
As of December 31, 2017, real estate construction loans totaled $25.9 million, or 3.4% of gross portfolio loans. The real estate construction portfolio consists of both residential and commercial construction loans. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had residential construction loans totaling $8.6 million, or 1.1% of gross portfolio loans, and commercial construction loans totaling $17.3 million, or 2.3% of gross portfolio loans.
 
Residential construction loans are generally made to individual borrowers for the construction of a personal residence. Generally, construction loans are limited to a loan to value ratio not to exceed 80% based on the lesser of construction costs or the appraised value of the property upon completion. The Bank originates only residential construction loans to individual borrowers whose intent is to occupy the house upon completion.
 
Commercial construction loans are generally made for the construction of commercial, owner-occupied properties and investment income producing properties with tenant leases in place at closing with rents commencing upon completion of construction. These loans are limited to a loan to value not to exceed 80% based on the lesser of construction costs or the appraised value of the property upon completion, and are underwritten based on the owner’s anticipated cash flow or the lease income from tenants.
 
Home-Equity Lending
 
The Bank generally originates fixed-term, fully amortizing home equity loans and home equity lines of credit. At December 31, 2017, the home equity portfolio totaled $34.5 million, or 4.5%, of gross portfolio loans. Due to the decline of both real estate values in our market areas and the increased risk inherent with second lien real estate financing, the Bank ceased originating home equity lines of credit in January 2009, but began originating home equity lines of credit again in 2014 under stricter credit criteria. The Bank generally underwrites one- to four-family home equity loans and lines of credit based on the applicant’s employment and credit history and the appraised value of the subject property. Presently, the Bank will lend up to 80% of the appraised value less any prior liens. In limited circumstances, the Bank may lend up to 90% of the appraised value less any prior liens. This ratio may be reduced in accordance with internal guidelines given the risk and credit profile of the borrower. Properties securing one- to four-family mortgage loans are generally appraised by independent fee appraisers. The Bank requires a title search and hazard insurance, and flood insurance, if necessary, in an amount not less than the value of the property improvements. Currently, home equity loans are retained in our loan portfolio.

The Bank’s home equity lines of credit carry an adjustable interest rate based upon the prime rate of interest and generally have an interest rate floor. As of December 31, 2017, interest only lines of credit totaled $9.9 million, or 28.8% of the total home equity loan portfolio, and 3.1% of total loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential property. All home equity lines of credit have a maximum draw period of 10 years with a repayment period of up to 20 years following such draw period depending on the outstanding balance.
 
Consumer Loans
 
The Bank currently offers a variety of consumer loans, primarily manufactured home loans, automobile loans and unsecured loans. At December 31, 2017, consumer loans totaled $34.7 million, or 4.6% of gross portfolio loans.
 
The most significant component of the Bank’s consumer loan portfolio consists of manufactured home loans originated primarily through an on-site financing broker after being underwritten by the Bank. Loans secured by manufactured homes totaled $21.0 million, or 2.8% of gross portfolio loans as of December 31, 2017. Manufactured home loans have a fixed rate of interest and may carry terms up to 25 years. Down payments are required, and the amounts are based on several factors, including the borrower’s credit history. The Bank has not originated manufactured home loans since early in 2011, and does not intend to originate such loans in the future.
 
Another significant component of our consumer loan portfolio consists of automobile loans. The loans are originated primarily through our branch network and are underwritten by Atlantic Coast Bank. Loans secured by automobiles totaled $5.3 million, or 0.7% of gross portfolio loans as of December 31, 2017. Automobile loans have a fixed rate of interest and may carry terms up to six years. Down payments are required, and the amounts are based on several factors, including the borrower’s credit history.
 
Consumer loans, except for those secured by manufactured homes, have shorter terms to maturity and are principally fixed rate, thereby reducing exposure to changes in interest rates, and carry higher rates of interest than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. Consumer loans have an inherently greater risk of loss because they are predominantly secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as automobiles or manufactured homes. In these cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance. As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability, and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
 
Commercial Business Lending
 
The Bank also offers commercial business loans that may be secured by assets other than real estate. At December 31, 2017, commercial business loans totaled $78.5 million, or 10.3% of gross portfolio loans. The purpose of these loans is to provide working capital, inventory financing, or equipment financing. Generally, working capital and inventory loans carry a floating rate of interest based on the prime rate plus a margin and mature annually. Loans to finance equipment generally carry a fixed rate of interest and terms of up to seven years. The collateral securing these types of loans is other business assets such as inventory, accounts receivable, and equipment. Once a loan is in the portfolio, the credit department monitors based on loan size, payment status, and borrower risk rating. Relationships with aggregate exposure of $500,000 or greater and lines of credit (regardless of amount) are required to submit financial statements annually. The Bank reviews the performance of these companies and affirms or changes their risk rating accordingly. Loans with borrowers whose risk ratings are classified as monitor or special mention are reviewed and documented quarterly and those rated substandard are reviewed monthly. Loans that become past due 30 days or more are monitored daily and borrower risk ratings are adjusted accordingly. Commercial business loans generally have higher interest rates than other loans in our portfolio because they have a higher risk of default since their repayment generally depends on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the sufficiency of any collateral. In addition, the Bank originates commercial loans through the 7(a) Program and the 504 Program of the SBA, as well as the B&I Program of the USDA.

Loan Originations, Purchases, and Sales 
 
The Bank originates portfolio loans through its branch network, its lending offices, and its call center. Referrals from current customers, advertisements, real estate brokers, mortgage loan brokers and builders are also important sources of loan originations. While the Bank originates both adjustable-rate loans and fixed-rate loans, origination volume is dependent upon customer loan demand within the Bank’s market areas. Demand is affected by local competition, the real estate market and the interest rate environment.
 
The Bank shut down its internal mortgage origination division in 2012, and moved to a referral model to originate mortgages. However, with the success of the Company’s capital raise in December 2013, the Bank reentered the business of originating one- to four-family residential loans for investment and sale, and intends to continue originating such loans in the future. Additionally, the Company has two mortgage loan production offices, with one in Florida and one in Georgia.
 
Prior to 2008, the Bank occasionally purchased pools of residential loans originated by other banks when organic growth was not sufficient. These loan purchases were made based on the Bank’s underwriting standards, such as loan-to-value ratios and borrower credit scores. The Bank ceased purchasing pools of loans between 2008 and 2012. However, during 2013, the Bank reentered the business of purchasing pools of residential loans originated by other banks, and intends to continue purchasing such loans to supplement organic growth. The Bank had limited purchase activity during the year ended December 31, 2017. The Bank may purchase pooled loans secured by properties located in areas other than the Bank’s market areas.
 
Similarly, prior to 2008, the Bank also participated in commercial real estate loans originated by other banks. These participation loans were subject to the Bank’s usual underwriting standards as described above applicable to this type of loan. The Bank had not participated in a commercial real estate loan originated by another bank from mid-2007 through 2015. However, during 2016, the Bank reentered the business of participating in commercial real estate loans originated by other banks, and intends to continue participating in such loans in the future.
 
From time-to-time, the Bank may sell performing residential loans from our portfolio to enhance liquidity or to appropriately manage interest rate risk. The Bank has also utilized the services of a national loan sale advisor to sell nonperforming residential mortgage loans in the past.
 
Loans Held-for-Sale
 
Beginning in 2008 and continuing into 2012, the Bank regularly sold originated, conforming one- to four-family residential loans, both fixed rate and adjustable rate, including the related servicing, to other financial institutions in the secondary market for favorable fees. The Bank had not originated residential loans to be held-for-sale from mid-2012 through 2013, but began originating such loans again early in 2014.
 
Beginning in 2010, the Bank began to sell the guaranteed portion of the internally originated SBA 7(a) loans to investors, while maintaining the servicing rights. Additionally, beginning in 2016, the Bank began to sell the guaranteed portion of the internally originated USDA B&I loans to investors, while maintaining the servicing rights. The Bank intends to continue originating such loans for the foreseeable future.
 
Warehouse Loans Held-for-Investment
 
Beginning in 2010, the Bank began to originate warehouse loans held-for-investment and permit third-party originators to sell the loans and servicing rights to investors in order to repay the warehouse balance outstanding. The Bank intends to continue originating such loans for the foreseeable future.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority 
 
Lending authority per credit officer ranges from $100,000 to $1.0 million based on the individual credit officer’s lending and loan underwriting experience. Loans which exceed an individual credit officer’s lending authority may be approved using the combined authority of another credit officer on loan amounts up to and including $1.0 million. Loans exceeding $1.0 million must be approved by our management loan committee.
Nonperforming and Problem Assets
 
General
 
When a borrower fails to make a timely payment on a loan, contact is made initially in the form of a reminder letter sent at either 10 or 15 days after the payment due date depending on the terms of the loan agreement. If a response is not received within a reasonable period of time, contact by telephone is made in an attempt to determine the reason for the delinquency and to request payment of the delinquent amount in full or to establish an acceptable repayment plan to bring the loan current.
 
Modifications are considered at the request of the borrower or upon the Bank’s determination that a modification of terms may be beneficial to the Bank. Generally, the borrower and any guarantors must provide current financial information and communicate to the Bank the underlying cause of their financial hardship and expectations for the near future. The Bank must then verify the hardship and structure a modification that addresses the situation accordingly.
 
If the borrower is unable to make or keep payment arrangements, additional collection action is taken in the form of repossession of collateral for secured, non-real estate loans and small claims or legal action for unsecured loans. If the loan is secured by real estate, a letter of intent to foreclose is sent to the borrower when an agreement for an acceptable repayment plan cannot be established or agreed upon. The letter of intent to foreclose allows the borrower up to 30 days to bring the account current. Once the loan becomes delinquent and an acceptable repayment plan has not been established, a foreclosure action is initiated on the loan.
 
Delinquent Loans
 
Total portfolio loans past due 60 days or more totaled $8.1 million, or 1.1% of total portfolio loans at December 31, 2017. Real estate loans 60 days or more past due totaled $7.0 million, or 0.9% of total loans at December 31, 2017. There were no construction loans 60 days or more past due at December 31, 2017. Other portfolio loans (consisting of home equity, consumer, and commercial non-real estate) 60 days or more past due totaled $1.1 million, or 0.1% of total loans at December 31, 2017.
Nonperforming Assets
 
Nonperforming assets consist of nonperforming portfolio loans, accruing portfolio loans past due 90 days or more, and foreclosed assets. Loans to a customer whose financial condition has deteriorated are considered for nonperforming status whether or not the loan is 90 days and over past due. Generally, all loans past due 90 days or more are classified as nonperforming. For portfolio loans classified as nonperforming, interest income is not recognized until actually collected. At the time the loan is placed on nonperforming status, interest previously accrued, but not collected, is reversed and charged against current income.

At December 31, 2017, the Bank had $7.8 million in nonperforming portfolio loans, or 1.0% of total portfolio loans. Our largest nonperforming portfolio loan at December 31, 2017 was a $5.5 million nonperforming land loan.
 
Real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure is classified as other real estate owned (OREO). At the time of foreclosure or repossession, the property is recorded at estimated fair value less selling costs, with any write-down charged against the allowance for portfolio loan losses. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank had OREO of $1.7 million.

Portfolio loans for which terms have been modified as a result of the borrower's financial difficulties are considered troubled debt restructurings (TDR). Portfolio loans modified as TDRs with market rates of interest are classified as impaired portfolio loans. Once the TDR loan has performed for 12 months in accordance with the modified terms, it is classified as a performing impaired loan. TDRs which do not perform in accordance with modified terms are reported as nonperforming portfolio loans, and as of December 31, 2017, such portfolio loans totaled $5.9 million and included the previously mentioned land loan.
 
Classified Assets
 
Banking regulations provide for the classification of portfolio loans and other assets, such as OREO, debt and equity securities considered by the Bank and regulators to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered not collectable and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a full specific loss reserve is not warranted. Those assets classified as “loss” are generally charged-off.
 
When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances for portfolio loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management and reviewed by its board of directors. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the inherent risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount. The Bank’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the OFR and the FDIC, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances.
 
In connection with the filing of the Bank’s regulatory reports with the OFR and in accordance with its classification of assets policy, management regularly reviews the problem assets in the portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. The total amount of classified assets (consisting primarily of portfolio loans secured by real estate and OREO) represented 13.7% of the Bank‘s equity capital and 1.3% of the Bank’s total assets at December 31, 2017.
 
There were no portfolio loans classified doubtful or loss at December 31, 2017. Assets classified substandard were $12.4 million at December 31, 2017. The Bank also designates certain portfolio loans as special mention when it is determined a loan relationship should be monitored more closely. Portfolio loans are classified as special mention for a variety of reasons including changes in recent borrower financial condition, changes in borrower operations, changes in value of available collateral, concerns regarding changes in economic conditions in a borrower’s industry, and other matters. A portfolio loan classified as special mention in many instances may be performing in accordance with the loan terms. Special mention portfolio loans were $1.2 million at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, $7.7 million of classified portfolio loans were on nonperforming status.
 
Allowance for Portfolio Loan Losses
 
An allowance for portfolio loan losses (the allowance) is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio and is established as these losses are recognized through a provision for portfolio loan losses (provision expense) charged to earnings. Generally, portfolio loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the loan balance is not fully collectible. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance.

At December 31, 2017, the allowance was $8.6 million, or 1.1% of total portfolio loans and 110.4% of total nonperforming portfolio loans. The following table sets forth activity in the Bank’s allowance for the years indicated:

The reasonableness of the allowance is established and reviewed by management, within the context of applicable accounting and regulatory guidelines, based upon its evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions affecting the Bank’s key lending areas. Senior credit officers monitor those conditions continuously and reviews are conducted quarterly with the Bank’s senior management and Board of Directors. Management’s methodology for assessing the reasonableness of the allowance consists of several key elements, which include a general loss component by type of portfolio loan and specific allowances for identified problem portfolio loans. The allowance also incorporates the results of measuring impaired portfolio loans. Furthermore, the allowance allocated to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.
 
Investment Activities
 
General
 
The Bank maintains an amount of liquid assets, such as cash and short-term securities, for the purposes of meeting operational needs. The Bank is permitted to make certain other securities investments. Cash flow projections are regularly reviewed and updated to assure that adequate liquidity is provided.
 
The Bank is authorized to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies and government sponsored enterprises, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers’ acceptances, repurchase agreements and federal funds. Subject to various restrictions, Florida-state chartered banks may also invest their assets in investment grade commercial paper and corporate debt securities and mutual funds.
 
The Bank’s Board of Directors has adopted an investment policy which governs the nature and extent of investment activities, and the responsibilities of management and the Board of Directors. Investment activities are directed by the Chief Financial Officer in coordination with the Bank’s Asset and Liability Committee (ALCO). Various factors are considered when making decisions, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment. The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated short and long term interest rates, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds through deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases.
 
The structure of the investment portfolio is intended to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and maximize earnings while managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.
 
Investment Securities
 
The Bank invests in investment securities, such as U.S. government sponsored enterprises and state and municipal obligations, as part of its asset liability management strategy.
 
Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) require that investments be categorized as “held-to-maturity,” “trading securities” or “available-for-sale,” based on management’s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. Securities are classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost when management has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity. Securities are classified as available-for-sale when they might be sold before maturity.
 
At December 31, 2017, $37.7 million of investment securities, representing the entire balance in investment securities, were classified as available-for-sale. The Bank held no non-agency collateralized mortgage-backed securities or non-agency collateralized mortgage obligations, as of December 31, 2017.

Management evaluates investment securities for other-than-temporary impairment (OTTI) at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. In determining OTTI, management considers many factors, including: (1) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost, (2) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, (3) whether the market decline was affected by macroeconomic conditions, and (4) whether the Company has the intent to sell the debt security or more likely than not will be required to sell the debt security before its anticipated recovery. The assessment of whether other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at the determination date.
 
When OTTI is determined to have occurred, the amount of the OTTI recognized in earnings depends on whether we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss. If we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, less any current-period credit loss, the OTTI recognized in earnings is equal to the entire difference between its amortized cost basis and its fair value at the balance sheet date. If we do not intend to sell the security and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis less any current-period loss, the OTTI is separated into the amount representing the credit loss and the amount related to all other factors. The amount of the total related to the credit loss is determined based on the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is recognized as a charge to earnings. The amount of the OTTI related to other factors is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the investment.

Sources of Funds
 
General
 
The Bank’s sources of funds are deposits, payment of principal and interest on loans, interest earned on or maturation of investment securities, borrowings, and funds provided from operations.
Deposits
 
The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts to consumers and businesses with a wide range of interest rates and terms. Deposits consist of noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and money market, and time deposit accounts. The Bank relies primarily on competitive pricing policies, customer service and marketing to attract and retain these deposits. Additionally, the Bank has purchased time deposit accounts from brokers at costs and terms which are comparable or better to time deposits originated in the Bank’s branch offices. The Bank had $74.9 million in brokered deposits at December 31, 2017, of which approximately $38.7 million is included in money market accounts and approximately $36.0 million is included in time deposits.

The variety of deposit accounts offered has allowed the Bank to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand. Pricing of deposits are managed to be consistent with overall asset and liability management, liquidity and growth objectives. Management considers numerous factors including: (1) the need for funds based on loan demand, current maturities of deposits, and other cash flow needs; (2) rates offered by market area competitors for similar deposit products; (3) current cost of funds and yields on assets; and (4) the alternative cost of funds on a wholesale basis, in particular the cost of advances from the FHLB and short-term borrowings from securities sold under agreements to repurchase (repurchase agreements). Interest rates are reviewed regularly by senior management as a part of its asset and liability management. Based on historical experience, management believes the Bank’s deposits are a relatively stable source of funds.

Federal Home Loan Bank Advances
 
Although deposits are the primary source of funds, the Bank may utilize borrowings when it is a less costly source of funds, and can be invested at a positive interest rate spread, when additional capacity is required to fund loan demand or when the borrowings meet asset and liability management goals. Borrowings have historically consisted primarily of advances from the FHLB; however, the Bank also has the ability to borrow from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta under the Primary Credit program and daylight overdraft capacity.
 
FHLB advances may be obtained upon the security of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. These advances may be obtained pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities, and call features.
 
The Bank’s remaining borrowing capacity with the FHLB was $63.3 million at December 31, 2017. The FHLB requires that the Bank collateralize the excess of the fair value of the FHLB advances over the book value with cash and investment securities. In the event the Bank prepays advances prior to maturity, it must do so at the fair value of such FHLB advances. As of December 31, 2017, fair value exceeded the book value of the individual advances by $0.4 million, which was collateralized by portfolio loans. The Bank has the ability to supplement its loan collateral with investment securities as needed to secure the FHLB borrowings or prepay advances to reduce the amount of collateral required to secure the debt. Unpledged investment securities available for collateral amounted to $34.1 million as of December 31, 2017.

Supervision and Regulation
 
General
 
The U.S. banking industry is highly regulated under federal and state law. These regulations affect the operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, including the Bank. Investors should understand that the primary objectives of the U.S. bank regulatory regime are the protection of depositors and consumers and maintaining the stability of the U.S. financial system, and not the protection of stockholders.

As a bank holding company, the Company is subject to supervision and regulation by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the FRB). The Company is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) under the federal securities laws.
 
As of December 27, 2016, the Bank is a Florida state-chartered commercial bank, subject to supervision and regulation by the FDIC and the OFR. Prior to December 27, 2016, the Bank was a federally-chartered federal savings bank, subject to the supervision and regulation by the Office of Comptroller Currency (the OCC). Some of the Bank’s retail operations are also subject to supervision and regulation by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB).
 
The aforementioned regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which an institution may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the FDIC’s deposit insurance fund and depositors. Under this system of federal and state regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. Following completion of its examination, the applicable federal agency critiques the institution’s operations and assigns its rating (known as an institution’s CAMELS rating). Under federal law, an institution may not disclose its CAMELS rating to the public.
 
Set forth below is a brief description of the bank regulatory framework that is or will be applicable to the Company and the Bank. This description is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to the Company. Banking statutes, regulations and policies are continually under review by Congress and state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies, including changes in how they are interpreted or implemented, could have a material adverse impact on the Company or its subsidiaries (including the Bank) and their respective operations. In addition to laws and regulations, state and federal bank regulatory agencies (including the FRB, the FDIC, the OCC and the OFR) may issue policy statements, interpretive letters and similar written guidance applicable to the Company and its subsidiaries (including the Bank). These issuances also may affect the conduct of the Company’s business or impose additional regulatory obligations. The brief description below is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, policies, interpretive letters and other written guidance that are described.
 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) has had and will continue to have a broad impact on the financial services industry, imposing significant regulatory and compliance changes, including a fundamental restructuring of the supervisory regime applicable to federal savings banks and bank holding companies, the imposition of increased capital, leverage and liquidity requirements, and numerous other provisions designed to improve supervision and oversight of, and strengthen safety and soundness within, the financial services sector. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act established a new framework of authority to conduct systemic risk oversight within the financial system distributed among new and existing federal regulatory agencies, including the Financial Stability Oversight Council, or Oversight Council, the FRB and the FDIC.
 
Many of the requirements called for in the Dodd-Frank Act remain subject to final rulemaking or phase-in over time. Given the uncertainty associated with the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act, the full extent of the impact such requirements will have on our operations continues to be unclear. The changes resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make any changes necessary to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements. Failure to comply with the new requirements may negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. While we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us, these changes could be materially adverse to our investors.

The following items provide a brief description of the relevant provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and their potential impact on the Company’s operations and activities, both currently and prospectively.
 
Creation of New Governmental Agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act creates various new governmental agencies such as the Financial Stability Oversight Council and the CFPB. The CFPB has a broad mandate to issue regulations, examine compliance and take enforcement action under the federal consumer financial laws, including with respect to the Company. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act permits states to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are stricter than those regulations promulgated by the CFPB, and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection rules adopted by the CFPB against certain institutions.
Mortgage Loan Origination and Risk Retention. The Dodd-Frank Act contains additional regulatory requirements that may affect our mortgage origination and servicing operations, result in increased compliance costs and may impact revenue. For example, in addition to numerous new disclosure requirements, the Dodd-Frank Act imposes new standards for mortgage loan originations on all lenders, including state-chartered banks. Most significantly, the new standards prohibit the Bank from originating a residential mortgage loan without verifying a borrower's ability to repay, limit the total points and fees that the Bank and/or a broker may charge on conforming and jumbo loans to 3% of the total loan amount and prohibit certain prepayment penalty practices. Also, the Dodd-Frank Act, in conjunction with the FRB's final rule on loan originator prohibits certain compensation payments to loan originators and the steering of consumers to loans not in their interest because the loans will result in greater compensation for a loan originator. These standards will result in a myriad of new system, pricing and compensation controls in order to ensure compliance and to decrease repurchase requests and foreclosure defenses. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act generally requires lenders or securitizers to retain an economic interest in the credit risk relating to loans the lender sells and other asset-backed securities that the securitizer issues if the loans have not complied with the ability to repay standards. The risk retention requirement generally will be 5%, but could be increased or decreased by regulation.
FDIC Insurance Assessments. The Dodd-Frank Act also broadened the base for FDIC insurance assessments. Assessments are now based on the average consolidated total assets less tangible equity capital of a financial institution. The Dodd-Frank Act also permanently increased the maximum amount of deposit insurance for banks, savings institutions and credit unions to $250,000 per depositor.
Corporate Governance and Executive Compensation. The Dodd-Frank Act requires companies to give stockholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation and change-in-control payments. The legislation also directs the FRB to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to bank holding company executives, regardless of whether the company is publicly traded or not.
Delayed, Phased-in Implementation. As noted above, many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act involve delayed effective dates and/or require implementing regulations. Accordingly, it will be some time before management can assess the full impact on operations. However, the Dodd-Frank Act has already resulted in an increased regulatory burden and compliance, operating and interest expense for the Company and its subsidiaries (including the Bank).
Federal Banking Regulation 
 
Business Activities. A Florida state-chartered commercial bank derives its lending and investment powers from the laws and the regulations enforced and administered by the FDIC and the OFR. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and nonresidential real estate, commercial business loans and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Bank also may establish subsidiaries that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for the Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage.
Capital Requirements. In accordance with Dodd-Frank, the FRB and the FDIC adopted new capital requirements for depository institutions, which would be phased in from 2015 to 2019, and would refine the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios. The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions.

The rules also establish a “capital conservation buffer” above the regulatory minimum capital requirements, which must consist entirely of common equity Tier 1 capital. The capital conservation buffer will be phased-in over four years beginning on January 1, 2016, as follows: the maximum buffer will be 0.625% of risk-weighted assets for 2016, 1.25% for 2017, 1.875% for 2018, and 2.5% for 2019 and thereafter. This will result in the following minimum ratios beginning in 2019: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%.
 
An institution is also subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions.
 
Basel III provided discretion for regulators to impose an additional buffer, the “countercyclical buffer,” of up to 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to take into account the macro-financial environment and periods of excessive credit growth. However, the final amended rules permit the countercyclical buffer to be applied only to “advanced approach banks” (i.e., banks with $250 billion or more in total assets or $10 billion or more in total foreign exposures), which currently excludes the Company and the Bank. The rules also implement revisions and clarifications consistent with Basel III regarding the various components of Tier 1 capital, including common equity, unrealized gains and losses, as well as certain instruments that no longer qualify as Tier 1 capital, some of which will be phased out over time. However, the final amended rules provide that small depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009 (which includes the Company) will be able to permanently include non-qualifying instruments that were issued and included in Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital prior to May 19, 2010 in additional Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital until they redeem such instruments or until the instruments mature.
 
In addition, smaller banking institutions (less than $250 billion in consolidated assets) were permitted to make a one-time election to opt-out of including most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital. Importantly, the opt-out excluded from regulatory capital not only unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities, but also accumulated net gains and losses on cash-flow hedges and amounts attributable to defined benefit postretirement plans. The Bank elected to opt-out on its March 31, 2015 Call Report.
 
The rules also contain revisions to the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework, which is designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions, including the Bank, if their capital levels begin to show signs of weakness. These revisions took effect January 1, 2015. Under the PCA requirements, which are designed to complement the capital conservation buffer, insured depository institutions are required to meet the following increased capital level requirements in order to qualify as “well-capitalized:”(i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8% (increased from 6%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 10% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% (increased from 4%).
 
The rules set forth certain changes for the calculation of risk-weighted assets, which were effective for us beginning January 1, 2015. The standardized approach final rule utilizes an increased number of credit risk exposure categories and risk weights, and also addresses: (i) an alternative standard of creditworthiness consistent with Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act; (ii) revisions to recognition of credit risk mitigation; (iii) rules for risk weighting of equity exposures and past due loans; (iv) revised capital treatment for derivatives and repo-style transactions; and (v) disclosure requirements for top-tier banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total assets that are not subject to the “advance approach rules” that apply to banks with greater than $250 billion in consolidated assets.
 
As of December 31, 2017, the Bank met the PCA requirements in order to qualify as “well-capitalized.”

Loans-to-One Borrower. Generally, a state-chartered bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations.
 
Capital Distributions. The laws and regulations enforced and administered by the FDIC and the OFR govern capital distributions by a Florida state-chartered commercial bank, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account.
 
A depository institution must file an application for approval of a capital distribution with the FDIC if:
 

· | the depository institution’s eligible retained income (i.e., net income for the four calendar quarters preceding the current calendar quarter, based on the FDIC-supervised institution's quarterly call reports, net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income) is negative; and (b) the depository institution’s capital conservation buffer ratio is less than 2.5 percent as of the end of the previous calendar quarter;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the depository institution would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or FDIC-imposed condition; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the depository institution is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Additionally, a Florida state-chartered commercial bank must obtain approval of the OFR to declare a dividend from retained net profits which accrued prior to the preceding two years, but each bank or trust company shall, before the declaration of a dividend on its common stock, carry 20 percent of its net profits for such preceding period as is covered by the dividend to its surplus fund, until the same shall at least equal the amount of its common and preferred stock then issued and outstanding. No Florida state-chartered commercial bank shall declare any dividend at any time at which its net income from the current year combined with the retained net income from the preceding two years is a loss or which would cause the capital accounts of the bank or trust company to fall below the minimum amount required by law, regulation, order, or any written agreement with the office or a state or federal regulatory agency.
 
The FDIC or FRB may disapprove a notice or application if:
 

· | the depository institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution, if after making such distribution the institution would be undercapitalized.
 
Liquidity. A depository institution is required to maintain a sufficient amount of liquid assets to ensure its safe and sound operation.
 
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All depository institutions have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations of the FDIC to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. In connection with its examination of a depository institution, the FDIC is required to assess the association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. Failure to comply with the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. The Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination.

Transactions with Related Parties. A depository institution’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by FDIC regulations and by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and its implementing regulation, Regulation W. An affiliate is a company that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Bank. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank. In general, loan transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliate are subject to certain quantitative and collateral requirements. In this regard, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliate are limited to 10% of the institution’s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions with any one affiliate and 20% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus for transactions in the aggregate with all affiliates. Collateral in specified amounts ranging from 100% to 130% of the amount of the transaction must usually be provided by affiliates in order to receive loans from the institution. In addition, FDIC regulations prohibit a depository institution from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. The FDIC requires depository institutions to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates.
 
The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated by the FRB. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features, and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. The Bank is in compliance with Regulation O.
 
A Florida state-chartered commercial bank is also subject to other limitations under Fla. Stat. § 655.0386 that limit “financial institution-affiliated parties” (including directors, officers, employees, or controlling stockholders) from engaging or participating, directly or indirectly, in any business or transaction conducted on behalf of or involving the Florida state-chartered commercial bank, subsidiary, or service corporation which would result in a conflict of the party’s own personal interests with those of the Florida state-chartered commercial bank, subsidiary, or service corporation with which he or she is affiliated.
 
Enforcement. The FDIC and the OFR have primary enforcement responsibility over Florida state-chartered commercial banks, including the Bank, and have the authority to bring enforcement actions against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action by the FDIC or the OFR may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil money penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance with respect to a particular depository institution.

Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. The federal banking agencies adopted Interagency Guidelines Prescribing Standards for Safety and Soundness to implement the safety and soundness standards required under federal law. The guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. The guidelines address internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, credit underwriting, loan documentation, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan.
 
Prompt Corrective Action Regulation. Under the PCA rules, the FDIC is required and authorized to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions. For this purpose, a depository institution is placed in one of the following five categories based on the depository institution’s capital:

· | well-capitalized (total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater and leverage ratio of 5% or greater);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | adequately capitalized (total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater, common equity tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% or greater and leverage ratio of 4% or greater);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | undercapitalized (total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, common equity tier 1 capital ratio less than 4.5% or leverage ratio less than 4%);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | significantly undercapitalized (total risk-based capital ratio less than 6%, tier 1 risk-based capital ratio less than 4%, common equity tier 1 capital ratio less than 3% or leverage ratio less than 3%); or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | critically undercapitalized (ratio of tangible equity to total assets equal to or less than 2%).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Generally, the FDIC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a depository institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the FDIC within 45 days of the date a depository institution receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” The criteria for an acceptable capital restoration plan include, among other things, the establishment of the methodology and assumptions for attaining adequately capitalized status on an annual basis, procedures for ensuring compliance with restrictions imposed by applicable federal regulations, the identification of the types and levels of activities the depository institution will engage in while the capital restoration plan is in effect, and assurances that the capital restoration plan will not appreciably increase the current risk profile of the depository institution. Any holding company for the depository institution required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of: an amount equal to 5% of a depository institution’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the FDIC, or the amount necessary to restore the depository institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the FDIC notifies the depository institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the FDIC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Failure by a holding company to provide the required guarantee will result in certain operating restrictions on the depository institution, such as restrictions on the ability to declare and pay dividends, pay executive compensation and management fees, and increase assets or expand operations. The FDIC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized depository institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured up to $250,000 by the FDIC. The FDIC imposes an assessment for deposit insurance on all depository institutions. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned to risk categories based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations, with institutions deemed less risky paying lower rates. Assessment rates (inclusive of possible adjustments) currently range from 2 ½ to 45 basis points of each institution’s total assets less tangible capital. The FDIC may increase or decrease the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment rulemaking.

The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The FDIC must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. Insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more are supposed to fund the increase. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the FDIC and the FDIC has exercised that discretion by establishing a long term fund ratio of 2%.
 
The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of our deposit insurance.
 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (FICO) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 12 basis points for each $100 in domestic deposits maintained at an institution.
 
Prohibitions Against Tying Arrangements. Depository institutions banks are prohibited, subject to some exceptions, from extending credit to or offering any other service, or fixing or varying the consideration for such extension of credit or service, on the condition that the customer obtain some additional service from the institution or its affiliates or not obtain services of a competitor of the institution.
 
Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement.
 
Federal Reserve System
 
FRB regulations require depository institutions to maintain noninterest-earning reserves against their transaction accounts, such as negotiable order of withdrawal and regular checking accounts. At December 31, 2017, the Bank was in compliance with these reserve requirements.
 
Other Laws/Regulations 
 
The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal or state laws and regulations applicable to financial institutions which relate to credit transactions, products and services offered to consumers, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorism financing and financial privacy. These laws, include, without limitation, the following: 
 

· | State usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank;

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is a bank holding company, subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB. The FRB has enforcement authority over Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation and its non-banking institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the FRB to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a risk to the Bank.
 
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation’s activities are limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies (if elected) or for bank holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance, incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A bank holding company must elect such status in order to engage in activities permissible for a financial holding company and conduct the activities in accordance with the requirements that would apply to a financial holding company’s conduct of the activity. A bank holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA), subject to the prior approval of the FRB, and certain additional activities authorized by FRB regulations.
 
Federal law prohibits a bank holding company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring control of another depository institution or holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the FRB. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with specified exceptions, more than 5% of the equity securities of a company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire depository institutions, the FRB must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the depository institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance fund, and the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 
Capital. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FRB to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to depository institutions themselves. Instruments such as cumulative preferred stock and trust preferred securities will no longer be includable as Tier 1 capital as is currently the case with bank holding companies. Instruments issued by May 19, 2010 will be grandfathered for companies with consolidated assets of $15 billion or less. The Company had no cumulative preferred stock or trust preferred securities outstanding as of December 31, 2017.
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act also extended the “source of strength” doctrine to bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, and other companies that control insured depository institutions and requires the regulatory agencies to issue regulations requiring that these companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. FRB policies also provide that holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
Dividends. The Company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. The majority of the Company’s revenue is from dividends paid to the Company by the Bank. The Bank is subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends it can pay. In addition, the Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including requirements to maintain capital at or above regulatory minimums, and to remain “well-capitalized” under the prompt corrective action regulations summarized above. Federal banking regulators have indicated that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only if (1) the organization’s net income available to common stockholders over the past year has been sufficient to fully fund the dividends and (2) the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Florida law states that, subject to certain capital requirements, the board of directors of a bank chartered under the laws of Florida may quarterly, semiannually, or annually declare a dividend of so much of the aggregate of the net profits of that period combined with its retained net profits of the preceding two years as they shall judge expedient, and, with the approval of the OFR, declare a dividend from retained net profits which accrued prior to the preceding two years.

Federal Securities Laws
 
Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation common stock is registered with the SEC. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation’s public offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not affiliates of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by an affiliate of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 or the requirements of other available exemptions from registration for resales of restricted securities. If Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation meets the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of the outstanding shares of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933.
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer will be required to certify that the Company’s quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the SEC under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting; they have made certain disclosures to the Company’s auditors and the audit committee of the Board of Directors about internal control over financial reporting; and they have included information in the Company’s quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting. The Company has existing policies, procedures and systems designed to comply with these regulations, and it continues to enhance and document such policies, procedures and systems to ensure continued compliance with these regulations.
 
Change in Control Regulations
 
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, no person may acquire control of a bank holding company such as the Company unless the FRB has been given 60 days’ prior written notice and has not issued a notice disapproving the proposed acquisition, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. Control, as defined under federal law, means ownership, control of or holding irrevocable proxies representing more than 25% of any class of voting stock, control in any manner of the election of a majority of the institution’s directors, or a determination by the regulator that the acquirer has the power, directly or indirectly, to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the institution. Acquisition of more than 10% of any class of a bank holding company’s voting stock constitutes a rebuttable determination of control under the regulations under certain circumstances including where, as will be the case with the Company, the issuer has registered securities under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 
In addition, federal regulations provide that no company may acquire control of a bank holding company without the prior approval of the FRB. Any company that acquires such control becomes a “bank holding company” subject to registration, examination and regulation by the FRB.

Federal Taxation
 
General
 
The Company and the Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company or the Bank.
 
The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Reform reduced the corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018 and changed certain other provisions. Accounting guidance required the Company to remeasure its deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities using the new enacted tax rate. The Company has recorded additional expense of $1.6 million to reflect changes that resulted from the enactment of the Tax Reform.
 
Method of Accounting
 
For federal income tax purposes, the Company currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal and state income tax returns.
Alternative Minimum Tax
 
The Company and the Bank have been subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT) in prior years and have $0.5 million available as credits to offset future tax liability; however, the utilization of the AMT credit carryforward is subject to annual limitation under Internal Revenue Code § 382 (IRC § 382).
Net Operating Loss Carryovers
 
Generally, a financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. At December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank have $5.0 million in net operating loss carryovers for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in 2027. The utilization of these net operating loss carryovers will be restricted due to Internal Revenue Service (IRS) limitations. See Note 14. Income Taxes of the Notes contained in this Report for additional information.
 
Internal Revenue Code § 382
 
Under the rules of IRC § 382, a change in the ownership of a company limits the gross amount of net operating loss carryover a company can use per year (the annual limitation). After a change in ownership occurs, recognition of certain losses during years one to five will have an adverse effect on the utilization of the annual limitation on net operating losses. Those recognized losses will be applied to the annual limitation before the net operating losses are applied. The annual limitation is discussed in detail in Note 14. Income Taxes of the Notes contained in this Report.
 
Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction
 
The Company may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from the Bank as a wholly owned subsidiary pursuant to Internal Revenue Code § 243.
 
State Taxation
 
Net Operating Loss Carryovers
 
Net operating losses in Florida may only be carried forward for 20 taxable years; however, a corporation may carry back Georgia net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. Through December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank had a Florida and Georgia net operating loss carryover of $5.6 million, which begins to expire in 2018. The utilization of these net operating loss carryovers will be restricted due to IRS limitations. See Note 14. Income Taxes of the Notes contained in this Report for additional information.
