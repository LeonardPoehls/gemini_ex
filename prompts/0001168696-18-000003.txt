DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Overview
We operate one of the largest and most geographically diverse theatre circuits in the United States, consisting of 7,322 screens in 560 theatres in 43 states along with Guam, Saipan, American Samoa and the District of Columbia as of December 31, 2017, with approximately 197 million attendees for the year ended December 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017"). Our geographically diverse circuit includes theatres in 48 of the top 50 U.S. designated market areas. We develop, acquire and operate multi-screen theatres primarily in mid-sized metropolitan markets and suburban growth areas of larger metropolitan markets throughout the United States. We operate our theatre circuit using our Regal Cinemas, United Artists, Edwards, Great Escape Theatres and Hollywood Theaters brands through our wholly owned subsidiaries.
Our business strategy is predicated on our ability to allocate capital effectively to enhance value for our stockholders. This strategy focuses on enhancing our position in the motion picture exhibition industry by capitalizing on prudent industry consolidation and partnership opportunities, managing, expanding and upgrading our existing asset base with new technologies and customer amenities and realizing selective growth opportunities through new theatre construction. For fiscal 2017, we reported total revenues, income from operations and net income attributable to controlling interest of $3,163.0 million, $271.7

NATIONAL CINEMEDIA JOINT VENTURE
We maintain an investment in National CineMedia, which operates the largest digital in-theatre advertising network in North America representing over 20,800 U.S. theatre screens (of which approximately 20,400 are part of National CineMedia's digital content network) as of December 31, 2017. 
We receive theatre access fees and mandatory distributions of excess cash from National CineMedia. As of December 31, 2017, we held approximately 27.6 million common units of National CineMedia. On a fully diluted basis, we own a 17.9% interest in NCM, Inc. as of December 31, 2017. 
See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of National CineMedia and related transactions.
DCIP AND OPEN ROAD FILMS JOINT VENTURES
We maintain an investment in DCIP, a joint venture company formed by Regal, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. ("AMC") and Cinemark Holdings, Inc. ("Cinemark"). DCIP funds the cost of digital projection equipment principally through the collection of virtual print fees from motion picture studios and equipment lease payments from participating exhibitors, including us. In addition to its U.S. digital deployment, DCIP actively manages the deployment of over 1,800 digital systems in Canada for Canadian Digital Cinema Partnership, a joint venture between Cineplex Inc. and Empire Theatres Limited.
The Company holds a 46.7% economic interest in DCIP as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, all of our screens were fully outfitted with digital projection systems. Please refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion of DCIP.
On August 4, 2017, the Company sold all of its 50% equity interest in Open Road Films, a film distribution company jointly owned by us and AMC, to a third party for total proceeds of approximately $14.0 million. In accordance with the purchase agreement, approximately $3.7 million of the net proceeds received were in satisfaction of various receivables and other amounts due to the Company related to film marketing services provided to Open Road Films prior to the closing date. As a result of the sale, the Company recorded a gain of approximately $17.8 million, representing the difference between the net proceeds received of $10.3 million (after satisfaction of the above amounts due the Company) and the carrying amount of the Company's investment in Open Road Films (approximately $(7.5) million) as of the closing date. Also effective with closing, the Company and Open Road Films entered into a new marketing agreement with respect to films released by Open Road Films after the closing date.
FILM DISTRIBUTION
Domestic movie theatres are the primary initial distribution channel for domestic film releases. The theatrical success of a film is often the most important factor in establishing its value in other film distribution channels. Motion pictures are generally made available through several alternative distribution methods after the theatrical release date, including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television. A strong theatrical opening often establishes a film's success and positively influences the film's potential in these downstream distribution channels. 
The development of additional distribution channels has given motion picture producers the ability to generate a greater portion of a film's revenues through channels other than its theatrical release. Historically, this potential for increased revenue after a film's initial theatrical release has enabled major motion picture studios and some independent producers to increase the budgets for film production and advertising.
FILM EXHIBITION
Evaluation of Film.    We license films on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis by negotiating directly with film distributors. Prior to negotiating for a film license, we evaluate the prospects for upcoming films. Criteria we consider for each film may include cast, producer, director, genre, budget, comparative film performances and various other market conditions. Successful licensing depends greatly upon the exhibitor's knowledge of trends and historical film preferences of the residents in markets served by each theatre, as well as the availability of commercially successful motion pictures.
Film Rental Fees.    Film licenses typically specify rental fees or formulas by which rental fees may be calculated. The majority of our arrangements use a "sliding scale" formula. Under a sliding scale formula, the distributor receives a percentage of the box office receipts using a pre-determined and mutually agreed upon film rental template. This formula establishes film rental predicated on box office performance and is the predominant formula used by us to calculate film rental fees. To a much lesser extent, we have also used a "firm term" formula and a "review or settlement" method where either (1) the exhibitor and 
7

distributor agree prior to the exhibition of the film on a specified percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor or (2) the exhibitor and distributor negotiate a percentage of the box office receipts to be remitted to the distributor upon completion of the theatrical engagement.
Duration of Film Licenses.    The duration of our film licenses are negotiated with our distributors on a case-by-case basis. The terms of our license agreements depend on performance of each film. Marketable movies that are expected to have high box office admission revenues will generally have longer license terms than movies with more uncertain performance and popularity.
Relationship with Distributors.    Many distributors provide quality first-run movies to the motion picture exhibition industry. We license films from each of the major distributors and believe that our relationships with these distributors are good. For fiscal 2017, films shown from our top ten film distributors accounted for approximately 93% of our admissions revenues. Our revenues attributable to individual distributors may vary significantly from year to year depending upon the commercial success of each distributor's motion pictures in any given year. In 2017, our largest single distributor accounted for 22.1% of our box office admissions. 
CONCESSIONS
In addition to box office admissions revenues, we generated approximately 29.4% of our total revenues from concessions sales during fiscal 2017. We emphasize prominent and appealing concession stations designed for rapid and efficient service. We continually seek to increase concessions sales by actively managing concession line congestion, optimizing product mix and through expansion of our concession offerings, introducing special promotions from time to time and offering employee training and incentive programs to up-sell and cross-sell products. We have favorable concession supply contracts and have developed an efficient concession purchasing and distribution supply chain. We have historically maintained strong brand relationships and management negotiates directly with these manufacturers for many of our concession items to obtain competitive prices and to ensure adequate supplies.
 To address consumer trends and customer preferences, we have continued to expand our menu of food and alcoholic beverage products to an increasing number of attendees. The enhancement of our food and alcoholic beverage offerings has had a positive effect on our operating results. As of December 31, 2017, we offered an expanded menu of food in 270 locations (reaching 63% of our attendees) and alcoholic beverages in 175 locations (reaching 38% of our attendees).
COMPETITION
The motion picture exhibition industry is highly competitive. Motion picture exhibitors generally compete on the basis of the following competitive factors:

• | ability to secure films with favorable licensing terms;


• | availability of customer amenities (including luxury reclining seating), location, reputation, stadium seating and seating capacity;


• | quality of projection and sound systems;


• | appeal of our concession products; and


• | ability and willingness to promote the films that are showing.

We have several hundred competitors nationwide that vary substantially in size, from small independent exhibitors to large national chains such as AMC and Cinemark. As a result, our theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the regions in which they operate. 
We also compete with other motion picture distribution channels including digital sell-through, DVD and Blu-ray, physical and digital rental, subscription video on demand and free and pay television. Other technologies could also have an 
8

adverse effect on our business and results of operations. When motion picture distributors license their products to the domestic exhibition industry, they refrain from licensing their motion pictures to these other distribution channels for a period of time, commonly called the theatrical release window. Over the past several years, the theatrical release window has contracted to approximately three to four months. Further, some film distributors have experimented with offering alternative distribution methods for certain films that rely on shorter theatrical release windows and in some cases, bypass the theatrical release altogether. We believe that a material contraction of the theatrical release window could significantly dilute the consumer appeal of the out-of-home motion picture offering. As a result, we continue to monitor the status of the theatrical release window during our film licensing decisions.
In addition, we compete for the public's leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, concerts, live theatre and restaurants.
SEASONALITY
 The timing of movie releases can have a significant effect on our results of operations, and the results of one fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for the next fiscal quarter or any other fiscal quarter. The unexpected emergence of a hit film during other periods can alter the traditional trend. The seasonality of motion picture exhibition, however, has become less pronounced as motion picture studios are releasing motion pictures somewhat more evenly throughout the year.
EMPLOYEES
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 26,000 persons. The Company considers its employee relations to be good.

REGULATION
The distribution of motion pictures is in large part regulated by federal and state antitrust laws and has been the subject of numerous antitrust cases. Consent decrees effectively require major film distributors to offer and license films to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Consequently, exhibitors cannot assure themselves of a supply of films by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must negotiate for licenses on a film-by-film basis.
Our theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the "ADA") to the extent that such properties are "public accommodations" and/or "commercial facilities" as defined by the ADA. Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations "reasonably accommodate" individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to "commercial facilities" conform to accessibility guidelines unless "structurally impracticable" for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, award of damages to private litigants and additional capital expenditures to remedy such non-compliance.
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all current applicable regulations relating to accommodations for the disabled. We intend to comply with future regulations in this regard and except as set forth in Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K, we do not currently anticipate that compliance will require us to expend substantial funds.
Our theatre operations are also subject to federal, state and local laws governing such matters as wages, working conditions, citizenship and health and sanitation and environmental protection requirements. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all relevant laws and regulations.
FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
Some of the information in this Form 10-K includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). All statements other than statements of historical facts included in this Form 10-K, including, without limitation, certain statements under "Business" and "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" may constitute forward-looking statements.
