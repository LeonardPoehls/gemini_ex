Item 1.    Business.
Whole Foods Market, based in Austin, Texas, is the leading natural and organic foods supermarket, the first national “Certified Organic” grocer, and uniquely positioned as America’s Healthiest Grocery StoreTM. The Company incorporated in 1978, opened the first Whole Foods Market store in 1980, and became an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Amazon.com, Inc. (Nasdaq: AMZN) on August 28, 2017.
We have one operating segment, natural and organic foods supermarkets. We are the largest natural and organic foods supermarket in the U.S. and the 9th largest food retailer overall based on 2016 sales rankings from Progressive Grocer. 
Product Offering
We offer a broad and differentiated selection of high-quality natural and organic products with a strong emphasis on perishable foods. Our quality standards ban hundreds of ingredients commonly found in products sold by other retailers, as well as products grown or produced by manufacturing, farming, fishing and ranching practices that don’t measure up. 
We carry both national and private label brands. Our product selection includes, but is not limited to: produce, grocery, meat and poultry, seafood, bakery, prepared foods, coffee and tea, beer and wine, cheese, nutritional supplements, vitamins, body care, pet foods and household goods. Our stores also feature a wide variety of non-GMO, vegan, gluten-free, dairy-free and other special diet foods; and certain stores offer sit-down wine bars and tap rooms. 
The following is a summary of annual percentage sales by product category for the fiscal years indicated:

Stores
As of September 24, 2017, we operated 470 stores: 448 stores in 42 U.S. states and the District of Columbia; 13 stores in Canada; and 9 stores in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), compared to 456 stores at the beginning of the fiscal year. We opened 31 stores including seven relocations and closed nine stores and three commissary kitchens during fiscal year 2017. We also closed one store for a major remodel. Three of the openings were Whole Foods Market 365 stores, our smaller-footprint value format launched in fiscal year 2016. As of September 24, 2017, we had 464 Whole Foods Market stores and 6 stores operating under the Whole Foods Market 365 banner.
All Whole Foods Market retail stores in North America are “Certified Organic” by California Certified Organic Farmers, an independent, USDA-accredited, third-party certifier. Additionally, certain facilities and product lines have been certified organic through their own organic handling plans, including all of our regional distribution centers and several of our bakehouses; our 365 Organic Everyday Value™ private label product line; and our Allegro Coffee™ line.

Purchasing and Distribution
The majority of our purchasing occurs at the regional and national levels. Our produce procurement center facilitates the procurement and distribution of the majority of the produce we sell. We also operate three seafood processing and distribution facilities, a specialty coffee and tea procurement and roasting operation, and 11 regional distribution centers that focus primarily on perishables distribution to our stores across the U.S., Canada and the U.K. In addition, we have four bakehouse facilities which distribute products to our stores. Other products are typically procured through a combination of specialty wholesalers and direct distributors. United Natural Foods, Inc. (“UNFI”) is our single largest third-party supplier, accounting for approximately 33% of our total purchases in fiscal year 2017.
Team Members
As of September 24, 2017, we had approximately 89,000 team members. We consider our team member relations to be very strong.
Seasonality
The Company’s average weekly sales and gross profit as a percentage of sales are typically highest in the second and third fiscal quarters, and lowest in the fourth fiscal quarter due to seasonally slower sales during the summer months. Gross profit as a percentage of sales is also lower in the first fiscal quarter due to the product mix of holiday sales. 
Competition
Our competition includes but is not limited to local, regional, national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets, natural foods stores, warehouse membership clubs, online retailers, smaller specialty stores, farmers’ markets, restaurants, and home delivery and meal solution companies, each of which competes with us on the basis of store ambiance and experience, product selection and quality, customer service, price, convenience or a combination of these factors.
Trademarks
The Company and its subsidiaries have registered or applied to register numerous trademarks, service marks, stylized logos, and brand names in the U.S. and in many additional countries throughout the world. In addition, the Company licenses certain other trademarks. The Company considers certain of its trademarks to be of material importance and actively defends and enforces such trademarks. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country; however, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained.
