ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General Overview
 
We are a Florida corporation formed on April 8, 2001. We were originally organized to be a blank check company.
 
On May 17, 2011, the Company entered into an exclusive memorandum of understanding with Immunovative Clinical Research, Inc. (“ICRI”), a Nevada corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Immunovative Therapies, Ltd. (“ITL”), an Israeli corporation pursuant to which the Company and ICRI intended to pursue a merger resulting in Novo owning ICRI.
 
In April 2012, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to “Immunovative, Inc.” As described in a report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on April 30, 2012, a majority of shareholders executed a written consent in lieu of an Annual Meeting effecting the change of the name of our business from “Novo Energies Corporation” to “Immunovative, Inc.” on April 2, 2012 to better reflect what we then intended to be our future operations. We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on April 30, 2012 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval.
 
On January 8, 2013, the Company received from ITL, a notice by which ITL purported to terminate the License Agreement dated December 9, 2011 between the Company and ITL (the “ITL Notice”), along with alleged damages. It is the Company’s position that ITL breached the License Agreement by delivering the ITL Notice and, that prior to the ITL Notice, the License Agreement was in full force and, on January 17, 2013 and that the Company had complied in all material respect with the License Agreement therefore the Company believes that there are no damages to ITL. As such, on January 17, 2013, the Company filed a lawsuit against ITL, which included the request for various injunctive relief against ITL for damages stemming from this breach.
 
On February 19, 2013, the Company and ITL entered into a settlement agreement whereby the parties have agreed to the following: (1) the Company will submit a letter to the Court advising the Court that the parties have reached a settlement and that the Company is withdrawing its motion, (2) ITL will pay the Company $20,000, (3) ITL will issue to the Company, ITL’s share capital equivalent to 9% of the issued and outstanding shares of ITL, (4) the Company will change its name and (5) the settling parties agree that the license agreement will be terminated. The Company had valued these shares at $0 since they deemed the investment to be worthless. During the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company sold the 3,280,000 shares for $125,000 which is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.
 
On March 13, 2013, the Board of Directors approved the change of name to “Tauriga Sciences, Inc.” from “Immunovative, Inc.” We filed an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation on March 13, 2013 with the Florida Secretary of State to affect this name change after receiving the requisite corporate approval. The Company’s symbol change to “TAUG” was approved by FINRA effective April 9, 2013.
 
Green Innovations
 
On May 31, 2013, the Company signed an exclusive North American license agreement with Green Innovations, Inc. (“Green Innovations”) for the commercialization of Bamboo-Based “100% Tree Free” products including hospital grade biodegradable disinfectant wipes. This 5-year license agreement functioned such that profits were to be split equally between Tauriga and Green Innovations. In consideration for such agreement Tauriga agreed to pay Green Innovations $250,000 and 4,347,826 shares of TAUG common stock. Tauriga received 625,000 shares of Green Innovations common stock as well. The agreement was later amended and completed for the following consideration: Tauriga paid Green Innovations a total of $143,730 and an additional 2,500,000 shares of TAUG common stock (for an aggregate share issuance of 6,847,826 shares). As of March 31, 2017, Tauriga has not generated any revenues from the license agreement. This agreement expires on June 1, 2018.
Bacterial Robotics
 
On October 29, 2013, the Company entered into a strategic alliance with Bacterial Robotics, LLC (“Bacterial Robotics”). Bacterial Robotics owns certain patents and/or other intellectual property related to the development of genetically modified micro-organisms (GMOs) and GMOs tailored to perform one or more specific functions, one such GMO being adopted to clean polluting molecules from nuclear waste, such GMO being referred herein as the existing BactoBot Technology (the BR Technology). Bacterial Robotics is developing a whitepaper to deliver to the Company for acceptance. Upon acceptance by the Company, the parties will form a strategic relationship through the formation of a joint venture in which the Company will be the majority and controlling owner which will use the NuclearBot Technology to further the growth of the nuclear wastewater treatment market. The intent is for Bacterial Robotics to issue a 10-year license agreement. In connection with the strategic alliance agreement, the Company issued a warrant to purchase 75,000,000 shares of its common stock (of which 23,134,118 warrants were cancelled pursuant to the December 22, 2016 transfer agreement with Open Therapeutics, LLC) valued at $1,100,000 and paid an additional $50,000 in cash. The Company fully impaired this as of March 31, 2014, as there was no value in the agreement.

Pilus Energy
 
On November 25, 2013, the Company entered a definitive agreement to acquire Cincinnati, Ohio based Pilus Energy LLC (“Pilus Energy”), a developer of alternative cleantech energy platforms using proprietary microbial solutions that creates electricity while consuming polluting molecules from wastewater. Upon consummation of the proposed transaction, which has been unanimously ratified by Tauriga’s board of directors, Pilus Energy will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tauriga. In addition, certain advisors of Pilus Energy will be incorporated into the existing management team of Tauriga and report directly to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer. A total of $100,000 was paid by Tauriga to Bacterial Robotics in connection with the execution of this November 2013 definitive agreement for the acquisition of Pilus Energy.
 
On January 28, 2014, the Company completed the acquisition of Cincinnati, Ohio based synthetic biology pioneer Pilus Energy LLC (“Pilus Energy”). Structurally Pilus Energy will be a wholly owned subsidiary of Tauriga (pursuant to the terms of the definitive agreement) and will maintain its headquarters location in the State of Ohio. The Board of Directors of Tauriga Sciences unanimously approved both the previously announced definitive merger agreement on October 25, 2013 as well as the completion of the acquisition inclusive of amended closing terms. In consideration for early closing of this acquisition, shareholders of Pilus Energy received 100,000,000 shares of Tauriga Sciences, Inc. common stock at $0.02 per share.
 
On March 26, 2014, the Company announced that its wholly owned subsidiary Pilus Energy had commenced a five-phase, $1,700,000 commercial pilot test (“commercial pilot”) with the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), utilizing Chicago Bridge & Iron Co. (NYSE:CBI) (“CB&I”) Federal Services serving as the third-party-contractor through the EPA’s Test and Evaluation (“T&E”) facility. This five phase commercial pilot included significant testing of the Pilus Energy Electrogenic Bioreactor (“EBR”) synthetic biology platform for generating value from wastewater. The Metropolitan Sewer District of Greater Cincinnati (“MSDGR”), which is co-located with EPA’s T&E facility, will host the commercial scale EBR prototype at its main treatment plant in Cincinnati.
 
At the time, the Company believed the main benefits in accelerating the closing of this acquisition was to enhance Tauriga’s access to capital markets and enable the intrinsic value of Pilus Energy’s technology to be realized sooner through demonstrable progress in the commercialization process. Pilus Energy utilizes a proprietary clean technology to convert industrial customer “wastewater” into value. This wastewater-to-value (“WTV”) proposition provides customers with substantial revenue-generating and cost-saving opportunities. Pilus Energy is converging digester, fermenter, scrubber, and other proven legacy technologies into a single scalable Electrogenic Bioreactor (“EBR”) platform. This transformative microbial fuel cell technology is the basis of the Pilus Cell(TM). The EBR harnesses genetically enhanced bacteria, also known as bacterial robots, or BactoBots(TM), that remediate water, harvest direct current (DC) electricity, and produce economically important gases and chemicals. The EBR accomplishes this through bacterial metabolism, specifically cellular respiration of nearly four hundred carbon and nitrogen molecules typically called pollutants in wastewater. Pilus Energy’s highly metabolic bacteria are non-pathogenic. Because of the mediated biofilm formation, these wastewater-to-value BactoBots(TM) resist heavy metal poisoning, swings of pH, and survive in a 4-to-45-degree Celsius temperature range. Additionally, the BactoBots(TM) are anaerobically and aerobically active, even with low biological oxygen demand (“BOD”) and chemical oxygen demand (“COD”).
 
On December 22, 2016, the Company, entered in a membership interest transfer agreement with Open Therapeutics, LLC, an Ohio limited liability company (“Open Therapeutics” formerly Bacterial Robotics LLC and Microbial Robotics, LLC), whereby the Company sold 80% of its membership interest in Pilus Energy which included the patents. Open Therapeutics agreed to terminate and cancel 80% of the unexercised portion of the warrant to purchase 28,917,647 shares (or 23,134,118 warrants) of the Company’s common stock (issued on January 28, 2014). Open Therapeutics will pay 20% of the net profit generated, to the Company from the previous year’s earnings after the initial $75,000 of profit (reflected as a contingent liability on the consolidated balance sheet). The Company further agreed it would vote its 20% membership interest in Pilus Energy in the same manner that Open Therapeutics votes its membership interest on all matters for which a member vote is required. Through March 31, 2017, and as of June 26, 2017, there has been no activity recorded by Open Therapeutics, LLC with respect to these patents, thus the $75,000 remains contingently owed to them.
 
Honeywood
 
On March 10, 2014, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire California based Honeywood LLC, developer of a topical medicinal cannabis product, that, at the time. sold in numerous dispensaries across the state of California. This definitive agreement was valid for a period of 120 days and Tauriga advanced to Honeywood $217,000 to be applied towards the final closing requisite cash total and incurred $178,000 in legal fees as of March 31, 2014 in connection with the acquisition.
 
On September 24, 2014 (the “Unwinding Date”), the Company, Honeywood and each of the Honeywood Principals entered into a Termination Agreement (the “Termination Agreement”) to unwind the effects of the Merger (the “Unwinding Transaction”). Pursuant to the Termination Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Standstill Agreement and the Employment Agreements were all terminated. As required by the Termination Agreement, on the Unwinding Date the Company entered into an Assignment of Interest (the “Assignment of Interest”) pursuant to which it conveyed its membership interest in Honeywood to the Honeywood Principals, as a result of which Honeywood ceased to be owned by the Company and became owned again by the Honeywood Principals.

In the Termination Agreement, the Honeywood Principals relinquished their right to any merger consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement, including the right to any shares of capital stock of the Company (which had never been formally issued or delivered), and agreed that all indicia of any Company shares issuable as merger consideration reflected on the transfer books of the Company, if any, would be cancelled without any further action by the Honeywood Principals. The shares of the Company that would have been issuable as merger consideration pursuant to the Merger Agreement if the Unwinding Transaction had not been consummated consisted of: (i) shares of the Company’s common stock representing approximately 15.457% of the Company’s outstanding common stock as of the Merger (109,414,235 shares) payable to the Honeywood Principals, (ii) 18,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock payable to a consultant of Honeywood, and (iii) additional shares of the Company’s common stock representing up to 10% of the Company’s outstanding common as of the Merger payable to the Honeywood Principals as an earn-out upon the achievement of certain milestones. Because of the Unwinding Transaction, none of the foregoing shares will be issued by the Company and the stockholders of the Company will not experience the dilution that would have resulted from such issuance.
 
In accordance with the Termination Agreement, Honeywood agreed to repay to the Company substantially all of the advances made by the Company to Honeywood prior to and after the Merger by delivering to the Company on the Unwinding Date a Secured Promissory Note in the principal amount of $170,000 (the “Note”). The Note bears interest at 6% per annum and is repayable in six quarterly installments on the last day of each calendar quarter starting on March 31, 2015 and ending on June 30, 2016. The Note is secured by a blanket security interest in Honeywood’s assets pursuant to a Security Agreement entered into on the Unwinding Date between Honeywood and the Company. As of March 31, 2017, Honeywood has made no payments under the Note and the Company does not expect to receive any payments pursuant to the Note.
 
The Termination Agreement contains a general release and covenant not to sue pursuant to which the Company, Honeywood and the Honeywood Principals released, and agreed not to sue with respect to, any and all rights they have against each other through the Unwinding Date except for their respective rights under the Termination Agreement, the Assignment of Interest, the Note, the Security Agreement, the License Agreement and the Release and Covenant Not to Sue dated July 15, 2014 entered into in connection with the closing of the Merger. The Termination Agreement also contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants regarding confidentiality and non-disparagement.
 
ColluMauxil
 
On November 15, 2016, the Company announced that it will form a new wholly owned subsidiary focused on the development, marketing and distribution of products that target muscle tension. The subsidiary will be called ColluMauxil Therapeutics LLC (“ColluMauxil”), which is based on the Latin terms for neck relief - “collum” and “auxilium.” The Company has filed for trademarks in association with the business with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Company plans to develop, market, distribute and potentially license a broad array of products and technologies that may help individuals who are affected by muscle tension. The Company has already identified potential products and technologies of interest and is actively working towards the goal of creating an innovative product line to launch the business activities of ColluMauxil. The Company believes that one of its most important strengths is its access to and relationships with potentially substantial distribution systems and networks. The Company intends to capitalize on distribution opportunities and will continually update shareholders on such developments. The Company intends on developing a product that specifically targets muscle tension in the neck, shoulder, and upper back. The Company envisions that this product will incorporate a roll-on delivery system (“Roll-On Product”) which is easier to apply to a specific area on the body. The Company also plans to develop a Roll-On Product that incorporates CBD Oil (“Cannabis Oil”), which is a legal alternative to THC oil, and it is available for sale in all states as well as around the world. Cannabis Oil is widely believed to provide relief to individuals who suffer from muscle tension, tenderness, and pain. Both contemplated Roll-On Products will be branded under the ColluMauxil.
 
Cupuacu Butter Lip Balm
 
On December 23, 2016, the Company, entered into a non-exclusive, 12 month, license agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Cleveland, Ohio based cosmetics products firm Ice + Jam LLC (“Ice + Jam”). Under terms of the License Agreement, the Company will market Ice + Jam’s proprietary Cupuacu Butter lip balm, sold under the trademark HERMAN and the two companies will evenly share (“50% / 50%”) any profits through the Company’s marketing, sales, and distribution efforts. The Company will pay the production costs for all product it sells to retail customers or distributors. The Company paid a one-time upfront non-refundable license fee of $9,810 in cash and agreed to an additional payment of common shares of Company stock. The Company agreed to issue 5,000,000 common shares which had a value of $27,500, based on the closing price of the stock on the day the Company entered into the agreement ($0.005 per share). The cost of the shares will be prorated over the life of the license. The Company further paid $2,190 as a prepaid deposit on future inventory for the purchase of 1,500 units at unit cost of $1.46. As of March 31, 2017, none of the units have been completed therefore the Company has recorded the payment as a prepaid asset. The License Agreement may be extended for an additional 12 months based on mutual agreement. The two companies reserve the right to request amendment of the License Agreement at any point during the effective duration.
 
On June 27, 2017, the Company wired $20,000 to Ice + Jam as an advanced payment on initial inventory base of 10,000-15,000 units with completed display cases and promotional literature for the contemplated launch. The Company has focused its efforts on securing potential distribution channels to the retail marketplace, as well as the improvement of the HERMAN product; inclusive of the label and graphics. The Company plans a mid to late autumn 2017 launch period to capitalize on the potential market demand associated with seasonality.

Lawsuit Filed Against Cowan Gunteski & Co. PA
 
On November 4, 2015, the Company filed a lawsuit against its predecessor audit firm Cowan Gunteski & Co. PA in Federal Court — Southern District Florida (Miami, Florida) entitled “Tauriga Sciences, Inc. v. Cowan, Gunteski & Co., P.A. et al”, Case No. 0:15-cv-62334. The case has since been transferred to the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey. The case alleges, among other things, that Cowan Gunteski committed malpractice with respect to the audit of the Company’s FY 2014 financial statements (as illustrated in the PCAOB Public Censure of July 23, 2015) and then misrepresented to the Company with respect about its ability to re-issue an independent opinion for FY 2014 financial statements. On July 31, 2015, the Company was delisted from the OTCQB Exchange to the OTC Pink Limited Information Tier due to its inability to file its FY 2015 Form 10K. The lawsuit was expected by the Company and its counsel to take up to 18 months to complete, from the date it was filed (November 4, 2015).
 
The Company in its lawsuit is seeking damages against Cowan Gunteski (and its malpractice insurance policy) expected to exceed $4,000,000. There is no guarantee that the Company will be successful in this lawsuit.
 
Subsequent to the filing of the lawsuit, the Company was notified that the lawsuit was temporarily suspended so that the Company and Cowan can attempt to mediate this case based on the engagement letters between the parties. On December 30, 2015, the Company was notified that Daniel F. Kolb was appointed as the mediator.
 
Mediation commenced on February 3, 2016. During these efforts, the Company had been offered settlement amounts, but none that have been satisfactory.
 
On March 22, 2016, the Company decided that its good faith efforts to settle its ongoing litigation with Cowan Gunteski & Co. P.A. have proven unsuccessful. Therefore, the Board of Directors of the Company unanimously agreed to proceed forward with the litigation. The Company is continuing to seek the assistance of independent experts, to help ascribe dollar amounts for certain damages suffered by the Company (“provable damages”). At this point in time, the Company has realized out of pocket cash losses and liabilities (inclusive of liquidated damages) that exceed $850,000. Additional potential damages include but are not limited to: inability to properly maintain Pilus Energy’s Intellectual Property (“Pilus IP”), the July 31, 2015 delisting of the Company shares from OTCQB to Pink Sheets, loss of market capitalization (“market cap”), loss of trading liquidity (“trading volume”), and loss of substantial business opportunities. In aggregate the Company intends to seek monetary award(s), during trial, in excess of $4,000,000. That figure is expected to continually increase as additional time lapses.

On September 29, 2016, the judge presiding over the case approved the ruled on the two outstanding motions filed on June 13, 2016. The motion to transfer the case to United States District Court for the District of New Jersey was approved, however the judge denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss the lawsuit. Depositions have commenced in this case.
 
On May 23, 2017, the Company represented in person by Paul K. Silverberg and Seth M. Shaw at the Trenton Courthouse (New Jersey Federal District Court) sought a trial date and a ruling concerning the Company's request for assignment of a Jury. On that date, Judge Sheridan assigned the case a trial date of November 6, 2017, however, has not yet rendered a final ruling with respect to assignment of a jury to this trial.  The case has been focused most recently on completion of the discovery phase and the Company has been taking numerous depositions and has furnished upon request, the documents requested by plaintiff's counsel.
 
The Company has previously disclosed that it is seeking in excess of $4,000,000 in monetary damages at trial.  While the specific details are strictly confidential, the Company has recently held a new round of settlement talks with plaintiff and malpractice insurance provider.  These discussions may continue up till the trial date.  The Company cannot predict whether or not the case will settle prior to trial.

On June 27, 2017, the Company wired $20,000 to Ice + Jam as an advanced payment on initial inventory base of 10,000-15,000 units with completed display cases and promotional literature for the contemplated launch. The Company has focused its efforts on securing potential distribution channels to the retail marketplace, as well as the improvement of the HERMAN product; inclusive of the label and graphics.
