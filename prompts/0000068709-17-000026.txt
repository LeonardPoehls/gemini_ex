ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
MTS Systems Corporation (the Company or MTS) is a leading global supplier of high-performance test systems and sensors that was incorporated under Minnesota law in 1966. Our operations are organized and managed in two reportable segments, Test and Sensors, based upon global similarities within their markets, products, operations and distribution. The Test and Sensors segments represented approximately 79% and 21% of our revenue, respectively, for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2016.
Terms
When we use the terms “MTS,” “we,” “us,” the “Company” or “our” in this report, unless the context otherwise requires, we are referring to MTS Systems Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries.

Fiscal year 2016 refers to the fiscal year ended October 1, 2016; fiscal year 2015 refers to the fiscal year ended October 3, 2015; and fiscal year 2014 refers to the fiscal year ended September 27, 2014. Fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014 include 52, 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. All dollar amounts are in thousands (unless otherwise noted).

Products and Markets by Business Segment
Test Segment
Our Test segment (Test) provides testing solutions including hardware, software and services. The testing solutions are used by customers in the development of products to characterize the product’s mechanical properties. Our solutions simulate forces and motions that customers expect their products to encounter in use. Mechanical simulation testing in a lab setting is an accepted method to accelerate product development compared to reliance on full physical prototypes in real-world settings, proving ground testing and virtual testing because it provides more controlled simulation and accurate measurement. The need for mechanical simulation increases in proportion to the cost of a product, the range and complexity of the physical environment in which the product will be used, expected warranty or recall risk and expense, governmental regulation and potential legal liability. A significant portion of the products in Test are considered by our customers to be capital expenditures. We believe the timing of purchases of our products may be impacted by interest rates, general economic conditions, product development cycles and new product initiatives.

A typical Test system includes a reaction frame to hold the prototype specimen, a hydraulic pump or electro-mechanical power source, piston actuators to create the force or motion and a computer controller with specialized software to coordinate the actuator movement and record and manipulate results. Lower force and less dynamic testing can usually be accomplished with electro-mechanical power sources, which are generally less expensive than hydraulic systems. In addition to these basic components, we sell a variety of accessories and spare parts. We also provide a number of service offerings, including installation, calibration, maintenance, training and consulting.

Test has a diverse set of customers by industry and geography. Regionally, the Americas, Europe and Asia represented approximately 26%, 21% and 53% of revenue for fiscal year 2016, respectively, based upon customer location.

Sales and Service
Test Segment
Test products are sold worldwide through a direct field sales and service organization, independent representatives and distributors and, to a much lesser extent, through other means (e.g. catalogs, internet, etc.) for standard products and accessories. Direct field sales and service personnel are compensated through salary and order incentive programs. Independent representatives and distributors are either compensated through commissions based upon orders or discounts off list prices.

In addition to direct field sales and service personnel throughout the United States and China, we have sales and service subsidiaries in Toronto, Canada; Berlin, Germany; Paris, France; Guildford, United Kingdom; Turin, Italy; Gothenburg and Gislaved, Sweden; Chinchon, Spain; Tokyo and Nagoya, Japan; Seoul, South Korea; Moscow, Russia; Chennai, India and Shanghai and Shenzhen, China.
The timing and volume of large orders (valued at $5,000 or greater on a United States dollar-equivalent basis) may produce volatility in backlog and quarterly operating results. Most customer orders are based on fixed-price quotations and typically have an average sales cycle of three to nine months due to the technical nature of the test systems and customer capital expenditure approval processes. The sales cycle for larger, more complex test systems may be two years or longer.

Sensors Segment
Sensors products are sold worldwide through a direct sales and service organization as well as through independent distributors. The direct sales and service organization is compensated through salary and commissions based upon revenue. The independent distributors pay us a wholesale price and re-sell the product to their customers.
In addition to direct field sales and service personnel throughout the United States, we have sales subsidiaries in Treviolo, Italy; Hitchin, United Kingdom; Aubervilliers, France; Huckelhoven and Dresden, Germany; Beijing, China and Vandreuil, Canada.
The average sales cycle for Sensors ranges from approximately one week to one month for existing customers purchasing standard products. The average sales cycle for a new account can range from approximately two weeks to two years depending on customer testing and specification requirements. 
Manufacturing and Engineering
Test Segment
Test systems are largely built to order and primarily engineered and assembled at our headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. We also operate manufacturing facilities in Shenzhen and Shanghai, China, which manufacture test systems serving the materials market, and our facility in Lexington, North Carolina manufactures test systems serving the ground vehicles market. We perform some smaller system assembly at our locations in Berlin, Germany and Seoul, South Korea. Installation of systems, training, service and consulting services are primarily delivered at customer sites. The engineering and assembly cycle for a typical Test system ranges from one to twelve months, depending on the complexity of the system and the availability of components. The engineering and assembly cycle for larger, more complex systems may be up to three years.
Sensors Segment
Sensors are engineered and assembled regionally at facilities located in Depew, New York; Halifax and Cary, North Carolina; Farmington Hills, Michigan; Provo, Utah; Cincinnati, Ohio; Lüdenscheid, Germany; and Machida, Japan. Assembly cycles generally vary from several days to several weeks, depending on the degree of product customization, the size of the order and manufacturing capacity.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components
Test Segment
A significant portion of Test systems consist of materials and component parts purchased from independent vendors. We are dependent, in certain situations, on a limited number of vendors to provide raw materials and components, such as mechanical and electronic components. However, we have not experienced any recent issues in procuring materials, parts or components needed in our engineering or production processes.

As Test generally sells products and services based on fixed-price contracts, fluctuations in the cost of materials and components between the date of the order and the delivery date may impact the expected profitability. The material and component cost variability is considered in the estimation and customer negotiation process. We believe fluctuations in the cost of raw materials and components did not have a significant impact on our operating results for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014.

However, we have not experienced any recent issues in procuring materials, parts or components needed in our engineering or production processes.
As Sensors generally sells products and services based on fixed-price contracts and the products are manufactured and delivered days to months from the time of order to shipment, fluctuations in the cost of materials and components between the date of the order and the delivery date are not likely to materially impact the expected profitability. We believe fluctuations in the cost of raw materials and components did not have a significant impact on our operating results for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Patents and Trademarks
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and proprietary trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology, some of which are material to our segments. We have obtained numerous patents and trademarks worldwide and actively file and renew patents and trademarks on a global basis to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We are also party to exclusive and non-exclusive license and confidentiality agreements relating to our own and third-party technologies. We aggressively protect certain of our processes, products and strategies as proprietary trade secrets. Our efforts to protect intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights include ongoing review of third-party patents and patent applications.
Seasonality
There is no significant seasonality in Test or Sensors.

Working Capital
Test Segment
The Test segment does not have significant finished product inventory, but maintains inventories of materials and components to facilitate on-time product delivery. Test may have varying levels of work-in-process projects that are classified as inventory or unbilled receivables, depending upon the manufacturing cycle, timing of orders, project revenue recognition and shipments to customers.

In Test, payments are often received from customers upon order or at milestones during the fulfillment of the order, depending upon the size and customization of the system. These are recorded as advance payments from customers in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and reduced as revenue is recognized. Conversely, if revenue is recognized on a project prior to customer billing, an unbilled accounts receivable is recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the customer has been billed. Upon billing, it is recorded as accounts receivable. Changes in the average size, payment terms and revenue recognition for orders in Test may have a significant impact on accounts receivable, unbilled accounts receivable, advance payments from customers and inventory. It has not been our practice to provide rights of return for our products. Payment terms vary and are subject to negotiation.

Sensors Segment
Sensors has finished product inventory, as well as inventories of materials and components to facilitate rapid delivery of product to reduce delivery time and exceed customer expectations. The type and amount of finished goods on hand are targeted based on historical and anticipated customer demands for high-volume products.
In Sensors, payments are often received from customers based on negotiated payment terms. Revenue is primarily recognized when products are shipped.

Customers
We do not have a significant concentration of sales with any individual customer within Test or Sensors. Therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our results.
Backlog
Most of our products are built to order. Our backlog of orders, defined as firm orders from customers that remain unfulfilled, totaled approximately $370,523, $353,013 and $326,473 at October 1, 2016, October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively. Test backlog was $331,044, $339,967 and $309,994 at October 1, 2016, October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively. Sensors backlog was $39,479, $13,046 and $16,479 at October 1, 2016, October 3, 2015 and September 27, 2014, respectively. Based on anticipated manufacturing schedules, we expect that approximately $297,000 of the backlog at October 1, 2016 will be converted to revenue during our fiscal year ending September 30, 2017 (fiscal year 2017). Delays may occur in the conversion of backlog into revenue as a result of export licensing compliance, technical difficulties, specification changes, manufacturing capacity, supplier issues or access to the customer site for installation. While the backlog is subject to order cancellations, we have not historically experienced a significant number of order cancellations. Refer to Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of order cancellations.
Government Contracts
Revenue from U.S. Government contracts varies by year. A portion of our government business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. Government. In addition to contract terms, we must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to the termination of contracts at the election of the U.S. Government or the suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting. U.S. Government revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was approximately 3%, 3% and 5% for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Competition
Test Segment
For relatively simple and inexpensive mechanical testing applications, customers may satisfy their needs internally by building their own test systems or using competitors who compete on price, performance, quality and service. For larger and more complex mechanical test systems, we compete directly with several companies throughout the world based upon customer value including application knowledge, engineering capabilities, technical features, price, quality and service.
Sensors Segment
We primarily compete on factors that include technical performance, price and customer service in new applications or in situations in which other sensing technologies have been used. Sensors’ competitors are typically larger companies that carry multiple sensor product lines, larger diverse companies with only a small portion of business in the sensors market or smaller, privately held companies throughout the world.
Research and Development
We invest in significant product, system and software application development. Occasionally, we also contract with our customers to advance the state of technology and increase product functionality. Costs associated with research and development (R&D) are expensed as incurred, totaling $25,336, $23,705 and $23,844 for fiscal years 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we allocated certain resources to capitalized software development activities. Total internal software development costs capitalized during fiscal years 2016 and 2015 were $2,761 and $1,966, respectively.
Environmental Compliance
We believe our operations are in compliance with all applicable material environmental regulations within the jurisdictions in which we operate. Capital expenditures for environmental compliance were not material in fiscal year 2016, and we do not expect such expenditures will be material in fiscal year 2017.
