Item 1.                                 Business
 
Dover Motorsports, Inc. is a public holding company that is a leading marketer and promoter of motorsports entertainment in the United States.  Through our subsidiaries, we own and operate Dover International Speedway® in Dover, Delaware and Nashville Superspeedway® near Nashville, Tennessee.  Our Dover facility promoted the following six events during 2017, all of which were under the auspices of the premier sanctioning body in motorsports - the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing (NASCAR):
 
·                  2 NASCAR Cup Series events;
 ·                  2 NASCAR XFINITY Series events;
 ·                  1 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series event; and
 ·                  1 NASCAR K&N Pro Series East event.
 
In 2018, we are scheduled to promote these same six events at Dover International Speedway.  Total revenues from these events were approximately 96%, 97% and 97% of total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
We have hosted the Firefly Music Festival (Firefly) on our property in Dover, Delaware for six consecutive years and it is scheduled to return on June 14-17, 2018.  The inaugural three day festival with 40 musical acts was held in July 2012 and the 2017 event was held on June 15-18, 2017 with over 140 musical acts.  In September 2014, Red Frog Events LLC formed RFGV Festivals LLC - a joint venture with Goldenvoice that promotes Firefly.  Goldenvoice is owned by AEG Live, one of the worlds largest presenters of live music and entertainment events.  We entered into an amended agreement with RFGV Festivals granting them two 5 year options to extend our facility rental agreement through 2032 (from its original expiration date of 2022) in exchange for a rental commitment to secure our property for up to two festivals per year. Rent is at differing rates depending on how many events are actually held.  On June 26-28, 2015, the Big Barrel Country Music Festival was held at our facility.  The three day festival was promoted by RFGV Festivals and featured 40 musical acts.  On January 28, 2016, RFGV Festivals announced it would not promote the Big Barrel Country Music Festival in 2016 and a second festival was not held in 2017.  In addition to the facility rental fee, we also receive a percentage of the concession sales we manage at the events.
 
We generate revenues primarily from the following sources:
 
·                  rights fees obtained for television and radio broadcasts of our events;
 
·                  ticket sales;
 
·                  sponsorship payments;
 
·                  luxury suite rentals;
 
·                  hospitality tent rentals and catering;
 
·                  concessions and vendor commissions for the right to sell concessions and souvenirs at our facilities;
 
·                  expo space rentals; and
 
·                  track and facility rentals and other event-related revenues.
 
We began our motorsports operations in 1969 in Dover, Delaware.  Our predecessor, Dover Downs, Inc., was also engaged in harness horse racing operations and later ran our other gaming operations.  As a result of several restructurings, our operations were segregated into two main operating subsidiaries - Dover International Speedway, Inc., incorporated in 1994, encompassed our motorsports operations, and Dover Downs, Inc., incorporated in 1967, conducted our gaming operations.

Effective March 31, 2002, we spun-off our gaming business which was then owned by our subsidiary, Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, Inc. (Gaming).  On a tax-free basis, we made a pro rata distribution of all of the capital stock of Gaming to our stockholders.  Our continuing operations subsequent to the spin-off consist solely of our motorsports activities and property rentals.
 
Nashville Superspeedway no longer promotes motorsports events and has not entered into sanction agreements with NASCAR since 2011.  We lease the facility on a short term basis to third parties from time to time.  On August 17, 2017, we entered into an agreement with an entity owned by Panattoni Development Company relative to the sale of approximately 147 acres at a purchase price of $35,000 per acre.  On January 22, 2018, we entered into an amendment to that agreement whereby the purchaser was required to deposit into escrow the remainder of the purchase price.  The total purchase price of $5,151,300 has now been placed into escrow.  In accordance with the terms of the amendment, closing will occur within three business days after the plat for the property has been fully executed by all required regulatory authorities, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2018.  On September 1, 2017, we also awarded to the purchaser a three year option for 88.03 additional acres at a purchase price of $55,000 per acre.  On February 9, 2018, we amended the option agreement to extend its term and to add additional acreage to the option.  The option is for three years beginning on the earliest to occur of March 1, 2018 or the date of closing of the initial 147 acres, but is only operative once closing occurs under the purchase agreement for the initial 147 acres.  An additional 86.45 acres were added to the option at a purchase price of $66,685 per acre and an additional 50.51 acres were added at a purchase price of $35,000 per acre.  The option may only be exercised for all of the 224.99 acres at one time for a total purchase price of $12,374,418.  We will continue with our effort to sell the remaining Nashville Superspeedway property.  As of December 31, 2016, all of the assets of Nashville Superspeedway were previously reported as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets.  While management remains committed to selling the Nashville property, with the exception of the 147 acres discussed above, we no longer believe it is probable that the remaining property will be sold within the next twelve months.  As such, we reclassified $23,545,000 to long term assets and $2,455,000 representing 147 acres of the total Nashville Superspeedway property was reported as assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2017.  In addition, the December 31, 2016 consolidated balance sheet was retrospectively adjusted to conform to the current-period presentation.
 
Dover International Speedway
 
We have promoted NASCAR-sanctioned racing events for 49 consecutive years at Dover International Speedway and currently promote six NASCAR-sanctioned events at the facility annually.  Two races are in the NASCAR Cup Series professional stock car racing circuit, two races are in the NASCAR XFINITY Series racing circuit, one race is in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series racing circuit and one race is in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East racing circuit.  Prior to 2017, the NASCAR Cup Series was sponsored by Sprint.  The series has been rebranded as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series for events in 2017 and 2018 (and for an additional two years if Monster Energy exercises its renewal option).
 
Each of the NASCAR XFINITY Series events, the Camping World Truck Series event and the K&N Pro Series East event at Dover International Speedway are conducted on the days before a NASCAR Cup Series event.  Dover International Speedway is one of only eight speedways in North America that presents two NASCAR Cup Series events and two NASCAR XFINITY Series events each year.  Additionally, it is one of only nine tracks to host three major NASCAR events at one facility on the same weekend.  The spring and fall event dates have historically allowed Dover International Speedway to hold the first and last NASCAR Cup Series events in the Maryland to Maine region each year.  Our fall event was the third of ten races in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Playoff, an elimination format which determines the NASCAR Cup Series champion for the racing season.  The XFINITY Series and the Camping World Truck Series have also moved to a playoff format.  Our fall XFINITY Series event was the second of seven races in the NASCAR XFINITY Series Playoff.
 
Dover International Speedway, widely known as the Monster Mile®, is a high-banked, one-mile, concrete superspeedway with permanent grandstand seating capacity of approximately 85,000.  Unlike some superspeedways, substantially all grandstand and skybox seats offer an unobstructed view of the entire track.  The concrete racing surface makes Dover International Speedway the only concrete superspeedway (one mile or greater in length) that conducts NASCAR Cup Series events.  The superspeedway facility also features the Monster Bridge®.  The climate

controlled bridge spans across the width of the superspeedway at a height of 29 feet and houses 50-luxury seats, a refreshment bar and other amenities.  The Monster Bridge is the only one of its kind in the motorsports industry.
 
Agreements with NASCAR
 
Our most recent sanction agreements with NASCAR are for a five year period (2016-2020).  Pursuant to the typical sanction agreement, NASCAR grants its sanction to a promoter, such as Dover International Speedway, to organize, promote and hold a particular competition.  The promoter sells tickets to the competition, sells or arranges for the sale of merchandise and concessions, and sells advertising, sponsorships and hospitality services.  NASCAR conducts the competition, arranges for the drivers, and has sole control over the competition, including the right to require alterations to the promoters facility and the right to approve or disapprove any advertising or sponsorship of the promoter.  NASCAR also has exclusive rights to exploit live broadcast and certain broadcast and intellectual property rights related to the competition, and exclusive rights to sponsorship and promotional rights relative to the series to which a particular competition belongs.  The promoter must pay the sanction fee and purse monies and receives a share of the live broadcast revenue contracted for by NASCAR.  The promoter is responsible for the condition of the facility, for compliance with laws, for control of the public, for fire and medical equipment and personnel, for security, for insurance and for providing facilities and services required by NASCAR officials and the live broadcast personnel.
 
Dover International Speedway, Inc. has entered into two sanction agreements with NASCAR pursuant to which it will organize and promote two NASCAR Cup Series events in 2016 through 2020.  Our business is substantially dependent on these two agreements.
 
Under the terms of our sanction agreements, NASCAR retains 10% of the gross broadcast rights fees allocated to each NASCAR-sanctioned event as a component of its sanction fee.  The remaining 90% is recorded as revenue.  The event promoter is required to pay 25% of the gross broadcast rights fees to the event as part of the awards to the competitors, which we record as operating expenses.
 
Competition
 
Our racing events compete with other racing events sanctioned by various racing bodies and with other sports and recreational events scheduled on or around the same dates.  Racing events sanctioned by different organizations are often held on the same dates at different tracks.  The quality of the competition, type of racing event, caliber of the event, sight lines, ticket pricing, location and customer conveniences and amenities, among other things, differentiate the motorsports facilities.  We also compete with improving and expanding media coverage and content by network and cable broadcasters.
Seasonality
 
We derive substantially all of our total revenues from admissions, television broadcast rights and other event-related revenue attributable to two major motorsports event weekends held in the spring and fall.  As a result, our business is highly seasonal.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 53 full-time employees and 7 part-time employees.  We engage temporary personnel to assist during our motorsports racing season.  We believe that we enjoy a good relationship with our employees.
