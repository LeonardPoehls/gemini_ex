ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

OVERVIEW
   We are a U.S.-based company that sources and distributes industrial products in China, and the Americas. We also provide business and management consulting services to public and private American and Chinese businesses. We used to operate in three identifiable business segments, as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 280, "Segment Reporting:" Magnesium, Basic Materials/Mineral Trading and Consulting. Beginning in 2006, we established our Magnesium and Basic Materials/Mineral Trading segments which have grown through acquisitions of controlling interests of Chinese private companies. We consolidated these acquisitions as either our wholly or majority owned subsidiaries. Through our U.S. based industrial commodities business, we source industrial commodities from South America for ultimate distribution in China. We also provide business and management consulting services to public and private American and Chinese businesses.  
   We currently operate our business in two segments, trading segment and consulting segment. We used to name "Trading segment" as "Mineral Trading segment" and "Basic Materials segment". Basic Materials segment used to include our subsidiaries, Lang Chemial and CDI Beijing. Since we disposed both subsidiaries on September 30, 2012, we focused on trading business in South America, and we renamed our Basic Materials segment to Mineral Trading segment in fiscal year 2014 and to Trading Segment in fiscal year 2016. Our Trading segment sources Cannabidiol (CBD)-related products, industrial commodities, and our Consulting segment provides business and management consulting services to American and Chinese companies that operate primarily in China and the Americas.
   Our corporate headquarters are in Plantation, Florida, which houses the U.S. executive and administrative team that guides our overall operations. Our U.S. office employs English and Chinese speaking business and accounting staff. These professionals focus on due diligence, business development, marketing, accounting and compliance with the reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and other applicable laws in the U.S. and the People's Republic of China ("PRC").
   Historically, we had the third segment, Magnesium segment, which represented our largest segment by assets and revenues. On September 30, 2014, we signed a Share Exchange Agreement with Yuwei Huang, a related party, selling our Magnesium Segment to Mr. Huang and in return, Mr. Huang and other parties have returned and cancelled 8,075,949 shares of the Company's common stock held by such parties related to Mr. Huang. In addition, 41,524 shares of convertible Series D Preferred Stock were cancelled within 10 business days after the Share Exchange Agreement was signed.
 
 On March 7, 2016, the Company entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Acquisition Agreement") to acquire 100% ownership interest in China Manor Assets Investment Management Company, Ltd. ("CMAIM") in exchange for the 1,670,000 shares of the Company's Series G convertible preferred stock. The preferred stock can be converted to Company's common stock upon a listing of the Company's common stock on NYSE or NASDAQ. The convertibility ratio is one share of the preferred stock to one thousand shares of Company's common stock. Each share of the preferred stock has the voting rights of 1,000 shares of Company common stock; and, thus, Xiangjun Wang, the sole equity owner of CMAIM, will be able to vote approximately 70% of the Company's common stock and control the Company. CDII prepared for issuance to Mr. Xiangjun Wang, the sole equity owner of CMAIM, 1,670,000 shares of company's Series G convertible preferred stock on April 30, 2016. However, the Company did not receive the equity interest of CMAIM and the preferred stock was not issued to Mr. Xiangjun Wang. On June 30, 2016, both parties agreed in formal writing to postpone the Acquisition Agreement due to the fact that certain capitalization conditions of CMAIM were not met. In September 2016, the Company cancelled the Series G convertible preferred stock that was prepared to be issued to Mr. Xiangjun Wang and the acquisition was terminated. As a result of certain closing conditions not being met, the transaction did not close.
 
In April 2015, we sold our entire 95% equity interest in CDI Jingkun Zinc Industry Co., Ltd. ("CDI Jingkun Zinc") and 100% equity interest in Shanghai CDI Metal Material Co., Ltd. ("CDI Metal") to Xiaowen Zhuang, a related party individual, for zero consideration. We also sold our 100% equity interest in CDI Jixiang Metal Co., Ltd. ("CDI Jixiang Metal") to Dragon Capital Group Corp. ("Dragon Capital"), a related party company, for zero consideration. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the Company also terminated operations in Chile. The Chilean government has granted us approval to officially close down the business on July 31, 2015.
   In April 2016, the Company ceased the operations and abandoned Capital Resource Management Co., Ltd. ("Capital Resource Management"), an entity in the Consulting segment. The disposal of Capital Resource Management does not qualify as discontinued operations, nor is it a significant disposition because Capital Resource Management had limited net assets and engaged in minimal operations. The loss on disposal of Capital Resource Management was $50,590, which was reported as "loss on disposal of subsidiary" for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.

  Corporate Initiatives
   In our Trading segment, we commenced sales from our U.S.-based industrial commodities business.  We established operations in Chile, Peru and Bolivia where we entered into contracts with local operators and producers to secure supplies of iron ore, copper concentrate and other minerals. Throughout the course of fiscal year 2012 to 2016 we have developed a relationship with a leading European logistics and trading solution company to sell our sourced iron ore and copper concentrate for delivery into China. We have also worked with our suppliers and local governmental authorities to obtain the necessary permits and approvals to process and export iron ore and copper concentrate on a continuous basis in these countries.  
           We operate our Trading segment under our wholly owned subsidiary of CDII Minerals, Inc., which was incorporated in June 2010 in Florida. Beginning operations under its predecessor CDII Trading in 2008, CDII Minerals is strategically positioned throughout several countries in South America and has developed the foundation and relationships to expand rapidly. In fiscal year 2014, we purchased iron ore in Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile and exported to China. In fiscal year 2016 and 2015, we did not generate any revenues from the Trading segment. Currently, we are working on expanding our trading business in South America and also looking into various business opportunities with local companies that have good business in the U.S.
   In our Consulting segment, we operate under our wholly owned subsidiaries named China Direct Investments, Inc. and CDI Shanghai Management which provide a suite of consulting services to American and Chinese companies that operate primarily in China and the American. We currently have service contracts with clients who conduct business in China or seek to conduct business within China. We generate revenues by providing consulting services in the areas of capital structures and arrangements, mergers, acquisitions and other business transactions, identifying potential areas of growth, translation services, managing and coordinating all necessary government approvals and licenses in the PRC, marketing services and coordination of the preparation of required SEC filings.
   Our Consulting segment revenues primarily consist of consulting and advisory service fees we received from certain publicly traded U.S. companies with their primary business operations located in the PRC. Our consulting fees vary based upon the scope of the services to be rendered. Historically, a significant portion of the fees we earned have been paid in the form of our clients' securities. We classify these securities as investments in marketable securities available-for-sale or investment in marketable securities available-for-sale-related party. We receive a fixed number of shares of their marketable securities or fees from those client companies, including both recurring and one-time transaction fees for services provided to clients. Consulting segment revenues vary from period to period depending upon the timing, nature and scope of services we provide to a particular client. In addition to potential transaction fees, we also anticipate receiving additional client fees generated from our ongoing annual service contracts.
   TRADING SEGMENT
   The scope of CDII trading services include purchasing, brokering, quality control, in addition to conducting comprehensive legal, financial, and technical due diligence on suppliers. In order to fulfill a niche market and facilitate smooth transactions, we have strategically placed ourselves between our suppliers in both North and South America and our buyers in China. We continue to strengthen our sources of supply and distribution networks by sourcing materials from independent producers in various regions of North and South America to help meet the growing demands of our customers in China.
   Our Trading segment engages in the sourcing of the global purchase and sale of industrial commodities in the Americas, which include Cannabidiol (CBD)-related products, oil-related products, mineral ores and non-ferrous metals. In fiscal year 2016 and 2015, we do not have revenues from the Trading segment as we adjust our business model. We have focused on the South American market and have established offices in Chile, Peru and Bolivia, but the operation costs were very high and, given the continuing drop of the iron ore market price and other mineral market price, we suspended operations in Chile and Peru on September 30, 2014. In fiscal year 2014, we delivered copper concentrate from Chile and Bolivia to China. In order to fulfill a niche market and facilitate smooth transactions, we have been strategically placing ourselves between our suppliers in South America and our buyers in China. Currently, we are working on expanding our trading business in South America and also looking into various business opportunities with local companies that have good business in South America and Asia.
 
We disposed of some entities under this segment in fiscal year 2016 and 2015. See Item 1 for more discussion.

  CONSULTING SEGMENT
   In our Consulting segment, we provide a suite of consulting services to American and Chinese companies that operate primarily in China and the Americas. We currently have service contracts with clients who conduct business in China or seek to conduct business within China. We generate revenues by providing consulting services in the areas of capital structures and arrangements, mergers, acquisitions and other business transactions, identifying potential areas of growth, translation services, managing and coordinating all necessary government approvals and licenses in the PRC, marketing services, investor relations services, and coordination of the preparation of required SEC filings. Our Consulting segment generated approximately $83,000 in revenues during fiscal year 2016, and $360,000 in fiscal year 2015.
   The scope of our Consulting segment is to offer a comprehensive suite of services tailored to meet the needs of each individual client. A significant component of our competitive advantage lies in the quality of our personnel. Members of our team possess a working knowledge of the unique characteristics of business operations in the Americas and China. Our function is to provide the necessary resources for Chinese entities to invest in the Americas or oversea clients to invest in China.
 
Our culturally diverse team has the critical edge in generating global commerce opportunities to these small to medium sized emerging companies. We seek to help navigate through what are often confusing cultural and legal challenges. Our team members have strong working knowledge of the unique characteristics of business operations in the U.S., China, and South America. By employing a multicultural team, through our offices in the U.S., Shanghai, and various locations in South America, we possess numerous advantages critical to international business success. Our Consulting segment revenues primarily consist of consulting and advisory service fees we received from certain publicly traded U.S. companies with their primary business operations located in the PRC. Our consulting fees vary based upon the scope of the services to be rendered. Historically, a significant portion of the fees we earned have been paid in the form of our clients' securities. We classify these securities as investments in marketable securities available-for-sale or investment in marketable securities available-for-sale-related party. We receive a fixed number of shares of their marketable securities or fees from those client companies, including both recurring and one-time transaction fees for services provided to clients. Consulting segment revenues vary from period to period depending upon the timing, nature and scope of services we provide to a particular client. In addition to potential transaction fees, we also anticipate receiving additional client fees generated from our ongoing annual service contracts.
   Currently, we are providing advisory and management services to our current clients and meanwhile are looking into opportunities to work with local firms for appropriate funding programs.
   EMPLOYEES
   As of September 30, 2016 we have 8 full-time employees, including 4 full-time employees in the United States and 4 full-time employees in the PRC. We believe we have good working relationships with our employees. We are currently not a party to any collective bargaining agreements.
   For our employees in the PRC, we are required to contribute a portion of their total salaries to the Chinese government's social insurance funds, including medical insurance, unemployment insurance and job injuries insurance, as well as a housing assistance fund, in accordance with relevant regulations. We expect the amount of our contribution to the government's social insurance funds to increase in the future as we expand our workforce and operations.
   COMPETITION
   Our subsidiaries and the business segments they operate in face unique challenges and extensive competition.
   Trading Segment. While we believe our subsidiaries in this segment have viable business models, we also recognize that many rival entities possess greater financial and technical resources to compete in these businesses. We compete with a variety of companies, which include global and domestic distribution agents as well as manufacturers. These companies have more capital, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial and marketing resources than us. These competitors may offer a more comprehensive array of products and services than we are able to provide. For these and other reasons, these competitors may achieve greater acceptance in the marketplace than our company, limiting our ability to gain market share and customer loyalty and increase our revenues. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of price and availability of the products we sell. In fiscal year 2015, we disposed of some entities under this segment. See Item 1 for more discussion.

  Consulting Segment. The services we offer in our Consulting segment compete with the services offered by many entities and individuals seeking to take advantage of the growing need of Chinese entities seeking management advice in order to obtain access to U.S. capital markets for their expansion. This competition ranges from large management consulting firms and investment banks that offer a broad range of consulting and financial services, to small companies and independent contractors that provide specialized services. Many of the firms prospecting these clients are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Furthermore, we acknowledge we are competing with firms that may possess greater financial, marketing, technical, human and other resources. We believe that we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to offer a wider range of value-added services than our competitors. In light of the current global economic environment and a continuation of the downturn in the global capital markets and concerns of China based companies, we believe it is difficult for smaller companies with operations based in China to attract interest in the financial community, make acquisitions and increase revenues and profitability. These factors impact our clients' ability to pay the management fees needed to meet the costs of providing the services needed to comply with U.S. securities laws, which our competitors may be able to provide at lower rates.
   INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
   We have registered the trademarks "China Direct", "Your Direct Link to China" and "CDI" in the United States. We do not consider the protection of our trademarks and brand names to be important to our business.
   GOVERNMENT REGULATION
   Despite efforts to develop the legal system over the past several decades, including but not limited to legislation dealing with economic matters such as foreign investment, corporate organization and governance, commerce, taxation and trade, the PRC continues to lack a comprehensive system of laws. Further, the laws that do exist in the PRC are often vague, ambiguous and difficult to enforce, which could negatively affect our ability to do business in the PRC and compete with other companies in our segments.
   In September 2006, the Ministry of Commerce promulgated the Regulations on Foreign Investors' Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises ("M&A Regulations") in an effort to better regulate foreign investment in the PRC. The M&A Regulations were adopted in part as a needed codification of certain joint venture formation and operating practices, and also in response to the government's increasing concern about protecting domestic companies in perceived key industries and those associated with national security, as well as the outflow of well-known trademarks, including traditional Chinese brands.
 
As a U.S. based company doing business in the PRC, we seek to comply with all PRC laws, rules and regulations and pronouncements, and endeavor to obtain all necessary approvals from applicable PRC regulatory agencies such as the Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.
   Economic Reform Issues
   Since 1979, the Chinese government has reformed its economic systems. Many reforms are unprecedented or experimental; therefore they are expected to be refined and improved. Other political, economic and social factors, such as political changes, changes in the rates of economic growth, unemployment, inflation, or the disparities in per capita wealth among regions in the PRC, could lead to further readjustment of the reform measures. We cannot predict if this refining and readjustment process may negatively affect our operations in future periods, particularly in relation to future policies including but not limited to foreign investment, taxation, inflation and trade.
Currency
   The value of the Renminbi ("RMB"), the main currency used in the PRC, fluctuates and is affected by, among other things, changes in the PRC's political and economic conditions. The conversion of RMB into foreign currencies such as the U.S. dollar have been generally based on rates set by the People's Bank of China, which are set daily based on the previous day's interbank foreign exchange market rates and current exchange rates on the world financial markets. The currency exchange and fund transfers are regulated by China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange, which sets the relevant laws, regulations, and carries out the supervision of currency exchanges and cross border transfers of related funds, and imposes restrictions and regulatory controls over such exchanges and transfers.

  Environment
   We are currently subject to numerous regulations relating to the protection of the environment which are highly relevant to our Trading segments in South America. These laws continue to evolve and are becoming increasingly stringent. The ultimate impact of complying with such laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable because regulations under some of these laws have not yet been promulgated or are undergoing revision. In fiscal year 2016 and 2015 we did not spend any funds related to compliance with environmental regulations.
   The Environmental Protection Law requires production facilities that may cause pollution or produce other toxic materials to take steps to protect the environment and establish an environmental protection and management system. Penalties for breaching the Environmental Protection Law include a warning, payment of a penalty calculated on the damage incurred, or payment of a fine. When an entity has failed to adopt preventive measures or control facilities that meet the requirements of environmental protection standards, it may be required to suspend its production or operations and pay a fine.
   OUR CORPORATE HISTORY
   We were incorporated on June 7, 1999 in Delaware initially under the name Caprock Corporation to engage in any lawful corporate undertaking, including, but not limited to, selected mergers and acquisitions.
  Between 1999 and 2005 we operated a number of small, start up or development stage businesses. In October 2005, we became a shell company and began a search for a business combination candidate.
   On August 16, 2006 we acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding stock of China Direct Investments in exchange for 10,000,000 shares of our common stock, which at closing, represented approximately 95% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. China Direct Investments was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on January 18, 2005 and its operations constitute our Consulting segment. As a result of the reverse merger transaction, China Direct Investments became a wholly owned subsidiary and the transaction resulted in a change of control of our company. For financial accounting purposes, the transaction in which we acquired China Direct Investments was treated as a recapitalization of our company with our former stockholders retaining approximately 5.0% of our outstanding common stock.
   In September 2006, we changed our name to China Direct, Inc. and in June 2007 we re-domiciled our company from Delaware to Florida. Subsequent to the transaction with China Direct Investments in August 2006, we have substantially grown our business by acquiring growth-oriented companies in the PRC.
   In February 2007, we acquired a 51% interest in CDI Magnesium in exchange for 25,000 shares of our common stock valued at $100,000. The fair value of our common stock was based on its value of $4.00 per share on February 6, 2007. We dissolved CDI Magnesium as of September 30, 2011 and wrote off our investment of $100,000 in the company in fiscal year 2011 upon completion of our sale of our 51% interest in Pan Asia Magnesium discussed below.
   In September 2007, we acquired a 51% interest in Pan Asia Magnesium in exchange for an aggregate investment of $7.4 million. We began presenting our interest in Pan Asia Magnesium as a discontinued operation beginning with our financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2009 as a result of a dispute with its former non-controlling shareholder and recorded a $7.4 million impairment charge against our investment in Pan Asia Magnesium.  On September 15, 2011 we completed the sale of our 51% ownership interest in Pan Asia Magnesium to Bloomgain Investment Limited, a British Virgin Islands company, an unrelated party for $3,047,582 in cash.
    In February 2008, we acquired a 51% interest in Baotou Changxin Magnesium in exchange for $7,084,000 and an additional 39% interest in Baotou Changxin Magnesium in exchange for $5,417,000. Accordingly, we held a 70.9% interest in Baotou Changxin Magnesium. On February 29, 2012, we disposed Excel Rise, which is a shareholder of Baotou Changxin Magnesium. After the disposal, we held 51% interest in Baotou Changxin Magnesium. As described elsewhere herein, in September 2012 we discontinued the operations of Baotou Changxin Magnesium.
   In February 2008, we invested $347,222 to acquire an 83% interest in Shanghai CDI Metal. In July 2011, we acquired the remaining 17% non-controlling interest in CDI Metal from its former non-controlling shareholder in exchange for the forgiveness of a loan from CDI Metal to such shareholder in the principal amount of RMB 100,000 (approximately $76,585).

  In June 2008, we entered into an agreement to form CDI Beijing. Under the terms of the Agreement, we acquired a 51% interest in CDI Beijing for approximately $1.5 million.  On December 30, 2009, the shareholders of CDI Beijing agreed to limit their capital contributions to the $2.9 million they had already contributed and waived their requirement to contribute additional capital including our obligation to contribute $2,200,000 by September 30, 2009.
   On March 29, 2009 we changed our name to China Direct Industries, Inc. to more accurately reflect our principal business of producing magnesium and distributing basic materials in the PRC.
   On July 13, 2010, we entered into an equity transfer agreement with Pine Capital Enterprises, Inc. ("Pine Capital") and Taiyuan Yiwei Magnesium Industry Co., Ltd. ("Yiwei Magnesium") to acquire an 80% interest in Ruiming Magnesium effective as of July 1, 2010, for RMB 44,880,000 (approximately $6,451,677) comprised of $2,428,864 in cash, 769,231 shares of our common stock valued at $846,154, and an assignment of a portion of our interest in Excel Rise in the amount of $2,367,038. The remaining 20% interest in Ruiming Magnesium is owned by Pine Capital. Yuwei Huang, our executive vice president - magnesium and member of our board of directors, owns or controls Pine Capital and Yiwei Magnesium.
   On May 6, 2011 we entered into a stock transfer contract with Mr. Kong Tung, a member of our board of directors, and Mr. Hui Dong, his son, both of whom were the shareholders of our subsidiary Beauty East prior to our acquisition of that company. We acquired 100% of Beauty East in exchange for 4,879,280 shares of our common stock valued at $6,147,893 or $1.26 per share.
   On August 29, 2011, we signed the acquisition agreements for 100% of Golden Trust Magnesium and 80% of Lingshi Magnesium. We subsequently entered into several supplemental agreements and pursuant to the last supplemental agreement, the aggregate purchase price was $26.4 million, to be paid by a combination of $15.0 million in cash or assignment of intercompany loans, $6.7 million in shares of our common stock, and $4.7 million by way of transferring our interest in our Excel Rise subsidiary. The Company completed the acquisition of Lingshi Magnesium on August 12, 2013 and the acquisition of Golden Trust Magnesium on March 7, 2014.
 
On February 29, 2012, our shareholders approved an amendment to our articles of incorporation in order to change our corporate name from China Direct Industries, Inc. to CD International Enterprises, Inc.
   On September 28, 2012, we sold our 51% interest in Lang Chemical for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $1.2 million, with $600,000 tendered at closing and the balance payable over a year with annual interest of 6% per year payable in quarterly installments. We acquired our stake in Lang Chemical in 2006 for approximately $700,000. This disposition is consistent with our strategy to streamline our investment and assets in China committed to this segment due to poor performance over the past year and realign our investments to our industrial commodities business in the Americas to maximize our profits and cash flow over the next fiscal year and beyond.
   On October 8, 2012, we sold our 51% interest in CDI Beijing for $1.6 million pursuant to the terms of an equity transfer agreement by and among CDI Shanghai Management, CDI Beijing and Chi Chen and Huijuan Chen. Mr. Chi Chen served as vice president of our Mineral Trading segment and was a minority owner of CDI Beijing. .

The preferred stock can be converted to CDII common stock as of October 1, 2017 at a ratio of each share of the preferred stock to 1,000 shares of CDII common stock. The conversion price shall be $0.064 per share, the average closing price of CDII common stock 10 trading days (September 16 to September 29, 2014) prior to September 30, 2014. The preferred stock has no voting rights. The payment of the Note will rely on cash flow of EM operations and/or future financing of CDII.

On January 8, 2015, CD International Enterprises, Inc., EM Resources Enterprises, Inc., and Manuel Mustafa, the President and sole owner of EM, elected not to proceed with the merger between the Company and EM. This agreement was terminated without penalty to the Company or EM pursuant to the Acquisition Termination Agreement between the parties dated January 8, 2015 as all parties desired to terminate the Merger Agreements for mutual benefit.

   In April 2016, the Company ceased the operation and disposed of Capital Resource Management Co., Ltd. ("Capital Resource Management"), an entity in the Consulting segment. The disposal of Capital Resource Management does not qualify as discontinued operations, nor is it a significant disposition because Capital Resource Management had limited net assets and engaged in minimal operations. The loss on disposal of Capital Resource Management was $50,590, which was reported as "loss on disposal of subsidiary" for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016.
