The Company is a fertilizer-related products and equipment exporter. We will sell production equipment to buyers on an international basis. We have a twenty year contract with Harbin Haixin Biological Fertilizer Co., Ltd., and will work towards modernizing production technology to make sure that individuals and producers the world over may economically produce natural fertilizer. For example, the Harbin Haixin Biological Fertilizer Co., Ltd., currently produces 5000 tons of natural fertilizer annually. In 2010 at the local county in which they reside, half of the 82 villages there used Harbin Haixin Biological Fertilizer Co. products, and the acreage utilizing the product totaled 8600 mu. Harbin Haixin Biological Fertilizer Co., Ltd., currently forecasts that sales of fertilizer will grow to 100,000 tons annually, with a total investment profit of 60,000,000.
 
The Company entered a cooperation agreement to form a joint venture with an unrelated foreign company on October 31, 2010.

Harbin Haixin Biological Fertilizer Co., Ltd., currently produces 5000 tons of natural fertilizer annually. In 2010, half of the 82 villages in the local county there used Haixin Brand Organic Fertilizer; the acreage utilizing the product totaled more than 5 million square meter according to Harbin Haizin Biological Fertilizer Co., Ltd.. Harbin Haixin Biological Fertilizer Co., Ltd., currently forecasts that sales of fertilizer will grow to 100,000 tons annually, with a total investment profit of 60,000,000 RMB.
 
The other party to the cooperation intent joint venture agreement was formed in 2009 and has 35 employees according to information provided by the company. Green industries are very popular and growing especially in the Heilongjiang Province in China.
 

The Chinese party to the cooperation agreement is located in Heilongjiang Province China. The following are taken from “Overview of Green Food Industry in Heilongjiang China” provided by the Department of Commerce of Heilongjiang Province:
 
Heilongjiang, located in the northeast of China, is the Northernmost province and of the highest latitude in China, named after the largest river inside its territory.

Heilongjiang Habitats the cold temperate zone continental monsoon climate with an average temperature altering from -4degrees to 5degrees C, long winters, high temperature, abundant rainfall and long sunshine period in summers, which is appropriate for the growth of crops. In addition, as Heilongjiang possesses one of the three world famous black soil zones, the organic content of the soil is higher than other parts of China, Black Soil, Chernozem and Meadow Soil occupying more than 70% of its arable land, as a result, Heilongjiang is an important commodity grain base and green food processing base in China, the home of food crops like soybean, rice, corn, wheat and potato; and of economic crops like sugar beet, flax and cured tomato. Being one of the key pasturing areas, Heilongjiang boasts 4.33-million-hectacre grasslands with high quality forage of high-value nutrition, proper for developing animal husbandry.
 
In the early 1990s, Heilong started to develop green food products. Until 2011, the areas certified by Green Food standard have reached 4,287,000 hectacres, one quarter of the total areas in China; national-level standardized material production base of green food has extended to 3,4000,000 hectacres, half of the total amount in China; the total output of green food in Heilong has achieved 29,500,000 metric tons, the total output value over 100 billion rmb yuan; there are 520 green food manufacturers that can produce eight types of food including green rice, dairy and mountain products, etc. Apart from that, there have been over 1200 green food sales outlets at home and more than 200 sales outlets at abroad, mostly in the US, Japan and Southeast Asia. By the end of 2012, the certificated area of place of origin of green food will have reached 4,467,000 hectacres, a predicted output of 31,500,000 metric tons.
 
In 2009, green (organic) food processing enterprises in the province developed to 500, sales income reached RMB 28.5 billion Yuan. 15 green food products were awarded as “Famous Brand in China”.
 
Under the contract with Harbin Haixin Biological Fertilizer Co., Ltd., if the Joint Venture moves forward, the Company will be a 16.25% partner in a Joint Venture for the production of organic biological fertilizer and organic rice. The duties of the Company under the contract are a $1,000,000 capital contribution, to assist the purchase in the United States of the facilities and equipment needed in the project and shipped to Chinese ports, to assist in all relevant matters such as the purchase of machinery and equipment, and materials outside China commissioned by the parties, to provide the needed equipment for installation, debugging and trial production, as well as technical personnel, production and testing technicians, to train the technical personnel and workers required by the project, to assist and handle the related formalities for Chinese workers, of the project to enter the United States, and to be responsible for handling other matters entrusted by the partners.
 
We will work hard to scour the United States and elsewhere for companies producing the very best in the industrial-scale agricultural equipment used in producing natural fertilizer. It may take us several months to build a network of business contacts to facilitate the commencement of purchase of equipment. Once adequate efficiencies are achieved in logistics and supply, we may begin an international marketing campaign, at first maximizing the personal contacts of our founders, to guarantee a suitable market for our products. 
 
The company plans especially to target the lucrative China market. According to our research, 10% of the Chinese market would amount to 14,000,000 tons of natural fertilizer sales. Each ton of natural fertilizer sells for 500 to 1,200 RMB. In areas such as Heilongjiang Province in China, which is experiencing a boom in rice production (41,533,000 mu of land in 2010), natural fertilizer is in especially high demand. Production of that amount of fertilizer will call for a large amount of modern equipment, which we plan to be able to provide to such companies.
 
Developing an adequate knowledge-base in terms of the regulations governing import and export of such equipment, and the network of providers and manufacturers involved, will take some time. That is why we plan to spend a considerable amount of labor and effort in obtaining the requisite knowledge, and/or recruiting suitable personnel to do the job.

The great harvest provided the most powerful protection to the supply of raw materials of "Ma Lang He" brand of organic rice. The great harvest also will greatly stimulate next year’s fertilizer sales and the rapid expansion of water rice production base.
