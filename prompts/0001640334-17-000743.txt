On November 30, 2015, we acquired a portfolio of mobile software applications for smartphones and tablets (“Apps”) pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”), by and between the Company and third parties.
 
Under the terms of the Agreement the parties agreed to sell certain assets, properties and contractual rights to the Company for $60,000 (the “Acquisition”). The $60,000 was paid by a related party and subsequently the Company provided 30,000,000 shares of common stock to the related party for the $60,000 payment and for $12,500 payment for legal fees. Further under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will employee two managers for a minimum term of one year. In addition, the individuals will be entitled to 10% of the Company’s annual profits as defined by the Agreement. The Company allocated the $60,000 purchase price to intangible assets as the assets purchased were without physical substance, and were paid by the related party. The intangible asset value was recorded as the full purchase price, and subsequently impaired as at December 31, 2015. Further under the terms of the Agreement the employees were issued a total of 300,000 shares of common stock valued at par, $0.002 per share.
