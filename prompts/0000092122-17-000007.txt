The predecessor Mississippi Power Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Maine on November 24, 1924 and was admitted to do business in Mississippi on December 23, 1924 and in Alabama on December 7, 1962.
In addition, Southern Company owns all of the common stock of Southern Power Company, which is also an operating public utility company. Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market. Southern Power Company is a corporation organized under the laws of Delaware on January 8, 2001. The term "Southern Power" when used herein refers to Southern Power Company and its subsidiaries while the term "Southern Power Company" when used herein refers only to the parent company.
On July 1, 2016, Southern Company completed the Merger for a total purchase price of approximately $8.0 billion and Southern Company Gas became a wholly-owned, direct subsidiary of Southern Company. Southern Company Gas is an energy services holding company whose primary business is the distribution of natural gas in seven states - Illinois, Georgia, Virginia, New Jersey, Florida, Tennessee, and Maryland - through the natural gas distribution utilities. Southern Company Gas is also involved in several other businesses that are complementary to the distribution of natural gas. Southern Company Gas was incorporated under the laws of the State of Georgia on November 27, 1995 for the primary purpose of becoming the holding company for Atlanta Gas Light Company, which was founded in 1856.
Southern Company also owns all of the outstanding common stock or membership interests of SCS, Southern LINC, Southern Holdings, Southern Nuclear, PowerSecure, and other direct and indirect subsidiaries. SCS, the system service company, has contracted with Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, Southern Power, Southern Company Gas, Southern Nuclear, SEGCO, and other subsidiaries to furnish, at direct or allocated cost and upon request, the following services: general and design engineering, operations, purchasing, accounting, finance and treasury, tax, information technology, marketing, auditing, insurance and pension administration, human resources, systems and procedures, digital wireless communication, and other services with respect to business and operations, construction management, and power pool transactions. Southern LINC provides digital wireless communications for use by Southern Company and its subsidiary companies and also markets these services to the public and provides fiber cable services within the Southeast. Southern Holdings is an intermediate holding company subsidiary, primarily for Southern Company's investments in leveraged leases and for other electric services. Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to the Southern Company system's nuclear power plants and is currently developing Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which are co-owned by Georgia Power. PowerSecure is a provider of products and services in the areas of distributed generation, energy efficiency, and utility infrastructure.

The Southern Company System
Traditional Electric Operating Companies
The traditional electric operating companies are vertically integrated utilities that own generation, transmission, and distribution facilities. See PROPERTIES in Item 2 herein for additional information on the traditional electric operating companies' generating facilities. Each company's transmission facilities are connected to the respective company's own generating plants and other sources of power (including certain generating plants owned by Southern Power) and are interconnected with the transmission facilities of the other traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. For information on the State of Georgia's integrated transmission system, see "Territory Served by the Southern Company System â€“ Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power" herein.
Agreements in effect with principal neighboring utility systems provide for capacity and energy transactions that may be entered into from time to time for reasons related to reliability or economics. Additionally, the traditional electric operating companies have entered into voluntary reliability agreements with the subsidiaries of Entergy Corporation, Florida Electric Power Coordinating Group, and Tennessee Valley Authority and with Duke Energy Progress, LLC, Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC, South Carolina Electric & Gas Company, and Virginia Electric and Power Company, each of which provides for the establishment and periodic review of principles and procedures for planning and operation of generation and transmission facilities, maintenance schedules, load retention programs, emergency operations, and other matters affecting the reliability of bulk power supply. The traditional electric operating companies have joined with other utilities in the Southeast (including some of those referred to above) to form the SERC to augment further the reliability and adequacy of bulk power supply. Through the SERC, the traditional electric operating companies are represented on the National Electric Reliability Council.
The utility assets of the traditional electric operating companies and certain utility assets of Southern Power Company are operated as a single integrated electric system, or power pool, pursuant to the IIC. Activities under the IIC are administered by SCS, which acts as agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company. The fundamental purpose of the power pool is to provide for the coordinated operation of the electric facilities in an effort to achieve the maximum possible economies consistent with the highest practicable reliability of service. Subject to service requirements and other operating limitations, system resources are committed and controlled through the application of centralized economic dispatch. Under the IIC, each traditional electric operating company and Southern Power Company retains its lowest cost energy resources for the benefit of its own customers and delivers any excess energy to the power pool for use in serving customers of other traditional electric operating companies or Southern Power Company or for sale by the power pool to third parties. The IIC provides for the recovery of specified costs associated with the affiliated operations thereunder, as well as the proportionate sharing of costs and revenues resulting from power pool transactions with third parties.
Southern Power and Southern LINC have secured from the traditional electric operating companies certain services which are furnished at cost in compliance with FERC regulations.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power each have a contract with Southern Nuclear to operate the Southern Company system's existing nuclear plants, Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle. In addition, Georgia Power has a contract with Southern Nuclear to develop, license, construct, and operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See "Regulation â€“ Nuclear Regulation" herein for additional information.

Southern Power
Southern Power constructs, acquires, owns, and manages generation assets, including renewable energy projects, and sells electricity at market-based rates (under authority from the FERC) in the wholesale market. Southern Power continually seeks opportunities to execute its strategy to create value through various transactions including acquisitions and sales of assets, construction of new generating facilities, and entry into PPAs primarily with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load serving entities. Southern Power's business activities are not subject to traditional state regulation like the traditional electric operating companies, but the majority of its business activities are subject to regulation by the FERC. Southern Power has attempted to insulate itself from significant fuel supply, fuel transportation, and electric transmission risks by generally making such risks the responsibility of the counterparties to its PPAs. However, Southern Power's future earnings will depend on the parameters of the wholesale market and the efficient operation of its wholesale generating assets, as well as Southern Power's ability to execute its growth strategy and to construct generating facilities. For additional information on Southern Power's business activities, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ OVERVIEW â€“ "Business Activities" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein.
Southern Power Company directly owns and manages generation assets primarily in the Southeast, which are included in the power pool, and has other wholly-owned subsidiaries, two of which are Southern Renewable Energy, Inc. (SRE) and Southern Renewable Partnerships, LLC (SRP), which were created to own and operate renewable generation facilities either wholly or in partnership with various third parties, including Turner Renewable Energy, LLC (TRE), First Solar Inc., Recurrent Energy, a subsidiary of Canadian Solar Inc., or SunPower Corp. The generation assets of these subsidiaries are not included in the power pool. In addition, Southern Power Company has other subsidiaries either with natural gas and biomass generating facilities or pursuing additional natural gas generation and other development opportunities. 
Some of SRP's partnerships allow for the sharing of cash distributions and tax benefits at differing percentages. SRP is entitled to 51% of all cash distributions from eight of the partnership entities and the respective partner who holds the class B membership interests is entitled to 49% of all cash distributions. For the Desert Stateline partnership, SRP is entitled to 66% of all cash distributions and the class B member is entitled to 34% of all cash distributions. In addition, Southern Power is entitled to substantially all of the federal tax benefits with respect to these nine partnership entities. 
During 2016, Southern Power acquired or commenced construction of approximately 2,134 MWs of additional solar, wind, and natural gas facilities and completed construction of approximately 1,060 MWs of solar facilities. The aggregate purchase price for projects acquired by Southern Power's subsidiaries during 2016 and 2015 was $2.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. During 2016, Southern Power's subsidiaries completed construction of and placed in service projects with a total construction cost of approximately $3.2 billion.
In December 2016, as part of Southern Power's renewable development strategy, SRP entered into a joint development agreement with Renewable Energy Systems Americas, Inc. (RES) to develop and construct approximately 3,000 MWs across 10 wind projects expected to be placed in service between 2018 and 2020. Also in December 2016, Southern Power signed agreements and made payments to purchase wind turbine equipment from Siemens Wind Projects, Inc. and Vestas-American Wind Technology, Inc. to be used for construction of the facilities. Once these wind projects reach commercial operation, they are expected to qualify for 100% production tax credits (PTCs).
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. For additional information on SRE and SRP, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ "Acquisitions" and "Construction Projects" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein.
See Item 2 â€“ Properties, Note 2 to the financial statements of Southern Power in Item 8 herein, and Note 12 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Southern Power" in Item 8 herein for additional information regarding Southern Power's acquisitions, construction, and development projects. 
As of December 31, 2016, Southern Power owned generating units totaling 11,768 MWs of nameplate capacity in commercial operation, after taking into consideration its equity ownership percentage of the solar and wind facilities. Southern Power calculates an investment coverage ratio for its generating assets based on the ratio of investment under contract to total investment using the respective generation facilities' net book value (or expected in-service value for facilities under construction or being acquired) as the investment amount. With the inclusion of the PPAs and investment associated with the solar and natural-gas fired facilities currently under construction and Bethel Wind, which was acquired subsequent to December 31, 2016, as well as other capacity and energy contracts, Southern Power has an average investment coverage ratio of 91% through 2021 and 90% through 2026, with an average remaining contract duration of approximately 16 years. 
Southern Power's natural gas and biomass sales are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated plant unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block 
I-3

                                    Index to Financial Statements

sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.
Southern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are predominantly through long-term PPAs; however, these solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid.
The following tables set forth Southern Power's PPAs as of December 31, 2016:

Financing Programs
See each of the registrant's MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY in Item 7 herein and Note 6 to the financial statements of each registrant in Item 8 herein for information concerning financing programs.
Fuel Supply
Electric
The traditional electric operating companies' and SEGCO's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas and coal. Southern Power's supply of electricity is primarily fueled by natural gas. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ RESULTS OF OPERATION â€“ "Electricity Business â€“ Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" of Southern Company and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ RESULTS OF OPERATION â€“ "Fuel and Purchased Power Expenses" of each traditional electric operating company in Item 7 herein for information regarding the electricity generated and the average cost of fuel in cents per net KWH generated for the years 2014 through 2016.
The traditional electric operating companies have agreements in place from which they expect to receive substantially all of their coal burn requirements in 2017. These agreements have terms ranging between one and four years. In 2016, the weighted average sulfur content of all coal burned by the traditional electric operating companies was 0.98% sulfur. This sulfur level, along with banked and purchased sulfur dioxide allowances, allowed the traditional electric operating companies to remain within limits set by Phase I of the Cross-State Air Pollution Rule (CSAPR) under the Clean Air Act. In 2016, the Southern Company system did not purchase any sulfur dioxide allowances, annual nitrogen oxide emission allowances, or seasonal nitrogen oxide emission allowances from the market. As any additional environmental regulations are proposed that impact the utilization of coal, the traditional electric operating companies' fuel mix will be monitored to help ensure that the traditional electric operating companies remain in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Additionally, Southern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to evaluate the need to purchase additional emissions allowances, the timing of capital expenditures for emissions control equipment, and potential unit retirements and replacements. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, and Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information on environmental matters.
SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company, has agreements in place for the natural gas burn requirements of the Southern Company system. For 2017, SCS has contracted for 477 Bcf of natural gas supply under agreements with remaining terms up to 15 years. In addition to natural gas supply, SCS has contracts in place for both firm natural gas transportation and storage. Management believes these contracts provide sufficient natural gas supplies, transportation, and storage to ensure normal operations of the Southern Company system's natural gas generating units.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have multiple contracts covering their nuclear fuel needs for uranium, conversion services, enrichment services, and fuel fabrication. The uranium, conversion services, and fuel fabrication contracts are for terms of less than 10 years with varying expiration dates. The term lengths for the enrichment services contracts are for less than 15 years with varying expiration dates. Management believes suppliers have sufficient nuclear fuel production capability to permit the normal operation of the Southern Company system's nuclear generating units.
Changes in fuel prices to the traditional electric operating companies are generally reflected in fuel adjustment clauses contained in rate schedules. See "Rate Matters â€“ Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans" herein for additional information. Southern Power's PPAs (excluding solar and wind) generally provide that the counterparty is responsible for substantially all of the cost of fuel.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power have contracts with the United States, acting through the DOE, that provide for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The DOE failed to begin disposing of spent fuel in 1998, as required by the contracts, and Alabama Power and Georgia Power have pursued and are pursuing legal remedies against the government for breach of contract. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power under "Nuclear Fuel Disposal Costs" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Natural Gas 
Recent advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the U.S. have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas and relatively low prices for natural gas. Procurement plans for natural gas supply and transportation to serve regulated utility customers are reviewed and approved by the state regulatory agencies in which Southern Company Gas operates. Southern Company Gas purchases natural gas supplies in the open market by contracting with producers and marketers and from its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sequent Energy Management, L.P., under asset management agreements in 
I-9

                                    Index to Financial Statements

states where such agreements are approved by the applicable state regulatory agency. Southern Company Gas also contracts for transportation and storage services from interstate pipelines that are regulated by the FERC. When firm pipeline services are temporarily not needed, Southern Company Gas may release the services in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or utilize asset management arrangements, thereby reducing the net cost of natural gas charged to customers for most of the natural gas distribution utilities. Peak-use requirements are met through utilization of company-owned storage facilities, pipeline transportation capacity, purchased storage services, peaking facilities, and other supply sources, arranged by either transportation customers or Southern Company Gas.
Territory Served by the Southern Company System
Traditional Electric Operating Companies and Southern Power
The territory in which the traditional electric operating companies provide electric service comprises most of the states of Alabama and Georgia, together with the northwestern portion of Florida and southeastern Mississippi. In this territory there are non-affiliated electric distribution systems that obtain some or all of their power requirements either directly or indirectly from the traditional electric operating companies. As of December 31, 2016, the territory had an area of approximately 120,000 square miles and an estimated population of approximately 17 million. Southern Power sells electricity at market-based rates in the wholesale market, primarily to investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load serving entities.
Alabama Power is engaged, within the State of Alabama, in the generation, transmission, distribution, and purchase of electricity and the sale of electric service, at retail in approximately 400 cities and towns (including Anniston, Birmingham, Gadsden, Mobile, Montgomery, and Tuscaloosa), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale to 14 municipally-owned electric distribution systems, 11 of which are served indirectly through sales to AMEA, and two rural distributing cooperative associations. Alabama Power owns coal reserves near its Plant Gorgas and uses the output of coal from the reserves in its generating plants. Alabama Power also sells, and cooperates with dealers in promoting the sale of, electric appliances.
Georgia Power is engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution, and purchase of electricity and the sale of electric service within the State of Georgia, at retail in over 600 communities (including Athens, Atlanta, Augusta, Columbus, Macon, Rome, and Savannah), as well as in rural areas, and at wholesale currently to OPC, MEAG Power, Dalton, various EMCs, and non-affiliated utilities. Georgia Power also markets and sells outdoor lighting services.

For information relating to KWH sales by customer classification for the traditional electric operating companies, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ RESULTS OF OPERATIONS of each traditional electric operating company in Item 7 herein. Also, for information relating to the sources of revenues for Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, and Southern Power, reference is made to Item 7 herein.
The RUS has authority to make loans to cooperative associations or corporations to enable them to provide electric service to customers in rural sections of the country. As of December 31, 2016, there were 71 electric cooperative organizations operating in the territory in which the traditional electric operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale.
One of these organizations, PowerSouth, is a generating and transmitting cooperative selling power to several distributing cooperatives, municipal systems, and other customers in south Alabama and northwest Florida. As of December 31, 2016, PowerSouth owned generating units with approximately 2,100 MWs of nameplate capacity, including an undivided 8.16% ownership interest in Alabama Power's Plant Miller Units 1 and 2. PowerSouth's facilities were financed with RUS loans secured by long-term contracts requiring distributing cooperatives to take their requirements from PowerSouth to the extent such energy is available. See PROPERTIES â€“ "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for details of Alabama Power's joint-ownership with PowerSouth of a portion of Plant Miller. Alabama Power has a 15-year system supply agreement with PowerSouth to provide 200 MWs of capacity service with an option to extend and renegotiate in the event Alabama Power builds new generation or contracts for new capacity.
Alabama Power and Gulf Power have entered into separate agreements with PowerSouth involving interconnection between their respective systems. The delivery of capacity and energy from PowerSouth to certain distributing cooperatives in the 
I-10

                                    Index to Financial Statements

service territories of Alabama Power and Gulf Power is governed by the Southern Company/PowerSouth Network Transmission Service Agreement. The rates for this service to PowerSouth are on file with the FERC.
Four electric cooperative associations, financed by the RUS, operate within Gulf Power's service territory. These cooperatives purchase their full requirements from PowerSouth and SEPA (a federal power marketing agency). A non-affiliated utility also operates within Gulf Power's service territory and purchases its full requirements from Gulf Power.
Mississippi Power has an interchange agreement with SMEPA, a generating and transmitting cooperative, pursuant to which various services are provided.
As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately 65 municipally-owned electric distribution systems operating in the territory in which the traditional electric operating companies provide electric service at retail or wholesale.
As of December 31, 2016, 48 municipally-owned electric distribution systems and one county-owned system received their requirements through MEAG Power, which was established by a Georgia state statute in 1975. MEAG Power serves these requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and purchases from other resources. MEAG Power also has a pseudo scheduling and services agreement with Georgia Power. Dalton serves its requirements from self-owned generation facilities, some of which are jointly-owned with Georgia Power, and through purchases from Georgia Power and Southern Power through a service agreement. See PROPERTIES â€“ "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Georgia Power has entered into substantially similar agreements with Georgia Transmission Corporation, MEAG Power, and Dalton providing for the establishment of an integrated transmission system to carry the power and energy of all parties. The agreements require an investment by each party in the integrated transmission system in proportion to its respective share of the aggregate system load. See PROPERTIES â€“ "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Southern Power assumed or entered into PPAs with some of the traditional electric operating companies, investor-owned utilities, IPPs, municipalities, electric cooperatives, and other load serving entities. See "The Southern Company System â€“ Southern Power" above and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Power Sales Agreements" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information concerning Southern Power's PPAs.
SCS, acting on behalf of the traditional electric operating companies, also has a contract with SEPA providing for the use of the traditional electric operating companies' facilities at government expense to deliver to certain cooperatives and municipalities, entitled by federal statute to preference in the purchase of power from SEPA, quantities of power equivalent to the amounts of power allocated to them by SEPA from certain U.S. government hydroelectric projects.

Competition
Electric 
The electric utility industry in the U.S. is continuing to evolve as a result of regulatory and competitive factors. Among the early primary agents of change was the Energy Policy Act of 1992, which allowed IPPs to access a utility's transmission network in order to sell electricity to other utilities.
The competition for retail energy sales among competing suppliers of energy is influenced by various factors, including price, availability, technological advancements, service, and reliability. These factors are, in turn, affected by, among other influences, regulatory, political, and environmental considerations, taxation, and supply.
The retail service rights of all electric suppliers in the State of Georgia are regulated by the Territorial Electric Service Act of 1973. Pursuant to the provisions of this Act, all areas within existing municipal limits were assigned to the primary electric supplier therein. Areas outside of such municipal limits were either to be assigned or to be declared open for customer choice of supplier by action of the Georgia PSC pursuant to standards set forth in this Act. Consistent with such standards, the Georgia PSC has assigned substantially all of the land area in the state to a supplier. Notwithstanding such assignments, this Act provides that any new customer locating outside of 1973 municipal limits and having a connected load of at least 900 KWs may exercise a one-time choice for the life of the premises to receive electric service from the supplier of its choice.
Pursuant to the 1956 Utility Act, the Mississippi PSC issued "Grandfather Certificates" of public convenience and necessity to Mississippi Power and to six distribution rural cooperatives operating in southeastern Mississippi, then served in whole or in part by Mississippi Power, authorizing them to distribute electricity in certain specified geographically described areas of the state. The six cooperatives serve approximately 325,000 retail customers in a certificated area of approximately 10,300 square miles. In areas included in a "Grandfather Certificate," the utility holding such certificate may, without further certification, extend its lines up to five miles; other extensions within that area by such utility, or by other utilities, may not be made except upon a showing of, and a grant of a certificate of, public convenience and necessity. Areas included in such a certificate that are subsequently annexed to municipalities may continue to be served by the holder of the certificate, irrespective of whether it has a franchise in the annexing municipality. On the other hand, the holder of the municipal franchise may not extend service into such newly annexed area without authorization by the Mississippi PSC.
Generally, the traditional electric operating companies have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, competition in their respective retail service territories in varying degrees from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources such as self-generation (as described below) and distributed generation technologies, as well as other factors.
Southern Power competes with investor-owned utilities, IPPs, and others for wholesale energy sales primarily in the Southeastern U.S. wholesale market. The needs of this market are driven by the demands of end users in the Southeast and the generation available. Southern Power's success in wholesale energy sales is influenced by various factors including reliability and availability of Southern Power's plants, availability of transmission to serve the demand, price, and Southern Power's ability to contain costs.
As of December 31, 2016, Alabama Power had cogeneration contracts in effect with nine industrial customers. Under the terms of these contracts, Alabama Power purchases excess energy generated by such companies. During 2016, Alabama Power purchased approximately 78 million KWHs from such companies at a cost of $2 million.
As of December 31, 2016, Georgia Power had contracts in effect with 29 small power producers whereby Georgia Power purchases their excess generation. During 2016, Georgia Power purchased 1.2 billion KWHs from such companies at a cost of $88 million. Georgia Power also has PPAs for electricity with six cogeneration facilities. Payments are subject to reductions for failure to meet minimum capacity output. During 2016, Georgia Power purchased 512 million KWHs at a cost of $38 million from these facilities.
Also during 2016, Georgia Power purchased energy from three customer-owned generating facilities. These customers provide only energy to Georgia Power, make no capacity commitment, and are not dispatched by Georgia Power. During 2016, Georgia Power purchased a total of 46 million KWHs from the three customers at a cost of approximately $2 million.
As of December 31, 2016, Gulf Power had agreements in effect with various industrial, commercial, and qualifying facilities pursuant to which Gulf Power purchases "as available" energy from customer-owned generation. During 2016, Gulf Power purchased 228 million KWHs from such companies for approximately $6 million.
As of December 31, 2016, Mississippi Power had one cogeneration agreement in effect with one of its industrial customers. Under the terms of this contract, Mississippi Power purchases any excess generation. During 2016, Mississippi Power did not purchase any excess generation from this customer.

Natural Gas 
Southern Company Gas' regulated natural gas distribution utilities do not compete with other distributors of natural gas in their exclusive franchise territories but face competition from other energy products. Their principal competitors are electric utilities and fuel oil and propane providers serving the residential, commercial, and industrial markets in their service areas for customers who are considering switching to or from a natural gas appliance. 
Competition for heating as well as general household and small commercial energy needs generally occurs at the initial installation phase when the customer or builder makes decisions as to which types of equipment to install. Customers generally use the chosen energy source for the life of the equipment. 
Customer demand for natural gas could be affected by numerous factors, including:

â€¢ | changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy;


â€¢ | general economic conditions;


â€¢ | energy conservation, including state-supported energy efficiency programs;


â€¢ | legislation and regulations;


â€¢ | the cost and capability to convert from natural gas to alternative energy products; and


â€¢ | technological changes resulting in displacement or replacement of natural gas appliances.

Southern Company Gas continues to develop and grow its business through the use of a variety of targeted marketing programs designed to attract new customers and to retain existing customers. These efforts include working to add residential customers, multifamily complexes, and commercial customers who might use natural gas, as well as evaluating and launching new natural gas related programs, products, and services to enhance customer growth, mitigate customer attrition, and increase operating revenues.
The natural gas-related programs generally emphasize natural gas as the fuel of choice for customers and seek to expand the use of natural gas through a variety of promotional activities. In addition, Southern Company Gas partners with third-party entities to market the benefits of natural gas appliances.
Recent advances in natural gas drilling in shale producing regions of the U.S. have resulted in historically high supplies of natural gas and relatively low prices for natural gas. The availability and affordability of natural gas have provided cost advantages and further opportunity for growth of the businesses.
Seasonality
The demand for electric power and natural gas supply is affected by seasonal differences in the weather. In most of the areas the traditional electric operating companies serve, electric power sales peak during the summer, while in most of the areas Southern Company Gas serves, natural gas demand peaks during the winter. As a result, the overall operating results of Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in the future may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis. In addition, Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas have historically sold less power and natural gas when weather conditions are milder.
Regulation
State Commissions
The traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to the jurisdiction of their respective state PSCs or applicable state regulatory agencies. These regulatory bodies have broad powers of supervision and regulation over public utilities operating in the respective states, including their rates, service regulations, sales of securities (except for the Mississippi PSC), and, in the cases of the Georgia PSC and the Mississippi PSC, in part, retail service territories. See "Territory Served by the Southern Company System" and "Rate Matters" herein for additional information.
Federal Power Act
The traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries, and SEGCO are all public utilities engaged in wholesale sales of energy in interstate commerce and, therefore, are subject to the rate, financial, and accounting jurisdiction of the FERC under the Federal Power Act. The FERC must approve certain financings and allows an "at cost standard" for services rendered by system service companies such as SCS and Southern Nuclear. The FERC is also authorized to establish regional reliability organizations which enforce reliability standards, address impediments to the construction of transmission, and prohibit manipulative energy trading practices.
Alabama Power and Georgia Power are also subject to the provisions of the Federal Power Act or the earlier Federal Water Power Act applicable to licensees with respect to their hydroelectric developments. As of December 31, 2016, among the hydroelectric projects subject to licensing by the FERC are 14 existing Alabama Power generating stations having an aggregate 
I-13

                                    Index to Financial Statements

installed capacity of 1,670,000 KWs and 17 existing Georgia Power generating stations and one generating station partially owned by Georgia Power, with a combined aggregate installed capacity of 1,087,296 KWs.
In 2013, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for Alabama Power's seven hydroelectric developments on the Coosa River (Weiss, Henry, Logan Martin, Lay, Mitchell, Jordan, and Bouldin). Alabama Power filed a petition requesting rehearing of the FERC order granting the relicense seeking revisions to several conditions of the license. Alabama Rivers Alliance, American Rivers, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and the Atlanta Regional Commission also filed petitions for rehearing of the FERC order. On April 21, 2016, the FERC issued an order granting in part and denying in part Alabama Power's rehearing request. The order also denied rehearing requests filed by Alabama Rivers Alliance, American Rivers, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and the Atlanta Regional Commission. On May 17, 2016, Alabama Rivers Alliance and American Rivers filed a second rehearing request and on June 15, 2016, also filed a petition for review at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit of the license and the rehearing denial order.  The FERC issued an order on September 12, 2016 denying the second rehearing request, and American Rivers and Alabama Rivers Alliance subsequently filed an appeal of that order at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit has consolidated the two appeals into one proceeding.
In 2013, Alabama Power filed an application with the FERC to relicense the Holt hydroelectric project located on the Warrior River. The current Holt license expired on August 31, 2015. Since the FERC did not act on Alabama Power's new license application prior to expiration, the FERC issued to Alabama Power an annual license authorizing continued operation of the project under the terms and conditions of the expired license until action is taken on the new license and, on December 22, 2016, issued a new 50-year license to Alabama Power. 
In December 2015, the FERC issued a new 30-year license to Alabama Power for the Martin Dam project located on the Tallapoosa River. Alabama Rivers Alliance, American Rivers, the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, and the Atlanta Regional Commission filed petitions for rehearing of the FERC order, which the FERC denied on November 15, 2016.
In 2016, Georgia Power continued the process of developing an application to relicense the Wallace Dam project on the Oconee River. The current Wallace Dam project license will expire on June 1, 2020.
Georgia Power and OPC also have a license, expiring in 2027, for the Rocky Mountain Plant, a pure pumped storage facility of 847,800 KW capacity. See PROPERTIES â€“ "Jointly-Owned Facilities" in Item 2 herein for additional information.
Licenses for all projects, excluding those discussed above, expire in the years 2023-2040 in the case of Alabama Power's projects and in the years 2024-2044 in the case of Georgia Power's projects.
Upon or after the expiration of each license, the U.S. Government, by act of Congress, may take over the project or the FERC may relicense the project either to the original licensee or to a new licensee. In the event of takeover or relicensing to another, the original licensee is to be compensated in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Power Act, such compensation to reflect the net investment of the licensee in the project, not in excess of the fair value of the property, plus reasonable damages to other property of the licensee resulting from the severance therefrom of the property. The FERC may grant relicenses subject to certain requirements that could result in additional costs.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Nuclear Regulation
Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Southern Nuclear are subject to regulation by the NRC. The NRC is responsible for licensing and regulating nuclear facilities and materials and for conducting research in support of the licensing and regulatory process, as mandated by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended; the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974, as amended; and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978, as amended; and in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended, and other applicable statutes. These responsibilities also include protecting public health and safety, protecting the environment, protecting and safeguarding nuclear materials and nuclear power plants in the interest of national security, and assuring conformity with antitrust laws.
The NRC licenses for Georgia Power's Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 expire in 2034 and 2038, respectively. The NRC licenses for Alabama Power's Plant Farley Units 1 and 2 expire in 2037 and 2041, respectively. The NRC licenses for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 expire in 2047 and 2049, respectively.
In 2012, the NRC issued combined construction and operating licenses (COLs) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Receipt of the COLs allowed full construction to begin. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Retail Regulatory Matters â€“ Nuclear Construction" of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Regulatory Matters â€“ Georgia Power â€“ Nuclear Construction" and Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters â€“ Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information.

See Notes 1 and 9 to the financial statements of Southern Company, Alabama Power, and Georgia Power in Item 8 herein for information on nuclear decommissioning costs and nuclear insurance.
Environmental Statutes and Regulations
The Southern Company system's electric utilities' operations are subject to extensive regulation by state and federal environmental agencies under a variety of statutes and regulations governing environmental media, including air, water, and land resources. Included are laws and regulations regarding the handling and disposal of waste and release of hazardous substances from certain current and former operating sites, and locations affected by historical operations or subject to contractual obligations. Compliance with these existing environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, a major portion of which is expected to be recovered through existing ratemaking provisions or through market-based contracts. There is no assurance, however, that all such costs will be recovered. For Southern Company Gas, substantially all of these costs are related to former manufactured gas plants (MGP) sites, which are primarily recovered through existing ratemaking provisions. See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company Gas under "Environmental Matters" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Compliance with federal environmental statutes and resulting regulations has been, and will continue to be, a significant focus for Southern Company, each traditional electric operating company, Southern Power, SEGCO, and Southern Company Gas. In addition, existing environmental laws and regulations may be changed or new laws and regulations may be adopted or otherwise become applicable to the Southern Company system, including laws and regulations designed to address air and water quality, wastes, greenhouse gases, endangered species or other environmental and health concerns. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company and each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein for additional information about environmental issues, including, but not limited to, proposed and final regulations related to air quality, water quality, CCRs, and global climate issues. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Environmental Matters" of Southern Power in Item 7 herein for additional information about environmental issues and global climate issues. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company Gas in Item 7 herein for additional information about environmental remediation liabilities.
The Southern Company system's ultimate environmental compliance strategy, including potential electric generating unit retirement and replacement decisions, and future environmental capital expenditures will be affected by the final requirements of new or revised environmental regulations; the time periods over which compliance with regulations is required; individual state implementation of regulations, as applicable; the outcome of any legal challenges to the environmental rules; any additional rulemaking activities in response to legal challenges and court decisions; the cost, availability, and existing inventory of emissions allowances; the impact of future changes in generation and emissions-related technology; the fuel mix of the electric utilities; and environmental remediation requirements. Compliance costs may arise from existing unit retirements, installation of additional environmental controls, upgrades to the transmission system, closure and monitoring of CCR facilities, and adding or changing fuel sources for certain existing units. Environmental compliance spending over the next several years may differ materially from the amounts estimated. Such expenditures could affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition if such costs are not recovered on a timely basis through regulated rates for the traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities or through long-term wholesale agreements for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power. Further, higher costs that are recovered through regulated rates could contribute to reduced demand for energy, which could negatively affect results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition. Also see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Environmental Matters" of Southern Company, each of the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas in Item 7 herein for additional information. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
Compliance with any new federal or state legislation or regulations relating to air, water, and land resources or other environmental and health concerns could significantly affect the Southern Company system. Although new or revised environmental legislation or regulations could affect many areas of the electric utilities' and natural gas distribution utilities' operations, the full impact of any such changes cannot be determined at this time. Additionally, many commercial and industrial customers may also be affected by existing and future environmental requirements, which for some may have the potential to ultimately affect their demand for electricity and natural gas. See "Construction Program" herein for additional information.

Rate Matters
Rate Structure and Cost Recovery Plans
Electric
The rates and service regulations of the traditional electric operating companies are uniform for each class of service throughout their respective retail service territories. Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval.
The traditional electric operating companies recover their respective costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the respective PSCs. Approved environmental compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power, Gulf Power, and Mississippi Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at Georgia Power and Gulf Power through base rate proceedings.
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Regulatory Matters" of Southern Company and each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the traditional electric operating companies under "Retail Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Also, see Note 1 to the financial statements of Southern Company and each of the traditional electric operating companies in Item 8 herein for a discussion of recovery of fuel costs, storm damage costs, and environmental compliance costs through rate mechanisms.
See "Integrated Resource Planning" herein for a discussion of Georgia PSC certification of new demand-side or supply-side resources and decertification of existing supply-side resources for Georgia Power. In addition, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Retail Regulatory Matters â€“ Nuclear Construction" of Georgia Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Regulatory Matters â€“ Georgia Power â€“ Nuclear Construction" and Georgia Power under "Retail Regulatory Matters â€“ Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act and the Georgia PSC certification of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which have allowed Georgia Power to recover financing costs for construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 during the construction period beginning in 2011.
See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 herein and MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle â€“ Rate Recovery of Kemper IGCC Costs" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 herein for information on cost recovery plans with respect to the Kemper IGCC.
The traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "FERC Matters" of each of the registrants in Item 7 herein for information on the traditional electric operating companies' and Southern Power Company's market-based rate authority and a pending FERC proceeding relating to this authority.
Through 2015, long-term non-affiliate capacity sales from Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (205 MWs) provided the majority of Gulf Power's wholesale earnings. Contract expirations at the end of 2015 and the end of May 2016 related to Plant Scherer Unit 3 wholesale services had a material negative impact on Gulf Power's earnings in 2016 but did not have a material impact on Southern Company's earnings in 2016. Remaining contract sales from Plant Scherer Unit 3 cover approximately 24% of Gulf Power's ownership of the unit through 2019. On October 12, 2016, Gulf Power filed a petition (2016 Rate Case) with the Florida PSC requesting an annual increase in retail rates and charges of $106.8 million based on the projected test year of January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 and a retail return on equity (ROE) of 11% compared to the current retail ROE of 10.25%. The requested increase includes recovery of the portion of Plant Scherer Unit 3 that has been rededicated to serving retail customers following the contract expirations discussed above. If retail recovery of Plant Scherer Unit 3 is not approved by the Florida PSC in the 2016 Rate Case, Gulf Power may consider an asset sale. The current book

value of Gulf Power's ownership of Plant Scherer Unit 3 could exceed market value which could result in a material loss. The Florida PSC is expected to make a decision on the 2016 Rate Case in the second quarter 2017. Gulf Power has requested that the increase in base rates, if approved by the Florida PSC, become effective in July 2017. On November 2, 2016, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power's 2017 annual cost recovery clause factors. The fuel and environmental factors include certain costs associated with the ongoing ownership and operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3. The final disposition of these costs, and the related impact on rates, is subject to the Florida PSC's ultimate ruling on whether costs associated with Plant Scherer Unit 3 are recoverable from retail customers, which is expected to be decided by the Florida PSC in the 2016 Rate Case.
Mississippi Power serves long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under cost-based electric tariffs which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 19.8% of Mississippi Power's operating revenues in 2016 and are largely subject to rolling 10-year cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.
Natural Gas
Southern Company Gas' seven natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulations and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies with respect to rates charged to their customers, maintenance of accounting records, and various service and safety matters. Rates charged to these customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide Southern Company Gas the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt, and provide a reasonable return. Rate base generally consists of the original cost of the utility plant in service, working capital, and certain other assets, less accumulated depreciation on the utility plant in service and net deferred income tax liabilities, and may include certain other additions or deductions.
With the exception of Atlanta Gas Light Company, which operates in a deregulated environment in which gas marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. 
The natural gas distribution utilities, excluding Atlanta Gas Light Company, are authorized to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that allow them to adjust their rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and to ensure they recover all of the costs prudently incurred in purchasing gas for their customers. In addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, the natural gas distribution utilities have other cost recovery mechanisms, such as regulatory riders, which vary by utility but allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation and energy efficiency plans. 
See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Regulatory Matters â€“ Utility Regulation and Rate Design" of Southern Company Gas in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company Gas under "Regulatory Matters" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms.
Integrated Resource Planning
Each of the traditional electric operating companies continually evaluates its electric generating resources in order to ensure that it maintains a cost-effective and reliable mix of resources to meet the existing and future demand requirements of its customers. See "Environmental Statutes and Regulations" above for a discussion of existing and potential environmental regulations that may impact the future generating resource needs of the traditional electric operating companies.
Certain of the traditional electric operating companies are required to file IRPs with their respective state PSC as discussed below.
Georgia Power
Triennially, Georgia Power must file an IRP with the Georgia PSC that specifies how it intends to meet the future electrical needs of its customers through a combination of demand-side and supply-side resources. The Georgia PSC, under state law, must certify any new demand-side or supply-side resources for Georgia Power to receive cost recovery. Once certified, the lesser of actual or certified construction costs and purchased power costs is recoverable through rates. Certified costs may be excluded from recovery only on the basis of fraud, concealment, failure to disclose a material fact, imprudence, or criminal misconduct.
See Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company under "Regulatory Matters â€“ Georgia Power â€“ Rate Plans," "â€“ Integrated Resource Plan," and "â€“ Nuclear Construction" and Note 3 to the financial statements of Georgia Power under "Retail

Regulatory Matters â€“ Rate Plans," "â€“ Integrated Resource Plan," and "â€“ Nuclear Construction" in Item 8 herein for additional information.
Gulf Power
Annually by April 1, Gulf Power must file a 10-year site plan with the Florida PSC containing Gulf Power's estimate of its power-generating needs in the period and the general location of its proposed power plant sites. The 10-year site plans submitted by the state's electric utilities are reviewed by the Florida PSC and subsequently classified as either "suitable" or "unsuitable." The Florida PSC then reports its findings along with any suggested revisions to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection for its consideration at any subsequent electrical power plant site certification proceedings. Under Florida law, any 10-year site plans submitted by an electric utility are considered tentative information for planning purposes only and may be amended at any time at the discretion of the utility with written notification to the Florida PSC.
Gulf Power's most recent 10-year site plan was classified by the Florida PSC as "suitable" in November 2016. Gulf Power's most recent 10-year site plan and environmental compliance plan identify environmental regulations and potential legislation or regulation that would impose mandatory restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Environmental Matters â€“ Environmental Statutes and Regulations â€“ Air Quality," "â€“ Environmental Statutes and Regulations â€“ Coal Combustion Residuals," and "â€“ Global Climate Issues" of Gulf Power in Item 7 herein. Gulf Power continues to evaluate the economics of various potential planning scenarios for units at certain Gulf Power coal-fired generating plants as EPA and other regulations develop.
As a result of the cost to comply with environmental regulations imposed by the EPA, Gulf Power retired its coal-fired generation at Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 (357 MWs) on March 31, 2016. Gulf Power filed a petition with the Florida PSC requesting permission to recover the remaining net book value of Plant Smith Units 1 and 2 and the remaining materials and supplies associated with these units as of the retirement date. On August 29, 2016, the Florida PSC approved Gulf Power's request to reclassify these costs, totaling approximately $63 million, to a regulatory asset for recovery over a period to be decided in the 2016 Rate Case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.
Mississippi Power 
Mississippi Power's 2010 IRP indicated that Mississippi Power plans to construct the Kemper IGCC to meet its identified needs, to add environmental controls at Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, to defer environmental controls at Plant Watson Units 4 and 5, and to continue operation of the combined cycle Plant Daniel Units 3 and 4. See MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Environmental Matters â€“ Environmental Statutes and Regulations â€“ Air Quality" and "â€“ Global Climate Issues" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 herein. In 2014, Mississippi Power entered into a settlement agreement with the Sierra Club that, among other things, required the Sierra Club to dismiss or withdraw all pending legal and regulatory challenges to the Kemper IGCC and the flue gas desulfurization system project at Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, which also occurred in 2014. In addition, and consistent with Mississippi Power's ongoing evaluation of recent environmental rules and regulations, Mississippi Power agreed to retire, repower with natural gas, or convert to an alternative non-fossil fuel source Plant Sweatt Units 1 and 2 (80 MWs) no later than December 2018 (and the units were retired in July 2016). Mississippi Power also agreed that it would cease burning coal or other solid fuel at Plant Watson Units 4 and 5 (750 MWs) and begin operating those units solely on natural gas no later than April 2015 (which occurred in April 2015) and cease burning coal and other solid fuel at Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (200 MWs) no later than April 2016 (which occurred in February and March 2016, respectively), and begin operating those units solely on natural gas (which occurred in June and July 2016, respectively).
For information regarding Mississippi Power's construction of the Kemper IGCC, see MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS â€“ FUTURE EARNINGS POTENTIAL â€“ "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" of Mississippi Power in Item 7 herein and Note 3 to the financial statements of Southern Company and Mississippi Power under "Integrated Coal Gasification Combined Cycle" in Item 8 herein.
The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.
