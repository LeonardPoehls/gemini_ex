Background
 Auxilio, Inc., a Nevada corporation, was incorporated on August 29, 1995.  On April 1, 2004, we acquired Alan Mayo and Associates, Inc. dba The Mayo Group (“TMG”), a managed print company.  TMG provided outsourced print management services to healthcare facilities throughout California, which services we provide as the successor-in-interest to TMG.  After we acquired TMG, we changed our name to “Auxilio, Inc.” and changed the name of TMG’s former subsidiary to “Auxilio Solutions, Inc.” Effective July 1, 2014, we acquired Delphiis, Inc., a California corporation, which provides IT security consulting services. On April 7, 2015, we acquired certain assets of Redspin, Inc. which provides IT security consulting services. On January 13, 2017, we acquired CynergisTek, Inc., a Texas corporation, which provides IT security consulting services and solutions. 
 As described in more detail in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on September 8, 2017, Auxilio, Inc., changed its name and state of incorporation from the State of Nevada to the State of Delaware by merging (the “Reincorporation”) with and into its wholly-owned subsidiary, CynergisTek, Inc., a Delaware corporation, which was established for the purpose of the Reincorporation. As a result of the Reincorporation, Auxilio ceased to exist as a separate entity. As of the date of the merger, each outstanding share of Auxilio’s common stock was deemed, by operation of law, to represent the same number of shares of our Common Stock. In accordance with Rule 12g-3 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the shares of our Common Stock were deemed to be registered under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act as a successor to Auxilio. Effective as of September 8, 2017, the Company’s trading symbol changed to “CTEK.”
 As part of the Reincorporation, two wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company also changed their corporate names, as follows: (i) Auxilio Solutions, Inc., a California corporation, changed its name to CTEK Solutions, Inc.; and (ii) CynergisTek, Inc., a Texas corporation, changed its name to CTEK Security, Inc. (“CTEK Security”).
 Our Common Stock currently trades on the NYSE American under the symbol “CTEK.”
 Principal Products and Services
 With the acquisition of CTEK Security, Auxilio and CynergisTek have become one under the CynergisTek name and is now recognized as a top-ranked cybersecurity and information management consulting firm dedicated to serving the healthcare industry. Most recently, as one company, we integrated our managed print solutions, IT security, and cybersecurity operations, and are able to go to market as an integrated cybersecurity and managed print solution company. We believe that offering our current and prospective hospital customers with comprehensive integrated services to address privacy, security and compliance of their IT environment, provides a significant competitive advantage to the Company. The integrated approach allows us to offer hospitals and health systems comprehensive support for managing print responsibilities that reduces costs, eliminates efficiencies, and improves the security. We provide the only comprehensive vendor neutral managed print program that now integrates in-depth cybersecurity expertise. The Company now has the ability to offer customers solutions that not only avoid cost, but that generate cost savings. 
 
To address growing market needs, CynergisTek recently expanded its professional services by offering several different smart-sourced managed services such as remediation, program development, virtual Chief Information Security Officer (“CISO”) and staffing. We also completed automation of our third-party risk management service (Vendor Security Management) and launched a full suite of incident response services to address the growing ransomware and malware attacks that are plaguing healthcare.

Competition
 We operate in a highly competitive market. The majority of competition in the healthcare industry market for managed print services comes from the large photocopy and multi-functional digital device manufacturers such as Xerox, Canon, Konica Minolta, Ricoh and Sharp. The competitive landscape also contains a number of regional and local equipment dealers and distributors that exist in the communities in which the hospitals serve. In addition, we compete with in-house departments performing the functions that we are seeking them to outsource to us.
 Most of the competition in the healthcare industry market for IT security services comes from large or niche consulting and technology firms and regional companies that offer multiple approaches but within a much smaller geographic footprint. Examples include companies like Accenture, KPMG, Deloitte, Dell Secureworks, Fire Eye, Coal Fire, Fortified Health Security and Clearwater Consulting. 
 We believe our analysis of the competitive landscape shows a very strong opportunity for fully-outsourced and managed services to the healthcare industry, and we believe that we have a strong competitive position in the marketplace due to several important factors:
 ·
We are primarily focused on the healthcare industry. We are not aware of any other vendor or service provider which has the majority of its business dedicated to addressing HIPAA compliance, including printed and stored documents and improving efficiency for the healthcare industry. Our expertise and knowledge base is unmatched in the market.
·
By focusing on healthcare, we believe we enjoy lower turn-around times for service, greater up-sell opportunities, and a deeper service relationship with the customer.
·
We have technology that simplifies how healthcare providers perform annual HIPAA risk analysis, as well as other regulatory and on-going risk assessments, by making it fast, effective, and affordable. 
·
We believe our offering provides a unique approach to managed security services. To address workforce and expertise shortages, we can deploy knowledgeable resources to perform a predefined security role on-site or virtually for a defined amount of time, which results in our customers receiving staff with expertise they need while controlling their costs.
·
We are not restricted to any single supplier, which allows us to bring the best hardware and software solutions to our customers. Our approach is to use the most appropriate technology to provide a superior solution without any prejudice as to manufacturer or developer.
·
We maintain a daily connection with our customers, which allows us to provide a detailed strategy and plan for saving the organization time, effort and money in the processes we manage and support.
·
We believe our relationship with healthcare providers gives us an advantage when targeting the larger pool of potential clients in the business associate category.
·
We have a strong referral base within healthcare as a result of serving more than a thousand hospitals and other healthcare clients under managed services agreements.
Customers
 Most of our customers are hospitals and their related off-site facilities.  The loss of any key customer could have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition, business, prospects and results of operation.  During the year ended December 31, 2017, our two largest customers represented approximately 46% of our revenues.

Intellectual Property
 We maintain databases that contain the results of our managed services and consulting efforts. This allows us to anticipate our customers’ future needs and to meet those needs. These databases provide us with exclusive insight into the state of cybersecurity and information management of our customers and the healthcare industry. We consider our proprietary RiskSonar application suite an important tool in assessing and organizing the information technology control structure of our customers. We consider our intellectual property an important and valuable asset that enhances our competitive position.
 We have not applied for or been granted a patent with respect to any managed print service technology, or processes, as related to document and image management. We have filed a trademark application for the name “CynergisTek” and for the Company’s logo.
Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 302 full-time employees and one part-time employee, including 259 employees engaged in providing services, 21 employees engaged in sales and marketing, and 22 employees engaged in general and administrative activities.  Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.  We believe our employee relations are good.
