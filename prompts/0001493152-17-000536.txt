Item 1. Business
General
 
The Company (together with its subsidiaries “we”, “us” or “our”) was originally founded in 1992 and has operated as a Delaware corporation since 1995.
 
Recent Developments
 
On January 8, 2016, we sold 22 shares of Series D Convertible Preferred Stock for gross proceeds of $2.2 million to several existing shareholders and entities affiliated with several members of our Board of Directors and issued warrants to purchase up to 44,000,000 shares of our Common Stock at an exercise price of $.10 per share.
 
On May 13, 2016, our shareholders approved the 2016 Stock Option Plan and approved an amendment to the Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 200,000,000 to 350,000,000.
 
During the period of July to September 2016, entities related to two Directors loaned us $840,000 under short term 10% promissory notes. These notes were subsequently converted into a $1.498 million private placement of units consisting of one share of Common Stock and a warrant to purchase one share of Common Stock.
 
On September 14, 2016, we entered into a new $3 million term loan agreement and a new $500,000 working capital line of credit with Iowa State Bank in which we refinanced approximately $2,835,000 due to the bank under prior loan agreements. Two of our Directors each guaranteed, severally and not jointly, to guaranty the payment of up to $1,750,000 of the Iowa State obligations.
 
In December 2016, our Board approved a non-binding term sheet with entities related to two of our Directors and an existing shareholder to raise up to $3 million in new capital. Under this term sheet, we expect that the investors and two officers will loan us $2.38 million in January 2017 under 10% convertible promissory notes. These notes would be automatically convertible, subject to shareholder approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of our Common Stock from 350,000,000 to 600,000,000, into shares of a new proposed Series E 12.5% Convertible Preferred Stock. Upon conversion of the notes, we will issue each investor a ten-year warrant to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock equal to ten times the number of shares of Common Stock into which their Series E Preferred Stock is convertible. Concurrent with the closing of these loans, Neil Braverman, a Director, is expected to become Chairman of the Board of Directors, replacing Maurice Needham who will remain as a Director.
 
In connection with the proposed financing, WPU Leasing is expected to defer all current and future cash interest and principal payments due under approximately $1.8 million of notes until such time as our Board of Directors determines we are in a position to resume normal payments, but no later than such time as we are EBITDA positive for two consecutive quarters. In addition, WPU Leasing is expected to amend its notes, retroactive to December 1, 2016, to reduce the current normal interest rate from 22.2% to 15% and eliminate the penalty interest provision.
 
There can be no assurance that the financing and other transactions contemplated by the non-binding term sheet will be completed.

As of January 2017, we have an industry-leading 503 overall approvals from the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) including 47 approvals for engine families with SCR (selective catalytic reduction) technology. We believe that of the approximately 2 million Class 8 trucks operating in North America, an estimated 600,000 to 700,000 Class 8 trucks fall into the Inside Useful Life designation. We have also received State of California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) Executive Order Certifications for Volvo/Mack D-13/MP8 (2010-2013), Cummins ISX (2010-2012) and Detroit Diesel DD15 (2010-2012) engine models for the heavy-duty diesel engine families ranging from 375HP to 600HP.
 
Products and Services
 
Dual Fuel Technology - American Power Group, Inc.
 
Our patented dual fuel conversion system is a unique external fuel delivery enhancement system that converts existing diesel engines into more efficient and environmentally friendly engines that have the flexibility, depending on the circumstances, to run on:

● | Diesel fuel and compressed natural gas (CNG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG); 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Diesel fuel and pipeline gas, well-head gas or approved bio-methane; or 
● | 100% diesel. 

 
Our proprietary technology seamlessly displaces up to 70% (average displacement ranges from 40% to 65%) of the normal diesel fuel consumption with various forms of natural gas. Installation requires no engine modification, unlike the more expensive fuel injected alternative fuel systems in the market.
 
By displacing highly polluting diesel fuel with less expensive, abundant and cleaner burning natural gas, a user can:
 

● | Reduce fuel and operating costs by 5% to 15%; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Reduce toxic emissions such as nitrogen oxide (NOX), carbon monoxide (CO) and fine particulate emissions; and 
● | Enhance the engine’s operating life, since natural gas is a cleaner burning fuel source. 

 
Primary end market applications include both primary and back-up diesel generators as well as mid- to heavy-duty vehicular diesel engines.
 
Wellhead Gas Flare Capture and Recovery Services - Trident NGL Services, a division of American Power Group, Inc.
 
In August 2015, we entered the flare gas capture and recovery business through a relationship with Trident Resources, LLC whereby we exclusively licensed their proprietary existing and next generation Natural Gas Liquids (“NGL”) compression/refrigeration process. Many areas in North America are facing significant federal and state imposed penalties and restrictions associated with the elimination of flared well head gas by oil and gas production companies. When oil is extracted from shale, a mixture of hydrocarbon gases (methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane and other heavy gases) reach the surface at each well site. These gases are either gathered in low-pressure pipelines for downstream NGL and methane extraction by large mid-stream processing companies or flared into the atmosphere when the gas-gathering infrastructure is too far away (remote well sites) or the pipeline is insufficient to accommodate the volumes of associated gas (stranded well sites).
 
We provide flare capture and recovery services to the oil and gas production operators who need to meet their mandated flare gas capture limits by processing their previously flared gas for an agreed upon processing fee. We are able to sell a portion of the NGL being processed by us as fuel, emulsifiers/dilutants or as feed stock to be further processed by refiners. The majority of the remaining associated gas is comprised of methane which is currently not sold but, if further processed, can produce pipeline grade natural gas for use in stationary and vehicular engines utilizing APG’s Fueled By Flare™ dual fuel solution.
 
During the twelve months ended September 30, 2016, operations from our Natural Gas Liquids Division were not significant.
 
Manufacturing/Processing
 
Our dual fuel conversion enhancement system is configured by our internal engineering staff based on customer engine specifications and then modeled through Computational Fluid Dynamics Analysis to scientifically determine the optimum mixture of diesel and natural gas prior to final installation. All components, including several proprietary patented components, are purchased from external sources and currently assembled into installation kits at our Algona, Iowa location and then delivered on site for installation. All installations are managed by an American Power Group lead team or certified installers that complete final testing and commissioning of the diesel engines.

Trident has designed and deployed a modular and mobile NGL processing system which takes the previously flared associated gas through their equipment and proprietary processing methods which converts the gas into hydro-carbon liquids, commonly referred to as NGLs. The majority of the remaining associated gas is comprised of methane which is currently not sold but, if further processed, can produce pipeline grade natural gas for use in stationary and vehicular engines utilizing APG’s Fueled By Flare™ dual fuel solution.
 
Raw Materials
 
Our dual fuel conversion components, including several proprietary components, are purchased from well known automotive parts suppliers as off-the-shelf components. We believe these suppliers are able to support the scalability of our business. While we believe our dual fuel conversion operations have access to sufficient components for the foreseeable future, management is currently identifying multiple potential sources for critical components to reduce the likelihood that supply issues could negatively impact our business.

Customers
 
Our dual fuel technology upgrade is ideally suited for the large domestic and international installed base of both stationary and vehicular diesel engines. The stationary market includes primary and backup diesel power generators for oil and gas drilling rigs, shale gas recovery pumps, hospitals, cold storage warehouses, data management centers, government and manufacturing facility applications. Vehicular applications include corporate and private route fleets, long haul logistics fleets, refuse haulers, public transit and government vehicles.
 
The United States Environmental Agency estimates there are 20 million diesel engines operating in the U.S., with an estimated 13 million used in vehicular applications and 7 million used in stationary generator applications. Today our primary vehicular market is the estimated 2 million + Class 8 heavy-duty vehicles operating in North America. We believe the number of available international stationary and vehicular diesel engines is significantly higher than the U.S. market.
 
We provide our flare capture and recovery services to oil and gas production companies who are seeking to eliminate the flaring of their excess hydrocarbon gases generated by the drilling process in order to meet various regulatory requirements. In addition, we sell the resulting NGL into a variety of end markets for heating, emulsifiers, or as a combined NGL liquid called Y Grade that can be sold to midstream companies who separate the liquids into their final commodities.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Our dual fuel conversion operations address the alternative fuel market in three distinct segments: (1) North American stationary, (2) North American vehicular and (3) International. To address these markets, we have put in place a sales organization consisting of direct sales, exclusive dealers/certified installers, non-exclusive dealer/installer agreements, sales representatives, and in-country international distributors, which in most instances are large, well-known companies. We also have co-marketing relationships with numerous national and regional CNG and LNG fuel suppliers which we believe encompasses a cumulative group of over 90 additional sales team members who we are currently working with to market our dual fuel solution as a cost effective way of consuming their natural gas products. We currently have twenty seven domestic dealers/certified installers, and exclusive distributors in five countries that market and distribute our products.
 
In November 2016, we announced the expansion of our existing dealer/installer network and to include a multi-year dealer/installer agreement with Rush Truck Centers which will initially cover fourteen states (AL, CA, CO, FL, GA, IL, IN, MO, NC, OH, OK, TN, TX, and VA).
 
Our flare gas capture and recovery sales organization is currently being reorganized to include direct, as well as commissioned sales individuals.

Competition
 
Under certain conditions it is not cost effective or technologically feasible to convert a diesel engine to operate either entirely or partially on an alternative fuel. Emission standards sometimes dictate the use of highly sophisticated technology that sometimes cannot be easily retrofitted onto an engine and/or is cost prohibitive. In those situations, we offer customers a cost effective solution which can be used in heavy-duty trucks, generators and other stationary industrial engines. As described above, our patented dual fuel conversion system is an external fuel delivery enhancement system that requires no engine modifications and can run on a combination of diesel fuel and natural gas or only diesel fuel, depending on the circumstances.
 
The primary natural gas alternative fuel solutions available to existing heavy-duty diesel engine operators are:
 

● | Dedicated Natural Gas Engines - 100% dedicated natural gas burning engines. This is usually a more expensive solution and available in new OEM and aftermarket completely rebuilt engines. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Invasive Retrofits - an existing diesel engine can be converted to operate on a combination of diesel and an acceptable form of natural gas. The invasive solution tends to be a higher priced solution than non-invasive solutions because of the need for additional custom designed natural gas fuel injectors. 
● | Non-Invasive Retrofits - are solutions, such as ours, where no major changes to the existing diesel engine are required and we do not use costly custom designed natural gas fuel injectors to operate the engine on dual fuel. With our 503 EPA engine family approvals, we are the industry leader in non-invasive dual fuel conversions. 

 
Our solution uses software to manage the introduction of natural gas under negative pressure to the engine’s turbo charger air flow, thus eliminating the need for costly and maintenance-prone custom fuel injectors and therefore making our solution more cost effective than others. In addition, we believe that our solution has a more universal design than other conversion technologies and therefore is applicable to a wider range of engine models and sizes than our competitors’ solutions currently are. Today, our primary focus is on addressing the installed base of existing diesel engines. We believe our dual fuel conversion technology upgrade is ideally suited for the large domestic and international installed base of both stationary and vehicular diesel engines, which is estimated to be in the millions of units.
 
A majority of the associated flare gases that are being generated by oil and gas production companies are gathered and transported through large low-pressure pipelines to be processed by large mid-stream processing companies into NGL or flared into the atmosphere when the gas-gathering infrastructure is too far away (remote well sites) or the pipeline is insufficient to accommodate the volumes of associated gas (stranded well sites). Based on information received from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority, in the Bakken region there are over 2,000 well sites classified as remote or stranded. In North America, there are thousands more well sites that have similar classification where pipeline access will never be logistically or economically feasible. These remote and stranded well sites are under increasing regulatory requirements to either capture and liquefy the flared gas into NGL or significantly reduce oil output.
 
There are currently a limited number of other entities providing similar services to stranded and/or remote sites. We believe Trident’s processing equipment and proprietary processing methods can achieve a higher NGL capture rate than competitors resulting in an overall higher compliance rate for our customers allowing them to meet or exceed the mandated flare capture guidelines.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our dual fuel conversion business and operations are affected by various federal, regional, state, local and foreign laws, rules, regulations and authorities. The primary domestic governing bodies are the EPA for the United States and California Air Resources Board (CARB) for California, which are responsible for monitoring and enforcing emissions standards and safety requirements. All domestic dual fuel conversion systems are subject to the regulations of the EPA and CARB, the primary requirement of which is that being that addition of a dual fuel conversion system to an existing diesel engine does not negatively impact the current emission profile of the engine or the engine’s original emission profile.

In April 2011, the EPA announced it had amended its alternative fuel conversion regulations for light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. The new regulations introduced new flexibilities for all clean alternative fuel converters and expanded compliance options for certain categories of conversions, building upon the concept that it is appropriate to treat conversions differently based on the age of the vehicle or engine being converted. EPA regulations had previously required vehicle and engine conversion systems to be installed after receiving a certificate of conformity which provided a regulatory exemption from potential tampering charges. Under the new heavy-duty vehicle regulations, testing and compliance procedures differ based on the age category of the vehicle or engine that is being converted: 1) full certification for new or relatively new, which is defined as engines less than two years old; 2) intermediate useful life (“IUL”), which is defined as engines older than two years but having fewer than 435,000 miles, and 3) outside useful life (“OUL”) which is defined as engines with more than 435,000 miles or 10 years old. All conversion manufacturers seeking exemption must demonstrate compliance, but the requirements differ among age categories. Our initial focus was on obtaining approval for a large number of engine families within the OUL category, as we believe they represent over seventy five percent of the Class 8 trucks in operation and the testing requirements are less stringent than those for the IUL category.
 
As of January 2017, we have an industry-leading 503 overall approvals from the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) including 47 approvals for engine families with SCR (selective catalytic reduction) technology. We believe that of the approximately 2 million Class 8 trucks operating in North America, an estimated 600,000 to 700,000 Class 8 trucks fall into the Inside Useful Life designation. We have also received State of California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) Executive Order Certifications for Volvo/Mack D-13/MP8 (2010-2013), Cummins ISX (2010-2012) and Detroit Diesel DD15 (2010-2012) engine models for the heavy-duty diesel engine families ranging from 375HP to 600HP.
 
Our flare capture and recovery business and operations are primarily governed by the various state and local rules, regulations and authorities. Our primary focus to-date has been in North Dakota where in September 2015, the North Dakota Industrial Commission established the following revised requirements for the capture of well site associated gases:
 

● | 85% of associated gases need to be captured by November 1, 2016 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------
● | 88% of associated gases need to be captured by November 1, 2018 
● | 91% of associated gases need to be captured by January 1, 2020 

 
Our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in, among other things, fines, suspensions of approvals, seizure or recall of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions. Furthermore, changes in existing regulations or adoption of new regulations could impose costly new procedures for compliance, or prevent us from obtaining, or affect the timing of, regulatory approvals. We use our best efforts to keep abreast of changing or new regulations for timely implementation.
 
Protection of Intellectual Property Rights and Proprietary Rights
 
Our American Power Group subsidiary has an exclusive, worldwide license under one U.S. patent for dual fuel conversion technology owned by M&R Development, Inc.
 
We use the names American Power Group and Trident in interstate commerce and assert common law rights in and to those names.
 
Employees
 
As of September 30, 2016, we had 20 full time employees and no part-time employees. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and consider the relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.
