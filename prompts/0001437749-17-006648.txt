ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Business
 
We are a Northglenn, Colorado based beverage company formed in 2011 by beverage industry veterans for exploiting niche markets in the beverage industry. We own beverage brands: Natural Cabana® Lemonade/Limeade, Natural Cabana® Coconut Water and PULSE® Heart & Body Health functional beverages. We introduced our Natural Cabana® Lemonade in 2012 and since then have developed a comprehensive US domestic distribution system. By establishing a comprehensive distribution system, Pulse has secured thousands of listings for its Lemonades/Limeades and Coconut Waters with regional and national grocery and convenience chain stores. We have been in business with Natural Cabana® Lemonade for five years. We expanded this brand into Limeade, which started selling in January 2014, and into Coconut Water, which started selling in March 2014. 
 
During 2016, we began eliminating several weaker, non-performing and slow-paying distributors and now have approximately 70 distributors and 20 wholesalers. This was a strategic decision as we moved our sales model concentration from direct store delivery through distributors to warehouse direct to retail which has led to reductions in overhead associated with direct store delivery distributors. The decrease in net sales was expected to grow net sales from a more profitable fixed expense base and to increase sales prices, reduce promotional programs, reduce freight-out which, collectively, will increase our contribution margin. 
 
Some of the more notable regional and national grocery and convenience chain stores are: Albertsons/Safeway/Tom Thumb Markets, Walmart, Kroger/King Soopers/City Markets, Stater Bros, Food Max, Houchens/IGA/IGA Express/IGA Cross Roads, Kmart, 7-Eleven, United C-stores, Weis Markets, King Kullen, Dierbergs Markets, Hy-Vee Supermarket, WinCo Foods, Price Less Markets, Gristede’s Foods, Toot n Totem, Travel America, Walgreens, Smashburger, Bolla Markets, Shop-Rite Grocery, Natural Foods, Flash Foods and Associated Foods.
 
We currently develop, produce, market, sell and distribute our brands through our strategic regional and international distribution system, which includes over 85% Class “A” distributors and wholesalers such as Sysco, The Sygma Network, UNFI and distributors for Anheuser Busch, Miller Coors, Pepsi, Coca-Cola, RC/7-Up and Cadbury Schweppes. 
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 11678 N Huron Street, Northglenn, Colorado 80234, and our telephone number at this address is (720) 382-5476. Our website is www.pulsebeverage.com. Information contained on our website is not a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We completed our initial public offering on February 15, 2011.
 
Overview and Mission
 
Our mission is to be one of the market leaders in the development and marketing of natural and functional beverage products that provide real health benefits to a significant segment of the population and are convenient and appealing to consumers. We have an experienced management team of beverage industry executives that have strong relationships in the industry and have successfully launched and/or managed the distribution for more than twenty-five major brands over the past twenty-six years. 
Products
 
Natural Cabana® Lemonade/Limeade

Natural Cabana® Lemonade/Limeade is a line-up of refreshing, all-natural, “good-for-you”, ready-to-drink lemonades/limeades in seven flavours: Natural Lemonade, Cherry Lemonade, Strawberry Lemonade, Mango Lemonade, Natural Limeade, Cherry Limeade and Raspberry Limeade. Natural Cabana® Lemonades/Limeades contain no artificial sweeteners or coloring with significant reduction in calories compared to competing products; having only 60 calories and 19 grams of sugar per 8 oz. serving. Lemonades and limeades are part of a high-growth market with few entrants. There is only one other all-natural lemonade in the marketplace that is offered in a 16oz glass format. We believe that the lemonade/limeade market is well established and that there is an immediate demand in North America and internationally. 
 
Natural Cabana® Lemonades/Limeades are targeted to beverage consumers desiring a lower calorie, all natural, thirst quenching beverage for enjoyment and rehydration. Nationally, only a handful of companies’ market ready-to-drink lemonades. We believe Natural Cabana® Lemonades/Limeades have competitive advantages over existing lemonade brands as follows: has 60 calories per 8oz. serving compared to over 100 calories of most competing beverages and is made of 100% all natural ingredients. The fact that Natural Cabana® Lemonades/Limeades contain no preservatives or artificial sweeteners means that they can be sold in health food stores such as Whole Foods, GNC Live Well, Vitamin Cottage, Sunflower and others. The following is a summary of our competition in the lemonade segment:
 

● | Calypso® – many flavors, 20oz glass bottle, artificial coloring, high in calories, artificial sweeteners;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hubert’s Lemonade® – all natural lemonade in a 16oz glass bottle;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Simply Lemonade® - one flavor in a 13.5oz plastic bottle using natural lemon juice and high in calories;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Arizona® Iced Tea – a lemonade/tea known as “Arnold Palmer” in a 24oz can; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Country Time Lemonade® - one flavor in a 12oz can, high in calories.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 
As part of our restructure, subsequent to December 31, 2016, we switched our packaging for Natural Cabana® Lemonade/Limeade from a 20oz glass bottle to a 16.9oz European style glass bottle used in the making of Citrus Tree and Pulse Heart Health. We had an inventory of more than 1,000,000 16.9oz glass bottles on hand which will reduce our cash outflow for glass bottles during 2017 by more than $300,000. This change has been well received in the market place and we expect to continue to deliver our products in this packaging.
 
Natural Cabana® Coconut Water
 
We introduced Natural Cabana® Coconut Water, in natural and pineapple flavours in a 16.9oz can, in March, 2014 as a major line extension to our Natural Cabana® Lemonades/Limeades. During 2016 we added a 11.2oz can as a 6 pack in a cardboard carton.

 The rapidly emerging coconut water category has nearly doubled in revenue every year since 2005 per the Wall Street Journal, and targeting consumer trends – “healthy” and “natural.” Dubbed “Mother Nature’s Sports Drink,” it is made from the highest quality coconuts from Thailand. High in electrolytes, naturally fat and cholesterol-free, coconut water is an excellent source of hydration, and contains healthy ingredients including calcium, potassium and magnesium. Natural Cabana® Coconut Water debuted at a price lower than its competitors and, per informal customer surveys, is the best-tasting coconut water in the market. 
 
Coconut water is one of the fastest growing beverage categories in the United States, with consumers and health experts recognizing its natural hydrating qualities, exceptional nutritional benefits and great taste. Coconut water contains high levels of electrolytes, vitamins and minerals and less sugar than many sports drinks.
 
While there are a number of competing brands in this category, we believe our pricing strategy, established existing distribution network, and exceptional taste of our Natural Cabana® Coconut Water brand will give us a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 
 
Business Value Drivers 
 
Profitable Growth – We believe “functional”, “image-based” and/or “better-for-you” brands properly supported by marketing and innovation, targeted to a broad consumer base, drive profitable growth. We are focused on maintaining and improving profit margins and believe that tailored branding, packaging, pricing and distribution channel strategies help achieve profitable growth. We are implementing these strategies with a view to achieving profitable growth. 
 
International market development – The expansion into international markets with our Natural Cabana® Lemonades/Limeades and Coconut Waters remains a key value driver for our growth. 
 
Cost Management – The principal focus of controlling cost inputs will continue to center around reducing input supply and production costs on a per-case basis, including raw material costs and co-packing fees. The converting raw materials into finished goods and finished goods into accounts receivable and the reduction of days to collect accounts receivable while aligning our overhead costs with our growth are key areas of focus in 2017. 
 
Efficient Capital Structure – Our capital structure is intended to optimize our working capital to finance expansion, both domestically and internationally. We believe our strong capital position currently provides us with a competitive advantage. 
 
We believe that, subject to increases in the costs of certain raw materials being contained, these value drivers, when properly implemented, will result in: (1) maintaining and increasing our gross profit margins; (2) providing additional leverage over time through reduced expenses as a percentage of net revenues; and (3) optimizing our cost of capital. The ultimate measure of success is and will be reflected in our current and future results of operations including positive cash flow. 
 
Gross and net sales, gross profits, contribution to fixed expenses, operating income, net income and net income per share represent key measurements of the above value drivers. These measurements will continue to be a key management focus in 2017. See ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION for a full discussion of our operations for 2016 and 2015.

Industry Background
 
Non-alcoholic beverages are among the most widely distributed food products in the world and are being sold through more than 400,000 retailers in the United States, our core market. The United States has more than 2,600 beverage companies and 500 bottlers of beverage products. Collectively they account for more than $100 billion in annual sales. It is estimated that globally more than $300 billion worth of non-alcoholic beverages are sold annually. The beverage market is controlled by two giants, The Coca-Cola Company (“Coke”) and PepsiCo, combining for over 70% of the non-alcoholic beverage market. Carbonated beverage sales are slipping, while non-carbonated beverage sales are growing. Experts predict that beverage companies that only offer carbonated beverages will have to work hard to off-set flagging demand. Industry watchers believe that growth will be largely confined to non-carbonated beverages and will chiefly affect functional drinks. 
Distribution Systems
 
Our distribution systems are comprised of the following:
 
Direct Store Delivery (“DSD”)
 
DSDs primarily distribute beverages, chips, snacks and milk and provide pre-sales, delivery and merchandising services to their customers. Service levels are daily and weekly and they require 25% to 30% gross profit from sales to their customers. We grant these independent distributors the exclusive right in defined territories to distribute finished cases of one or more of our products through written agreements. These agreements typically include compensation to those distributors in the event we provide product directly to one of our regional retailers located in the distributor’s region. We are also obligated to pay termination fees for cancellations of most of these written distributor agreements, which have terms generally ranging from one to three years. We have chosen, and will continue to choose, our distributors based on their perceived ability to build our brand franchise in convenience stores and grocery stores. 
Direct to Retail Channel (“Warehouse Direct”)
 
We have secured listings with large retail convenience store and grocery store chains where we ship direct to the chain stores warehousing system. Retailers must have warehousing and delivery capabilities. Services to retailers are provided by an assigned broker, approved by us, to oversee pre-sale and merchandising services. Our direct to retail channel of distribution is an important part of our strategy to target large national or regional restaurant chains, retail accounts, including mass merchandisers and premier food-service businesses. Through these programs, we negotiate directly with the retailer to carry our products, and the account is serviced through the retailer’s appointed distribution system. These arrangements are terminable at any time by these retailers or us, and contain no minimum purchase commitments.
Production Facilities
 
We outsource the manufacturing and warehousing of our products to independent contract manufacturers (“co-packers”). We purchase our raw materials from North American suppliers which deliver to our third-party co-packers. We currently use two co-packers located in Oregon and Virginia to manufacture and package our products. Once our products are manufactured, we store finished product in a warehouse adjacent to each co-packer or in third party warehouses. Our co-packers were chosen based on their proximity to markets covered by our distributors. Most of the ingredients used in the formulation of our products are off-the-shelf and thus readily available. No ingredient has a lead time greater than two weeks. Other than minimum case volume requirements per production run for most co-packers, we do not have annual minimum production commitments with our co-packers. Our co-packers may terminate their arrangements with us at any time, in which case we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers. We continually review our contract packing needs considering regulatory compliance and logistical requirements and may add or change co-packers based on those needs.
Raw Materials
 
Substantially all the raw materials used in the preparation, bottling and packaging of our products are purchased by us or by our contract manufacturers in accordance with our specifications. The raw materials used in the preparation and packaging of our products consist primarily of juice concentrates, natural flavors, stevia, pure cane sugar, bottles, labels, trays and enclosures. These raw materials are purchased from suppliers selected by us or by our contract manufacturers. We believe that we have adequate sources of raw materials, which are available from multiple suppliers.
 
Currently, we purchase our flavor concentrate from four flavor concentrate suppliers. Generally, all natural flavor suppliers own the proprietary rights to the flavors. About the development of new products and flavors, independent suppliers bear a large portion of the expense for product development, thereby enabling us to develop new products and flavors at relatively low cost. We anticipate that for future flavors and additional products, we may purchase flavor concentrate from other flavor houses with the intention of developing other sources of flavor concentrate for each of our products. If we must replace a flavor supplier, we could experience disruptions in our ability to deliver products to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
 
Quality Control
 
To ensure that the flavor profiles of our products meet the needs of consumers’ taste, health and life-style, we contract the services of Catalyst Development Inc. (“Catalyst”), a beverage product development firm located in Burnaby, BC, Canada. Catalyst’s owner, Ron Kendrick, is our Chief of Product Development and oversees our beverage development, inventory supply chain, and quality assurance through his team of three persons.

We are committed to building products that meet or exceed the quality standards set by the U.S government. Our products are made from high quality all natural ingredients. We ensure that all our products satisfy our quality standards. Contract manufacturers are selected and monitored by our own quality control representatives to assure adherence to our production procedures and quality standards. Samples of our products from each production run undertaken by each of our contract manufacturers are analyzed and categorized in a reference library. The manufacturing process steps include source selection, receipt and storage, filtration, disinfection, bottling, packaging, in-place sanitation, plant quality control and corporate policies affecting quality assurance. In addition, we ensure that each bottle is stamped with a production date, time, and plant code to quickly isolate problems should they arise.
 
For every run of product, our contract manufacturers undertake extensive testing of product quality and packaging. This includes testing levels of sweetness, taste, product integrity, packaging and various regulatory cross checks. For each product, our contract manufacturers must transmit all quality control test results to us for reference following each production run. Testing also includes microbiological checks and other tests to ensure the production facilities meet the standards and specifications of our quality assurance program. Water quality is ensured through activated carbon and particulate filtration as well as alkalinity adjustment when required. Flavors are pre-tested before shipment to contract manufacturers from the flavor manufacturer. We are committed to ongoing product improvement with a view toward ensuring the high quality of our product through a stringent contract packer selection and training program.
 
Regulation
 
The production and marketing of our proprietary beverages are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, provincial, state and local health agencies, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA also regulates labeling of our products. From time to time, we may receive notifications of various technical labeling or ingredient reviews with respect to our licensed products. We believe that we have a compliance program in place to ensure compliance with production, marketing and labeling regulations.
 
Our contract manufacturers presently offer non-refillable, recyclable containers in the U.S. and various other markets. Legal requirements have been enacted in jurisdictions in the U.S. requiring that deposits or certain eco-taxes or fees be charged for the sale, marketing and use of certain non-refillable beverage containers. The precise requirements imposed by these measures vary. Other beverage container related deposit, recycling, eco-tax and/or product stewardship proposals have been introduced in various jurisdictions in the U.S. We anticipate that similar legislation or regulations may be proposed in the future at local, state and federal levels.
 
New Product Development
 
Our product philosophy will continue to be based on developing products in those segments of the market that offer the greatest chance of success such as health, wellness and natural refreshment and rehydration, and we will continue to seek out underserved market niches. We believe we can quickly respond, given our technical and marketing expertise, to changing market conditions with new and innovative products. We are committed to developing products that are distinct, meet a quantifiable need, are proprietary, lend themselves to at least a 30% gross profit, project a quality and healthy image, and can be distributed through existing distribution channels. We are identifying brands of other companies with a view to acquiring them or taking on the exclusive distribution of their products.

Segment Information
 
We have one operating segment: Non-carbonated beverages; and one reportable geographic segment: North America.
 
Research and Development
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016 we spent $nil on research and development. 
 
Seasonality
 
Our sales are seasonal and we experience fluctuations in quarterly results because of many factors. Historically, we have generated a greater percentage of our revenues during the warm weather months of April through September. Timing of customer purchases will vary each year and sales can be expected to shift from one quarter to another. Thus, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as any indication of future performance or results expected for the entire fiscal year. 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had fourteen employees/consultants, including Robert E. Yates, who serves as our President and Principal Executive, Financial and Accounting Officer.
