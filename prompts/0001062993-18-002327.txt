 Corporate Overview 
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on February 2, 2005. Our original business plan was to develop fuel cell technology and produce fuel cells in China for indoor forklifts, scooters, underwater equipment (e.g. shallow underwater sightseeing submarines) that require a small size, longevity of use and silent operation. During fiscal 2008 we suspended the development of our products and business plan until we were able to raise sufficient additional financing. 
 Since the suspension of our original business plan, our management has been analyzing various alternatives available to our company to ensure our survival and to preserve our shareholders' investment in our common shares. 
 On July 31, 2012, we filed Articles of Merger with the Nevada Secretary of State to change the name of the company from Intervia Inc. to Blue Sky Petroleum Inc., by way of a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary Blue Sky Petroleum Inc., which was created solely for the name change. 
 Also on July 31, 2012, we filed a Certificate of Change with the Nevada Secretary of State to give effect to a forward split of our authorized and issued and outstanding shares of common stock on a 3 new for 1 old basis and, consequently, our authorized capital increased from 75,000,000 to 225,000,000 shares and correspondingly, our issued and outstanding shares of common stock increased from 15,740,000 to 47,220,000 shares of common stock, all with a par value of $0.001. These amendments became effective on August 7, 2012 upon approval from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).

Effective September 19, 2012, our stock symbol changed from ITVA to BSKY to better reflect the new name of our company. The symbol change became effective with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on September 19, 2012.
 On June 10, 2015, our board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary Asian Development Frontier Inc., a Nevada corporation, to effect a name change from Blue Sky Petroleum Inc. to Asian Development Frontier Inc. Asian Development Frontier Inc. was formed solely for the change of name. Articles of Merger to effect the merger and change of name were filed and became effective with the Nevada Secretary of State on July 9, 2015. The name change became effective with the OTC Markets at the opening of trading on July 9, 2015 under the symbol "ADFI". Our CUSIP number is 04521W101. 
 On September 21, 2017, Unifunds Limited, a Hong Kong corporation, acquired an aggregate of 55,000,000 issued and outstanding common shares of our Company. The shares were acquired in private transactions, in equal part from each Jin Han Alvin Lee, our former president, secretary, chief executive officer, chief financial officer, treasurer and director, and Kok Seong Lim, our former director. The purchase price, which was paid with personal funds of the purchaser, was $0.06218 per share or $3,420,000 in the aggregate. 
 The 55,000,000 common shares constitute approximately 57.7% of our issued and outstanding voting securities as at the date of this report. Shirley Van Kerkhove has sole voting and dispositive control over securities held by UniFunds Limited. There are no arrangements or understandings among UniFunds Limited, Jin Han Alvin Lee, or Kok Seong Lim or their respective associates with respect to the election of directors or other matters pertaining to the Company. 
 On October 17, 2017, our board of directors approved an agreement and plan of merger to merge with our wholly-owned subsidiary Unifunds Limited (a Nevada corporation, incorporated on October 19, 2017), for the sole purpose of effecting a name change from Asian Development Frontier Inc. to Unifunds Limited. Our company remained the surviving company. Completion of the merger and name change became effective on March 23, 2018 following approval of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. On March 23, 2018 we adopted the new trading symbol “UIFD”, and new CUSIP number 90775A101.

Competition
 Currently our company has no operations. We are engaged in the evaluation of potential opportunities to develop our business through merger, acquisition or joint venture, with a view to increasing shareholder value. In that regard we may compete with other private or public companies for business opportunities and financing. Many of the companies with whom we may compete have greater financial and technical resources than those available to us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the identification, evaluation, acquisitions and development of assets or opportunities of merit. In addition, they may be able to afford management and other expertise greater than our own. This competition could adversely impact on our ability to re-establish operation, and to achieve the financing necessary for us to develop any assets or interests we may acquire.
Compliance with Government Regulation
 We are committed to complying with and are, to our knowledge, in compliance with, all governmental and environmental regulations applicable to our company and any future properties. Permits from a variety of regulatory authorities are required for many aspects of mine operation and reclamation. We cannot predict the extent to which these requirements will affect our company or any future properties if we identify the existence of minerals in commercially exploitable quantities. In addition, future legislation and regulation could cause additional expense, capital expenditure, restrictions and delays in the exploration of any future properties.
Subsidiaries
 We do not have any subsidiaries.
 Employees
 Currently, we do not have any employees. Additionally, we have not entered into any consulting or employment agreements with our president, chief executive officer, treasurer, secretary or chief financial officer. Our directors, executive officers and certain contracted individuals play an important role in the running of our company. We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next 12 month period. We do and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed. 
 We engage contractors from time to time to consult with us on specific corporate affairs or to perform specific tasks in connection with our programs. 
 Intellectual Property
 We do not own, either legally or beneficially, any patent or trademark.
