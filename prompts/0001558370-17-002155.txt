     Company Overview
     We are a clinical stage specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to developing and commercializing innovative transdermal synthetic cannabinoid treatments for patients with high unmet needs. We are evaluating two patent protected product candidates, ZYN002 and ZYN001, in five indications. We are studying ZYN002 in adult patients with refractory epileptic focal seizures (formerly known as complex partial seizures) and osteoarthritis, or OA, and in pediatric patients with fragile X syndrome, or FXS. We intend to study ZYN001 in patients with fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain. We believe these product candidates will provide new treatment options for patients, as well as additional treatment options for patients not currently receiving adequate relief from current treatment regimens. In 2016, we completed a Phase 1 program for ZYN002 in which it was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in both healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy. We are currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trials for ZYN002 in adult patients with refractory epileptic focal seizures, adult patients with OA and pediatric patients with FXS. We expect to initiate Phase 1 clinical trials for ZYN001 in the first half of 2017.
     Cannabinoids are a class of compounds derived from Cannabis plants. The two primary cannabinoids contained in Cannabis are cannabidiol, or CBD, and ∆9-tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. Clinical and preclinical data suggest that CBD has positive effects on treating epilepsy, arthritis and FXS, and THC has positive effects on treating pain. We believe ZYN002 may potentially offer first‑line therapies to patients suffering from epilepsy, OA and FXS, and ZYN001 may potentially offer first-line therapies to patients suffering from fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain.
     ZYN002 is the first and only synthetic CBD formulated as a permeation‑enhanced gel for transdermal delivery, and is patent protected through 2030. CBD is the primary non‑psychoactive component of Cannabis. In preclinical animal studies, ZYN002’s permeation enhancer increased delivery of CBD through the layers of the skin and into the circulatory system. These preclinical studies suggest increased bioavailability, consistent plasma levels and the avoidance of first‑pass liver metabolism of CBD when delivered transdermally. In addition, an in vitro study published in Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research in April 2016 demonstrated that CBD is degraded to THC in an acidic environment such as the stomach. We believe such degradation may lead to increased psychoactive effects if CBD is delivered orally and may be avoided with the transdermal delivery of ZYN002, which maintains CBD in a neutral pH. ZYN002, which is being developed as a clear gel with once- or twice-daily dosing, is targeting treatment of epilepsy, OA and FXS, which collectively affect millions of patients using treatments that currently comprise a multi‑billion dollar market. We have been granted orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for ZYN002 for the treatment of FXS.
     ZYN001 is a pro‑drug of THC that enables effective transdermal delivery of THC via a patch and is patent‑protected through 2031. A pro‑drug is a drug administered in an inactive or less active form and designed to enable more effective delivery, which is then converted into an active form through a normal enzymatic process. In addition, we expect that ZYN001 will be classified by the FDA as a new chemical entity, or NCE. We are working with a development partner, LTS LOHMANN Therapie-Systeme AG, or LTS, to optimize the formulation of ZYN001 into a state of the art drug-adhesive matrix transdermal patch to be used in clinical studies. 
     In our preclinical animal studies, ZYN001 demonstrated effective skin permeation with sustained delivery and rapid conversion of ZYN001 to THC. These preclinical studies suggest increased bioavailability, consistent plasma levels and the avoidance of first‑pass liver metabolism of ZYN001. In addition, preclinical testing has shown no genotoxicity findings and safety pharmacology findings consistent with those seen with THC. ZYN001 is targeting two pain indications, fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain, which collectively represent multi-billion dollar markets.

 Our key development programs and expected timelines for the development of ZYN002 and ZYN001 are shown in the chart below:
    
     Cannabinoid Science Overview
     Cannabinoids refer to a unique class of compounds derived from the Cannabis plant. Of the over 100 cannabinoid compounds currently identified, THC and CBD are the primary cannabinoids used for pharmaceutical purposes. THC was identified as the major psychoactive cannabinoid and subsequently found to be a partial agonist of the CB1 and CB2 receptors, activation of which stimulates the endogenous noradrenergic pathway, inducing antinociception and suggesting a role for THC in pain management.
     CBD, the main non‑psychoactive component of Cannabis, has little affinity for the CB1 and CB2 receptors. It does, however, produce multiple effects, including blocking the equilibrative nucleoside transporter, the orphan G‑protein‑coupled receptor GRP55, and the transient receptor potential of melastatin type 8 channel; enhancing activity of 5‑HT1a and glycine receptors and the transient receptor potential of ankyrin type 1 channel; and regulating the intracellular effects of calcium. The influence of CBD on these targets — each of which we believe plays a key role in neuronal excitability — is the scientific basis for its antiepileptic potential.
     CBD inhibits the metabolism (breakdown) of two endocannabinoids (anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol, or 2-AG). Inhibition of the metabolism of these endocannabinoids is thought to result in increased anandamide and 2-AG availability and greater CB1 and CB2 activation. Therefore, CBD acts as a facilitator of the endogenous endocannabinoid system, which modifies release of other neurotransmitters from presynaptic terminals. This modulation of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic neurons of various classes is the scientific basis for the use of CBD in the treatment of FXS.
     CBD exerts a range of anti‑inflammatory effects, including attenuation of the endothelial cell activation, chemotaxis of inflammatory cells, suppression of T‑cell macrophage reactivity, and induction of apoptosis of T cells, which suggests a possible therapeutic role in the treatment of OA. CBD’s agonist effect on TRPV1 receptors leads to antihyperalgesia, which further suggests a possible role in the treatment of OA. Third‑party studies suggest that psychotropic effects of Cannabis are caused by THC, not CBD.
     Clinical and preclinical data suggest that THC has positive effects on treating pain and CBD has positive effects on treating epilepsy, arthritis and FXS. Clinical data suggest that THC and CBD have a very high therapeutic index. Interest

in cannabinoid therapeutics has increased significantly over the past several years as preclinical and clinical data has emerged highlighting the potential efficacy and safety benefits of cannabinoid therapeutics. Dronabinol and nabilone, oral formulations of THC, have been approved by the FDA. In third‑party studies, adverse events from oral THC including dronabinol and nabilone were primarily psychotropic and related to peak plasma levels. Many patients have received CBD‑enriched Cannabis and Epidiolex®, a liquid formulation of highly concentrated CBD which is currently in development. The cannabinoid therapeutics market is expected to grow significantly due to the potential benefits these products may provide over existing therapies. 
     Our Product Candidates
     ZYN002
     Overview
     ZYN002 is the first and only synthetic CBD formulated as a patent‑protected permeation‑enhanced gel for transdermal delivery (see Figure 1).
     Figure 1 — Chemical structure and delivery of CBD.
             ZYN002 is being developed as a clear gel that is designed to provide consistent, controlled drug delivery with convenient once‑ or twice‑daily dosing. Because CBD is virtually insoluble in water, we use ethanol and propylene glycol as solubilizing agents and Transcutol® HP as a permeation enhancer. All excipients in the gel have been classified as Generally Recognized As Safe, or GRAS, and have been used in transdermal products previously approved by the FDA.
     The permeation enhancer in ZYN002 increases the delivery of CBD through the layers of the skin and into the circulatory system.
     Transdermal delivery allows the CBD in ZYN002 to avoid stomach acid degradation and the first‑pass liver metabolism that occurs with oral or oral mucosal delivery methods. Drugs applied transdermally are absorbed across the skin into the systemic circulation, enabling the potential to have a consistent absorption with increased bioavailability.
     Market Overview and Rationale
     ZYN002 is targeting treatment of epilepsy, OA and FXS. 
     Epilepsy — Epilepsy is a disease characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures (transient symptoms due to abnormal neuronal activity in the brain) and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of the condition. Focal seizures usually start in a small area of the temporal lobe or frontal lobe of the brain and quickly involve other areas of the brain that affect alertness and awareness. Focal seizures are the most common type of seizure, representing approximately 60% of all epilepsies.

     According to Decision Resources, in 2017 there are expected to be approximately 2.4 million epilepsy patients in the United States, of which approximately 60% suffer from focal seizures, and treatments for these patients are expected to represent a total U.S. market size of approximately $2.5 billion. 
     We believe that ZYN002 may provide an effective treatment for epilepsy based on the anticonvulsant effects of CBD due to its ability to reduce neuronal hyperexcitability shown in multiple in vivo models of epilepsy conducted by third parties. Epilepsy specialists and patient organizations have shown considerable interest in the potential therapeutic role of CBD in adults with epilepsy and, especially, children with intractable epilepsy. Two companies have active CBD development programs for the treatment of patients with Dravet syndrome, or DS, or Lennox Gastaut syndrome, or LGS, infantile spasms and tuberous sclerosis complex, all of which are rare and severe forms of pediatric epilepsy. Unlike these cannabinoid‑based childhood orphan epilepsy development programs, we are conducting development programs for ZYN002 in a much broader subset of the epilepsy population.
     In 2016, a third party reported results from three double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials of Epidiolex®, one in DS patients and two in LGS patients. In the DS trial, Epidiolex demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in convulsive seizures compared with placebo. A total of 120 patients with an average age of 10 years and receiving on average three concomitant anti-epileptic drugs, or AEDs, were treated for 14 weeks with 61 patients receiving Epidiolex 20 mg/kg/day and 59 patients receiving placebo.
     In the first LGS trial, Epidiolex demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in drop seizures compared with placebo. A total of 171 patients aged 2 to 55 years and receiving on average three AEDs were treated for 14 weeks with 86 patients receiving Epidiolex 20 mg/kg/day and 85 patients receiving placebo. In the second LGS trial, Epidiolex also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in drop seizures compared with placebo. A total of 225 patients with LGS ranging in age from 2 to 55 years old and on average taking three concomitant AEDs were treated for 14 weeks with 76 patients receiving Epidiolex 20 mg/kg/day, 73 patients receiving Epidiolex 10 mg/kg/day and 76 patients receiving placebo. Both doses of Epidiolex achieved statistically significant reduction in drop seizures compared to placebo.   
     In an open label interventional trial conducted by a third party, 214 patients with treatment resistant epilepsy were treated for at least 12 weeks with an oral CBD solution (2-5 mg/kg per day, up-titrated until intolerance or to a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg per day, depending on the study site). In this open label trial, baseline median monthly frequency of motor seizures was 30.0 and decreased to 15.8 over the 12-week treatment period. A post-hoc analysis showed the greatest reduction in seizures occurred in patients with focal seizures (a 55% reduction).
     ZYN002 is being developed by us for the treatment of epilepsy in patients with focal seizures.
     Osteoarthritis — OA is a degenerative joint disease that leads to wear and tear of the joints and affects the cartilage, joint lining, ligaments and bone. It is the most common form of joint disease and tends to occur most often in the hand joints, spine, hip, knees and great toes. It is characterized by the breakdown of the joint cartilage, bony changes in the joints and deterioration of the tendons and ligaments leading to pain and inflammation of the joint lining. 
     According to Data Monitor information from 2009 and further adjusted to account for annual growth rates, it is predicted that the total number of U.S. adults (25 years of age or older) with OA will be approximately 31 million in 2017. In addition, based on estimates from Decision Resources, treatment for patients suffering from OA is predicted to represent a total U.S. market size of approximately $1.3 billion in 2017.
     We believe that ZYN002 may provide an effective treatment for OA based on research we have conducted. We examined the efficacy of transdermal ZYN002 for reduction of inflammation and pain in vivo, assessing adverse effects in a rat with complete Freund’s adjuvant‑induced monoarthritic knee. ZYN002 gel (0.6, 3.1, 6.2, or 62.3 mg/day) was applied for four consecutive days after arthritis induction. The level of inflammation was assessed by knee joint circumference and immune cell invasion in histological sections.

 Measurement of CBD plasma concentration revealed linearity with daily doses of 0.6 to 6.2 mg of ZYN002. Compared with baseline, rats treated with ZYN002 gel had significant, dose‑dependent reductions in knee joint and synovial membrane swelling, immune cell infiltration, and spontaneous pain rating scores (P≤0.05). Paw withdrawal latency, or PWL, recovered to near‑baseline levels. Immunohistochemical analysis of spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia revealed dose‑dependent reductions of pro‑inflammatory biomarkers (CD11b/c, CGRP, TNF). The data suggests that topical ZYN002 has the potential to provide effective relief of pain and inflammation caused by OA. We anticipate ZYN002 may be used as monotherapy in patients with OA.
     FXS — FXS is a genetic condition that causes intellectual disability, anxiety disorders, behavioral and learning challenges and various physical characteristics. The impairment can range from learning disabilities to more severe cognitive or intellectual disabilities. According to the National Fragile X Foundation, FXS affects 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males and 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females of all races and ethnic groups. According to a 2012 CDC study, approximately 1 in 151 women carry the Fragile X gene and could pass it to their children. Approximately 1 in 468 men carry the Fragile X gene and their daughters will also be carriers. FXS is an autism spectrum disorder, and patients with FXS exhibit autism‑like symptoms including cognitive impairment, anxiety and mood swings, attention deficit and heightened stimuli. Approximately 7% of women and 18% of men with FXS have seizures. People with FXS are affected throughout their lives. Currently, there are no known cures or approved therapies for the treatment of FXS. Special education and symptomatic treatments for anxiety and irritability are employed to lessen the burden of illness. 
     FXS is the most common inherited intellectual disability. Based on the 2012 U.S. Census and the National Fragile X Foundation FXS prevalence rates, in 2012 there were approximately 71,000 patients with FXS in the United States.
     We believe ZYN002 may provide an effective treatment for FXS based on its capacity to interact with the endocannabinoid system, which is compromised in patients with FXS. Specifically, CBD indirectly increases the concentration of the cannabinoids 2‑AG and anandamide, which are endogenous ligands at the CB1 and CB2 receptors. Furthermore, the Fragile X mental retardation protein 1 that is diminished in patients with FXS, is required for the production of 2‑AG. Therefore, FXS results in the reduction of endogenous stimulation of endocannabinoid receptors while CBD facilitates the availability of endogenous endocannabinoids, potentially attenuating the pathophysiology of the disease. We anticipate ZYN002 may be used as monotherapy in patients with FXS.
     In vitro and Preclinical Studies
     In an in vitro study published in Cannabis and Cannabinoid Research in April 2016, we evaluated the effects of exposing CBD to acidic conditions. We exposed CBD to simulated gastric fluid. Upon high‑performance liquid chromatography analysis of this solution, we found Δ‑8 THC and Δ‑9 THC compounds formed from the degradation of CBD in this acidic condition. These results suggest that CBD may degrade and form THC if delivered by oral or oral mucosal routes. In addition, prior to commencing our Phase 1 program for ZYN002, we studied the pharmacokinetic, or PK, profile of ZYN002 in preclinical animal studies which demonstrated that ZYN002 achieves sustained, consistent CBD plasma levels.
     Clinical Trials
     Following a pre‑ Investigational New Drug, or IND, meeting with the FDA, we initiated Phase 1 clinical trials for ZYN002 in Australia in October 2015. In 2016, we completed three Phase 1 studies for ZYN002 and initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of ZYN002 in each indication. We have also initiated a standard toxicology program for ZYN002 concurrently with the clinical program. The toxicology program consists of standard single‑dose toxicology, multiple‑dose toxicology, reproductive studies and carcinogenicity studies. 
     Phase 1 Clinical Trials— In June 2016, we completed two Phase 1 clinical trials for ZYN002 in healthy volunteers and patients with epilepsy. The first Phase 1 single rising dose clinical trial for ZYN002 in healthy human subjects and in patients with epilepsy evaluated the tolerability and PK profile of ZYN002. Results from this clinical trial demonstrated that ZYN002 was safe and well-tolerated at all tested dose levels and the incidence of adverse events associated with ZYN002 was similar to placebo for both healthy subjects and epilepsy patients. The second Phase 1 clinical trial was a 

 
  9

 

randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled multiple rising dose clinical trial for ZYN002 in twenty-four healthy volunteers and twelve patients with epilepsy to evaluate the PK profile, pharmacodynamics, or PD, and tolerability of multiple doses (200, 250, and 500 mg) of ZYN002. Each volunteer and patient received seven days of either ZYN002 or placebo. Results from this clinical trial demonstrated that ZYN002 was safe and well-tolerated at all dose levels. The twice daily dosing provided a more favorable PK profile with comparable results between healthy volunteers and epilepsy patients. 
     Transdermal application of ZYN002 was very well tolerated with minimal skin erythema. Skin dryness at the application site was common for both ZYN002 and placebo gel.  Overall, the incidence of adverse events associated with ZYN002 was similar to placebo in both healthy volunteers and adult epilepsy patients. There were no reports of somnolence or fatigue and a very low incidence of gastrointestinal events was observed.  There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations for healthy volunteers and epilepsy patients receiving ZYN002.  One healthy volunteer receiving placebo gel developed a serious adverse event suspected to be a catheter infection and was discontinued from the study. In addition, healthy volunteers and epilepsy patients had no drug related changes in performance on the Trail Making Test, a test of visual attention, psychomotor ability, and task switching; a divided attention task; and the Paced Auditory Serial Addition Task, or PASAT, a test that measures working memory and focused attention.  These results indicate that ZYN002 did not produce impairment in critical areas of cognitive functioning often impacted by central nervous system drugs.  No changes in mood symptoms as accessed by the Inventory of Depression and Anxiety Symptoms, or IDAS, and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, or PANAS were observed for ZYN002 suggesting that ZYN002 is not associated with declines in psychological health.
     In July 2016, we completed a third Phase 1 clinical trial for ZYN002 which was randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial in 42 healthy volunteers. The volunteers received a range of CBD doses from 395 mg to 504 mg daily in 2.5% and 4.2% ZYN002 formulations for fourteen days. Results from this clinical trial demonstrated that ZYN002 was very well tolerated with minimal skin erythema. CBD plasma concentrations were dose dependent and did not fluctuate at steady state. The 4.2% formulation demonstrated a comparable PK and tolerability profile to the 2.5% concentration and was easier to use due to the lower volume. There were no serious adverse events or discontinuations from this clinical trial.
     Overall, in the Phase 1 program, ZYN002 was demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated, provided a favorable CBD PK profile, and no THC was detected in plasma or urine.
     Phase 2 Clinical Trials—  In June 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 randomized, multi-center, multi-dose clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ZYN002 in adult patients with refractory epileptic focal seizures, which we refer to as the STAR 1 (Synthetic Transdermal Cannabidiol for the Treatment of Epilepsy) trial. We have enrolled 224 patients into the screening period and completed enrollment in the trial. Screened patients are being followed for 8 weeks during the baseline phase. After the baseline phase, approximately 180 patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of two doses of CBD gel (195 mg or 97.5 mg CBD in ZYN002 4.2%) or placebo gel every 12 hours for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is median reduction in seizure frequency over the twelve-week treatment period. We expect to report preliminary topline results for STAR 1 in July/August 2017. In November 2016, we announced that we initiated a 12-month open-label extension clinical trial (STAR 2) for patients who successfully complete the STAR 1 trial.
     In August 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 randomized, multi-center, multi-dose clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ZYN002 in adult patients with knee pain due to OA, which we refer to as the STOP (Synthetic Transdermal Cannabidiol for the Treatment of Knee Pain due to Osteoarthritis) trial. We have enrolled 418 patients into the screening period and completed enrollment in the trial. Patients who complete screening are being followed for two weeks during a baseline phase, which includes a one-week washout period. A total of 320 patients have been randomized (1:1:1) to receive one of two doses of CBD gel (250 mg or 125 mg CBD in ZYN002 4.2%) or placebo gel every 12 hours for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is the change from baseline in the weekly mean of the 24-hour average worst pain score. We expect to report topline results for STOP in July/August 2017.

 In December 2016, we initiated an exploratory Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of ZYN002 in children with FXS, which we refer to as the FAB-C (Treatment of Fragile X Syndrome Anxiety and Behavioral Challenges with CBD) trial. Approximately 16 patients between the ages of 8-17 years will be enrolled in the clinical trial and will be followed for six weeks during a titration period, where they will receive a daily dose of CBD gel (50 mg CBD in ZYN002 4.2%) that may be titrated up to a daily dose of CBD gel (250 mg CBD in ZYN002 4.2%). After completion of the titration period, patients will receive one of three daily maintenance doses of CBD gel (50 mg, 100 mg or 250 mg CBD in ZYN002 4.2%) for an additional six weeks. The primary endpoint of the study is the changes in anxiety, depression and mood as measured by the Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale, or ADAMS, a validated patient reported outcomes questionnaire. Secondary endpoints include the Aberrant Behavior Checklist and sleep assessments including sleep onset, sleep time, and nighttime awakenings. We expect to report topline results for FAB-C in the third quarter of 2017. 
     Phase 3 Clinical Trials— We intend to use the data from the Phase 2 clinical trials detailed above to select doses of ZYN002 for our Phase 3 program, which we expect will consist of two randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled clinical trials for each indication and open‑label long‑term clinical trials. 
     ZYN001
     Overview
     ZYN001 is a pro-drug of THC that enables effective transdermal delivery via a patch and is patent protected through 2031. We expect that ZYN001 will be classified by the FDA as an NCE. The structure of the skin effectively inhibits the transdermal delivery of most therapeutics. Drugs classified as hydrophobic, such as THC, add an additional impediment to their transdermal delivery through the skin. THC is naturally hydrophobic and thus is unable to be effectively delivered through human skin.  A pro‑drug is a drug administered in an inactive or less active form and designed to enable more effective delivery, and then converted into an active form through a normal metabolic process. Chemically, ZYN001 is the synthetic D‑glyceric acid ester of THC. Unlike THC, ZYN001 is able to be efficiently absorbed into the skin through transdermal delivery. After crossing the stratum corneum, ZYN001 is hydrolyzed back to THC and glyceric acid under physiological conditions, mainly due to the action of common enzymes in the skin tissue known as “esterases.” See Figure 2 below.
     Figure 2. Hydrolysis of ZYN001 into glyceric acid and THC.
    
     The transdermal patch is a non-invasive, non-oral dosage form that has been proven to be an effective method of delivery in other FDA approved products. We are working with a development partner, LTS, to optimize the formulation of ZYN001 into a state of the art drug-adhesive matrix transdermal patch. We intend to test the ZYN001 patch for application to the arm, back and thigh. The drug substance is produced synthetically and is not derived or extracted from botanicals. The excipients in the patch have been classified as GRAS, and have been used in transdermal products previously approved by the FDA.
     As illustrated below in Figure 3, transdermal delivery often provides more consistent plasma levels without the peaks and valleys often associated with an oral dosage form.

     Market Overview and Rationale
     ZYN001 is targeting two pain indications, fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain.
     Fibromyalgia — Fibromyalgia is a chronic health problem that causes pain throughout the body and other symptoms such as fatigue and cognitive (memory or thought) problems.  According to Decision Resources, in 2017, there are expected to be approximately 6.1 million adult fibromyalgia patients in the United States, and pain treatment for these patients are expected to represent a total U.S. market size of approximately $1.4 billion.
     We believe that ZYN001 may provide an effective treatment for fibromyalgia based on the hypothesis that an endocannabinoid deficiency is the underlying cause of fibromyalgia, which may enable patients to benefit from therapy with an exogenous cannabinoid. Nabilone, a compound which is chemically similar but not identical to THC, has shown significant reduction in fibromyalgia pain in a third‑party randomized clinical trial, but it has also been associated with dose limiting psychoactive adverse effects. We believe ZYN001 has the potential to treat fibromyalgia by delivering sustained, consistent plasma levels of THC to provide a therapeutic benefit with minimal psychoactive adverse effects. We anticipate ZYN001 may be used as monotherapy in patients with fibromyalgia.
     Peripheral Neuropathic Pain — Neuropathic pain is defined as pain initiated or caused by a primary lesion or dysfunction of the central or peripheral nervous systems. In patients with peripheral neuropathic pain, the pain is a symptom of another disease that has caused nerve damage — such as a herniated disc (lower back pain), diabetes (diabetic neuropathy), cancer (neuropathic cancer pain), or herpes zoster infection (postherpetic neuralgia) — but it is recognized as a clinical condition on its own. Because the damage does not involve the brain or spinal cord, the resulting neuropathic pain is defined as peripheral. 
     According to Decision Resources, in 2017 there are expected to be approximately 15.2 million peripheral neuropathic pain patients in the United States, and pain treatment for these patients are expected to represent a total U.S. market size of approximately $3.3 billion in 2017.
     We believe that ZYN001 may provide effective treatment for peripheral neuropathic pain based on third‑party studies in animals that have shown that cannabinoid receptors are found in high concentrations in the central nervous system, as well as on peripheral neurons and along the principal nociceptive pathways. The results of a third‑party randomized, placebo‑controlled clinical trial demonstrated that low‑dose vaporized Cannabis may reduce neuropathic pain which we believe suggests a role for THC in peripheral neuropathic pain management. We anticipate ZYN001 may be used as monotherapy in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain.

 Preclinical Studies
     In preclinical studies, the transdermal route of administration of ZYN001 achieved consistent THC plasma levels that we believe will deliver therapeutic benefit with minimal psychoactive side effects thereby distinguishing it from oral and oral mucosal delivery systems.
     In vivo guinea pig PK — The PK of a 4% ZYN001 patch was examined in a hairless guinea pig model by adhering two patches, with a total of 6.25 cm2 active area, to the guinea pig. PK refers to a drug’s absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion from the body and measures, among other things, the concentration of the drug in the plasma. The patches remained on the guinea pig for 72 hours, and blood samples were obtained for 103 hours. Plasma samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography‑tandem mass spectrometry, or LC/MSMS. ZYN001, THC, and metabolites of THC (hydroxy‑THC, or THC‑OH, and 11‑nor‑delta‑9‑THC carboxylic acid, or TCH‑COOH), were measured. No skin irritation or erythema was shown. 
     The standard battery of genotoxicology studies required by the FDA for ZYN001 showed no adverse effects. The safety pharmacology studies required by the FDA demonstrated that ZYN001 has a pharmacology profile consistent with THC. The compound is currently being investigated in preclinical toxicology.
     Clinical Trials 
     We discussed our planned preclinical studies and clinical trials for ZYN001 with the FDA at a Pre‑IND meeting in August 2013. We anticipate initiating Phase 1 clinical trials in the first half of 2017. Phase 2 clinical trials investigating ZYN001 in each individual indication are planned to begin by the end of 2017.
     Phase 1 Clinical Trials— We plan to evaluate the tolerability and PK profile of ZYN001 in a Phase 1 single rising dose and multiple rising doses clinical trial in healthy human subjects. Subsequently, we intend to conduct a Phase 1 multiple rising dose clinical trials to examine the tolerability, PK and PD of multiple doses of ZYN001 in patients with fibromyalgia. In this trial, we will evaluate ZYN001 in several pain models:  capsaicin, UV-B and cold pressor. To complete the Phase 1 program, we will conduct a bioequivalence clinical trial assessing the PK of ZYN001 when applied to various parts of the body (e.g., arm, thigh and back). 
     Phase 2a Clinical Trials— We intend to initiate Phase 2 clinical trials for ZYN001 as outlined in the following table: 
    
 | Phase 2a Clinical Trials 
 | | Expected Type of | 
Target Indication | Patient Population | Therapy | Design 
Fibromyalgia | Patients who meet the American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia syndrome | Monotherapy, first‑line therapy in patients with fibromyalgia | Randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of ZYN001 to placebo
Peripheral Neuropathic Pain | Patients with peripheral neuropathic pain of at least six months’ duration | Monotherapy, first‑line therapy in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain | Randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled trial comparing the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of ZYN001 to placebo

          Phase 2b Clinical Trials— Depending on the results of Phase 2a clinical trials, we may need to further define the dosing in Phase 2b clinical trials or we may proceed directly into Phase 3 clinical trials.

 Phase 3 Clinical Trials— We intend to use the data from the Phase 2 clinical trials outlined above to select doses of ZYN001 for our Phase 3 program, which we expect will consist of two randomized, double‑blind, placebo‑controlled clinical trials for each indication and open‑label long‑term clinical trials.
     Intellectual Property
     The success of our product candidates will depend in large part on our ability to:
    
· | obtain and maintain patent and other legal protections for the proprietary compounds, technology, inventions and improvements we consider important to our business;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prosecute our patent applications and defend our issued patents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We internally developed our intellectual property related to ZYN002 and ZYN001. We have sought and intend to continue to seek appropriate patent protection for our product candidates, as well as other proprietary technologies and their uses by filing patent applications in the United States and selected other countries.
     As of March 24, 2017, we owned a total of eight issued U.S. utility patents, one allowed U.S. utility patent and two pending U.S. utility patent applications. These U.S. patents and patent applications will expire between 2029 through 2031. We have already obtained additional patent term for some of the issued patents to compensate us for delays at the U.S. Patent Office, under the patent term adjustment laws. These patents, and any pending applications that ultimately issue as patents, may also be eligible for patent term extension for delay caused by FDA regulatory review, thereby further extending their patent terms.
     In addition to our U.S. intellectual property, we own eighty-six corresponding foreign issued patents and seven corresponding foreign applications, which will expire between 2026 and 2031. 
     ZYN002
     Our ZYN002 patent portfolio currently consists of two issued patents in the United States, six issued patents in France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and one pending patent application in Canada. The issued patents claim the permeation enhanced formulation of ZYN002 and methods of use relating to ZYN002. The issued patents will expire between 2026 and 2030. Any patents that issue from our currently pending patent applications will expire in 2030.
     ZYN001
     Our ZYN001 patent portfolio currently consists of two issued patents in the United States, one issued patent in Japan, issued patents in forty-three countries in Europe, including France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, one allowed patent application in the United States and patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, Canada and Japan. The issued patents are composition of matter patents, which cover the chemical structure of the pro‑drug ZYN001, the D‑glyceric acid ester of THC, and other THC pro‑drugs. The issued patents will expire between 2028 and 2031. Any patents that issue from our currently pending patent applications will expire in 2028.
     Other
     The rest of our patent portfolio relates to patents and applications owned by us and directed to other potential product candidates.

 Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
     We seek to protect our proprietary information, including our trade secrets and proprietary know‑how, by requiring our employees, consultants and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of their employment or engagement. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of the relationship with us be kept confidential and not be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of our employees, the agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us, utilizing our property or relating to our business and conceived or completed during employment shall be our exclusive property to the extent permitted by law. Where appropriate, agreements we obtain with our consultants also typically contain similar assignment of invention obligations. Further, we require confidentiality agreements from entities that receive our confidential data or materials.     Research and Development
     We incurred research and development expense of $16.8 million, $7.4 million and $2.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
     Manufacturing
     The active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, used in ZYN002 and ZYN001 are synthesized by contract manufacturers. These contract manufacturers have sufficient capabilities to meet our projected product requirements through Phase 3 clinical trials.
     The ZYN002 gel is manufactured and filled into unit of use sachets by a contract manufacturer. The ZYN001 transdermal patch is manufactured by a contract manufacturer. 
     We selected our contract manufacturers for their specific competencies in manufacturing, product design, and materials. FDA regulations require that products be produced under current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs. Our key suppliers currently meet cGMPs and have sufficient capacities to meet our projected product requirements through Phase 3 clinical trials.
     Commercial Operations
     We recently hired a Vice President, Commercial responsible for pre-commercialization activities, including global market analysis, strategic optimization and value development associated with ZYN002 and ZYN001, as well as business development activities as we evaluate partnering options. However, we do not currently have a fully integrated organization for the sales, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. We may rely on licensing and co‑promotion agreements with strategic collaborators for the commercialization of our products in the United States and other territories. If we choose to build a commercial infrastructure to support marketing in the United States, such commercial infrastructure could be expected to include a sales force supported by sales management, internal sales support, an internal marketing group and distribution support. To develop the appropriate commercial infrastructure internally, we would have to invest financial and management resources, some of which would have to be deployed prior to any confirmation that ZYN002 or ZYN001 will be approved.     Competition
     The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We believe our scientific knowledge, technology, and development capabilities provide us with substantial competitive advantages, but we face potential competition from multiple sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical, and biotechnology companies; academic institutions; governmental agencies; and public and private research institutions. Successfully developed and commercialized product candidates must compete not only with existing therapies, but also with agents that may become available in the future.

     ZYN002
     We are studying ZYN002 in adult patients with refractory epileptic focal seizures (formerly known as complex partial seizures) and OA, and in pediatric patients with FXS.
     Cannabinoid Competition
     Cannabinoids, such as GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC, or GW’s Epidiolex® and CBD more generally, have shown promise clinically and anecdotally as a treatment for epilepsy. No CBD products or combination THC/CBD products have been approved in the United States. GW is currently investigating Epidiolex, a liquid formulation of highly concentrated CBD, in the United States for the treatment of DS, (severe, infantile‑onset, genetic drug‑resistant epilepsy with no FDA approved treatments) and LGS (a rare disorder with onset typically between three and five years of age featuring multiple seizure types with slow spike wave complexes on EEG) and childhood epilepsy syndromes. Insys Therapeutics Inc., or Insys, is also developing a synthetic CBD oral solution compound for the treatment of DS, LGS, childhood epilepsy syndromes and glioblastoma. Further, Kalytera Therapeutics, Inc. is developing an oral formulation of CBD for the treatment of acute graft versus host disease (GvHD).
     In the combination THC/CBD space, GW’s Sativex®, a plant extract combination of THC/CBD for treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis, is approved in 30 countries outside the United States as an alternative to baclofen and tizanidine. GW recently reported a successful clinical trial for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme with a combination of THC and CBD.
     Additional activity in this space includes companies supplying synthetic cannabinoids, Cannabis extracts, and herbal Cannabis to researchers for preclinical and clinical investigation.
     General Competition and Standard of Care
     Within epilepsy, we intend to treat epilepsy patients with focal seizures. Second and third generation AEDs continue to improve upon first generation therapies, but experts contend that a better understanding of the disorder accompanied by fundamentally innovative treatments will be required to effectively improve treatment outcomes for the high percentage of patients undertreated by AEDs. The majority of AEDs have frequent safety concerns including serious CNS adverse events and drug‑drug interactions.
     In OA, our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first‑line therapy in patients with OA. Patients try a multitude of prescription and over‑the‑counter medications to relieve pain including traditional NSAIDs, Cox‑2 inhibitors, centrally acting analgesics / opioids, topical analgesics, intra‑articular corticosteroids, and hyaluronic acid preparations. Though these products offer varying degrees of pain relief, many also have been shown to cause significant adverse effects including potential addiction.
     In FXS, our expected type of therapy is monotherapy, first‑line therapy in patients with FXS. There are no drugs approved for the treatment of FXS, although various classes of medications are used off‑label for the treatment of behavioral and mental health conditions associated with FXS. Some patients with FXS benefit from medications that treat attention deficit disorders and other patients who experience general anxiety, social anxiety and other chronic conditions may benefit from different types of anti‑anxiety medications. We are aware that Neuren Pharmaceuticals and Marinus Pharmaceuticals are developing compounds for the treatment of FXS.
     ZYN001
     We intend to study ZYN001in patients with fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain.
    
 
  16

 


 Cannabinoid Competition
     We believe cannabinoids offer a superior treatment paradigm for patients suffering from pain, providing more controlled delivery and therefore treatment effect along with a much more tolerable safety profile. The Cannabis therapeutic area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis sativa plant and synthetic products, all of which use THC, CBD, or a combination of THC/CBD as the active ingredient. In the United States, two oral capsules — Insys’ dronabinol (a synthetic THC) and Meda AB’s nabilone (a synthetic derivative of THC) — have been approved and distributed for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have not responded adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments. Dronabinol capsules are also approved for anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS. Insys has obtained FDA approval for an orally administered liquid formulation of dronabinol for treatment of anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments and is awaiting a scheduling decision from the DEA. Further, Therapix Biosciences, Ltd. in also exploring the development of THC + palmidrol for Tourette Syndrome. Exploratory research into the effects of THC formulations in other indications is also in progress. GW, is also developing Sativex®, a plant extract combination of THC/CBD for treatment of chronic cancer pain and neuropathic pain in an oral mucosal spray.     General Competition and Standard of Care
     In fibromyalgia, we anticipate ZYN001 may be used as first- or second-line monotherapy in patients with fibromyalgia. There are only three drugs approved by the FDA: pregabalin, duloxetine, and milnacipran. We intend to treat patients whose condition is either newly diagnosed or has not responded to previous treatment with these three currently approved treatments. There is no known cure for the disease and no single therapy is likely to provide significant relief of all symptoms. Low‑dose tricyclic antidepressants are prescribed frequently, but are associated with various side‑effects. Fibromyalgia is also treated using opioids, but, in addition to debate about their efficacy, these can be addictive for many patients.
     In peripheral neuropathic pain, we anticipate ZYN001 may be used as first- or second-line monotherapy in patients with peripheral neuropathic pain. Peripheral neuropathic pain generally is treated with tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants such as duloxetine, depakote, pregabalin, gabapentin and topiramate, and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, or SNRIs. Although tricyclic antidepressants, anticonvulsants, and SNRIs often show efficacy in treating neuropathic pain, they also have many drawbacks, including poor tolerability with side effects in most patients.
     Government Regulation and Product Approval
     As a development stage pharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, and other federal, state, and local regulatory agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and its implementing regulations set forth, among other things, requirements for the research, testing, development, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, approval, labeling, storage, record keeping, reporting, distribution, import, export, advertising and promotion of our products. Although the discussion below focuses on regulation in the United States, we anticipate seeking approval for, and marketing of, our products in other countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in the European Union are addressed in a centralized way through the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the European Commission but country‑specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process of obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and may not be successful.     U.S. Government Regulation
     The FDA is the primary body that regulates pharmaceuticals in the United States, and its regulatory authority is based in the FDC Act. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. In particular, controlled substances, like CBD and THC, are regulated by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, or 

 
  17

 

DEA. A failure to comply with any requirements during the product development, approval, or post‑approval periods, may lead to administrative or judicial sanctions, which could include the imposition of a hold on clinical trials, refusal to approve pending marketing applications or supplements, withdrawal of approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.
     The steps required to obtain approval for commercialization of a new drug in the United States are lengthy, complex and expensive, and the outcome is far from certain. These steps generally include:
    
· | completion of preclinical studies, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory protocols, or GLP, regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND to support human clinical testing in the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an IRB before each trial may be initiated;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well‑controlled clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and with current GCPs to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product candidate for each target indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission of a New Drug Application, or NDA, to the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the investigational product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

      In certain cases, a drug may require scheduling by DEA prior to commercialization. This step is required if the drug has a potential for abuse and is not currently controlled (scheduled) by DEA or is controlled in Schedule I.
     Pre-clinical Testing
     Before testing any compound in humans in the United States, a company must develop pre-clinical data, generally including laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as toxicological and pharmacological studies in animal species to assess safety and quality.  Certain types of animal studies must be conducted in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations and the Animal Welfare Act, which is enforced by the Department of Agriculture.     Clinical Trials
     FDA regulations require that the person or entity sponsoring or conducting a clinical study in the United States for the purpose of investigating a drug candidate’s safety and effectiveness submit to the FDA an IND application, which contains pre-clinical testing results and provides a basis for the FDA to conclude that there is an adequate basis for testing the drug in humans. A 30‑day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA does not place the proposed clinical trial in the IND application on clinical hold within this 30‑day period, the clinical trial may begin. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols that detail, among other things, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the efficacy criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be reviewed, approved and conducted 

 
  18

 

under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board (IRB).  The sponsor, investigators, and IRB must, as applicable, obtain the informed written consent of each participating subject, comply with the protocol and investigational plan, adequately monitor the clinical trial, and timely report adverse events. We have completed our Phase 1, and are conducting our Phase 2, clinical trials for ZYN002 in Australia and New Zealand, and did not file an IND with the FDA prior to the commencement of those Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials.
     In Australia, the approval process for commencing Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials resides with the Human Research Ethics Committee, or HREC. Prior to commencing a clinical trial, a sponsor must submit to the HREC a study protocol, an investigator brochure and a template informed consent for such clinical trial. The HREC approval process generally takes four to eight weeks.
     Once a study is approved by the HREC, a Clinical Trial Notification, or CTN, is submitted to the Australian Government Department of Health, Therapeutic Goods Administration, or TGA. The CTN is a notification that the HREC has approved the safety, efficacy and ethical acceptability of the trial, approved the trial protocol and evaluated the scientific merit of the trial. The TGA sends the clinical trial site a written acknowledgement of the clinical trial, allowing the clinical trial to begin. TGA response time to acknowledge a clinical trial is approximately two weeks from receipt of the CTN from the clinical trial site.
     In addition to filing an IND with the FDA, we must receive approval from the DEA prior to commencement of any clinical trials in the United States that involve the use of Schedule I controlled substances. We plan to submit an IND prior to conducting any clinical trials in the United States. We plan to submit NDAs for ZYN002 and ZYN001 to the FDA upon completion of all requisite clinical trials. The clinical investigation of an investigational product candidate is generally divided into three phases. Although the phases are usually conducted sequentially, they may overlap or be combined. The three phases of an investigation are as follows:
    
· | Phase 1. Phase 1 involves the initial introduction of a product candidate into humans. Phase 1 clinical trials may be conducted in patients with the target disease or condition or healthy volunteers. These studies are designed to evaluate the safety, metabolism, PK and pharmacologic actions of the product candidate in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness. During Phase 1 clinical trials, sufficient information about the product candidate’s safety, PK and pharmacological effects may be obtained to permit the design of Phase 2 clinical trials. The total number of participants included in Phase 1 clinical trials varies, but is generally in the range of 20 to 80.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 2. Phase 2 clinical trials are conducted to develop initial data regarding the effectiveness of the product candidate in the target disease or condition, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage, and to identify possible adverse side effects and additional safety risks associated with the product candidate. Phase 2 clinical trials are typically controlled and conducted in a limited patient population, usually involving no more than several hundred participants. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase 3. Phase 3 clinical trials are controlled clinical trials conducted in an expanded subject population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of the investigational product candidate has been obtained, and are intended to further evaluate dosage, clinical effectiveness and safety, to establish the overall benefit‑risk profile of the product candidate, and to provide an adequate basis for labeling. Phase 3 clinical trials usually involve several hundred to several thousand participants. In most (though not all) cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to support approval of a drug.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The decision to terminate development of an investigational product candidate may be made by either a health authority body, such as the FDA, or IRB/ethics committees, or by a company for various reasons. The FDA may issue a “clinical hold,” ordering the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements, presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients, or for other reasons. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor called a data safety monitoring board, or DSMB, or data monitoring 

 
  19

 

committee, or DMC. A DSMB or DMC may provide recommendations on  whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points, based on access to data from the ongoing trial. The suspension or termination of development can occur during any phase of clinical trials if it is determined that the participants or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. In addition, there are requirements for the registration of ongoing clinical trials of product candidates on public registries and the disclosure of certain information pertaining to the trials as well as clinical trial results after completion.
     A sponsor may request a special protocol assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the design and size of certain clinical trials (including Phase 3 clinical trials), clinical studies, or animal studies to address applicable scientific and regulatory requirements.  An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and if areas of agreement are reached, they will be documented in a letter. The agreement generally may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins, except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began. An SPA is not binding if new circumstances arise, and there is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval even if the study is subject to an SPA. We expect to test ZYN002 and ZYN001 in several advanced stage clinical trials, and we may request an SPA. Having an SPA does not guarantee that a product will receive FDA approval.
     New Drug Applications
     In order to obtain approval to market a drug in the United States, a marketing application must be submitted to the FDA that provides data establishing the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the proposed indication. The application includes all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls and proposed packaging and labeling, among other things. Data can come from company‑sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and effectiveness of a product, or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate to the satisfaction of the FDA. If the drug has a potential for abuse, the NDA must include a description and analysis of studies or information related to abuse of the drug, including a proposal for scheduling under the federal Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. A description of any studies related to overdosage is also required, including information on dialysis, antidotes, or other treatments, if known.
     In most cases, the NDA must be accompanied by a substantial user fee; there may be some instances in which the user fee is waived. The FDA will initially review the NDA for completeness before it accepts the NDA for filing. The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. If the application is not sufficiently complete, the FDA may refuse to accept the NDA for filing and request additional information. A refusal to file, which requires resubmission of the NDA with the requested additional information, delays review of the application. If the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in‑depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most NDAs for standard review product candidates are reviewed within twelve months of submission. The FDA can extend this review to consider certain late‑submitted information or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA reviews the NDA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates that present challenging questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
     Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, 

 
  20

 

before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP. After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or, if the FDA concludes that an NDA does not meet the regulatory standards for approval, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA’s interpretation of data may differ from the sponsor’s. Obtaining approval can take years, requires substantial resources and depends on a number of factors, including the severity of the targeted disease or condition, the availability of alternative treatments, and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials.
     An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require risk evaluation and mitigation strategies, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post‑approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
     Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including certain changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, may require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA generally applies the same procedures and standards in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
     Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
     Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA‑regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, or NIH , at www.clinicaltrials.gov. When a clinical trial is registered on this website, certain information regarding the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial must be posted. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of many of these trials after completion, although under certain circumstances disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed until the product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly‑available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.     Advertising and Promotion
     The FDA and other federal agencies closely regulate the marketing and promotion of drugs through, among other things, standards and regulations for direct‑to‑consumer advertising, promotion to healthcare practitioners, communications regarding unapproved uses, industry‑sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A product cannot be commercially promoted before it is approved. After approval, product promotion can include only those claims relating to safety and effectiveness that are consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA. Healthcare providers are permitted to prescribe drugs for “off‑label” uses — that is, uses not approved by the FDA and therefore not described in the drug’s labeling — because the FDA does not regulate the practice of medicine. However, FDA historically has restricted manufacturers’ communications regarding off‑label uses. Broadly speaking, a manufacturer may not promote a drug for off‑label use, but may engage in non‑promotional, balanced communication regarding off‑label use under specified conditions. Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions in this area may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the FDA, the DOJ, or the Office of the Inspector General of HHS, as well as state authorities. This enforcement activity could subject a company to a range 

 
  21

 

of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes drug products.  In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, state and federal fraud and abuse and consumer protection laws have been applied to restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years.  Some of the pertinent laws have not been definitively interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations.  In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
     Other Post Approval Regulations
     After a drug receives regulatory approval, its sponsor is required to comply with a number of post‑approval requirements. For example, as a condition of approval of an NDA, the FDA may require post‑marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. In addition, as a holder of an approved NDA, a company is required to report adverse reactions and production problems to the FDA, to provide updated safety and efficacy information, and to comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for any of its products. Also, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMP after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP. cGMP includes requirements regarding organization and training of personnel, building and facilities, equipment, control of components and drug product containers, closures, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, holding and distribution, laboratory controls and records and reports. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before it can be implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon a sponsor and any third‑party manufacturers that a sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with applicable cGMP requirements or the conditions of the product’s approval may lead the FDA to take enforcement action, which could result in fines, civil penalties, injunctions, suspension of manufacturing operations, operating restrictions, withdrawal of FDA approval, seizure or recall of products, and criminal prosecution. Although we periodically monitor the compliance of our third-party manufacturers, we cannot be certain that our present or future third-party manufacturers will consistently comply with cGMP or other applicable FDA regulatory requirements.     Controlled Substances
     The CSA and its implementing regulations establish a “closed system” of distribution for controlled substances. The CSA imposes registration, security, recordkeeping and reporting, storage, manufacturing, distribution, labeling, importation, exportation, disposal and other requirements under the oversight of the DEA.  The DEA is the federal agency responsible for regulating controlled substances, and requires those individuals or entities that manufacture, import, export, distribute, research, or dispense controlled substances to comply with the regulatory requirements to prevent the diversion of controlled substances to illicit channels of commerce.
     Facilities that research, manufacture, distribute, import or export any controlled substance must register annually with the DEA. The DEA registration is specific to the particular location, activity(ies) and controlled substances utilized. For example, separate registrations are required for importation and manufacturing activities, and each registration authorizes which schedules of controlled substances the registrant may handle. However, certain coincident activities are permitted without obtaining a separate DEA registration, such as distribution of controlled substances by the manufacturer that produces them.
     The DEA categorizes controlled substances into one of five schedules — Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V — with varying qualifications for listing in each schedule. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently “accepted medical use” in treatment in the United States and lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision. They may be used only in federally‑approved research programs and may not be marketed or sold for dispensing to patients in the United States. Pharmaceutical products having a currently accepted medical use may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V substances, with Schedule II substances presenting the highest potential for abuse and 

 
  22

 

physical or psychological dependence, and Schedule V substances presenting the lowest relative potential for abuse and dependence. The regulatory requirements are more restrictive for Schedule II substances than Schedule III-V substances. For example, all Schedule II drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician, physically presented to a pharmacist in most situations, and cannot be refilled. While Cannabis and THC are Schedule I controlled substances, products approved for medical use in the United States that contain Cannabis, THC or Cannabis/THC extracts must be placed in Schedules II‑V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the “acceptable medical use” requirement.
     The DEA inspects all manufacturing facilities to review security, record keeping, reporting and compliance with other DEA regulatory requirements prior to issuing a controlled substance registration. The specific security requirements vary by the type of business activity and the schedule and quantity of controlled substances handled. The most stringent requirements apply to manufacturers of Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures commonly include background checks on employees and physical control of controlled substances through storage in approved vaults, safes and cages, and through use of alarm systems and surveillance cameras. An application for a manufacturing registration as a bulk manufacturer (not a dosage form manufacturer or a repacker/relabeler) for a Schedule I or II substance must be published in the Federal Register, and is open for 30 days to permit interested persons to submit comments, objections, or requests for a hearing. A copy of the notice of the Federal Register publication is forwarded by the DEA to all those registered, or applicants for registration, as bulk manufacturers of that substance. Once registered, manufacturing facilities must maintain records documenting the manufacture, receipt and distribution of all controlled substances. Manufacturers must submit periodic reports to the DEA of the distribution of Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III narcotic substances, and other designated substances. Registrants must also report any controlled substance thefts or significant losses, and must adhere to certain requirements to dispose of controlled substances. As with applications for registration as a bulk manufacturer, an application for an importer registration for a Schedule I or II substance must also be published in the Federal Register, which remains open for 30 days for comments. Imports of Schedule I and II controlled substances for commercial purposes are generally restricted to substances not already available from a domestic supplier or where there is not adequate competition among domestic suppliers. In addition to an importer or exporter registration, importers and exporters must obtain a permit for every import or export of a Schedule I and II substance, Schedule III, IV and V narcotic, specially designated Schedule III non-narcotics, or Schedule IV or V narcotic controlled in Schedule I or II by the Convention on Psychotropic Substances and submit import or export declarations for Schedule III, IV and V non‑narcotics.
     For drugs manufactured in the United States, the DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for the amount of substances within Schedules I and II that may be manufactured or produced in the United States based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate medical, scientific, research and industrial needs. This limited aggregate amount of Cannabis that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, which, in turn, must annually apply to the DEA for individual manufacturing and procurement quotas. The quotas apply equally to the manufacturing of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and production of dosage forms. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas a few times per year, and individual manufacturing or procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments for individual companies.
     The states also maintain separate controlled substance laws and regulations, including licensing, recordkeeping, security, distribution, and dispensing requirements. State Authorities, including Boards of Pharmacy, regulate use of controlled substances in each state. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly as manifested in the loss or diversion of controlled substances, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal prosecution.
     We currently manufacture the API for ZYN002 and ZYN001 in the United States and Canada. We are currently conducting Phase 2 clinical trials for ZYN002 in Australia and New Zealand. We may also choose to conduct clinical trials for ZYN001 outside the United States subject to regulatory approval. We may decide to develop, manufacture or commercialize our product candidates in additional countries. As a result, we will also be subject to controlled substance laws and regulations from the Therapeutic Goods Administration in Australia, Health Canada’s Office of Controlled

Substances in Canada, the New Zealand Medicines and Medical Device Safety Authority in New Zealand, and from other regulatory agencies in other countries where we develop, manufacture or commercialize ZYN002 or ZYN001 in the future. 
     The Hatch‑Waxman Act
     Generic Competition
     Any drug candidates approved for commercial marketing under an NDA would be subject to the provisions of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act.  Among other things, the Hatch-Waxman Act establishes two abbreviated approval pathways for drug products that are in some way follow-on versions of already approved NDA products.  The first provides that generic versions of an approved product may be approved under an Abbreviated New Drug Application, or ANDA, by a showing that the generic product is the “same as” the approved product in key respects. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredient(s), same strength, route of administration and dosage form as a previously approved NDA product (the “ reference listed drug” or RLD) and has been shown through PK testing to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are generally not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical studies or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “therapeutic equivalents” to the RLD, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the RLD. 505(b)(2) applications are the second approval pathway for follow-on drug products.  505(b)(2) applications are NDAs and must therefore contain full reports of safety and effectiveness data; however, in a 505(b)(2) application at least some of the required data is derived from studies not conducted by or for the applicant.  In this regard, a 505(b)(2) application may rely on scientific literature or on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness of an approved RLD.  Unlike an ANDA, a 505(b)(2) may be submitted for a product that differs in active ingredient, strength, route of administration, dosage form, or other conditions of use.
     The approval of drug products submitted under these abbreviated approval pathways may be prevented by certain periods of regulatory exclusivity and/or extended patent protection provided by the Hatch-Waxman Act.
     Impact of Listed Patents
     An ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed with the approved RLD in the FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify: (i) that the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) that the listed patent has expired; (iii) the date that the listed patent will expire; or (iv) that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also elect to submit a statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding a patented method of use rather than certify to such listed method of use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents by filing a certification that the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
     A certification that the new product will not infringe the RLD’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA holder and patent owner once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder and/or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. If the patent was listed in the Orange Book before submission of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earliest of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.  This regulatory stay is commonly referred to as a “30-month stay.”
    
 
  24

 


 Marketing Exclusivity
     An ANDA or 505(b)(2) application cannot be approved until the expiration of any applicable non‑patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the RLD.
     The Hatch-Waxman Act provides certain periods of regulatory exclusivity.  These include (1) five years of regulatory exclusivity for a drug product that contains a new chemical entity (NCE), which generally means an active ingredient that contains a novel active moiety; and (2) three years of exclusivity for the approval of an NDA or supplemental NDA that contains data from new clinical investigations that were necessary for approval. Three-year exclusivity prevents FDA from approving a follow-on product with the same conditions of approval for three years. By contrast, NCE exclusivity prevents FDA from accepting for review an application for a follow-on product that contains the protected active moiety during the five-year period dating from the product’s approval.  However, if the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application contains a Paragraph IV certification, that application may be submitted four years after approval of the listed drug protected by NCE exclusivity.  In that case, if timely patent litigation is filed, the regulatory stay will expire seven and a half years after the approval of the RLD, unless it terminates early based on expiration of the patent, a settlement of the patent litigation, or a decision in the litigation favorable to the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant.
     If there is no patent listed in the Orange Book with the RLD, there can be no Paragraph IV certification; in these circumstances, no ANDA or 505(b)(2) may be filed before the expiration of the NCE exclusivity period.
     Additionally, six months of marketing exclusivity in the United States is available under Section 505A of the FDC Act if, in response to a written request from the FDA, a sponsor timely submits and the agency accepts reports of requested studies relating to the use of the approved drug in the pediatric population. This six month pediatric exclusivity period is not a standalone exclusivity period, but rather is added to any existing patent or regulatory exclusivity period for which the drug product is eligible. Pediatric exclusivity does not extend the term of the patent; instead, it extends by six months the preclusive effect of the patent on FDA’s authority to approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application. Whether pediatric exclusivity will extend a listed patent depends on the type of patent certification provided by the follow-on applicant and the outcome of any associated litigation arising from that certification.
     Patent Term Extension
     The term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug that contains an active ingredient not previously approved may be eligible for patent term extension, which provides patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the development and FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch‑Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in the European Union and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products.     The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
     The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring such companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.

 European and Other International Government Regulation
     In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Some countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application, or CTA, much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the European Union, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the national health authority of each EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
     To obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a new drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. In the European Union, marketing authorization for a medicinal product can be obtained through a centralized, mutual recognition, decentralized procedure, or the national procedure of an individual EU Member State.  In accordance with the centralized procedure, the applicant can submit a single application for marketing authorization to the EMA. The agency will provide a positive opinion regarding the application if it meets certain quality, safety, and efficacy requirements.  Following the opinion of the EMA, the European Commission makes a final decision to grant a centralized marketing authorization that permits the marketing of a product in all 28 EU Member States and three of the four European Free Trade Association, or EFTA, States, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.  The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain medicinal products, including orphan medicinal products, medicinal products derived from certain biotechnological processes, advanced therapy medicinal products and certain other medicinal products containing a new active substance for the treatment of certain diseases. This route is optional for certain other products, including medicinal products that are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or whose authorization would be in the interest of public or animal health. 
     Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized marketing authorization procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed.  This application process is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure.  The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application.  The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.  If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States.
     The mutual recognition procedure is similarly based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the marketing authorization of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States.  The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the marketing authorization delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.
     For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Internationally, clinical trials are generally required to be conducted in accordance with GCP, applicable regulatory requirements of each jurisdiction and the medical ethics principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
     Compliance
     During all phases of development (pre‑ and post‑marketing), failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s imposition of a clinical hold on trials, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product 

 
  26

 

seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, product detention or refusal to permit the import or export of products, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Third country authorities can impose equivalent penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
     Data Exclusivity
     In the European Union if a marketing authorization is granted for a medicinal product containing a new active substance, that product benefits from eight years of data exclusivity, during which generic marketing authorization applications referring to the data of that product may not be accepted by the regulatory authorities, and a further two years of market exclusivity, during which such generic products may not be placed on the market. The two-year period may be extended to three years if during the first eight years a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved.        Orphan Drug Designation
     Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States. If the disease or condition affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, orphan drug designation may nevertheless be available if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the drug would be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, a drug that has received orphan drug designation is eligible for financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax credits for certain research and user fee waivers under certain circumstances. The Orphan Drug Act provides that, if a designated drug is approved for the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the approved product will be granted seven years of orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA generally may not approve any other application for a product containing the same active moiety for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. In the European Union, orphan drug designation also entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity following drug approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
     In the European Union, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life‑threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union. Additionally, orphan drug designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life‑threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. The application for orphan designation must be submitted to the EMA and approved before an application is made for marketing authorization for the product. Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity. During this ten-year period, with a limited number of exceptions, neither the competent authorities of the EU Member States, the EMA, or the European Commission are permitted to accept applications or grant marketing authorization for other similar medicinal products with the same therapeutic indication. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if this latter product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity
     Orphan drug designation must be requested before submission of an application for marketing approval. Products that qualify for orphan designation may also qualify for other FDA programs that are intended to expedite the development 

 
  27

 

and approval process and, as a practical matter, clinical trials for orphan products may be smaller, simply because of the smaller patient population.  Nonetheless, the same approval standards apply to orphan-designated products as for other drugs.  Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.  
     Priority Review, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Accelerated Approval (United States) 
     The FDA has programs to expedite submission and consideration of certain drug products that address serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.  An application for a drug will receive priority review designation if it is for a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Priority review means that FDA will seek to complete its first-cycle review and take action on the application within six months rather than the customary 10 month standard review period.  An applicant may request priority review at the time it submits its application.  Priority review designation does not change the scientific/medical standard for approval or the quality of evidence necessary to support approval.
     Additionally, the fast track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs involving serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. If a drug receives fast track designation, the FDA may consider reviewing sections of the NDA on a rolling basis, rather than requiring the entire application to be submitted to begin the review. Products with fast track designation also may be eligible for more frequent meetings and correspondence with the FDA about the product’s development.  Other FDA programs intended to expedite development and review include accelerated approval (i.e., approval on the basis of a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit) and breakthrough therapy designation, which is available for drugs under development for serious or life-threatening conditions and where preliminary clinical evidence shows that the drug may have substantial improvement on at least one clinically significant endpoint over available therapy. If a drug receives breakthrough therapy designation, it will be eligible for all of the benefits of fast track designation, as well as for more intensive guidance from the FDA on an efficient drug development program and a commitment from the agency to involve senior FDA managers in such guidance. Even if a product qualifies for fast track designation or breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for these designations, and/or may determine that the product does not meet the standards for approval.
     Accelerated Review (European Union)
     Under the Centralized Procedure in the European Union, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA is 210 days (excluding “clock stops,” when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP). Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest. Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances:  the seriousness of the disease (e.g., heavy disabling or life‑threatening diseases) to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In this circumstance, EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days.     Healthcare Reform
     In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the associated reconciliation bill, which we refer to collectively as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare will be financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical industry are the following:
    
 
  28

 



· | an annual, nondeductible fee on any covered entity engaged in manufacturing or importing certain branded prescription drugs and biological products, apportioned among such entities in accordance with their respective market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, retroactive to January 1, 2010, to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price, or AMP, for most branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of healthcare fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti‑Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new partial prescription drug benefit for Medicare recipients, or Medicare Part D, coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50.0% point‑of‑sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133.0% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | new requirements to report annually specified financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in the Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations, including reporting any “payments or transfers of value” made or distributed to prescribers, teaching hospitals, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and other healthcare providers and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year, with data collection required beginning August 1, 2013 and reporting to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services required beginning March 31, 2014 and by the 90th day of each subsequent calendar year;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a new Patient‑Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a mandatory nondeductible payment for employers with 50 or more full‑time employees (or equivalents) who fail to provide certain minimum health insurance coverage for such employees and their dependents, beginning in 2015 (pursuant to relief enacted by the Treasury Department).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The Affordable Care Act also established an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending. Beginning in 2014, the IPAB was mandated to propose changes in Medicare payments if it determines that the rate of growth of Medicare expenditures exceeds target growth rates. The IPAB has broad discretion to propose policies to reduce expenditures, which may have a negative impact on payment rates for pharmaceutical products. A proposal made by the IPAB is required to be implemented by the U.S. federal government’s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services unless Congress adopts a proposal with savings greater than those proposed 

 
  29

 

by the IPAB. The IPAB has not yet been called upon to act as the annual determinations by the CMS Office of the Actuary have not identified a savings target for implementation years 2015 or 2016.
     In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of an amount greater than $1.2 trillion for the fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to healthcare providers of up to 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013. Subsequent litigation extended the 2% reduction, on average, to 2025. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our customers and accordingly, our financial operations.
     Moreover, legislative changes to the Affordable Care Act remain possible and appear likely in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration. We expect that the Affordable Care Act, as well as other healthcare reform measures that have been and may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, and could seriously harm our future revenue. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may compromise our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
     Coverage and Reimbursement
     Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third‑party payors. Third‑party payors include government health administrative authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the drug product. Third‑party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA approved drugs for a particular indication. Third‑party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost‑effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA approvals. Our product candidates, if approved, may not be considered medically necessary or cost‑effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third‑party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
     The Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA enacted by the U.S. Congress in 2003, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products, including creating the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit, which became effective at the beginning of 2006. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any products for which we receive marketing approval. However, to obtain payments under this program, we would be required to sell products to Medicare recipients through prescription drug plans operating pursuant to this legislation. These plans will likely negotiate discounted prices for our products.
     Existing federal law requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates to state governments, based on a statutory formula, on covered outpatient drugs reimbursed by the Medicaid program as a condition of having their drugs paid for by Medicaid. Rebate amounts for a product are determined by a statutory formula that is based on prices defined in the statute: AMP, which must be calculated for all products that are covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid program, and best price, which must be calculated only for those covered outpatient drugs that are a single source drug or 

 
  30

 

innovator multiple source drug, such as biologic products. Manufacturers are required to report AMP and best price for each of their covered outpatient drugs to the government on a regular basis. Additionally, some state Medicaid programs have imposed a requirement for supplemental rebates over and above the formula set forth in federal law, as a condition for coverage. In addition to the Medicaid rebate program, federal law also requires that if a pharmaceutical manufacturer wishes to have its outpatient drugs covered under Medicaid as well as under Medicare Part B, it must sign a “Master Agreement” obligating it to provide a formulaic discount of approximately 24% known as the federal ceiling price for drugs sold to the U.S. Departments of Defense (including the TRICARE retail pharmacy program), Veterans Affairs, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard, and also provide discounts through a drug pricing agreement meeting the requirements of Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, for outpatient drugs sold to certain specified eligible healthcare organizations. The formula for determining the discounted purchase price under the 340B drug pricing program is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and rebate amount for a particular product as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above.
     Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, each EU Member States can restrict the range of medicinal products for which its national health insurance system provides reimbursement and can control the prices of medicinal products for human use marketed on its territory. As a result, following receipt of marketing authorization in an EU Member State, through any application route, the applicant is required to engage in pricing discussions and negotiations with the competent pricing authority in the individual EU Member State. The governments of the EU Member States influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national healthcare systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers.   Some EU Member States operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed upon. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost‑effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits.  Others adopt a system of reference pricing, basing the price or reimbursement level in their territories either on the pricing and reimbursement levels in other countries or on the pricing and reimbursement levels of medicinal products intended for the same therapeutic indication. Further, some EU Member States approve a specific price for the medicinal product or may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become more intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, we may face competition for our product candidates from lower‑priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products. In addition, in some countries, cross‑border imports from low‑priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
     Health Technology Assessment, or HTA, of medicinal products, however, is becoming an increasingly common part of the pricing and reimbursement procedures in some EU Member States.  These EU Member States include the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Sweden. HTA is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted.  HTA generally focuses on the clinical efficacy and effectiveness, safety, cost, and cost-effectiveness of individual medicinal products as well as their potential implications for the healthcare system.  Those elements of medicinal products are compared with other treatment options available on the market.
     The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States.  The extent to which pricing and reimbursement decisions are influenced by the HTA of the specific medicinal product varies between EU Member States.
     In addition, pursuant to Directive 2011/24/EU on the application of patients’ rights in cross-border healthcare, a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States was established.  The purpose of the network is to facilitate and support the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs.  This may lead to harmonization of the criteria taken into account in the conduct of HTAs between EU Member States and in pricing and reimbursement decisions and may negatively affect price in at least some EU Member States.

     The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third‑party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third‑party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
     Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
     Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
     In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to additional regulation, particularly once third-party reimbursement becomes available for one or more of our products, by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, other divisions of HHS (for example, the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments.
     The federal Anti‑Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti‑Kickback Statute liability. The reach of the Anti‑Kickback Statute was broadened by the Affordable Care Act, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
     The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to an obligation to pay money to the government, or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and reached substantial financial settlements under these laws for, among other things, allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non‑reimbursable, uses.  Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claims laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. 
     The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third‑party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

     The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, which requires certain pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and public reporting of the payment data. Pharmaceutical and biological manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to have started tracking such payments on August 1, 2013, and must submit a report on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year.
     Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.  Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain health care providers in those states. Some of these states also prohibit certain marketing-related activities including the provision of gifts, meals, or other items to certain health care providers. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct.
     In addition, we are subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information.  Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.  HIPAA, as amended by HITECH, and its implementing regulations, among other things, imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.  Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA other than with respect to providing certain employee benefits, we potentially could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity (e.g., a healthcare provider or a health plan) in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.
     Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government programs, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of pre‑marketing product approvals, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government or refusal to allow us to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post‑marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti‑fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
     In addition, at the federal level, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, regulates the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs. The DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in prescription drug distribution, for example, it requires manufacturers to affix a product identifier to each package and case of a prescription drug product intended for sale by November 27, 2017.  A product identifier is an electronically-readable graphic that contains information including the product’s unique numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date.  The DSCA also requires relevant parties and to identify and remove illegitimate products from the market, including products that are 

 
  33

 

counterfeit, stolen, intentionally contaminated, or otherwise harmful.  The Prescription Drug Marketing Act, its implementing regulations and state laws also regulate the distribution of prescription drug product samples.
     In order to distribute products commercially, we must also comply with state law requirements for registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products, including, in some states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies to, among other things, establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, register their sales representatives, and/or limit other specified sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.
     Government Contracts and Grants
     To date we have been awarded approximately $7.9 million in state and federal grants which have provided us with funding and resources to continue the development of our product candidates and contributed to research and development efforts outside of our primary therapeutic focus. Approximately $6.0 million of our grant funds have been received from the NIH, and some of these funds support research related to ZYN001.     Scientific Advisors 
     We have established a clinical advisory board and we regularly seek advice and input from these experienced clinical leaders on matters related to our research and development programs. The members of our clinical advisory board consist of experts across a range of key disciplines relevant to our programs. We intend to continue to leverage the broad expertise of our advisors by seeking their counsel on important topics relating to our product development and clinical development programs. Our scientific advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. In addition, our clinical advisors may have arrangements with other companies to assist those companies in developing products or technologies that may compete 

 
  34

 

with ours. All of our clinical advisors are affiliated with other entities and devote only a small portion of their time to us. Our current clinical advisors are set forth in the table below:

     Employees
     As of March 24, 2017, we had 12 full-time employees. In addition to our full‑time employees, we contract with third‑parties for the conduct of certain preclinical, manufacturing, accounting and administrative activities. We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees and none are represented by labor unions.     Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
     We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act. We will remain an “emerging growth company” until the earliest of (1) the beginning of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, or January 1, 2021, (2) the beginning of the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenue 

 
  35

 

is $1.0 billion or more, (3) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities and (4) as of the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year. For as long as we remain an “emerging growth company”, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various disclosure and reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to:
    
· | an exemption from the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | being permitted to present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in each case, instead of three years for any Securities Act filings;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | being permitted to present the same number of years of selected financial data as the years of audited financial statements presented, instead of five years;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation, including no Compensation Disclosure and Analysis;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an exemption from any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | an exemption from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We may rely on these provisions until December 31, 2020. However, if certain events occur prior to the end of such period, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenue exceeds $1.0 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non‑convertible debt in any three‑year period, we will cease to be an “emerging growth company” prior to the end of such period.
     We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations in this Report and may elect to take advantage of other reduced reporting requirements in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our stockholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
     The JOBS Act provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies.”
