ITEM 1 | BUSINESS
-------+---------

General 
 The following discussion and the other information provided in this report should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report, which have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern.
 We are an independent natural gas, natural gas liquid (“NGL”) and condensate company operating in the Appalachian Basin. We are focused on drilling and exploration activities in the Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale and Upper Devonian (“Burkett”) Shale. We pursue a balanced growth strategy of exploiting our sizable inventory of high potential exploration drilling prospects while actively seeking to acquire complementary oil and natural gas properties. 
 We are headquartered in State College, Pennsylvania and have a regional office in Cranberry, Pennsylvania. 
 We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on March 8, 2007. Our common stock previously traded on The Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol “REXX”. On April 3, 2018, we received a Staff Determination Letter from the Listing Qualifications Department of Nasdaq indicating that, based on our continued non-compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b), our common stock would be suspended from trading on Nasdaq at the opening of business on April 12, 2018, and a Form 25-NSE would be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which would remove our common stock from listing and registration on Nasdaq, in each case unless we requested an appeal before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel. We did not appeal this determination and the time period in which to appeal has lapsed.  Following the delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq, our common stock may be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB or OTC Markets Group’s Pink marketplace. Trading on the OTCBB or Pink marketplace may occur only if a market maker applies to quote our common stock and we are current in our reporting obligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  Once our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq, there can be no assurance that a market maker will apply to quote our common stock or that our common stock then will be eligible for quotation on the OTCBB or the Pink marketplace.
 The information set forth in this report is exclusive of our discontinued operations related to the DJ Basin, for which the related assets were sold in 2012 and 2013, Water Solutions Holdings, LLC and its subsidiaries (“Water Solutions”), which were sold in July 2015, and the Illinois Basin, for which the related assets were sold in August 2016, unless otherwise noted. These operations are classified as Discontinued Operations on our Consolidated Statements of Operations and Assets Held for Sale on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Our estimated proved reserves account for the sale of our Illinois Basin assets in August 2016 have not been retroactively restated to remove the associated estimated proved reserves from prior year balances.
 At December 31, 2017, our estimated proved reserves had the following characteristics: 
  
• | 1,032.9 Bcfe;
--+--------------


• | 56.0% natural gas, 42.0% NGLs and 2.0% condensate;
--+---------------------------------------------------


• | 89.2% proved developed; and 10.8% proved undeveloped; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | a reserve life index of approximately 15.3 years (based upon 2017 production).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 At December 31, 2017, we owned an interest in approximately 554.0 condensate, NGL and natural gas wells. For the quarter ended December 31, 2017, we produced an average of 205.3 net MMcfe per day, composed of approximately 60.1% natural gas, 1.9% condensate and 38.0% NGLs. 
 In the Appalachian Basin during 2017, we averaged net production of approximately 184.5 MMcfe per day of natural gas, NGLs and condensate. As of December 31, 2017, including both developed and undeveloped acreage, we controlled approximately 171,400 gross (117,700 net) acres in Pennsylvania that we believe are prospective for Marcellus Shale exploration and 132,100 gross (105,100 net) acres in Pennsylvania that we believe are prospective for Burkett Shale exploration. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we controlled approximately 165,300 gross (128,400 net) acres, which includes both developed and undeveloped acreage, in Pennsylvania and Ohio that we believe are prospective for Utica Shale exploration. 
 Our total revenue from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $205.3 million, which was primarily derived from the sale of natural gas, NGLs and condensate.

For the year ended December 31, 2017 , we drilled 28.0 gross (20.5 net) wells. We placed into sales 26.0 gross (15.2 net) wells and ended the year with 11.0 gross (8.0 net) wells in inventory that are awaiting completion. 
 The following table sets forth selected data concerning our continuing operations for production, estimated proved reserves and undeveloped acreage for the periods indicated:

1 | NGLs, condensate and oil are converted at the rate of one BOE to six Mcfe.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


2 | Represents the present value, discounted at 10% per annum (PV-10), of our estimated future net cash flows of our estimated proved reserves before income tax and asset retirement obligations. PV-10 is a non-GAAP financial measure because it excludes the effects of income taxes and asset retirement obligations. The most directly comparable GAAP measure is standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows. The standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows includes the effects of estimated future income tax expenses and asset retirement obligations and is calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Topic 932. Standardized measure is based on proved reserves as of fiscal year-end calculated using the unweighted arithmetic average first-day-of-month prices for the prior 12 months. PV-10 should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as defined under GAAP. Our PV-10 measure and the Standardized Measure of discounted future cash flows do not purport to represent the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves. At December 31, 2017, our standardized measure was $0.0 million. For an explanation of why we show PV-10 and a reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, please read “Item 6. Selected Financial Data – Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Please also read “Risk Factors – Our estimated proved reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.”

Our Competitive Strengths 
 We believe our strengths provide us with significant competitive advantages and position us to successfully execute our business and growth strategies. 
 High Quality Asset Base with Liquids-Weighted Growth. We are focused on developing acreage that we believe to be prospective for three producing zones, the Marcellus Shale, the Burkett Shale and the Utica Shale. A substantial portion of our acreage holdings are in liquids-rich areas that we believe are prospective for NGL and condensate production. As of December 31, 2017, our holdings believed to be prospective for liquids-rich production accounted for approximately 83.2% of our total net acreage. 
 Track Record of Production Growth. Our management and operations teams have a proven track record of performance and have consistently demonstrated our ability to acquire and develop reserves at attractive costs in the basins in which we operate. Our production has grown at a CAGR of 31.9% between 2010 and 2017. We believe we have competitive finding and development costs as compared to our industry peers. 
 Significant Operational Control in Our Core Areas. As a result of successfully executing our strategy of acquiring concentrated acreage positions and operating properties with a high working interest, we currently operate and manage approximately 70.0% of our net acreage. Our high percentage of operated properties enables us to exercise a significant level of control with respect to the timing and scope of drilling, production, operating and administrative costs, in addition to leveraging our base of technical expertise in our core operating areas. 
 History of Maximizing Operating Efficiencies. Our costs of operations continue to decrease year-over-year as we leverage our increasing production, pricing concessions from service providers and our expertise in the regions in which we operate. Our field level lease operating expense per Mcfe, which excludes the effect of transporting, marketing and processing, has decreased from $0.15 per Mcfe in 2015 to $0.12 per Mcfe in 2016 and $0.11 per Mcfe in 2017. Our general and administrative expense per Mcfe has decreased from $0.40 per Mcfe in 2015 to $0.28 per Mcfe in 2016 and $0.27 per Mcfe in 2017.

Business Strategy 
 Our goal is to build long-term stockholder value by growing reserves and production in a cost-effective manner. Key elements of our strategy include: 
 Develop Our Existing Properties. Our core leasehold consists entirely of interests in developed and undeveloped natural gas, NGL and condensate resources located in the Appalachian Basin. We pursue an active, technology-driven drilling program to develop and maximize the value of our existing acreage. We actively allocate capital in an effort to maximize value and estimated proved reserve growth based on our assessment of the relative risk of development and the economics of potential projects. Additionally, by concentrating our drilling and producing activities in our core areas, we are able to develop the regional expertise needed to interpret specific geological and operating trends and develop economies of scale in our operations. Our areas of focus include: 

• | our Marcellus Shale play with approximately 171,400 gross (117,700 net) acres;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our Utica Shale play with approximately 165,300 gross (128,400 net) acres;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our Burkett Shale play with approximately 132,100 gross (105,100 net) acres
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Employ Technological Expertise. We intend to utilize and expand the technological expertise that has enabled us to achieve a drilling success rate of approximately 100.0% over the last three years, to improve operations and to enhance field recoveries. We intend to continue to apply this expertise to our proved reserve base and our development projects. 
 Reduce Per Unit Operating Costs Through Economies of Scale and Efficient Operations. As we continue to increase our production and develop our existing properties, we believe that our per unit production costs can benefit from leveraging our existing infrastructure and expertise over a larger number of wells. Our acreage positions are tightly concentrated, which we believe will enable us to achieve greater cost efficiencies in our drilling and completion operations than those of our competitors who have less consolidated positions. As we continue to develop our acreage positions, we expect to realize increased capital efficiencies through greater utilization of multi-well pads and existing infrastructure and facilities. 
 Maintain Capital Budgeting Flexibility. Because of the volatility of commodity prices and the risks involved in our industry, we believe in remaining flexible in our capital budgeting process. Our high percentage of operated properties enables us to exercise a significant level of control with respect to drilling, production, operating and administrative costs. 
 Manage Commodity Price Exposure Through an Active Hedging Program. We actively hedge our future exposure to commodity price fluctuations by entering into natural gas, NGL and oil derivative contracts. This strategy is designed to provide us with stability in our cash flows to support our on-going capital requirements.
Significant Accomplishments in 2017 
 We have described certain of our significant accomplishments in 2017 below. 
  
• | Completed the divestiture of Warrior South Assets. In January 2017, we sold our Warrior South assets in Ohio for total consideration of approximately $30.0 million.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Entered a $300 million first lien delayed draw term loan. In April 2017, we closed an agreement for a new $300 million first lien delayed draw term loan providing us with additional liquidity to continue the development of our asset base.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Entered into comprehensive marketing arrangement with BP Energy Company. In August 2017, we entered into a comprehensive marketing arrangement with BP Energy Company pursuant to which BP Energy Company will market the majority of our liquid C3+ products stream and provide additional credit support while also enhancing several of our existing marketing initiatives in the Appalachian Basin.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Achieved horizontal drilling success. In our operated areas of the Appalachian Basin we drilled 28.0 gross (20.5 net) wells and placed 26.0 gross (15.2 net) wells into service during 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had 11.0 gross (eight net) wells awaiting completion in our operated areas in the Appalachian Basin.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decreased operating expenses. Our costs of operations continue to decrease year-over-year as we leverage our increasing production, pricing concessions from service providers and our expertise in the regions in which we operate. Our field level lease operating expense per Mcfe, which excludes the effect of transporting, marketing and processing, has decreased from $0.15 per Mcfe in 2015 to $0.12 per Mcfe in 2016 and $.011 per Mcfe in 2017. Our general and administrative expense per Mcfe has decreased from $0.40 per Mcfe in 2015 to $0.28 per Mcfe in 2016 and $0.27 per Mcfe in 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Improved realized natural gas differentials. Due to our transportation of natural gas to the Gulf of Mexico our realized natural gas pricing, before the effects of hedging, as compared to NYMEX have improved from a differential of approximately $0.91/mcf in 2016 to approximately $0.22/mcf in 2017.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Plans for 2018 
 Our budgeted capital spending for 2018 is approximately $78.0 million to $83.0 million. The capital budget contemplates the drilling of approximately seven gross (4.5 net) horizontal Marcellus Shale wells in Butler County, Pennsylvania. We have plans to complete 11.0 gross (8.5 net) horizontal Marcellus Shale wells in Butler County, Pennsylvania and seven gross (five net) horizontal Utica Shale wells in Carroll County, Ohio. In the event our cash flows are materially less than anticipated and/or other sources of capital we historically have utilized are not available on acceptable terms, we may curtail our capital spending. The following table summarizes our actual 2017 and our budgeted 2018 capital expenditures:

Competition 
 The oil and gas industry is intensely competitive, particularly with respect to the acquisition of prospective oil and natural gas properties and reserves. Our ability to effectively compete is dependent on our geological, geophysical and engineering expertise and our financial resources. We must compete against a substantial number of major and independent oil and natural gas companies that have larger technical staffs and greater financial and operational resources than we do. Many of these companies not only engage in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves, but also have refining operations, market refined products and generate electricity. We also compete with other oil and natural gas companies to secure drilling rigs and other equipment and services necessary for drilling and completion of wells. Consequently, equipment and services may be in short supply 
 9


from time to time. Additionally, it can be difficult to attract and retain employees, particularly those with expertise in high demand areas. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 105 full-time employees, 17 of whom were field personnel. No employees are represented by a labor union or covered by any collective bargaining arrangement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. We regularly utilize independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services, particularly in the areas of drilling, completion, field services, oil and gas leasing and on-site production operation services. 
Marketing and Customers 
 Our natural gas producing properties are located near existing pipeline systems and processing infrastructure. We have firm commitments for the sale of approximately 110,000 gross MMBTU per day in our Butler County, Pennsylvania operating area for our working interest and that of our working interest partners as of December 31, 2017. Additionally in Butler County, Pennsylvania, we have firm processing commitments with unaffiliated third parties for our liquids-rich gas totaling 285,000 gross MMBTU per day as of December 31, 2017. In Ohio, we have a marketing agreement in place with BP Energy for 14,000 MMBtu per day. In addition to our marketing and processing agreements, we have several transportation agreements in the Appalachian Basin totaling commitments of approximately 263,000 gross MMBTU per day in 2018; 263,000 gross MMBTU per day in 2019; 245,000 gross MMBTU per day in 2020; 191,000 gross MMBTU per day in 2021; and 191,000 gross MMBTU per day in 2022.
 In addition to our natural gas transportation and sales agreements, we also have agreements in place to transport and sell our ethane production. We began selling ethane via the ATEX and Mariner West pipelines during 2014. The initial term of the ATEX pipeline agreement expires 15 years from the date that we began to deliver ethane to the ATEX pipeline, with us retaining a unilateral right to extend the initial term for successive periods of not less than one or more than five years so long as the shippers on the ATEX pipeline continue to ship an aggregate of 50,000 barrels per day of ethane. The initial term of the Mariner West pipeline agreement expires on December 31, 2028, but the agreement will automatically extend for successive one year terms thereafter until such time as either party gives 12 months’ notice of intent to terminate. In December 2015, we executed an additional NGL supply agreement INEOS Europe AG for ethane, propane and butane on the Mariner East pipeline. The ethane sales commenced in April 2016 and the propane and butane sales are expected to begin in the first quarter of 2018. The term of the agreement is 10 years and will extend automatically for one year terms thereafter until such time that either party provides twelve months’ notice of intent to terminate.
 Prices for natural gas and oil fluctuate widely based on, among other things, supply and demand. Supply and demand are influenced by a number of factors, including weather, foreign policy, industry practices and the U.S. and worldwide economic climate. Natural gas and oil markets have historically been cyclical and volatile in nature as a result of many factors that are beyond our control. There can be no assurance of any price at which we will be able to sell our natural gas and condensate. Prices may be relatively low when our wells are most productive, thereby reducing overall returns. 
 We enter into derivative transactions with unaffiliated third parties to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short-term fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices. For a more detailed discussion, see the information set forth in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.” 
 Governmental Regulations 
 Our oil and natural gas exploration, production, and related operations are subject to extensive statutory and regulatory oversight by federal, state, tribal and local authorities. We must, for example, obtain drilling permits; post bonds for drilling; operating, and reclamation; and submit various reports. The following activities are also subject to regulation: the location of wells; the method of drilling; completion and operation of wells; secondary and enhanced oil recovery projects; notice to surface owners and third parties; the surface development, use, and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; temporary storage tank operations; compression and access roads; the impoundment of water; the manner and extent of earth disturbances; air emissions; the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations; and the calculation and distribution of royalty payments and production taxes. We must also comply with statutes and regulations addressing conservation matters, including the size of drilling units, spacing units, or proration units; the number of wells that may be drilled in an area; the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties; and the establishment of maximum rates of production. Failure to comply with any of these requirements can result in substantial monetary penalties or lease cancellation and, in certain cases, criminal prosecution. Finally, if tribal or local authorities have previously imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration and production activities those restrictions must be 
 10


addressed before activities can proceed. Moreover, most states impose a production, ad valorem, or severance tax with respect to production and sale of oil or natural gas within their jurisdiction. 
 The increasing regulatory burden on the natural gas and oil industry will most likely increase our cost of doing business and may affect our production rates. However, these burdens generally do not affect us differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect others in our industry with similar types, quantities, and locations of production. Additional proposals or proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), and the courts. Implementation of such proposals could increase the regulatory burden and potential for financial sanctions for non-compliance. Although we believe we are currently in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, because such rules and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted, we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such laws. We may be required to make significant expenditures to comply with governmental laws and regulations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 
 Historically, the transportation and sale or resale of natural gas in interstate commerce has been regulated pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938, the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the FERC. In the past, the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas and oil could be sold. Deregulation of wellhead sales in the natural gas industry began with the enactment of the NGPA. In 1989, the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act was enacted, removing both price and non-price controls from natural gas sold in “first sales” no later than January 1, 1993. While sales by producers of natural gas, and all sales of natural gas liquids, condensate, and crude oil currently can be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 
 The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions. Its regulations affect the marketing of natural gas produced by us, as well as the revenues that may be received by us for sales of such production. Since the mid-1980s, the FERC has issued a series of orders (collectively, “Order 636”) which significantly altered the marketing and transportation of natural gas. Order 636 mandated a fundamental restructuring of interstate pipeline sales and transportation service, including the unbundling by interstate pipelines of the sale, transportation, storage and other services such pipelines previously performed. One of the FERC’s purposes in issuing Order 636 was to increase competition within the natural gas industry. Generally, Order 636 has eliminated or substantially reduced the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services, and has substantially increased competition and volatility in natural gas markets. 
 The price we receive from the sale of oil and NGLs will be affected by the cost of transporting products to markets. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations establishing an indexing system for transportation rates for oil pipelines, which, generally, index such rates to inflation, subject to certain conditions and limitations. We are unable to predict the effect, if any, of these regulations on our intended operations. The regulations may, however, increase transportation costs or reduce well head prices for NGLs and oil. 
 In August 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”). Among other matters, the EPAct 2005 amends the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) to make it unlawful for “any entity,” including otherwise non-jurisdictional producers such as us, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. On January 20, 2006, the FERC issued rules implementing this provision. The rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit any such statement necessary to make the statements not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. The new anti-manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases, or transportation subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction, which includes the reporting requirements under Order Nos. 704 and 720. It therefore, reflects a significant expansion of the FERC’s enforcement authority. We have not been affected differently than any other producer of natural gas by this act.
 Environmental Matters 
 Our operations and properties are subject to extensive and changing federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. These laws and regulations among other things: 

• | require the acquisition of permits or other authorizations before construction, drilling, and certain other of our activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limit or prohibit construction, drilling, and other activities on specified lands within wetlands areas, endangered species habitat, wilderness, and other protected areas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 11


 
• | impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require the installation of pollution control equipment in connection with our operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | place restrictions upon the use or disposal of the material utilized in our operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrict the types, quantities, and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment or used in connection with drilling, production, and transportation activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as site restoration, pit closure, and well plugging for abandoned wells; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital in connection with worker health and safety.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The permits required for our operations may be subject to revocation, modification, and renewal by the issuing authorities. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce environmental laws and regulations, and violations may result in administrative or civil penalties, injunctions, or even criminal penalties. Some states continue to adopt new regulations and permit requirements, which may impede or delay our operations or increase our costs. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and, except for those matters described in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings,” have no material commitments for capital expenditures to comply with existing environmental requirements. Nevertheless, the trend in environmental legislation and regulation generally is toward stricter standards, and we expect that this trend will continue. Changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or in interpretations of these laws and regulations could have a significant impact on us and the natural gas and oil industry as a whole. 
 The following is a summary of the existing laws and regulations that we believe are most likely to have a material impact on our business operations. 
 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal, and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, as the case may be, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration and production of natural gas and crude oil are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as “hazardous” wastes in the future. Along these lines, on December 28, 2016, a federal trial court issued a consent decree under which the EPA agreed that, by March 15, 2019, it will either sign a notice of proposed rulemaking to revise its RCRA regulations as they pertain to oil and gas wastes (in which case it will take a final action on the proposed rulemaking by July 15, 2021) or sign a determination that no such revision is necessary.  If oil and gas wastes were to become classified as “hazardous” under RCRA or comparable state statutes, it could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act
 The Comprehensive Environmental, Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, as amended (“CERCLA”), and comparable state statutes impose strict liability on owners and operators of sites where “hazardous substances” have been released into the environment.  They likewise impose strict liability on persons who disposed of or arranged for the disposal of “hazardous substances” that have been released into the environment. The definition of “hazardous substances” excludes “petroleum, including crude oil and any fraction thereof.” Nevertheless, non-excluded hazardous substances can be present at sites of oil and gas operations. Liability under CERCLA may be joint and several and includes liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment. 
 We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that, for many years, have been used for natural gas and oil exploration and production operations or produced water disposal operations. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties that we own or lease or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where these substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA, and analogous state

laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination or perform remedial activities to prevent the future spread of contamination. 
 Water Discharges and Disposal
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”), and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. While the Clean Water Act contains an oil and gas “exemption” to its requirement that a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit be obtained for stormwater discharges, the exemption does not apply to certain types of stormwater discharges from oil and gas facilities (including those that have come into contact with wastes or other substances).  Moreover, under the laws of some states, including Pennsylvania, operators of oil and gas facilities must obtain permit authorizations for stormwater discharges that emanate from the facilities regardless of whether the discharges are covered by the Clean Water Act’s exemption.  The Clean Water Act, in addition, prohibits the unpermitted discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the United States, including certain wetlands. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. 
 Our natural gas and oil exploration and production operations generate produced water as a waste material, Under the Clean Water Act, the EPA has issued rules that prohibit the discharge of oil and gas wastewaters directly to surface waters, or publicly-owned treatment works, unless the wastewaters have been treated to contain zero pollutants.  Therefore, a common method of produced water disposal, and one that we use, is subsurface injection into disposal wells. Such disposal wells are permitted under the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, which was established under the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”). The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states and, in others, the States administer it on their own. To date, we believe that all necessary disposal well permits have been obtained and that the produced water has been discharged in substantial compliance with such permits and applicable laws and regulations. 
 Endangered Species Act
 
The Endangered Species Act and comparable state laws restrict activities that could affect threatened and endangered species and their habitats.  They do so through operating restrictions and temporary, seasonal, or permanent bans on certain types of activities in affected areas.  We may conduct operations in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that might eventually be listed as threatened or endangered may exist.  The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we conduct operations could cause us to incur new costs that would arise out of species protection measures.  It could also limit our exploration and production activities in a way that could adversely impact our ability to develop and produce gas reserves.  The same outcomes could occur if any portion of our gas-reserve acreage is designated as “critical” or “suitable” habitat areas for threatened or endangered species.
Air Pollutant Emissions
 The Federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. The EPA issued New Source Performance Standards in 2012, which it amended in 2013 and 2014, known as “NSPS OOOO.” Among other things, NSPS OOOO requires operators of new and modified hydraulically-fractured gas wells to use special techniques (known as “green completions”) to reduce emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds (“VOCs”) from the wells.  NSPS OOOO also revised the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for glycol dehydration units.  On May 12, 2016, the EPA issued additional New Source Performance Standards (effective August 2, 2016), known as “NSPS OOOOa,” which built on the NSPS OOOO standards by directly regulating methane and VOC emissions from various types of new and modified oil and gas sources.  Some of those sources were already regulated under NSPS OOOO, while others, like pneumatic pumps, were covered for the first time.  The EPA, however, is presently planning to reconsider OOOOa’s requirements for (i) monitoring for fugitive emissions (i.e., leaks), (ii) using professional engineers to certify closed vent systems, and (iii) pneumatic pumps that are used at well sites.  It is also planning to stay or postpone the effective dates of those requirements while it reconsiders them.  On February 23, 2018, moreover, the EPA amended OOOOa to remove certain requirements for sources of fugitive emissions to be repaired during unscheduled or emergency shutdowns.
 
Separately, on October 20, 2016, the EPA finalized Control Techniques Guidelines to reduce emissions from a number of existing (as opposed to new or modified) oil and gas sources that are located in certain ozone-sensitive areas, including Pennsylvania.  These guidelines will lead to regulations that directly address VOC emissions and have the incidental effect of reducing methane emissions.  The implementation deadline for the regulations is January 1, 2021.  On March 2, 2018, however, the EPA proposed to withdraw the Control Techniques Guidelines.
 Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil, and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations.

In 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court held in Massachusetts, et al. v. EPA that under the Clean Air Act greenhouse gas emissions may be regulated as an “air pollutant.” In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane, and other “greenhouse gases” present an endangerment to human health and the environment, the EPA, under the Clean Air Act, has adopted regulations that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases.  The EPA has adopted regulations that, among other things, require a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles and impose greenhouse gas emissions limitations on certain stationary sources. The EPA has also adopted regulations that require monitoring and reporting on GHG emissions from specified sources, including petroleum refineries and certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities.  As noted above, moreover, the EPA has finalized New Source Performance Standards that address VOC and methane emissions from the oil and gas industry.
 Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly reporting, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal, or cleanup requirements could materially adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as those of the oil and gas industry in general. For example, recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the Earth’s atmosphere. While the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered climate change-related bills to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, there has not been significant activity in the form of adopted legislation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at the federal level in recent years. In the absence of such federal legislation, a number of states have passed laws, adopted regulations, or undertaken regulatory initiatives to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases, primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether or when the U.S. Congress may act on climate change legislation or how federal legislation may be reconciled with state and regional requirements, any future federal laws or implementing regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions could require us to incur increased operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas, NGLs, and oil that we produce. 
 State Laws
 In addition to federal laws and regulations, the various states where we operate have enacted their own environmental laws and regulations. As an example, in 2012, Pennsylvania enacted Act 13 (“Act 13”), which represented the first comprehensive legislation regarding the development of the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania.  Act 13, among other things, (i) set stronger environmental standards, (ii) established impact fees, which are determined based on a multi-year fee schedule and the average sales prices of natural gas, (iii) increased the notice distance for unconventional well permit applications, (iv) extended certain setback distances for unconventional wells, and (v) increased the distance and duration of presumed well-operator liability for water pollution.  In addition, Act 13 imposed spill prevention requirements applicable to well site construction, wastewater transportation, and gathering lines. 
 Act 13 has been the subject of multiple challenges in Pennsylvania courts.  In 2013, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, among other things, invalidated the portions of Act 13 providing for statewide gas and oil zoning and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection’s (“PaDEP”) issuance of waivers of setbacks from waterbodies. It also enjoined the enforcement of those setbacks.  In 2016, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, among other things, enjoined the enforcement of Act 13’s provisions that authorized the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission to conduct validity reviews of local oil and gas-siting ordinances and established procedures for mounting court challenges to those ordinances.  These decisions had the effect of giving local government in Pennsylvania more authority than they otherwise would have possessed to regulate where oil and gas operations may occur, which could make it more difficult to develop Marcellus Shale acreage in some municipalities.  We cannot predict whether the portions of Act 13 that remain effective will be amended or replaced, or how or to what extent any additional rules or regulations adopted under Act 13 will affect our operations in Pennsylvania.   
 Furthermore, in October 2016, the Pennsylvania Environmental Quality Board issued final rules that are codified in Chapter 78a of Title 25 of the Pennsylvania Code.  These rules changed and added requirements for surface activities related to unconventional oil and gas operations.  The rules include requirements for permitting, waste handling, water management and restoration, surface reclamation, and abandoned and orphaned wells.  In November 2016, the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court issued an order that enjoins the enforcement of certain portions of the rules while the court considers an industry group’s legal challenges to those and other portions of the rules.  These regulations may increase operating costs or cause unanticipated delays.
 
PaDEP, moreover, stated in an October 2017 regulatory update document that it is developing proposed amendments to the state’s well drilling, casing, cementing, operation, and plugging regulations.

In addition, in 2018, PaDEP is expected to finalize a new general permit (“GP-5A”) for air pollutant emissions from sources at new or modified gas well sites and certain remote pigging stations. Under the permit, methane, VOC, and hazardous air pollutant  emissions from certain sources would need to be controlled, using leading technologies, if uncontrolled potential emissions from those sources would exceed certain limits (e.g., 200 tons per year for methane).  GP-5A would also include special requirements for well drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations, well completion operations, and wellbore liquids unloading operations.  And, it would impose certain leak detection and repair requirements, which would be more stringent than the ones that NSPS OOOOa (discussed above) imposes.
 Although it is not possible at this time to predict whether proposed federal or state legislation or regulations will be adopted as currently written, if at all, or how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address environmental matters would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. Any additional costs or operating restrictions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation. In addition, new environmental laws or regulations could curtail the demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate and thus adversely affect demand for our products and services, which may in turn adversely affect our future results of operations.
