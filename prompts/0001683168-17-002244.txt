Item 1. Business.
1.a.) General Development of Business.
 
Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. 
 
Chineseinvestors.com was incorporated on January 6, 1997 in the State of Indiana under the corporate name “MAS Acquisition LII Corp.” Prior to June 12, 2000, the Company was a ‘blank check’ company seeking a business combination with an unidentified business.
 
On June 12, 2000, we acquired 8,200,000 shares of common stock, representing 100% of the outstanding shares of Chineseinvestors.com, Inc., which was incorporated in the State of California on June 15, 1999. In connection with this acquisition, Aaron Tsai, our former sole officer and director, was replaced by Chineseinvestors.com, Inc.’s officers and directors.
 
The stockholders of Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. were issued 8,200,000 shares of our common stock, or approximately 96% of our total outstanding common shares. After giving effect to the acquisition, Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. became a wholly owned subsidiary and we changed our name to Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. Immediately prior to the acquisition of Chineseinvestors.com, Inc., MAS Capital Inc. returned 8,200,000 shares of common stock for cancellation without any consideration.
 
Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. was established as an ‘in language’ (Chinese) financial information web portal, offering various levels of information relative to the US Equity and Financial Markets, as well as certain other specific financial markets (including China A Shares, FOREX, etc.). Over the years, various informational components have been added and the general content improved as the Company continues to derive a material portion of its income from various subscription services it offers to its customers. We offer subscription services to provide education about investing and news and analysis on the stock market as well as news about particular stocks that we are following. Nevertheless, we do not provide our subscribers with individualized investment advice and never have investment discretion over any subscribers’ or site visitors’ funds. As described below, providing investor relations services for other companies, especially those requiring Mandarin language support, now account for our most significant revenue sources.
 
The registrant’s investor relations agreements typically obligate the registrant to provide translations of the client’s releases into English from Mandarin or from English into Mandarin, to feature advertisements about the client on the www.chinesefn.com website, and otherwise to assist the client in achieving its goals, which may be increasing the client’s stock price, increasing awareness of the clients and its stock or helping the client to move from pink sheets to an established public securities market. Not all of those goals are shared by every client. Promotions geared to the Chinese American market is the underlying common thread, generally in the form of advertisements on the chinesefn.com website. The registrant provides other services intended to increase awareness and knowledge of its clients’ businesses and stock within the Chinese American community.
 
The registrant generally receives a fee consisting of cash and the client’s securities for its services. The securities clearly offer success incentives and align the interests of the registrant and the client.
 
Chineseinvestors.com, Inc. has been in continuous operation since July 1999 using the web domains (uniform resource locators) of www.chineseinvestors.com and www.chinesefn.com.
 
We established a Representative Office business presence in leased office space in Shanghai, China in late 2000 from which we fulfill most of our support types of service and also have a leased office presence in San Gabriel, California.

In 2010, the Company filed a Form 10 registration statement for us to become a public reporting company under the Exchange Act of 1934 in order to facilitate the Company’s ability to raise capital on the public market.

As part of its plans to establish direct selling channels for its non-industrial hemp products, the Company recently engaged Launch Haus, LLC, a venture building firm and digital holding company, based in Scottsdale, AZ, specializing in direct response marketing including digital, ecommerce, and direct sales channels. Launch Haus will play an integral part in directing the Company’s organization and launch of its direct-to-consumer ecommerce and network marketing business divisions in the US and potentially China. Launch Haus has a strong presence in the direct-selling industry and its principals have a proven track record having built sales organizations with large commissionable volume over the last 10 years. In addition to general go-to-market planning and customer experience consulting, Launch Haus has been engaged to: develop a customized cutting-edge direct response marketing campaign that will focus on personalized, customer-centric marketing and sales force automation; develop a compensation plan that incentivizes both rapid growth through recruitment of new, entry-level consumers and top-tier distributors; introduce the Company to its stable of industry-leading suppliers for global payment systems and logistics and its network of distributor recruitment and legal governance and compliance professionals.

Meanwhile in March 2017, the Company made a $250,000 investment in Breakwater MB, LLC, a cannabis-focused investment and consulting company, formed by the Company’s board member and former CFO, Paul Dickman, as a means to invest capital in and provide consulting services to private, cannabis-focused companies as they transition into the public market. The invested capital will primarily be used to cover the costs of becoming a publicly traded company, a strategy the Company expects will provide significant investment appreciation and opportunity for liquidity. All opportunities will be evaluated by the investment committee comprised of ChineseInvestors.com, Inc.’s CEO Warren Wang, Medicine Man Technologies CEO Andy Williams, and Paul Dickman, former CFO and current board member of ChineseInvestors.com, Inc. Mr. Dickman is the managing member of Breakwater MB, LLC. The Company’s CEO, Warren Wang, serves as an advisor to Breakwater MB, LLC, but will not receive compensation for his services.
 
Currently, Breakwater MB, LLC has raised a total of $700,000 and it has commitments for an additional $400,000. The Company’s equity position in Breakwater MB, LLC will be approximately 12.5%. ChineseInvestors.com, Inc.’s board reviewed and approved the investment with Mr. Dickman abstaining from voting. Mr. Dickman has committed to invest between $5,000 and $15,000 in Breakwater MB equity. That investment in addition to services that Mr. Dickman may render for Breakwater MB may result in his receiving up to 30% of the equity of Breakwater MB, LLC.
 
1.c.) General Company Information.
 
Market and Market Prospects
 
A significant market focus of the Company is on the segment of the Chinese population (both in the US and abroad) that does not have English language reading and or speaking skills but who wish to participate in the various financial markets that typically do not offer real time Chinese language information from an investment and/or general information perspective. With the emergence of a Chinese middle class as well as those who have had wealth transferred to them, there appears to be a continuing expansion of interest by the Chinese public in the general financial and securities marketplace as a whole.
 
In addition, the Company continues to provide various additional service initiatives including 1) offering consulting services, 2) offering various investor and public relation services, and 3) high quality information. The Company continues to build its current client base with regard to content services.

Support Services

General Corporate Support Services
 
In June 2012 the Company initiated its first corporate support service (hybrid IR) support effort for Nova Lifestyle, Inc. (Nova) a company whose shares of common stock are quoted on the OTCQB marketplace. The Company provided Nova’s global operations with interim general share and shareholder support via messaging and information delivery to our Company’s subscribers. The initial period (beginning June 15, 2012) was so successful that Nova engaged the Company for a twenty-four month services contract in exchange for 100,000 shares of Nova’s (Symbol “STVS”) common stock. That service contract has now expired.
Medicine Man Technologies Inc. Support Services
 
The Company participated in the startup as well as initial operations of Medicine Man Technologies in consideration of receiving 2,800,000 shares of common stock of the business valued at $0.41 per share on a private basis in the period ending May 31, 2016. Since being listed on the OTC marketplace under ticker MCDL, as a fully reporting OTC:QB listed enterprise it traded primarily in the $1.50 to $2.50 price range with limited trading.

The Company also provides foreign companies practical advice on US capital markets, the US legal system, the US Securities markets among other practical issues.

As of the date of this filing we have provided some level of investor relations services to over 70 different companies since commencing our investor relations services. Our investor relations services generated over $300,000 in stock related revenue in the annual period ending May 31, 2017.
 
In the fiscal year ending May 31, 2017, we experienced increase in value over what we reported in prior periods due to market recovery of the stock we have taken in compensation for our services. All such stock is accepted as restricted and not liquidated at any point during which we actively provide support or advertising services to a client. The majority of our corporate support services clients are not in a financial position to fully compensate us for the value of our services in cash.

The Company has worked toward establishing its web presence, but due to the lack of site use information in competitor companies, and based upon our website access metrics, the Company must acknowledge that while it has a substantial public audience potential, it is difficult to ascertain exactly where any specific leadership position lies; therefore, the Company can make no definitive statement as to an overall position of its website and presence within its specific marketplace.

In addition, the Company plans to substantially increase our presence in the US as well as China, expanding our educational training and seminar products substantially.
 
We believe that we have the requisite blend of experience and technical skills related to financial market awareness and content publication to develop a series of courses devoted to investor education and offered in the Mandarin language. Based on the demands of individuals in China and outside China, as well as on the structure and features of the financial markets, we anticipate we will be able to substantially increase our presence and revenues once we are able to offer services within China (Peoples Republic of China).
 
These courses will range in content providing basic knowledge and practical trading skills. They will be coupled with training in the use of digitalized, randomized, and quantified analyses for stock trading analysis and trading; helping the participants to be more skillful in practical trading as they progress through the course work.

Launch Haus has a strong presence in the direct-selling industry and its principals have a proven track record having built sales organizations with large commissionable volume over the last 10 years.

Plan
 
ChineseHempOil.com’s near-term goal is to break even within a 6 months. In order to achieve this goal, ChineseHempOil.com is increasing its sales volume via networking with existing customers and its affiliated companies and via its association with marketing related service providers such as Launch Haus. Additionally, the Company plans to increase its sales department to develop new customers.
 
ChineseHempOil.com’s ultimate goal is to make the business profitable and competitive in the domestic market. To achieve such goal, the Company needs to cooperate with other businesses having capital, market, technology, or products. Additionally, the Company needs to recruit sufficient workforce and talents and actively develop new technology and new products through research and development.
 
Market Overview
 
Domestic Markets
 
Through a member based distribution network, the Company will have access to the major markets in California, New York and most other states in United States. ChineseHempOil.com, Inc. currently markets its non-industrial hemp products via online channels including but not limited to ChineseHempOil.com and via retail sales. It also plans to market its non-industrial hemp-based health products and/or skin care products through its network marketing platform that is in the development stages.
International Market
 
Currently, ChineseHempOil.com, Inc. does not have plans to market its OptHemp product line internationally; however, this could change as international markets show an interest in such products.
Market Opportunity
 
ChineseHempOil.com, Inc. believes that consumers are increasingly concerned about their own health needs. Domestically, the health products market is expanding along with the growth of the economy and acceleration of an aging population. Therefore, ChieseHempOil.com, Inc. hopes to take advantage of this increased demand.

Competition
 
At present, non-industrial hemp health products are widely available in the United States. Our main goal is to distinguish ourselves through targeted ethnic marketing and enhanced product delivery technology. 
Intellectual Property
 
ChineseHempOil.com, Inc. has trademark applications pending for OptHemp as it relates to non-industrial hemp health products. Moreover, it is actively planning research and development of its own formulas and may seek to patent and trademark these products in development.
Government Regulation
 
Marijuana remains illegal under Federal law.
 
Marijuana is a Schedule-I controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of marijuana has been legalized, its use remains a violation of federal law. Since federal law criminalizing the use of marijuana preempts state laws that legalize, in large part its use, strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in our inability to proceed with our business plan. In large the Federal Government has refrained from enforcing the Federal Laws in states that have legalized marijuana. In a 2013 policy statement the Department of Justice stated that it intends to confine itself to eight objectives: Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors; Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form from going to other states; Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and use of marijuana; Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use; Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and Preventing marijuana possession or use on federal property. Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions hinted that the Department of Justice might begin more aggressive enforcement of federal laws against recreational marijuana, even in states that have legalized. Sessions' comments have echoed White House spokesman Sean Spicer, who predicted harsher prosecution of marijuana under the Trump Administration. If the Trump Administration were to crack down on states with legalized marijuana, the Department of Justice would have to lead the charge. Consequently, marijuana stock prices tend to move whenever Sessions mentions the topic. This would mark a significant priority shift from the Obama Administration’s 2013 policy statement discussed above.
 
Laws and regulations affecting the medical marijuana industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our proposed operations.
 
Local, state, and federal medical marijuana laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter certain aspects of our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt certain aspects of our business plan and result in a material adverse effect on certain aspects of our planned operations. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business. However, many influential people in the Cannabis Industry are lobbying diligently within the new administration to legalize Cannabis federally.
 
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration Rule Effective in January 2017 labeled Marijuana, Hemp and Their Derivatives as Schedule I substances.
 
On December 14, 2016, the Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) made an update to the Federal Register item (21 CFR Part 1308), creating a new Administration Controlled Substances Code Number for Marijuana Extract (hereinafter, the “Marijuana Extract Rule”). Marijuana Extract is defined therein as “. . . an extract containing one or more cannabinoids that has been derived from any plant of the genus Cannabis, other than the separated resin (whether crude or purified) obtained from the plant.” The Marijuana Extract Rule confirms that as of January 17, 2017, a harsher cannabis law will be put into place reclassifying non-THC cannabis oil as a schedule 1 drug, despite the fact cannabidiol (“CBD”) extracts are non-psychoactive.

Thereafter, on or about March 13, 2017, the DEA issued a clarification of the Marijuana Extract Rule and appeared to back off of its position somewhat. The DEA’s highlights of its clarification are that: The “marijuana extract” definition does not include materials or products excluded from the definition of marijuana set forth in the Controlled Substances Act (“CSA”). The CSA states: “The term 'marijuana' means all parts of the plant Cannabis sativa L., whether growing or not; the seeds thereof; the resin extracted from any part of such plant; and every compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such plant, its seeds or resin. Such term does not include the mature stalks of such plant, fiber produced from such stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of such plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks (except the resin extracted therefrom), fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant which is incapable of germination.” 21 U.S.C. § 802(16). Therefore, it appears that if a product consists solely of parts of the cannabis plant excluded from the CSA definition of marijuana, such product is not considered “marijuana” or a “marijuana extract.” In other words, CBD products derived solely from mature stalks or non-industrial hemp containing little-to-no THC don’t appear to be prohibited under the Marijuana Extract Rule. However, this clarification is not an official ruling by the DEA as it does not have the same authority as a formal rule. Instead, this clarification provides guidance as to how the DEA will enforce the Marijuana Extract Rule. In addition, the Marijuana Extract Rule is currently subject to an appeal pending in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals by members of the hemp industry, and this clarification may cause that court to rule that the clarification limits the final rule. In conclusion, the Marijuana Extract Rule itself carries more legal authority and this clarification is not an official ruling by the DEA — it is the agency’s interpretation of its own rule, which could change as the DEA so desires.
 
Our business is subject to strict government regulations.
 
The processing, formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of our products are subject to federal laws and regulation by one or more federal agencies, including the FDA, the FTC, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Environmental Protection Agency. These activities are also regulated by various state, local, and international laws and agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. Government regulations may prevent or delay the introduction, or require the reformulation, of our products, which could result in lost revenues and increased costs to us. For instance, the FDA regulates, among other things, the composition, safety, labeling, and marketing of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, herbs, and other dietary ingredients for human use). The FDA may not accept the evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient that we may wish to market, may determine that a particular dietary supplement or ingredient presents an unacceptable health risk, and may determine that a particular claim or statement of nutritional value that we use to support the marketing of a dietary supplement is an impermissible drug claim, is not substantiated, or is an unauthorized version of a “health claim.”
 
Any of these actions could prevent us from marketing particular dietary supplement products or making certain claims or statements of nutritional support for them. The FDA could also require us to remove a particular product from the market. Any future recall or removal would result in additional costs to us, including lost revenues from any additional products that we are required to remove from the market, any of which could be material. Any product recalls or removals could also lead to liability, substantial costs, and reduced growth prospects. With respect to FTC matters, if the FTC has reason to believe the law is being violated (e.g. failure to possess adequate substantiation for product claims), it can initiate an enforcement action. The FTC has a variety of processes and remedies available to it for enforcement, both administratively and judicially, including compulsory process authority, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement could result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, consumer redress, and divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, or such other relief as may be deemed necessary. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Any action against us by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products.
 
Additional or more stringent regulations of dietary supplements and other products have been considered from time to time. These developments could require reformulation of some products to meet new standards, recalls or discontinuance of some products not able to be reformulated, additional record-keeping requirements, increased documentation of the properties of some products, additional or different labeling, additional scientific substantiation, adverse event reporting, or other new requirements. Any of these developments could increase our costs significantly. For example, the Dietary Supplement and Nonprescription Drug Consumer Protection Act (S.3546), which was passed by Congress in December 2006, imposes significant regulatory requirements on dietary supplements including reporting of “serious adverse events” to FDA and recordkeeping requirements. This legislation could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. In June 2007, the FDA adopted final regulations on GMPs in manufacturing, packaging, or holding dietary ingredients and dietary supplements, which apply to the products we may manufacture and sell. These regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged, and held in compliance with certain rules. These regulations could raise our costs and negatively impact our business. Additionally, our third-party suppliers or vendors may not be able to comply with these rules without incurring substantial expenses. If our third-party suppliers or vendors are not able to timely comply with these new rules, we may experience increased cost or delays in obtaining certain raw materials and third-party products. Also, the FDA has announced that it plans to publish guidance governing the notification of new dietary ingredients. Although FDA guidance is not mandatory, it is a strong indication of the FDA’s current views on the topic discussed in the guidance, including its position on enforcement.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not Approved use of Cannabidiol as a Dietary Supplement.
 
The FDA has concluded that cannabidiol products are excluded from the dietary supplement definition under section 201(ff)(3)(B)(ii) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic (“FD&C”) Act. The FDA’s ruling could have broad implications for an industry built atop the potential health benefits of CBDs, including marketing strategies and product labeling to account for such rules which state that companies cannot make claims as to proven health or medical efficacy without FDA approval. As such, even if we generally try to comply with existing FDA rules to the extent possible, compliance may not guarantee escaping regulatory scrutiny. Still, a compliance strategy should decrease risk exposure, including from truth-in-advertising claims brought by consumers related to CBD products that we intend to market.

Plan
 
CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd’s near-term goal will be to achieve $1m in sales with the first year after the skin care line is launched. In order to achieve this goal, CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd. plans to create sales volume via networking with existing customers and its affiliated companies and via its association with marketing related service providers. Additionally, it may increase its sales department to develop new customers.
 
CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd’s ultimate goal is to make the business competitive in the international and domestic markets. To achieve such goal, it needs to cooperate with other businesses having capital, market, technology, or products. Additionally, the Company needs to recruit sufficient workforce and talents and actively develop new technology and new products through research and development.
 
Market Overview
 
Domestic & International Markets
 
CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd. plans to market its hemp skin care products via online channels and via retail and direct selling channels in international markets and domestic markets.
Market Opportunity
 
Skin care awareness and consciousness are some of the driving forces behind the booming skin care industry. Moreover, there is a rising demand for natural and organic products with no unnecessary chemicals, parabens, additives or fillers. Meanwhile, anti-aging products have shifted to those that do not just target wrinkles but also dry skin, uneven skin tone, hyperpigmentation and dark circles under eyes.
 
As Chinese consumers have seen their buying power grow over these past few years, they have bought more cosmetics than they used to. We are all now influenced by Asian countries’ beauty rituals. The US skin care market is expected to reach nearly $11 billion by 2018. CBD Biotechnology Co. Ltd. understands this mentality and will strive to meet consumer expectations both internationally and domestically in China by including hemp extract in its skin care products. Some dermatologists believe that the anti-oxidants and anti-inflammatory agents in hemp extract can positively impact the skin. Recognizing the untapped market potential, CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd. is developing and manufacturing what it believes to be the first line of non-industrial hemp-infused skin care products in China.
 
Competition
 
At present, CBD Biotechnology is not aware of any skin care products in China infused with hemp oil extract. As such it strives to be the leader when it comes to hemp infused cosmetics in China. Although skin care products containing hemp extract are currently being marketed in the US, CBD Biotechnology Co. Ltd. hopes to be able to gain market share in the US as well and specifically among Chinese consumers in the US.
Intellectual Property
 
As the products are still in development. CBD Biotechnoloty Co., Ltd. does not have any trademark applications.
 
Government Regulation
 
Although cannabis is still illegal in China, Cannabis Sativa Leaf Extract can legally be added to skin care products. A catalogue provided by the China Food and Drug Administration entitled “Catalogue of Cosmetics Raw Materials in Use (2015)” includes Cannabis Sativa Leaf Extract.
Employees
 
CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd currently has one full-time employee. In addition, some of the work is performed by parent company staff.
 
Property
 
CBD Biotechnology Co., Ltd.’s corporate headquarters are located in the Pudong Free-Trade Area in Shanghai.
