Corporate Overview and Our Products
 
CUI Global, Inc. and Subsidiaries, (collectively, ‘‘CUI Global’’ or “The Company”) is a Colorado corporation organized on April 21, 1998. CUI Global, Inc.'s principal place of business is located at 20050 SW 112th Avenue, Tualatin, Oregon 97062, phone (503) 612-2300. The Company is a platform company dedicated to maximizing shareholder value through the acquisition, development and commercialization of new, innovative technologies. The Company's operations fall into two reportable segments: Power and Electromechanical segment and Energy segment. In addition, the Company’s corporate overhead activities are included in an ‘‘other’’ category. The Company has subsidiaries in 4 countries, including the United States. Through its subsidiaries, CUI Global has built a diversified portfolio of industry leading technologies that touch many markets.
Power and Electromechanical Segment
 CUI, Inc., CUI Japan, and CUI-Canada - Subsidiaries
 CUI, Inc., is based in Tualatin, Oregon, CUI Japan is based in Tokyo, Japan and CUI-Canada, acquired in March 2015, is based in Toronto, Canada (collectively referred to as “CUI”). These three subsidiaries are providers of electronic components including power supplies, transformers, converters, connectors and industrial controls for Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs). Since its inception in 1989, CUI has been delivering quality products, extensive application solutions and superior personal service. CUI's solid customer commitment and honest corporate message are a hallmark in the industry.
 
The Power and Electromechanical segment aggregates its product offerings into two categories: components including connectors, speakers, buzzers, test and measurement devices, and control solutions including encoders and sensors; and power solutions. These offerings provide a technology architecture that addresses power and related accessories to industries as broadly ranging as telecommunications, consumer electronics, medical and defense.
 
Power Supply Units
 Our current power line consists of external and embedded ac-dc power supplies, dc-dc converters and basic digital point of load modules. This dynamic, broadly applicable product line accounts for a significant portion of our current revenue.
Digital Power Patent License Agreement with Power-One, Inc.
 CUI, Inc. entered into a non-exclusive Field of Use Agreement with Power-One, Inc. to license Power-One’s Digital Power Technology patents. The license provides access to Power-One’s portfolio of Digital Power Technology patents for incorporation into the company’s line of digital point of load power modules. The company, through its power division, also manufactures a wide range of embedded and external power electronics devices for OEM manufacturers.
Advanced Power
 With the rapid rise in cloud computing and the “Internet of Things,” CUI is well positioned with our advanced power portfolio to address these quickly-growing markets. System complexity, energy efficiency regulations and the need for more processing power in smaller spaces has moved digital power to a mandatory technology in datacom, server and storage applications. As one of the early adopters of digital power, CUI continues to be an industry leader in this space. As a founding member of the Architects of Modern Power (AMP) Group® power consortium partnered with Ericsson Power Modules and Murata, CUI is driving change in the industry to ensure supply chain security and push technology innovation for tomorrow’s applications. The acquisition of certain assets and certain liabilities of Tectrol, Inc. (now CUI-Canada) in 2015 now allows us to address the front-end power requirements of these same systems, providing a complete power solution for our customers. In an environment where OEMs are working to reduce their approved vendor list, the capability to deliver a full system solution is becoming critical.
 
During 2014, CUI, Ericsson Power Modules and Murata announced the formation of the Architects of Modern Power (AMP) consortium. The goal of the AMP alliance is to realize the most technically advanced, end-to-end solutions and provide a complete ecosystem of hardware, software and support. Beyond purely mechanical specifications, it is the standardization of monitoring, control and communications functions, and the creation of common configuration files for plug-and-play interoperability that will ensure compatibility between each firms’ products.
 
As the large scale networking and telecommunications companies convert to digital power, our early entry into the market, and our relationship with Ericsson should enhance our ability to penetrate this (according to the Darnell Group) multi-billion dollar market.

Energy Segment
 Orbital Gas Systems, Ltd. and Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc. - Subsidiaries
 Effective April 1, 2013, CUI Global closed on a share purchase agreement to acquire 100% of the equity interest in Orbital Gas Systems Ltd. a company organized under the laws of England and Wales (‘‘Orbital-UK’’), from its sole shareholder. In 2015, the Company started Orbital Gas Systems, North America, Inc.
 
Orbital-UK is the largest natural gas systems integrator in the U.K. and has operated successfully in the natural gas industry for over 30 years. In addition, Orbital-UK is a leading provider of natural gas infrastructure and high-tech solutions to United Kingdom transmission companies, including: Scotia Gas Networks (SGN); Wales & West; and National Grid, the national gas transmission company in the U.K. and one of the most respected specialized gas engineering companies in the world.
 
The Energy segment subsidiaries, collectively referred to as Orbital, have developed its portfolio of products, services and resources to offer a diverse range of personalized gas engineering solutions to the gas utilities, power generation, emissions, manufacturing and automotive industries. Its proprietary VE® Technology enhances the capability and speed of our GasPT® Technology. Moreover, VE Technology provides a superior method of penetrating the gas flow without the associated vortex vibration, thereby making it a ‘‘stand-alone’’ product for thermal sensing (thermowells) and trace-element sampling.
 
We deal with a number of independent licensors for whose intellectual property we compete with other manufacturers. Rights to such intellectual property, when acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the licensor a royalty on our net sales of the item. These license agreements, in some cases, also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees in order to maintain technical rights and exclusivity.
 
GasPT®
 Through an exclusive licensing contract with DNV-GL (formerly: GL Industrial Services UK, Ltd.) (formerly: British-based Advantica, Ltd.)(‘‘GL’’), CUI Global owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a Gas Quality Inferential Measurement Device (GasPT) designed by GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the GasPT. The Company has minimum commitments, including royalty payments, under this licensing contract.

The natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT, is a low cost solution for measuring natural gas quality. It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content. From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z). An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
 
This new and innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil & Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada in Canada, the Pipeline Research Counsel International (PRCI) in the US, ENGIE (the French energy giant), and NMi & The International Organization of Legal Metrology (‘‘OIML’’) for SNAM RETE in Italy. At present, there is no equivalent product competition. There are instruments like gas chromatographs (‘‘GC’’), but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT.
 
By way of example, in the case of SNAM RETE, the Italian gas transmission company, there are 13 natural gas injection points for the SNAM RETE system. Those injection points will continue to use GC’s for monitoring. On the other hand, there are 2,500 customer access points, servicing 7,500 customers. Those would include city gates, large industrial users, power generation plants and others. All of those customer access ports would be applicable for the GasPT Technology.
 
In the case of ENGIE and its subsidiaries, negotiations are underway to use the device to update/monitor ENGIE's residential network of some 21 million consumers, calling for the deployment of 10's of thousands of units.
 
In addition, there are more than 50,000 gas-fired turbines in operation worldwide. Each of those turbines is subject to variances in natural gas quality. Depending on the quality of the gas, by using our GasPTi Technology, those very expensive machines can be tuned to run more efficiently and therefore longer with significantly cleaner emissions. Currently, because of the delay in information from the GC’s, such tuning cannot be effectively accomplished. It is this greater efficiency that has led National Grid in the UK to change its entire turbine control strategy, canceling orders for several GC’s and, in 2013, replacing those GC’s with GasPTi devices specifically designed for natural gas-fired turbine control.
 
In conjunction with the Orbital acquisition, we have moved the entire GasPT technology portfolio, along with VE Technology, into Orbital’s product portfolio. Orbital has successfully introduced the combined GasPT analyzer and VE sample system (GasPTi) to National Grid, the largest natural gas provider in the UK. In addition, along with passing first phase testing by GE-Energy in October/November 2012, the GasPTi device successfully completed second phase testing with GE-Energy in October 2013. The device is now in the final phase testing at GE's Oil & Gas Learning Center in Nuovo Pignone, Florence, Italy.
 
In January 2012, the company entered into a five-year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a. for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia. SOCRATE is the ‘‘vendor-of-choice’’ for SNAM RETE GAS (‘‘SRG’’). SOCRATE continues to be involved in negotiations with SRG relative to both the 2010 Technical Upgrade of Metering Facilities and 2011/2012 New Capacity and Implementation Plan. In conjunction with those two initiatives, SRG transmission system concluded 24 months of in-field testing with six (6) GasPTi units.
 
On September 3, 2015, SRG issued a public tender for the installation of a minimum of 3,300 metering devices to change the way SRG monitors its facilities and assets. After a several month bidding process, Orbital and its partner, SOCRATE were awarded the initial purchase order (400 units) pursuant to the tender. Those 400 units were delivered on-time and in-budget during 2016. Due to a regulatory issue unrelated to the technology, the next phase of the project has been temporarily delayed; however, SRG has advised Orbital that the project is still fully funded, approved, and expected to move forward as soon as the regulatory matter is resolved. SRG has also confirmed that the GasPT device is still the only qualified technology.

Orbital utilizes internationally recognized distribution partners in various global markets in an effort to reach customers throughout the natural gas industry. These distribution partners are utilized to supplement and enhance our existing sales and engineering teams in the UK and USA.
 
VE-Probe and VE Technology®
 On July 30, 2013, our Orbital subsidiary acquired exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe VE sample system, VE thermowell and VE Technology from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd. The agreement, which includes certain royalty commitments, gives Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its revolutionary GasPT and GasPTi natural gas metering systems. The GasPT technology provides fast and accurate measurement of the physical properties of the natural gas mixture. By combining the GasPT technology with the equally unique VE sample system, which is able to provide a gas sample from a high pressure transmission line in less than two seconds, Orbital has created the GasPTi metering system.
 
The GasPTi system is able to accurately provide nearly real-time data to the natural gas operator in a total cycle-time of less than five seconds. Moreover, it provides this analysis at approximately one-fifth of the installation cost of current technology with none of the associated maintenance, carrier gas, calibration gas, or other ancillary costs associated with traditional technology.
 
VE Technology gives us the ability to control and produce the entire bill of materials for our GasPTi systems, thus allowing us to capture a larger margin as we provide this unique metering solution to the natural gas industry. Additionally, we can now also manufacture, market and sell additional applications for the VE Technology, including sampling systems separate from the GasPT and Thermowells found throughout all pipeline systems.
 
In addition, the VE Technology, in combination with applicable detectors, allows us to produce trace-element detectors for such components as mercury (Hg), moisture (H20), and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) that are particularly effective in quickly and accurately identifying these elements. That ability has allowed us to sell a significant number of our probes into the Gorgon LNG Project in Australia, a large Northeastern LNG terminal in the US, and chemical plants throughout North America.
 
Anticipated Growth Strategy for Our Energy Segment
 We are presently in the midst of our marketing efforts for our GasPT Inferential Natural Gas Monitoring Device, VE technology products, and other product offerings. Our strategy includes:

· | For GasPT our strategy has been to identify the large gas utility companies who would most likely provide opportunities for batch sales rather than single unit sales. This approach has focused strongly on the United Kingdom, Europe and the United States. The Company will continue its efforts in those areas.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We will continue the process of identifying prospects for our GasPT technology in the Asian markets.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Beyond this, our strategy is based on identification of the main geographical locations for liquefied natural gas importation (pipelines and terminals), mixing and blending points and strategic locations for security of supply strategies, which can be current or planned pipelines and import terminals where additional gas quality monitoring may be required.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Orbital-UK continues to develop new integrated solutions, promote existing technologies, and increase customer relationships within the UK while working to increase its worldwide reach.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company will continue to identify opportunities to utilize the unique VE technology beyond the existing product offering, with a focus on gas sampling, thermowells, and trace element sampling applications.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We entered into a second five-year, exclusive distribution agreement for our GasPT technology with an Italian company, SOCRATE s.p.a., for sales, marketing, distribution and service of our GasPT gas metering device for Italy and North Africa, including Libya and Tunisia.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | During 2016, Orbital signed a Technology and Patent License Agreement with daily Thermetrics, a globally-respected design and manufacturing company providing process industries with precise temperature measurement instrumentation. The Agreement calls for the manufacture and sale of the patented natural gas sampling VE technology in North America. This relationship is expected to allow Orbital to more efficiently penetrate the North American energy market.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Company will continue to seek out new opportunities to design, manufacture, and produce innovative solutions within the Energy segment in efforts to increase customer reach, product innovation, and growth. In such an effort, during 2016, Orbital was awarded a $3.0 million project to design, manufacture, and produce innovative solutions for gas quality and volumetric metering within SGN’s (formerly: Scotia Gas Network) Great Britain gas distribution network. Orbital-UK was awarded the contract by DNV GL a leader within the oil and gas industry.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The objective of the SGN project is to optimize gas network design and network operation assumptions. This project will use a pilot trial methodology with the procurement and installation of innovative sensor technologies across pressure tiers in a gas distribution system. These technologies, combined with novel power and communications and a cloud-based data system, will be used by DNV GL to develop a prototype real-time energy demand model, a world first. Innovative technology, such as Orbital’s proprietary GasPT Technology, form the backbone of the solution coupled with bespoke metering designs to be used to meet the project criteria. The project is designed to produce a GasPT application which would allow the millions of residential energy consumers to have immediate, real-time access to the cost of their energy usage.
 
We have entered into negotiations with ENGIE the French transmission company for deployment of the devices to both GRTgaz (ENGIE’s pipeline subsidiary) and Elengy (ENGIE’s liquid natural gas subsidiary) in the near future. ENGIE has already agreed to represent the technology to other Western European and North American entities in a partnership with Orbital.
 
According to the latest industry analysts (including MarketsandMarkets), the global GC market reached $2,583.6 million in 2014 and is poised to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% from 2014 to 2019, reaching $3,605.1 million by 2019. Admittedly, that market is mature and is dominated by ‘‘after-market and accessories’’ sales. In contrast, the GasPT Technology is less expensive, more efficient and dramatically faster than any available GC. It provides nearly real-time monitoring without the need for a large enclosure, carrier gas and, most significantly, regular technical support and calibration. Taking all of those factors into account, it is our intention that the GasPT Technology will rapidly and effectively penetrate a large segment of that $2.5+ billion market.

Intellectual Property Protection
 The Company relies on various intellectual property laws and contractual restrictions to protect its proprietary rights in products, logos and services. These include confidentiality, invention assignment and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors, suppliers and strategic partners. The confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees, contractors and suppliers are in perpetuity or for a sufficient length of time so as to not threaten exposure of proprietary information.
 
Under the United States Trademark Act of 1946, as amended, and the system of international registration of trademarks governed by international treaties, the Madrid Agreement concerning the international registration of marks and the protocol relating to the Madrid Agreement, administered by the World Intellectual Property Organization, which maintains the international register and, in several instances, direct trademark registration in foreign countries, we and our subsidiaries actively maintain up to date the following trademarks: CUI INC, AMT, Novum, CUI Global, GasPT, IRIS, AMP, Architects of Modern Power, AMP Group, Solus, Total Power Solutions and Orbital Gas Systems.
 
The Company continuously reviews and updates the existing intellectual property filings and files new documentation both nationally and internationally (Patent Cooperation Treaty) in a continuing effort to maintain up to date protection of its intellectual property.
 
For those intellectual property applications pending, there is no assurance that the registrations will be granted. Furthermore, the Company is exposed to the risk that other parties may claim the Company infringes their existing patent and trademark rights, which could result in the Company’s inability to develop and market its products unless the Company enters into licensing agreements with the technology owner or could force the Company to engage in costly and potentially protracted litigation.
 
Competitive Business Conditions
 The industries in which the company competes are very broad. We operate a commoditized power and electromechanical parts distribution business that is focused on efficiency of delivery and competitive pricing to differentiate our products from competitors. The market is subject to some volatility due to production requirements of larger global firms. We feel that our power and electromechanical parts distribution business is diverse and broad. We have very strong retail distribution partners that maximizes our product exposure to new designs and small to medium sized customers. We focus on the OEM market and supply higher levels of support, customer service and a constantly expanding product line, in order to further differentiate with our competitors. This product line ranges from a $0.02 connector to a >$1,000 power solution – all different products for different customers. Additionally, we utilize third party external sales representative organizations to penetrate new and better customers otherwise not readily available to the company.
 
CUI is becoming more recognized in the power supply market and has differentiated itself through technology with a foundation of legacy and product quality. As of December 31, 2016, our Power and Electromechanical segment accounted for approximately 67.5% of our revenues and our Energy segment accounted for approximately 32.5% of our revenues. We continue to add new products and technologies that will provide us the opportunity to compete outside of price and more on innovative technology and strategic partnerships.
 
From our portfolio of full-featured power supplies, we believe that we are competitive with market leaders in our space and that the market is ready for new technologies and new ideas. With the shift toward digitally-based power supplies accelerating, our strategy is to develop a true software defined power ecosystem where the sum of the components is greater than its parts.
 
Similarly, the natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT along with our VE-Probe, competes in a mature industry with established competitors. There are significant investments being made globally into the natural gas extraction and transportation infrastructure. Our natural gas quality measurement system is a comparably low cost solution to measuring natural gas quality as compared to our best competition. It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content. From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z). This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and SNAM RETE in Italy. At present, there is no equivalent product competition. There are instruments like gas chromatographs, but they are slower and more complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT system.
