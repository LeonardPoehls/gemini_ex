--------+---------

Overview 
 We are a science-driven, patient-focused biopharmaceutical company seeking to leverage our believed strengths across the continuum from discovery through commercialization by discovering and developing small molecule therapeutics to meet the needs of patients with infectious and complement-mediated diseases. 
 Our current focus is on our complement inhibitor platform, directed at advancing small molecule compounds that have the potential to be used in the treatment of immune-related diseases associated with the alternative pathway of the complement system. The complement system is a part of the human innate immune system and is believed to comprise three pathways, the alternative pathway, the lectin pathway and the classical pathway. We are advancing novel small molecules from this platform which will initially target complement factor D, an essential protein within the amplification loop of the alternative pathway. The alternative pathway is thought to play a critical role in a number of disease conditions including rare orphan conditions such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, a blood disorder, and C3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, a kidney disease, as well as more prevalent indications such as dry age-related macular degeneration, or dry AMD, an ophthalmologic disease. 
 We have generated a platform of potent and specific orally-administered compounds that, in preclinical studies, bind to factor D with high affinity, resulting in alternative pathway inhibition. Our lead drug candidate has demonstrated complete suppression of alternative pathway complement activity after oral dosing in healthy volunteers in a phase I clinical trial. We believe that our alternative pathway factor D inhibitor compounds may have a pharmacological advantage in addressing extravascular hemolysis, or red blood cell destruction outside of blood vessels, that affects patients with PNH, including those whose intravascular hemolysis, or red blood cell 
 
1 
 
 destruction within blood vessels, is successfully treated with currently approved treatments. In addition, we believe we may be able to treat the proportion of patients with PNH who have suboptimal response to, or who fail to respond to, currently approved treatments for PNH. Further, because C3G is a disease resulting from alternative pathway over-activation, we believe our factor D inhibitors may be effective in treating patients with C3G. In addition, we are advancing other small molecule compounds with characteristics that have the potential to be appropriate for treatment of dry AMD. We may also seek to advance other factor D inhibitors for oral systemic administration to treat PNH, C3G, or other diseases. 
 We also have a collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen, the pharmaceutical subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson Inc., under which we have granted to Janssen exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize a portfolio of antiviral drug candidates we discovered and developed for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus, or HCV, infection in exchange for specified milestone payments, future royalties, if any, and an equity investment in us. 
 We also intend to continue to leverage our extensive expertise in structural biology and synthetic chemistry to discover and develop additional small molecule compounds to meet other significant unmet medical needs. We believe our drug discovery capabilities will allow us to further expand our drug candidate portfolio, providing us with strong growth potential and, over time, reducing our reliance on the success of any single drug candidate. Our research team has successfully discovered and advanced multiple compounds into clinical development including sovaprevir, odalasvir, and ACH-3422 in our HCV program, all of which we have licensed to Janssen, and ACH-4471, a first-generation complement factor D inhibitor from our broad alternative pathway complement inhibitor platform. 
 We were incorporated on August 17, 1998 in Delaware. Since our inception, we have spent substantial research and development funds to develop our drug candidate pipeline and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We have incurred losses of $503.6 million from inception through December 31, 2016 and had an accumulated deficit of $517.4 million as of December 31, 2016, which includes preferred stock dividends recognized until our initial public offering in 2006. Our net losses were $61.7 million, $5.0 million, and $69.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. 
 Collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 In May 2015, we entered into an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with Janssen, and its affiliate, JJDC, which we refer to as the Janssen Agreement. Under the Janssen Agreement, we granted Janssen exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products that contain one or more of our drug candidates for the treatment of HCV, namely odalasvir, a second-generation NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3422, a NS5B HCV polymerase inhibitor, and sovaprevir, a NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor. We completed the transfer of our portfolio of drug candidates for the treatment of chronic HCV to Janssen in December 2015. 
 Under the terms of the Janssen Agreement, we are eligible to receive (1) up to $115.0 million of milestone payments based upon achievement of clinical enrollment and dosing in specified studies, substantially all of which is related to dosing in one study, (2) up to an additional $290.0 million of milestone payments based upon regulatory approvals and first commercial sale in specified territories, the majority of which relates to regulatory approval and the first commercial sale in the U.S., and (3) up to an additional $500.0 million of milestone payments based upon achieving worldwide sales targets. We recognized revenue of $15.0 million in December 2016 related to the achievement of a clinical enrollment milestone under the Janssen Agreement. 
 We are also eligible to receive royalties on worldwide annual net sales of licensed products, if any, at tiered royalty rate percentages beginning in the mid-teens and rising to the low-twenties, subject to customary reductions. The royalty term is determined on a licensed-product-by-licensed-product and country-by-country basis and begins on the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country and ends on the expiration of the last to expire of specified patents or regulatory exclusivity covering such licensed product in such country or, 
 
2 
 
 with a customary royalty reduction, ten years after such first commercial sale if there is no such exclusivity. Janssen will bear the future costs of worldwide development and commercialization of licensed products. 
 In addition, effective on July 1, 2015, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with JJDC, which we refer to as the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, we issued 18,367,346 shares of common stock to JJDC at a price of $12.25 per share for an aggregate purchase price of $225.0 million. 
 Our Strategy 
 Our objective is to become the leading biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering, developing and commercializing small molecule therapies that specifically target the alternative pathway of the human complement system, while continuing our interests in HCV through collaboration with our partner, Janssen. Specifically, our near-term strategy includes the following efforts: 

 | Become the leading pharmaceutical company focused on the complement alternative pathway by:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advancing the first alternative pathway factor D inhibitor in clinical development for PNH and C3G. We believe ACH-4471 is the first small molecule alternative pathway factor D inhibitor to be tested in humans. We began clinical development with this compound in February 2016 and we have completed a single-ascending dose trial and have completed dosing of four cohorts in a multiple-ascending dose trial designed to understand the safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of the drug candidate after oral administration for which final data analysis is ongoing. We have initiated screening in a phase II clinical trial in patients with PNH and anticipate providing an update on the status of the program in the first half of 2017. In addition, we anticipate initiating a clinical trial in patients with C3G in the second half of 2017.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advancing next-generation compounds for PNH and C3G. Our highly skilled discovery team has designed and advanced a robust portfolio of compounds with a goal of improving the efficacy, pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of our first factor D inhibitors. In addition to advancing ACH-4471, our objective is to design improved next-generation compounds that move into IND-enabling preclinical studies, as well as another set of compounds that move into late-stage preclinical characterization. We anticipate initiating phase I clinical trials with a second alternative pathway factor D inhibitor before year-end 2017.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advancing other compounds for treatment of ophthalmologic conditions where over activation of the alternative pathway is implicated. Excessive activation of alternative pathway in the complement system has been implicated in multiple therapeutic areas outside of rare diseases including dry AMD. We have designed, discovered and begun preclinical testing of a number of compounds for potential clinical development for dry AMD and its advanced form, geographic atrophy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Advancing our understanding of the role of alternative pathway factor D inhibition in human disease. We have established research collaborations with a number of academic institutions and scientific and clinical leaders to better elucidate the role of the alternative pathway and factor D in causing human disease. These collaborations have served to advance our understanding of the implications of inhibiting the alternative pathway. We believe our understanding of the biology underlying complement-mediated disease is highly valuable and provides us with a competitive advantage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Collaborating with Janssen in HCV.
--+-----------------------------------

 In order to access the worldwide development and commercialization expertise of a major pharmaceutical organization to facilitate the advancement of our HCV drug candidate portfolio, we entered into a collaboration with Janssen in June 2015. Despite the fact that Janssen has the deciding vote on collaborative matters we will seek to maximize the value of this collaboration by leveraging our participation in the joint steering committee, 
 
3 
 
 or JSC, with Janssen management to support the clinical development of a safe, effective, short-duration combination regimen to treat chronic HCV infection. Janssen is currently conducting OMEGA-1, a phase IIb clinical study of JNJ-4178, a once daily oral regimen of odalasvir, AL-335, and simeprevir, in patients with genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 HCV, including both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients. 
 Our Programs 
 Our expertise in structural biology and synthetic chemistry, coupled with our work in antimicrobial discovery research, led us to consider how the immune system plays a part in inhibiting pathogens in the body. This research led to the development of our platform focused on complement system inhibition. 
 The first clinical compound from our complement inhibitor platform is ACH-4471, which entered phase I clinical development in healthy volunteers in February 2016. ACH-4471 is designed to target and inhibit complement factor D, a critical protein in the amplification loop within the alternative pathway of the complement system. 
 ACH-4471. ACH-4471 is a potent and specific inhibitor of factor D which demonstrated complete inhibition of the complement alternative pathway in human healthy volunteers in a phase I clinical trial. Further, the compound has demonstrated dose-proportional in vitro suppression of red blood cell destruction, or hemolysis, in plasma samples from PNH patients and similar suppression of cell killing in serum from patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or aHUS. ACH-4471 has exhibited the following characteristics in preclinical studies and clinical trials: 
 

 | Potency. ACH-4471 is highly specific for inhibition of factor D, a protein critical to the amplification of the complement system. In oral administration of ACH-4471 in non-human primates at a dose of 200mg/kg, we noted complete and sustained suppression of alternate pathway activity. In phase I clinical trials in healthy human volunteers, we noted similar complete suppression of alternative pathway activity to 24 hours post-dosing. The compound has been shown in vitro to efficiently block the alternative pathway of the complement system in both PNH and aHUS, patient blood samples.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism. Pharmacokinetic results and activity in preclinical studies suggest that ACH-4471 should be explored in clinical development for potential oral dosing twice or three times daily. Controlled release formulation systems are being developed for ACH-4471 with the objective of once daily dosing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Safety. We have completed fourteen day and twenty eight day toxicology studies in rats and dogs, respectively, in which ACH-4471 demonstrated high safety margins with minimal dose-related effects even at high drug exposures. Three month toxicology studies testing the effects of ACH-4471 in both rats and dogs are completed and support progression of ACH-4471. In single-ascending and multi-ascending dose phase I clinical trials in healthy volunteers, ACH-4471 has been generally well tolerated with no treatment-related serious adverse events reported. Two cases of self-limited, alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, elevations (Grade 3 and 4) were observed post-treatment at doses of 500mg and 800mg twice daily, respectively, with neither subject exhibiting signs or symptoms of hepatic decompensation. Both subjects ALT levels normalized without intervention during follow up. Further, no treatment-associated fever or infections were observed.

 Next Generation Factor D Inhibitors for Oral Administration. Our research team has synthesized almost 2,000 factor D inhibitor compounds from which we have selected several to advance into further development. The most advanced of these is currently in IND-enabling studies. Other compounds are in late screening and we anticipate selecting additional compounds to advance into IND-enabling studies in 2017. 
 Next Generation Factor D Inhibitors for Intravitreal Administration. Our research team has selected several compounds from our library for the pharmacophysical properties that may be advantageous for delivery

 to the back of the eye. We are advancing a number of these compounds in preclinical studies and anticipate selecting one or more lead compounds later in 2017. 
 The Complement System 
 The complement system is part of the bodys immune system. The immune system protects the body by recognizing and eliminating bacteria, viruses and other infectious agents, referred to as pathogens, and abnormal cells such as cancer cells. The activities of the immune system are undertaken by its two components, the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The role of the innate immune system is to provide a rapid nonspecific response to pathogens or abnormal cells in the body and to activate the adaptive immune system. The role of the adaptive immune system is to provide a specific response to pathogens or abnormal cells. Once a pathogen or abnormal cell has been recognized, the adaptive immune system generates immune cells and antibodies that specifically attack that pathogen or abnormal cell. 
 Complement is activated via three pathways: the alternative pathway, lectin pathway and the classical pathway. At sites of infection, the complement system activates and triggers a series of potent inflammatory responses. There are also many regulatory mechanisms to prevent uncontrolled complement over-activation. 
 The complement system consists of over 30 small proteins and protein fragments found in the blood, generally synthesized by the liver, and normally circulating in an inactive state. Complement proteins account for about 5% of the globulin portion of blood serum. A number of complement proteins are proteases. When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave specific proteins and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages. The end-result of this activation cascade is amplification of the response and activation of the pathogen- and cell-killing membrane attack complex, or MAC. 
 The alternative pathway is one of three complement pathways that opsonize, or prepare a pathogen for destruction, and kill pathogens. The alternative pathway is initiated by the spontaneous hydrolysis, or breaking of protein C3 chemical bonds through the introduction of water. This is sometimes referred to as tickover and is the initiation of alternative pathway. Many inflammatory, autoimmune, neurodegenerative and age-related diseases are associated with inefficient complement regulation or excessive activity of the complement system and are believed to be specifically related to the alternative pathway. 
 Current therapies, including those in development, to treat PNH target other complement proteins such as C5 or C3 that are active downstream of factor D within the protein activation cascade of the complement system. 
 The PNH Market 
 PNH is a life-threatening, ultra-rare genetic blood disorder defined by chronic uncontrolled complement activation leading to the destruction of red blood cells, or hemolysis, which can take place both inside, or intravascularly, and outside, or extravascularly, of the circulatory system. Based on internal research, we estimate that PNH affects approximately 10,000 people in North America and Western Europe. The chronic hemolysis in patients with PNH may be associated with life-threatening thrombotic events, recurrent pain, kidney disease, disabling fatigue, severe anemia, pulmonary hypertension, shortness of breath and intermittent episodes of dark-colored urine or hemoglobinuria. The only currently approved therapy for PNH patients is eculizumab, or Soliris®, which originally was approved in 2007 and is currently approved in the United States, Europe, Japan and in several other territories. Sales of Soliris® were reported to be $2.8 billion in 2016. 
 We estimate that approximately 25% of patients currently treated with eculizumab, the current standard of care for patients with PNH, have suboptimal response in the form of symptomatic extravascular hemolysis due to the accumulation of C3 protein fragments on red blood cells, or due to genetic mutations that prevent binding of eculizumab to C5, the protein target of eculizumab. Patients who respond sub-optimally to eculizumab through extravascular hemolysis often require dosing at higher than recommended levels or greater dosing frequency. 
 
5 
 
The C3G Market 
 C3G is a life-threatening, ultra-rare disorder characterized by over-activation of the alternative pathway. The condition includes both dense deposit disease, or DDD, and C3 glomerulonephritis, and is typically characterized by abnormalities in complement protein levels which results in deposits of complement protein C3 fragments within the glomeruli of the kidney, thereby inhibiting proper filtration of the blood, tissue scarring, and ultimately impaired kidney function. The overall prognosis for patients with C3G is poor, with approximately 50% of C3G patients progressing to end-stage renal disease, or ESRD, within 10 years of diagnosis. Dialysis and renal transplantation are options available for patients who reach ESKD; however, disease recurrence is frequent after transplantation, occurring in more than 50% of patients. Only about 50% of patients have a functioning graft 5 years after transplantation. Based on internal research, we estimate that C3G affects approximately 6,000 people in North America and Western Europe. Other than dialysis and renal transplantation, there are no approved treatments for patients with C3G. 
The Dry AMD Market 
 Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in elderly people, and we estimate that there are more than 10 million intermediate and advanced stage patients with AMD worldwide. AMD may reach epidemic levels in the next decade as the population in developed markets ages. Dry AMD is one of two advanced stages of AMD that, according to internal research, affects approximately 1.5 million patients. There are no currently approved therapies for patients with dry AMD, including its advanced form, geographic atrophy. One therapy currently being evaluated in a phase III clinical trial uses a monoclonal antibody for injection every 4-6 weeks. Due to their lower molecule weight and greater relative potency, we believe our small molecule factor D inhibitors, while leveraging the same mechanism of action as the phase III monoclonal antibody, may have the potential for dosing to the eye at frequencies of every three months or longer. 
Benefits of Our Approach 
 We believe that compounds advanced from our complement inhibitor platform have distinct potential advantages over currently available therapies. 
 Focus on the Alternative Pathway 
 Many complement-mediated diseases are the direct result of dysregulation of the alternative pathway. While other complement treatments marketed or in development focus on inhibiting the classical, lectin or terminal pathways (the terminal pathway being the final stage of all three complement pathways), these treatments do not affect the complement system at the root of dysregulation. For example, C3G results from overproduction of C3 fragments that ultimately deposit in the kidney, impairing renal function. This overproduction of C3 fragments stems from dysregulation of the fluid phase of the alternative pathway. Factor D inhibitors can potentially block or suppress over activation of the alternative pathway, limiting or eliminating C3 fragment deposition in the kidney. Conversely, other complement inhibitors, such as C3 and C5 inhibitors, do not specifically inhibit the alternative pathway. 
Targeting Factor D 
 In blood serum, factor D has one of the lowest concentration of all the complement proteins, including targets of other therapies including C5 and C3. It is therefore limited and has the potential to provide a highly specific target for drug intervention while, we believe, limiting off-target effects and potentially leading to lower doses. Our expertise in synthetic chemistry has allowed our scientists to utilize crystal structures with high resolution to synthesize compounds that bind specifically to factor D. Further, because factor D is rate-limiting in activation of the alternative pathway, targeting factor D effectively shuts down the amplification loop that can lead to indiscriminant activation of the complement system. 
 
6 
 
Small Molecule Inhibitors 
 All our complement factor D inhibitor compounds for the potential treatment of rare diseases are orally-available small molecule compounds. This is in contrast to biologic compounds that require intravenous or subcutaneous dosing. The current therapy for PNH is dosed intravenously, requiring routine hospital visits. We believe that oral dosing could provide a more convenient regimen for patients and their care-givers. Additional small molecule compounds stemming from our alternative pathway factor D inhibitor platform, are also being optimized for ophthalmic administration. These compounds may have dosing advantages in ophthalmological complement-mediated diseases such as dry AMD, with the goal of dosing intervals of every three months or longer. We also believe that our factor D inhibitor compounds have the potential to treat C3G, a disease for which there are no approved therapies, by preventing or reducing the accumulation of C3 fragments. 
Our Collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
 In May 2015, we entered into parallel transactions with Janssen and its affiliate, JJDC, Inc., consisting of (i) an exclusive collaboration and license agreement with Janssen, which we refer to as the Janssen Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Janssen exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products that contain one or more of our drug candidates for the treatment of HCV, namely odalasvir, a second-generation NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3422, a NS5B HCV polymerase inhibitor, and sovaprevir, a NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor, and (ii) a stock purchase agreement, which we refer to as the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, pursuant to JJDC purchased 18,367,346 shares of our common stock at a price of $12.25 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $225.0 million. The Janssen Agreement became effective on June 29, 2015 upon the early termination of applicable waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement became effective July 1, 2015. In connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, we and JJDC entered into an investor agreement on July 1, 2015, which we refer to as the Investor Agreement, governing specified rights and obligations of JJDC with respect to its ownership of shares of our common stock. 
 Under the terms of the Janssen Agreement, we are eligible to receive (1) up to $115.0 million of milestone payments based upon achievement of clinical enrollment and dosing in specified studies, substantially all of which is related to dosing in one study, (2) up to an additional $290.0 million of milestone payments based upon regulatory approvals and first commercial sale in specified territories, the majority of which relates to regulatory approval and the first commercial sale in the U.S., and (3) up to an additional $500.0 million of milestone payments based upon achieving worldwide sales targets. We recognized revenue of $15.0 million in December 2016 related to the achievement of a clinical enrollment milestone under the Janssen Agreement. 
 We are also eligible to receive royalties on worldwide annual net sales of licensed products, if any, at tiered royalty rate percentages beginning in the mid-teens and rising to the low-twenties, subject to customary reductions. The royalty term is determined on a licensed-product-by-licensed-product and country-by-country basis and begins on the first commercial sale of a licensed product in a country and ends on the expiration of the last to expire of specified patents or regulatory exclusivity covering such licensed product in such country or, with a customary royalty reduction, ten years after such first commercial sale if there is no such exclusivity. Janssen will bear the future costs of worldwide development and commercialization of licensed products. 
 Under the Janssen Agreement, Janssen has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop a specified licensed product toward regulatory approval in several specified major market countries and, if such development is successful, to seek regulatory approval in such countries. Following regulatory approval (and pricing and reimbursement approvals, as applicable) of any licensed product in any of the major market countries, Janssen will use commercially reasonable efforts during the applicable royalty term to commercialize such licensed product in each major market country where it has been approved. 
 The term of the Janssen Agreement will continue, unless earlier terminated, until expiration of the royalty term for licensed products or all payment obligations under the Janssen Agreement. Janssen may terminate the 
 
7 
 
 Janssen Agreement upon 60 days written notice to us at any time prior to submission of the first application for marketing approval for a licensed product in any of the specified major market countries. Janssen may also terminate the Janssen Agreement under specified circumstances relating to the safety or regulatory approvability of a licensed product. Either we or Janssen may terminate the Janssen Agreement if the other party is in material breach of the agreement and fails to cure such breach within specified cure periods. Either we or Janssen may terminate the Janssen Agreement in the event of specified insolvency events involving the other party. Upon any early termination, rights to our licensed drug candidates will revert to us. 
 In connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement, we and JJDC entered into an Investor Agreement on July 1, 2015, which we refer to as the Investor Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Investor Agreement the shares of common stock that we issued and sold to JJDC were subject to lock-up restrictions and voting arrangements which have since expired. In addition, there are specified limitations on JJDCs ability to acquire additional shares of our common stock. We have also agreed to provide JJDC with certain piggyback registration rights such that for the seven year period following the expiration of the lock-up, June 29, 2016, subject to specified conditions, whenever we propose to register shares of our common stock for our own account, JJDC will have the right to include some or all of the shares it acquired from us pursuant to the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement in such registration. In addition, JJDC has the right to compel us to file a registration statement to register shares acquired from us pursuant to the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement. 
 Pursuant to the Janssen Agreement, the JSC consisting of three members from each of Janssen and our company will provide strategic guidance for the joint HCV program. If the JSC fails to reach a unanimous decision on a matter within its authority, the matter shall be referred to the applicable executive officers of Janssen and our company who shall attempt to reach a mutual decision. If the executive officers cannot reach a mutual decision, then Janssen has the deciding vote with regard to such matter. 
 We established our HCV drug candidate pipeline entirely through our internal discovery capabilities. Through these efforts, we identified and developed a portfolio of drug candidates including odalasvir, ACH-3422 and sovaprevir. Prior to entering into the Janssen Agreement, we were focused on the development of the following HCV drug candidates: 
 

 | Odalasvir, a NS5A Inhibitor. We completed three phase IIa clinical trials with odalasvir including the -007 trial with sovaprevir, the -005 study, which examined the use of odalasvir with ribavirin alone, and the Proxy Doublet study which examined the use of odalasvir in combination with sofosbuvir, a nucleotide NS5B polymerase inhibitor marketed by Gilead Sciences, Inc., or Gilead, under the brand name Sovaldi®. HCV patients treated for both eight weeks and six weeks with the combination of odalasvir and sofosbuvir achieved 100% SVR24, or sustained viral response 24 weeks after cessation of therapy, demonstrating the differentiation of odalasvir within the NS5A class.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ACH-3422, a NS5B Nucleotide Polymerase Inhibitor. ACH-3422 has demonstrated excellent potency and was well-tolerated in a phase Ib proof of concept study in which HCV patients receiving a once-daily 700mg dose of ACH-3422 for 14 days demonstrated mean maximal viral load reduction of 4.6 log10.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Sovaprevir, a NS3 Protease Inhibitor. We completed a phase II clinical trial that evaluated 12 weeks of treatment consisting of sovaprevir and our NS5A inhibitor, odalasvir, with ribavirin for the treatment of genotype 1 HCV (the -007 trial). In this trial, genotype 1b patients achieved 100% SVR24; however, in genotype 1a patients, the combination regimen results were suboptimal.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ACH-3422 and sovaprevir are not currently in clinical development under the Janssen Agreement. 
 In September 2016, we announced clinical trial results from the first triple combination regimen under the collaboration. Initiated in October 2015, the phase IIa clinical trial tested a combination regimen consisting of 
 
8 
 
 Olysio® (simeprevir), a protease inhibitor marketed by Janssen, AL-335, a nucleotide polymerase inhibitor in clinical development by Janssen, and odalasvir. This study was designed to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of different dosing regimens containing odalasvir and AL-335, with or without simeprevir, in treatment-naïve patients with genotype 1 HCV infection for treatment durations of eight or six weeks. 
 Of patients who received the triple combination of odalasvir, AL-335, and simeprevir, the combination now denoted as JNJ-4178, 100% had undetectable levels of HCV infection at SVR12 and all patients in cohort 1 achieved SVR24 (i.e., cohorts 1, 3, and 4; N=60,20/cohort). Cohort 1 evaluated the triple combination of odalasvir (50mg QD), AL-335 (400 mg QD) and simeprevir (100mg QD) for eight weeks, while cohorts 3 and 4 assessed odalasvir (50 mg QOD), AL-335 (800 mg QD), and simeprevir (75 mg QD) for eight and six weeks, respectively. In cohort 2, which assessed the dual combination of odalasvir (50 mg QOD) and AL-335 (800 mg QD) for eight weeks, 90% of patients achieved SVR12 (N=20). In all of these cohorts, the dosing regimens were generally well-tolerated. The majority of adverse events were mild and the most commonly reported events were headache, fatigue, and upper respiratory tract infection. There was also one serious adverse event in cohort 1 that resulted in premature discontinuation of all study drugs. This consisted of a Mobitz Type 1 2nd degree atrioventricular block and was deemed probably related to odalasvir and possibly related to AL-335 and simeprevir. The event was not associated with clinical or echocardiographic abnormalities, did not require any therapeutic intervention, resolved following treatment discontinuation, and the patient went on to achieve SVR24. Other than the one serious adverse event, no clinically significant laboratory, echocardiography, or ECG abnormalities were reported. 
 In November 2016, we announced that Janssen had initiated OMEGA-1, a phase IIb clinical trial of JNJ-4178 in patients with genotypes 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 HCV, including both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients. Genotype 3 patients and patients with cirrhosis may be added to OMEGA-1 after those patient populations are studied in additional arms of the on-going phase IIa clinical trial, now designated study 604. This study is ongoing. 
 The HCV Market 
 The hepatitis-C virus is a common cause of viral hepatitis, which leads to inflammation of the liver. HCV infection is contracted by transmission through the blood of an infected person. Hepatitis due to HCV can result in an acute process in which a person is affected for only several months and then the virus is cleared from the body. However, the Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, estimates that 70% to 85% of newly infected individuals become chronically infected following exposure. HCV disease progression then occurs over a period of 20 to 30 years during which patients are generally asymptomatic, meaning they exhibit no symptoms of the disease, until they experience late-stage disease. Chronic hepatitis can lead to permanent liver damage, which can result in the development of liver cancer, liver failure or death. Estimates by the World Health Organization in July 2016 indicated that approximately 130 million to 150 million individuals worldwide are chronically infected with HCV. 
 The HCV market has seen significant change in recent years, notably with the 2011-2013 introductions of the first directly acting antivirals (DAAs)protease inhibitors boceprevir (Victrelis®), telaprevir (Incivek®), simeprevir (Olysio®), and nucleotide polymerase inhibitor, sofosbuvir (Sovaldi®). These were first approved for treatment of patients with HCV genotype 1 in combination with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Sofosbuvir was also approved for use with ribavirin alone for use in treatment of patients with HCV genotype 2. In 2014, all-oral combination regimens entered the market including the combination of sofosbuvir and ledipasvir (Harvoni®) and the ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir/dasabuvir/ribavirin combination (Viekira Pak). In 2016, the oral combination of elbasvir/grazoprevir (Zepatier) also entered the HCV market. These treatment regimens for HCV offer improved SVR rates for patients of the appropriate genotype, who do not have base-line resistant viral variants, and who can tolerate the combination therapy. According to public filings, sales for marketed HCV regimens were reported to be approximately $19 billion in 2016 , including sales of boceprevir (Victrelis®), 
 
9 
 
 telaprevir (Incivek®) sofosbuvir (Sovaldi®) and sofosbuvir/ledipasvir (Harvoni) by Gilead and Viekira Pak by AbbVie, Inc. Even though the number of patients treated for HCV is anticipated to peak in 2016 through 2020, and competitive pricing may result from the introduction of all-oral combination regimens with broad genotypic coverage in 2015 and beyond, the HCV DAA market is expected to be a multi-billion dollar market for the next several years in the combined markets of the United States, the European Union and Japan according to Citi Research in February 2017. 
 Despite recent improvements in the treatment landscape for HCV infected patients, there remains a goal for a new HCV therapy that addresses the needs of a broader range of HCV patients, both across the spectrum of HCV genotypes 16, and across varying stages of liver disease, and that shortens the duration of treatment. We believe our collaboration with Janssen can provide a combination regimen that contains our NS5A inhibitor, odalasvir, in combination with other agents that may be able to address these goals. 
 Our Drug Discovery Programs and Capabilities 
 To date we have successfully advanced eight drug candidates into human clinical trials, with two additional drug candidates that we advanced into late-stage preclinical studies. We discovered nine of these ten drug candidates in house by applying our expertise in biology and synthetic chemistry. We intend to continue to capitalize on our internal drug discovery and development capabilities to expand our drug candidate portfolio. 
 From early lead identification through clinical candidate selection, we have coupled our knowledge base in genomic replication targets with an integrated drug discovery infrastructure to aid in the advancement of our discovery programs. 
 Target Selection and Assay Development 
 We are focused on addressing unmet medical needs with an emphasis on inhibiting essential proteins or enzymes with small molecule inhibitors. We select targets for our drug discovery programs based upon the relevance of the target to key steps within the biological system, our ability to develop appropriate assays for early assessment of potency, selectivity and safety and our ability to identify small molecules that can be optimized within a reasonable time period to become drug candidates. 
Compound Synthesis, Hit Identification and Lead Optimization 
 Our focused compound library contains a diverse set of molecules that have been synthesized for specific biological targets. We have developed the following tools that enable us to manage our compounds efficiently and advance our programs: 

 | AACP (Achillion Automated Chemistry Platform) is a proprietary software that facilitates synthesis of thousands of small molecules in parallel by automating several cumbersome steps involved;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | CART (Compound Acquisition and Repository Tracking) streamlines our scientists ability to select and acquire compounds for lead identification and optimization;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | CHEM-ACH is a data mining software that allows analysis of our proprietary compounds and their biological activities. Such analysis helps in studying the structure-activity relationships and designing and synthesizing compounds for lead optimization;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | CIDM (Competitive Intelligence & Data Mining) is a web application. It analyzes publicly available information to display competitive information including clinical and preclinical development activities, intellectual property and scientific literature;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ComplementWiki is an in-house database of ongoing and completed complement- related drug development and clinical trial designs and results. It also has an in-house developed, user friendly interface for accessing and analyzing this data;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | HCVWiki is an in-house database of ongoing and completed HCV therapy clinical trial designs and results. It also has an in-house developed, user friendly interface for accessing and analyzing this data; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | PSTS (Preclinical Study Tracking System) is a web interface which is used for accessing the details of our preclinical studies. It allows scientists to enter, modify, and query preclinical study documents.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Candidate Selection 
 A cornerstone of our approach to drug discovery and development is the early assessment of the drug-like properties associated with optimized lead compounds. Potency and activity against a given target are necessary but not sufficient predictors of eventual successful clinical development of a new drug. In order to perform an early assessment of the potential for successful development, prior to progression of a compound into late-stage preclinical studies in support of clinical trials, we rigorously evaluate compounds in numerous tests relating to safety, metabolism, pharmacokinetic properties and physical properties associated with the feasibility for an oral formulation. 
Competition 
 The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We expect that we, our collaborators and future collaborators, if any, will face significant competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to any of our drug candidates that we, or they, may seek to develop or commercialize. There are a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of drug candidates for the treatment of the key complement-mediated disease indications such as those from Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and other potential therapies in development by Akari Therapeutics, PLC, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Amyndas Pharmaceuticals, S.A., Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., BioCryst Pharmaceuticals, Inc., ChemoCentryx, Inc., Genentech, Inc., Omeros Corporation, Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and True North Therapeutics, Inc. Additionally, Novartis AG also has intellectual property rights in the complement area. 
 In the HCV market, there are a number of pharmaceutical companies that currently market and sell products for HCV or are pursuing the development of drug candidates for HCV including AbbVie Inc., Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Gilead, Merck & Co., Inc. and Regulus Therapeutics Inc. 
 Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, have fewer or more tolerable side effects or are less costly than any drug candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our drug candidates obsolete and noncompetitive. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we, or any current or future collaborators, may develop. In addition to currently approved products, our competitors also may obtain additional FDA or other marketing approvals for their products before we or any current or future collaborators, are able to obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we, or any current or future collaborators, are able to enter the market. 
 Many of our existing and potential future competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a 
 
11 
 
 smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our strategy is to pursue patents, developed internally and licensed from third parties, and other means to protect our technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets that may be important to the development of our business. 
 Our success will depend significantly on our ability to: 
 

 | obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for the technology, inventions, improvements and know-how we consider important to our business;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | defend and enforce our patents;
--+--------------------------------


 | preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We hold issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States, and in foreign countries we deem appropriate, covering intellectual property developed as part of our research and development programs. 
 Our complement inhibitor patent portfolio currently includes a large number of pending U.S. applications, international applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, referred to as the PCT, and applications that have been entered into the national phase of prosecution in foreign countries. These patents and patent applications, if issued, will expire in 2035 or 2036, without regard to possible patent term extensions to account for regulatory delay to market our drugs. These applications include claims directed to composition of matter, pharmaceutical composition and their methods of use to treat complement factor D related disorders, including PNH, macular age degeneration, and C3G. The applications include specific claims directed to our lead drug candidate, ACH-4471 and its medical use, as well as other compounds and their medical uses. 
 Our first family of complement inhibitor patent filings, which consists of eight subfamilies, are based on a priority provisional application filed in February 2014. These applications were entered into the international phase with PCT applications in February 2015 and were entered into the national phase of prosecution in foreign countries in August 2016. In addition to the United States, five of the applications were filed in 14 foreign countries (including the major market countries of China, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Japan and South Korea) and four regional patent offices (European Patent Office (EPO), African Regional Patent Office (ARIPO), Eurasian Patent Office (EAPO) and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)). One application was filed in the United States, 6 foreign countries (including the major market countries of China, Australia, India, Canada, Japan and South Korea) and one region (European Patent Office (EPO). Two applications were filed in the United States and Europe. 
 Our second family of complement inhibitor patent filings, which consists of nine subfamilies, are based on priority provisional applications filed in August 2015. These applications were entered into the international phase with PCT applications in August 2016 and five of the subfamilies were also filed in Argentina and Taiwan. Our third family of complement inhibitor patent filings, which also consists of nine subfamilies, are also based on priority provisional applications filed in August 2015. These applications were entered into the international phase with PCT applications in August 2016. 
 In 2015, we entered into the Janssen Agreement. Under the Janssen Agreement, we granted Janssen exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products that contain one or more of our drug 
 
12 
 
 candidates for the treatment of HCV, namely: odalasvir, a second-generation NS5A inhibitor; ACH-3422, a NS5B HCV polymerase inhibitor; and sovaprevir, a NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor. Under the Janssen Agreement, we have granted Janssen an exclusive, worldwide license to our intellectual property related to these compounds. Janssen is in Phase IIb development with a three drug combination for the treatment of HCV, JNJ-4178, which includes one of the HCV drug candidates we licensed to Janssen, odalasvir. The other two drug candidates licensed to Janssen, ACH-3422 and sovaprevir, are not currently in clinical development. Our patent portfolio on odalasvir is comprised of (i) U.S. Patent Nos. 8,809,313 and 9,474,742, and an allowed U.S. application, with claims covering the composition of matter of odalasvir, methods to use odalasvir to treat HCV, and pharmaceutical compositions including odalasvir, and (ii) U.S. Patent No. 9,468,629, with claims covering methods of manufacture of odalasvir as well as compositions of matter claims covering intermediates in its synthesis. These U.S. Patents will expire in 2032, without regard to any patent term extension that may be available to compensate for the delay to market caused by regulatory review by the U.S. FDA. In addition, we co-own with our partner Janssen two pending unpublished U.S. patent applications covering aspects of odalasvir and its methods of use and compositions thereof, and an international Patent Cooperation Treaty application, which if granted, will expire in 2037. We have granted patents on odalasvir in the major market foreign jurisdictions of Europe and China, and we have pending patent applications on odalasvir in the additional significant market countries of Australia, Brazil, Canada, Eurasia, India, Japan and South Korea, which will expire in 2032, unless the patent term is extended by a countrys law that allows further protection for the time required to obtain regulatory approval, such as a Supplementary Protection Certificate in Europe. 
 We rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. In order to protect our proprietary technology and processes, we also rely in part on confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We currently rely on contract manufacturers to produce drug substances and drug products required for our clinical trials under current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), with oversight by our internal managers. We plan to continue to rely upon contract manufacturers and collaboration partners to manufacture commercial quantities of our drug candidates if and when approved for marketing by the FDA. We currently rely on a limited number of manufacturers for the preclinical or clinical supplies of each of our drug candidates we are developing and do not currently have relationships for redundant supply or a second source for any of these drug candidates. We believe that there are alternate sources of supply that can satisfy our clinical trial requirements without significant delay or material additional costs. 
Sales and Marketing 
 We intend to establish our own sales and marketing capabilities if and when we obtain regulatory approval of our drug candidates. In North America and Western Europe, patients in the markets for our drug candidates are largely managed by medical specialists in the areas of immunology, nephrology, and hematology. Historically, companies have experienced substantial commercial success through the deployment of specialized sales forces which can address a majority of key prescribers. Therefore, we expect to utilize a specialized sales force in North America for the sales and marketing of drug candidates that we may successfully develop. We currently have no marketing, sales or distribution capabilities. In order to participate in the commercialization of any of our drugs, we must develop these capabilities on our own or in collaboration with third parties. We may also choose to hire a third party to provide sales personnel instead of developing our own staff. 
 Outside of North America, and in situations or markets where a more favorable return may be realized through licensing commercial rights to a third party, we may license a portion or all of our commercial rights in a territory to a third party in exchange for one or more of the following: up-front payments, research funding, development funding, milestone payments and royalties on drug sales. 
 
13 
 
Under the Janssen Agreement, we granted Janssen exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products that contain one or more of our drug candidates for the treatment of HCV, namely odalasvir, a second-generation NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3422, a NS5B HCV polymerase inhibitor, and sovaprevir, a NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor. ACH-3422 and sovaprevir are not currently in clinical development under the Janssen Agreement. 
 Regulatory Matters 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, sales, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
 Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States 
 In the United States, the FDA approves and regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. The failure to comply with requirements under the FDCA and other applicable laws at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities. 
 A drug product candidate must be approved by the FDA through the new drug application, or NDA. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 
 

 | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDAs good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical trials may begin in the U.S.;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices, or GCP, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | preparation and submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA, requesting marketing for one or more proposed indications;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | review by an FDA advisory committee, if requested by the FDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
14 
 

 | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


 | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, and potentially post-market requirement, or PMR, and commitment, or PMC, studies.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Before an applicant begins testing a compound with potential therapeutic value in humans, the drug candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity and stability of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the formulated drug or drug product, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the safety and activity of the drug for initial testing in humans and to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, and long term toxicity studies, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 The IND and IRB Processes 
 An IND is an exemption from the FDCA that allows an unapproved drug to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer an investigational drug to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any new drug that is not the subject of an approved NDA. In support of the IND application, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments. In addition, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period, or thereafter, the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin (or resume if the clinical trial had been ongoing at the time a clinical hold was imposed). 
 In addition to the foregoing IND requirements, an IRB/ethics committee representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in 
 
15 
 
 any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects or, in certain indications such as cancer, patients with the target disease or condition (e.g., cancer) and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness and to determine optimal dosage.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2. The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3. These clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal studies, which denote a study that presents the data that the FDA or other relevant regulatory agency will use to determine whether or not to approve a drug. The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, identify adverse effects, establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 4. Post-approval studies may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials conducted under the IND must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. In addition, IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA for any of the following: serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions; findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug; and any clinically important increase in the case of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA or the sponsor or the data monitoring committee may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. The FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data submitted. 
 Section 505(b)(2) NDAs 
 NDAs for most new drug products are based on two full clinical studies which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product for the proposed use. These applications are submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDAs previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar product, or published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe for use and effective in use and relied upon by the applicant for approval of the application were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. 
 Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDAs previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain preclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional studies or 
 
16 
 
 measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant. 
 Review of an NDA by the FDA 
 If clinical trials are successful, the next step in the drug development process is the preparation and submission to the FDA of a NDA. The NDA is the vehicle through which drug applicants formally propose that the FDA approve a new drug for marketing and sale in the United States for one or more indications. The NDA must contain a description of the manufacturing process and quality control methods, as well as results of preclinical tests, toxicology studies, clinical trials and proposed labeling, among other things. Every new drug must be the subject of an approved NDA before it may be commercialized in the United States. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is subject to an application user fee, currently exceeding $2.0 million, and the sponsor of an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $98,000 per product and $512,000 per establishment. These fees are typically increased annually. Certain exceptions and waivers are available for some of these fees, such as an exception from the application fee for drugs with orphan designation and a waiver for certain small businesses, an exception from the establishment fee when the establishment does not engage in manufacturing the drug during a particular fiscal year, and an exception from the product fee for a drug that is the same as another drug approved under an abbreviated pathway. 
 Following submission of an NDA, the FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 calendar days of its receipt and strives to inform the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDAs receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Under that agreement, 90% of applications seeking approval of New Molecular Entities, or NMEs, are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date on which FDA accepts the NDA for filing, and 90% of applications for NMEs that have been designated for priority review are meant to be reviewed within six months of the filing date. For applications seeking approval of drugs that are not NMEs, the ten-month and six-month review periods run from the date that FDA receives the application. The review process and the Prescription Drug User Fee Act goal date may be extended by the FDA for three additional months (denoted as a major amendment) to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is or will be manufactured. These pre-approval inspections may cover all facilities associated with an NDA submission, including drug component manufacturing (e.g., active pharmaceutical ingredients), finished drug product manufacturing, and control testing laboratories. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. In addition, as a condition of approval, the FDA may require an applicant to develop a REMS. REMS use risk minimization strategies beyond the professional labeling to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh the potential risks. To determine whether a REMS is needed, the FDA will consider the size of the population likely to use the product, seriousness of the disease, expected benefit of the product, expected duration of treatment, seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the product is a new molecular entity. 
 The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians 
 
17 
 
 and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy and Priority Review Designations 
 The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs are fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation. 
 Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track products, sponsors may have greater interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track products NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review may be available if the FDA determines, after preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective. The sponsor must also provide, and the FDA must approve, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the sponsor must pay applicable user fees. However, the FDAs time period goal for reviewing a fast track application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. In addition, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Second, in 2012, Congress enacted the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Improvement Act. This law established a new regulatory scheme allowing for expedited review of products designated as breakthrough therapies. A product may be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner. 
 Third, the FDA may designate a product for priority review if it is a drug that treats a serious condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. Significant improvement may be illustrated by evidence of increased effectiveness in the treatment of a condition, elimination or substantial reduction of a treatment-limiting drug reaction, documented enhancement of patient compliance that may lead to improvement in serious outcomes, and evidence of safety and effectiveness in a new subpopulation. A priority designation is intended to direct overall attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDAs review clock goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months. For new chemical entities, or NCEs, the review clock starts after the NDA is filed with a total clock of twelve and eight months, respectively. 
 Accelerated Approval Pathway 
 The FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and that is reasonably 
 
18 
 
 likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. 
 For the purposes of accelerated approval, a surrogate endpoint is a marker, such as a laboratory measurement, radiographic image, physical sign, or other measure that is thought to predict clinical benefit, but is not itself a measure of clinical benefit. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. An intermediate clinical endpoint is a measurement of a therapeutic effect that is considered reasonably likely to predict the clinical benefit of a drug, such as an effect on IMM. The FDA has limited experience with accelerated approvals based on intermediate clinical endpoints, but has indicated that such endpoints generally may support accelerated approval where the therapeutic effect measured by the endpoint is not itself a clinical benefit and basis for traditional approval, if there is a basis for concluding that the therapeutic effect is reasonably likely to predict the ultimate clinical benefit of a drug. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is most often used in settings in which the course of a disease is long and an extended period of time is required to measure the intended clinical benefit of a drug, even if the effect on the surrogate or intermediate clinical endpoint occurs rapidly. Thus, accelerated approval has been used extensively in the development and approval of drugs for treatment of a variety of cancers in which the goal of therapy is generally to improve survival or decrease morbidity and the duration of the typical disease course requires lengthy and sometimes large trials to demonstrate a clinical or survival benefit. 
 The accelerated approval pathway is usually contingent on a sponsors agreement to conduct, in a diligent manner, additional post-approval confirmatory studies to verify and describe the drugs clinical benefit. As a result, a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, would allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the FDA. 
 The FDAs Decision on an NDA 
 On the basis of the FDAs evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. 
 If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, many types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 
19 
 
Post-Approval Requirements 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, condition of NDA approval may include sponsor agreement to PMR or PMC studies, which are designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, or complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, and its implementing regulations, as well as the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCA, which regulate the distribution and tracing of prescription drugs and prescription drug samples at the 
 
20 
 
 federal level, and set minimum standards for the regulation of drug distributors by the states. The PDMA, its implementing regulations and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples, and the DSCA imposes requirements to ensure accountability in distribution and to identify and remove counterfeit and other illegitimate products from the market. 
 Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs 
 In 1984, with passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress established an abbreviated regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve generic drugs that are shown to contain the same active ingredients as, and to be bioequivalent to, drugs previously approved by the FDA pursuant to NDAs. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, bioequivalence, drug product formulation, specifications and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data and quality control procedures. ANDAs are abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, in support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the preclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the reference-listed drug, or RLD. 
 Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, the strength of the drug and the conditions of use of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a RLD if the rate and extent of absorption of the drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the listed drug. Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates whether the generic product is therapeutically equivalent to the RLD in its publication Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also referred to as the Orange Book. Physicians and pharmacists consider a therapeutic equivalent generic drug to be fully substitutable for the RLD. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDAs designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. 
 Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the RLD has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of non-patent data exclusivity for a new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity, or NCE, is a drug that contains no active moiety that has previously been approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such NCE exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval. The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. A company must request orphan drug designation before submitting an NDA for the drug and rare disease or condition. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the PDUFA goal dates for the regulatory 
 
21 
 
 review and approval process, although it does convey certain advantages such as tax benefits and exemption from the PDUFA application fee. 
 If a product with orphan designation receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve another sponsors marketing application for the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Orphan exclusivity does not block the approval of a different drug for the same rare disease or condition, nor does it block the approval of the same drug for different indications. If a drug designated as an orphan drug ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan drug application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity. Orphan exclusivity will not bar approval of another product under certain circumstances, including if a subsequent product with the same drug for the same indication is shown to be clinically superior to the approved product on the basis of greater efficacy or safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or if the company with orphan drug exclusivity is not able to meet market demand. 
 Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity 
 In the US, there are two regulations that govern the requirements and incentives to conduct pediatric drug trials: the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, and Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA. 
 Under the PREA, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. With enactment of the Food and Drug Safety and Innovation Act, or the FDASIA, in 2012, sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans within sixty days of the end-of-phase II meeting, unless the product has received orphan drug designation, which exempts that drug for that indication from the PREA requirements. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests, and any other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA, and the FDAs internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other, and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time. 
 The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Additional requirements and procedures relating to deferral requests and requests for extension of deferrals are contained in FDASIA. Unless and until FDA promulgates a regulation stating otherwise, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation. 
 Pediatric exclusivity under BPCA is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. In order to obtain pediatric exclusivity, a sponsor and the FDA have to agree on a Written Request which details the studies that need to be conducted in order for the product to obtain pediatric exclusivity. The data from these studies does not need to show the product is effective in the pediatric population studied. If reports of the studies outlined in the Written Request are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot approve another application. With regard to patents, the six-month pediatric exclusivity period will not attach to any patents for which an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submitted a paragraph IV patent certification, unless the NDA sponsor or patent owner first obtains a court determination that the patent is valid and infringed by the proposed product.

The 21st Century Cures Act 
 On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act, into law. The Cures Act is designed to modernize and personalize healthcare, spur innovation and research, and streamline the discovery and development of new therapies through increased federal funding of particular programs. It authorizes increased funding for the FDA to spend on innovation projects. The new law also amends the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize and expand funding for the National Institutes of Health. The Act establishes the NIH Innovation Fund to pay for the cost of development and implementation of a strategic plan, early stage investigators and research. It also charges NIH with leading and coordinating expanded pediatric research. Further, the Cures Act directs the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to expand surveillance of neurological diseases. 
 With amendments to the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, Title III of the Cures Act seeks to accelerate the discovery, development, and delivery of new medicines and medical technologies. To that end, and among other provisions, the Cures Act reauthorizes the existing priority review voucher program for certain drugs intended to treat rare pediatric diseases until 2020; creates a new priority review voucher program for drug applications determined to be material national security threat medical countermeasure applications; revises the FDCA to streamline review of combination product applications; requires FDA to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help support approval of new indications for approved drugs; provides a new limited population approval pathway for antibiotic and antifungal drugs intended to treat serious or life-threatening infections; and authorizes FDA to designate a drug as a regenerative advanced therapy, thereby making it eligible for certain expedited review and approval designations. 
 Review and Approval of Drug Products Outside the United States 
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of drug products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others. 
 Clinical Trial Approval in the EU 
 Pursuant to the currently applicable Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC and the Directive 2005/28/EC on Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of the EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. If the clinical trial is conducted in different EU Member States, the competent authorities in each of these EU Member States must provide their approval for the conduct of the clinical trial. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial at a specific study site after the competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. 
 In April 2014, the EU adopted a new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which is set to replace the current Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC. The new Clinical Trials Regulation will be directly applicable to and binding in all 28 EU Member States without the need for any national implementing legislation. The new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014 will become applicable in 2018. It will overhaul the current system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new legislation aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. Under the new coordinated procedure for the approval of clinical trials, the sponsor of a clinical trial will be required to submit a single application for approval of a clinical trial to a 
 
23 
 
 reporting EU Member State (RMS) through an EU Portal. The submission procedure will be the same irrespective of whether the clinical trial is to be conducted in a single EU Member State or in more than one EU Member State. The Clinical Trials Regulation also aims to streamline and simplify the rules on safety reporting for clinical trials. 
 Marketing Authorization 
 In the EU, marketing authorizations for medicinal products may be obtained through several different procedures founded on the same basic regulatory process. 
 The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. It is optional for those products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients. Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a marketing authorization application, or MAA, is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional written or oral information is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human use or CHMP. Accelerated evaluation may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases. These are defined as circumstances in which a medicinal product is expected to be of a major public health interest. Three cumulative criteria must be fulfilled in such circumstances: the seriousness of the disease, such as severely disabling or life-threatening diseases, to be treated; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and anticipation of high therapeutic benefit. In these circumstances, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. 
 The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other concerned EU Member States of an assessment of an application for marketing authorization conducted by one EU Member State, known as the reference EU Member State. In accordance with this procedure, an applicant submits an application for marketing authorization to the reference EU Member State and the concerned EU Member States. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States which, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all EU Member States. In accordance with the mutual recognition procedure, the sponsor applies for national marketing authorization in one EU Member State. Upon receipt of this authorization the sponsor can then seek the recognition of this authorization by other EU Member States. Authorization in accordance with either of these procedures will result in authorization of the medicinal product only in the reference EU Member State and in the other concerned EU Member States. 
 A marketing authorization may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU. Regulation No. 1901/2006 provides that, prior to validating a marketing authorization in the EU, an applicant must demonstrate compliance with all measures included in a Pediatric Investigation Plan, or PIP, approved by the Pediatric Committee of the EMA, covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted a product-specific waiver, class waiver, or a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. 
 Orphan Drug Designation and Exclusivity in the EU 
 Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 and Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000 provide that a product can be designated as an orphan medicinal product by the European Commission if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of: (1) a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the EU when the application is made, or (2) a life-
 
24 
 
 threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the EU and that without incentives the medicinal product is unlikely to be developed. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition. The criteria required to obtain orphan status will be reevaluated at the time of MAA review and must still be met in order to retain orphan status. 
 Once authorized, orphan medicinal products are entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all EU Member States and, in addition, a range of other benefits during the development and regulatory review process, including scientific assistance for study protocols, authorization through the centralized marketing authorization procedure covering all member countries and a reduction or elimination of registration and marketing authorization fees. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. The period of market exclusivity may, in addition, be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated on the basis of available evidence that the original orphan medicinal product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Thus, even if a product candidate is approved, sales of the product will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations, provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for, the product. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. 
 In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable marketing approvals. Nonetheless, product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product candidate could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, a payors decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payors determination to provide coverage for a drug product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
 The containment of healthcare costs also has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit a 
 
25 
 
 companys revenue generated from the sale of any approved products. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which a company or its collaborators receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for a product also involves challenges. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of a product to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in commercialization. 
 In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies or so called health technology assessments, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for products, but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the European Union have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the European Union. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various European Union member states, and parallel trade, i.e., arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states, can further reduce prices. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any products, if approved in those countries. 
 Healthcare Law and Regulation 
 Healthcare providers and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with providers, consultants, third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse, anti-kickback, false claims laws, reporting of payments to physicians and teaching physicians, patient privacy laws and regulations, and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain business and/or financial arrangements. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following: 

 | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, paying, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalties laws, which prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false, fictitious or fraudulent or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
26 
 

 | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created additional federal criminal laws that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published in January 2013, which impose obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal false statements statute, which prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the federal transparency requirements known as the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, or the Affordable Care Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, within the United States Department of Health and Human Services, information related to payments and other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws and transparency statutes, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by third-party payors, including private insurers.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and transfers of value to other health care providers and health care entities, or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. There have been a number of federal and state proposals during the last few years regarding the pricing of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, limiting coverage and reimbursement for drugs and other medical products, government control and other changes to the healthcare system in the United States. 
 By way of example, the United States and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reduce the cost of healthcare. In March 2010, the United States Congress enacted the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, which, among other things, includes changes to the coverage and payment for products under government health care programs. In January 2017, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the ACA. The Budget Resolution is not a law, however, it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the ACA. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the ACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent legislation to replace elements of the ACA that are repealed. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for

 spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2012 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislations automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and will remain in effect through 2024 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. 
 With the new Administration and Congress, there will likely be additional legislative changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the ACA. It remains to be seen, however, precisely what the new legislation will provide, when it will be enacted and what impact it will have on the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenue from product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain marketing approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
