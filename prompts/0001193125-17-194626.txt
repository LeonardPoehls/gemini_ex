Our operating segments are currently (i) professional diagnostics; (ii) consumer diagnostics; and (iii) other non-reportable.
In January 2015, we sold our condition management, case management, wellbeing, wellness, and womens and childrens health businesses, which we refer to collectively as our health management business. As a result of the sale of our health management business, which was the largest component of our former patient self-testing reporting segment, as well as certain other transactions in 2015, the only component of the patient self-testing reporting segment that was retained by Alere was the Alere Home Monitoring business. Therefore, in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, we reported our financial information in two reportable operating segments: (i) professional diagnostics and (ii) consumer diagnostics, and Alere Home Monitoring was reported as a component of the professional diagnostics segment. Due to the nature of the operations of Alere Home Monitoring and the manner in which this business is conducted, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have decided to voluntarily report our Alere Home Monitoring business as a separate segment under the heading other non-reportable segment. Financial information about our segments is provided in Note 19, Financial Information by Segment to consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Recent Developments 
 Merger Agreement with Abbott Laboratories 
 On January 30, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement, with Abbott Laboratories, or Abbott. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott with and into Alere, or the merger, with Alere surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Abbott, or the surviving corporation. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, prior to its amendment (as described herein), holders of shares of our common stock were entitled to receive $56.00 in cash, without interest, in exchange for each share of common stock. On April 13, 2017, Abbott and Alere entered into an Amendment to Agreement and Plan of Merger, or the Merger Agreement Amendment, which amends the Merger Agreement (as amended by the Merger Agreement Amendment, the Amended Merger Agreement), which provides, among other things, that the holders of shares of our common stock will receive $51.00 in cash, without interest, in exchange for each share of common stock. Other than as expressly modified pursuant to the Merger Agreement Amendment, the Merger Agreement remains in full force and effect. The Amended Merger Agreement has been approved by our Board of Directors. 
 Each share of our Series B Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the merger will remain issued and outstanding immediately following the consummation of the merger as one share of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, of the surviving corporation. Completion of the merger pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement is subject to customary closing conditions, including (1) the adoption of the Amended Merger Agreement by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of all outstanding shares of our common stock, (2) there being no judgment or law enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the consummation of the merger, (3) the expiration of the waiting period applicable to the merger under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, or the HSR Act, and receipt of other required antitrust approvals and (4) the absence of a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Amended Merger Agreement). Under the terms of the Amended Merger Agreement, Abbott has agreed to make certain divestitures if necessary to obtain the consent of the antitrust authorities to the transaction contemplated by the Amended Merger Agreement, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Amended Merger Agreement. The obligation of each of the parties to consummate the merger is also conditioned on the other partys representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Amended Merger Agreement. The Amended Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights that allow the Amended Merger Agreement to be terminated in certain circumstances. 
 
4 
 
In addition, the Merger Agreement Amendment extends the date after which each of Alere and Abbott would have a right to terminate the Amended Merger Agreement to September 30, 2017, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement Amendment reduces the termination fee that Alere may be required to pay Abbott under specified circumstances to $161 million, from $177 million. The Merger Agreement Amendment also provides that neither any matter set forth in our public filings made with the SEC between January 1, 2014 and April 13, 2017, nor any matter of which Abbott or any of Abbotts representatives was made aware prior to April 13, 2017, could be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur. Further, in addition to the qualifications set forth in the original Merger Agreement, the Amendment qualifies all of our representations and warranties made in the Amended Merger Agreement (including those made in the original Merger Agreement) by all matters set forth in our public filings made with the SEC between January 1, 2014 and April 13, 2017 and any matter known by Abbott or any of Abbotts representatives prior to April 13, 2017. 
 In addition, the Merger Agreement Amendment changes Abbotts commitment to provide Aleres employees that continue with Abbott with specified levels of compensation and benefits to be a commitment through the first anniversary of the closing of the merger, rather than through December 31, 2017 and a 2018 long-term incentive award to each continuing employee employed by Abbott or its subsidiaries at the time annual long-term awards are made generally that is no less favorable than the long-term incentive award made to similarly situated employees of Abbott generally. 
 Antitrust Clearance 
 On May 2, 2016, Abbott and Alere received a request for additional information, or a second request, from the United States Federal Trade Commission, or the FTC, relating to Abbotts potential acquisition of Alere. The second request was issued under the HSR Act. In addition, Abbott has agreed voluntarily to provide the FTC at least 60 days advance notice before certifying substantial compliance with the second request and to extend the waiting period imposed by the HSR Act to not less than 60 days after Abbott and Alere have certified substantial compliance with the second request, unless the period is further extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the FTC. 
 On June 23, 2016, Abbott and Alere received a request for additional information, or a supplemental information request, from the Canadian Competition Bureau, or the Bureau, relating to Abbotts potential acquisition of Alere. The supplemental information request was issued under the Competition Act of Canada, or the Competition Act. The effect of the supplemental information request is to extend the waiting period imposed by the Competition Act until 30 days after Abbott and Alere have each complied with the supplemental information request, unless the period is extended voluntarily by the parties or terminated sooner by the Bureau. 
 On January 25, 2017, the European Commission approved the merger under the EU Merger Regulation. The approval is conditional on, and the merger may not be completed until, Abbott has entered into binding agreements to divest the epoc and Triage product lines, as well as Aleres activities relating to the commercialization of BNP assays to customers of Danaher for use on Beckman-Coulter laboratory analyzers, to one or more purchasers. The purchasers and terms of sale need to be approved by the European Commission. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we are not aware of any binding and definitive final agreements that have been entered into to divest any of the epoc product line, Triage product line or Aleres activities relating to the commercialization of BNP assays to customers of Danaher for use on Beckman-Coulter analyzers. 
 On April 20, 2017, the South Korean antitrust authority informed Abbott that it would be expanding its review period by 90 days.

As of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the antitrust approvals from the FTC, the Bureau and the South Korean antitrust authorities, each of which is required pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement, have not been obtained. 
 Litigation with Abbott Laboratories prior to the Amendment to the Merger Agreement 
 After entering into the original Merger Agreement, Abbott informed Alere that it had serious concerns about, among other things, the accuracy of various representations, warranties and covenants made by Alere in the original Merger Agreement. Abbott indicated that these concerns related to the delay in the filing of Aleres Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as well as governmental investigations previously announced by Alere. Abbott requested information from Alere about these and other matters, citing contractual rights to receive information under the original Merger Agreement. In the initial meeting in which Abbott expressed its concerns to Alere, as part of a discussion about potential paths forward, Abbott requested that Alere agree to terminate the original Merger Agreement in return for a payment by Abbott to Alere in the range of between $30 and $50 million in respect of Aleres transaction expenses. Aleres Board of Directors promptly rejected that request. In these discussions, Abbott affirmed its commitment to abide by its obligations under the original Merger Agreement. 
 On August 25, 2016, Alere filed a complaint against Abbott in the Delaware Chancery Court, and filed an accompanying motion to expedite the proceedings, asking the Delaware Chancery Court to require Abbott to specifically perform its obligations with respect to obtaining antitrust approvals as required by the original Merger Agreement. 
 On September 29, 2016, the Delaware Chancery Court entered an order that, among other things, adopted a detailed schedule setting forth actions required to be taken by specified dates in order to obtain all antitrust clearances required by the original merger agreement. 
 On November 3, 2016, Abbott filed a complaint against Alere in the Delaware Chancery Court asserting a claim against Alere for breach of contract from Aleres alleged refusal to provide Abbott with certain information under the original Merger Agreement. On February 1, 2017, Alere filed a motion to dismiss Abbotts November 3 complaint. 
 On December 7, 2016, Abbott filed a complaint (which was subsequently amended after the various actions were consolidated) in the Delaware Chancery Court seeking a declaration that Alere had experienced a Material Adverse Effect (as such term is defined in the original Merger Agreement) and that Abbott could terminate the original Merger Agreement. 
 On February 1, 2017, Abbott filed its answer to the complaint Alere had filed on August 25, 2016, and Alere filed an answer to Abbotts amended complaint as well as counterclaims against Abbott. Aleres counterclaims requested a declaratory judgment that, among other things, (i) there had been no Material Adverse Effect (as such term is defined in the original Merger Agreement); and (ii) Abbott had breached the parties original Merger Agreement and breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. 
 Settlement Agreement relating to the Amended Merger Agreement 
 Concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement Amendment, Alere and Abbott entered into a settlement agreement, or the Settlement Agreement. The Settlement Agreement released claims arising out of or related to the merger, and resolved the parties litigation that had been pending in Delaware Chancery Court. The Settlement Agreement provided reciprocal releases, except for any potential antitrust claims by Alere to the extent they relate to developments after August 25, 2016, which would not be released until the parties obtain all consents and regulatory clearances necessary for closing. Abbotts potential claims based on information not excluded from the definition of Material

 Adverse Effect in the Amended Merger Agreement were also not released. Finally, the Settlement Agreement provided for dismissal of the Delaware litigation with prejudice, with the exception of the non-released antitrust claims, which were dismissed without prejudice. 
 The merger pursuant to the Amended Merger Agreement is expected to close by the end of the third quarter of 2017, subject to satisfaction of the conditions set forth in the Amended Merger Agreement. 
 Products and Services 
 Professional Diagnostics 
 Our professional diagnostic solutions allow patients and their healthcare providers to work together to better manage patients conditions over the continuum of care, from the hospital to home. Professional diagnostics solutions are generally designed to assist medical professionals in both preventative and interventional medicine, and include testing and monitoring performed in hospitals, laboratories and doctors offices as well as patient self-testing, which we define as testing or monitoring performed at home under the supervision of a medical professional. Professional diagnostic products provide for qualitative or quantitative analysis of patient samples for evidence of a specific medical condition, disease state or toxicological state or to measure response to therapy. Within professional diagnostics, we focus on point-of-care, rapid diagnostic testing and patient self-management markets where we believe that we can improve patient health outcomes. We distinguish these markets from clinical diagnostic markets consisting of large, centralized laboratories offering a wide range of highly-automated laboratory services in hospital or related settings. The point-of-care market for rapid diagnostic products includes all areas where a patient is assessed or diagnosed, including hospitals, laboratories, physician offices, specialized mobile clinics, emergency rooms, rapid-response laboratories and patient health screening locations. 
 In the market for rapid diagnostic products, the ability to deliver faster, accurate results at competitive prices generally drives demand. As the speed and accuracy of these products improve, we believe that they will play an important role in achieving earlier diagnosis, timely intervention and therapy monitoring outside acute medical environments. Our current professional diagnostic products include point-of-care tests within the infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology markets. We also operate seven specialized toxicology laboratories that offer comprehensive laboratory-based testing services. 
 We also provide one test that is designed for use solely on the Beckman Coulter laboratory analyzers. 
 Infectious Disease.     Our infectious disease diagnostic products are designed to detect certain diseases or groups of diseases and allow medical professionals to make informed health decisions. Disease areas covered include influenza, group A streptococcus (Strep A), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), pneumonia, viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) / acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), gastrointestinal disease, vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue, and syphilis and other sexually-transmitted diseases. In addition, antimicrobial resistance continues to be a major global health issue requiring healthcare professionals to quickly and accurately identify the nature of a pathogen in order to define the appropriate treatment strategy. Healthcare institutions around the world are actively seeking antimicrobial stewardship programs and solutions in order to improve their use of antibiotics. Our Test Target Treat initiative is designed to drive education and awareness among healthcare professionals regarding how they can use rapid diagnostics to make more targeted treatment decisions sooner than would otherwise be possible with conventional diagnostics, thereby reducing inappropriate antimicrobial use and the spread of resistance.

In 2014, after receiving clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, the Alere i Influenza A & B test was made available for sale in the United States, and we have continued to increase the Alere i installed base since receiving clearance. Alere i is a rapid point-of-care molecular platform for the qualitative detection of infectious diseases. Our Alere i isothermal nucleic acid amplification technology provides molecular results in just minutes, allowing healthcare providers to make quick and effective clinical decisions. In January 2015, the Alere i Influenza A & B test was granted the first-ever CLIA waiver for a nucleic acid-based influenza diagnostic test by the FDA. A CLIA waiver means that the FDA has waived the more stringent requirements for laboratory testing applicable to moderate or high complexity laboratory tests based on the tests ease of use and accuracy. As a result, the Alere i Influenza A & B test may be used in physician offices, clinics and other public health settings, where influenza patients are frequently examined and treated. In April 2015, we received clearance from the FDA for the Alere i Strep A test, and in July 2015 that test was granted a CLIA waiver by the FDA. In August 2016, the RSV test for use on the Alere i platform received 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA for detection of RSV infection in both children and adults, and in March 2017 this test was granted a CLIA waiver by the FDA. This RSV test is the first molecular test that can be used at the point of care to detect RSV in 13 minutes or less. Alere i tests for sexual health and neuroviruses are currently in development. 
 In addition to the advancements we have made with our Alere i platform, we have also continued to expand our product offerings to broaden our suite of infectious disease diagnostics, including tests based on advanced technologies that enable rapid and accurate diagnosis and monitoring of some of the most prevalent infectious diseases. We develop and market a wide variety of point-of-care tests for influenza A & B, RSV, strep A, pneumococcal pneumonia, C. difficile, HIV, hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B (HBV), malaria, dengue and other infectious diseases. Our tests for infectious diseases are currently sold under brand names that include Alere, Alere i (as discussed above), Alere q, Alere Determine, Acceava, BinaxNOW, Clearview, Panbio, Pima, SD, TechLab and Alere TestPack. 
 In December 2016, we received CE marking approval for the Alere Malaria Ag P.f, which is a high-sensitivity rapid diagnostic test for malaria. The Alere Malaria Ag P.f is designed to detect the histidine rich protein II (HRP-II) antigen of Plasmodium falciparum, to enable better identification of individuals with very low blood levels of the parasite responsible for causing malaria, many of whom may be without evident symptoms of malaria infection. We expect this diagnostic test will help healthcare workers screen individuals who are asymptomatic but may be carrying the parasite, and thus aid the implementation of surveillance and mass screen-and-treat programs that are critical for accelerating malaria elimination. The development of this product was supported by funding from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and in partnership with PATH and FIND. We plan to launch this product commercially in the second quarter of 2017. 
 Our offerings for the diagnosis and management of HIV infection include the Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo, the first FDA-approved and CLIA-waived rapid, point-of-care test that detects both HIV-1/2 antibodies and free HIV-1 p24 antigen. Due to its capability to detect unbound p24 antigen, this fourth-generation test may detect HIV infection earlier in the course of the disease. By enabling healthcare providers in physicians offices, clinics and other public health settings to diagnose HIV infection earlier, they can provide appropriate medical care to patients sooner. The Alere Determine HIV-1/2 Ag/Ab Combo is available in the United States and received CLIA-waived status in December 2014. 
 In addition, the Alere HIV Combo, which achieved CE marking in Europe in 2015, is our rapid point-of-care fourth-generation test that detects both HIV-1/2 antibodies and the HIV-1 p24 antigen. In July 2016, our HIV Combo product was awarded World Health Organization, or WHO, prequalification, making it available for public sector procurement in resource-limited countries. Because the Alere HIV Combo can detect free HIV-1 p24 antigens, which can appear days earlier than HIV antibodies, this diagnostic tool can be useful in earlier identification of HIV infection.

Our Alere Pima Analyzer, also known as the Alere CD4 Analyzer, continues to help HIV-infected patients in Africa and Asia monitor their immune function to determine the urgency of their need for drug therapy. The Alere Pima Analyzer provides CD4 results in 20 minutes or less, using disposable, single-use fingerstick cartridges. CD4 results delivered quickly and accurately at the point of care can improve both patient retention and access to treatment. Program data from the Alere Pima Analyzer can be transmitted and managed using our Alere Data Point connectivity solution, which is designed to enable data transmission from analyzers in the field to a web portal in order to assist in the management of local HIV treatment programs. 
 During 2015, Aleres SD BIOLINE HIV/Syphilis Duo test was awarded WHO prequalification, making it the first dual HIV/syphilis point-of-care test available for public sector procurement in resource-limited countries. 
 During 2016 we also continued to advance the development and commercialization of our Alere q Analyzer, which utilizes a versatile, single-use test cartridge to automatically extract, amplify and detect multiple molecular targets from a single patient sample. Alere q HIV 1/2 Detect is the first assay on the Alere q platform, and received In-Vitro Diagnostic (IVD) CE marking in March 2015 and WHO pre-qualification in June 2016. This is the first molecular diagnostic test at the point of care that identifies HIV-1 and HIV-2 in less than 60 minutes and can be used for early infant diagnosis of HIV infection. The Alere q HIV 1/2 Detect is not approved for sale in the United States. 
 In August 2016, we achieved IVD CE marking in Europe for our new Alere Reader, a diagnostic analyzer that can be used in both point-of-care and laboratory settings. The Alere Reader was initially available for use in Europe with the Alere BinaxNOW Legionella and Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen cards, with other lateral flow applications and assays expected to follow. In April 2017, the Alere Reader received 510(k) marketing clearance from the FDA and will be initially available in the U.S. for use with the BinaxNOW Influenza A & B Card 2. With the Alere Reader, physicians, lab technicians and other healthcare personnel insert test cards into the Alere Reader, which detects, identifies and analyzes the completed lateral flow assay. Results are displayed on an intuitive touch screen and can immediately be printed or linked to patient electronic medical records and back-end information systems. The Alere Reader uses an automated function to ensure that quality controls have been tested. 
 These products are examples of our deployment of leading technologies to enable rapid and accurate diagnosis and monitoring of some of the most prevalent infectious diseases around the world. 
 In addition to point-of-care products, we also offer a line of indirect fluorescent antibody, or IFA, assays for 17 viral, bacterial and autoimmune diseases, a line of serology diagnostic products covering a broad range of disease categories and 40 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or ELISA, tests for a wide variety of infectious and autoimmune diseases, as well as a full line of automated instrumentation for processing ELISA tests. 
 Demand for certain infectious disease tests, such as influenza A & B, or flu, is significantly affected by the seasonal nature of the cold and flu season. As a result, we typically experience higher sales of our flu tests in the first and fourth quarters. Sales of our flu products also vary widely from year to year based in large part on the severity, duration and timing of the onset of the cold and flu season. Sales of our diagnostic tests for Strep A are subject to the same seasonality as sales of our flu tests, but the seasonal impact with respect to our Strep A tests has historically been weaker than with respect to flu tests. 
 Cardiometabolic Disease.    Cardiometabolic disease encompasses a spectrum of conditions and illnesses, including both cardiovascular conditions and diabetes. Cardiovascular diseases include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, metabolic syndrome, coronary artery disease, heart attack, heart failure and stroke. Our Alere Triage, Alere Cholestech LDX, Alere Afinion products, and our epoc Blood Analysis System, we believe, have established us as a leader in this market. 
 
9 
 
The Alere Triage System is our rapid diagnostic test system comprised of the Alere Triage MeterPro, a high-performance portable testing platform, and a menu of test devices that enable physicians to promote improved health outcomes through the rapid diagnosis of critical diseases and health conditions, as well as the detection of certain drugs of abuse. This system is designed to aid in the diagnosis, assessment and risk stratification of patients having critical care issues, including congestive heart failure, acute coronary syndromes, acute myocardial infarction, or AMI, and is designed to play an important part in reducing hospital admissions and improving clinical and economic outcomes. Alere Triage cardiovascular rapid tests include immunoassays for B-type Natriuretic Peptide (BNP), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), D-dimer, myoglobin, troponin I and N-terminal pro-Brain Natriuretic Peptide (NT-proBNP). Alere Triage tests for troponin I and NT-proBNP, as well as certain test panels which include a combination of immunoassays, are not available for sale in the United States. We also offer a version of the Alere Triage BNP Test for use on Beckman Coulter laboratory analyzers. 
 Our Alere Cholestech LDX System is a small, portable point-of-care analyzer and test cassette system for testing blood glucose, cholesterol and related lipids. The Alere Cholestech LDX System makes it possible to provide a complete lipid profile with tests for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), triglycerides, and glucose. The Alere Cholestech LDX System provides results in five minutes per test cassette and is CLIA-waived. This waiver allows the Alere Cholestech LDX System to be marketed to physician offices and clinics and to be used in health screening by medical professionals. 
 In addition, we sell our First Check brand of over-the-counter tests for cholesterol monitoring. 
 We also offer the epoc Blood Analysis System for blood gas, electrolyte and metabolite testing. The epoc (which stands for enterprise point-of-care) platform is a point-of-care analysis system that provides wireless bedside blood gas, electrolyte and metabolite measurement testing solutions and complements our Alere Triage products in emergency room and intensive care unit settings. Utilizing easy-to-use, low-cost disposable Smart-Cards, the epoc Blood Analysis System produces laboratory-quality results in critical and acute care settings in about 30 seconds. While we have divested most of our veterinary point-of-care product lines over the past several years, we do continue to sell, on a limited basis, the epoc platform for use by veterinarians. 
 We also offer point-of-care diabetes products, including our Afinion Test System and our NycoCard Test System, which are designed to easily and rapidly determine the level of glycated hemoglobin, or HbA1c, in a patients blood at the point of care. HbA1c results provide information regarding the patients average blood sugar levels over a period of time. These systems are designed to simplify monitoring of any type of diabetes, facilitating treatment management and prevention of complications. By providing timely information regarding a patients blood sugar levels over time, it may also increase a patients motivation to comply with treatment and lifestyle changes and thereby improve their prognosis. Our CE-marked Lipid Panel is an important tool in our Afinion Test System for cardiovascular disease risk assessment. The Afinion Test System can also measure a patients Albumin Creatinine Ratio, which aids in the early detection of kidney disease often present in diabetic patients, and C-reactive protein, or CRP. Physicians test for elevated levels of CRP in connection with the diagnosis, therapy and monitoring of inflammatory diseases. Information regarding the level of CRP in a patients bloodstream can help physicians discriminate between a serious inflammatory illness, such as pneumonia, and less severe conditions, such as acute bronchitis and other respiratory tract infections. The NycoCard Test System, which is a low-cost product suited to countries with developing healthcare systems, includes tests for D-dimer, CRP, urine albumin and HbA1c. 
 Through our subsidiary Arriva Medical, we are a national mail-order supplier of diabetic testing supplies, including blood glucose monitors, test strips, lancets, lancing devices, and control solutions, as well as other related medical supplies in the United States. The costs of these products are, in many cases, reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers. Effective November 4, 2016, 
 
10 
 
 the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, revoked Arriva Medicals enrollment and, as a result, Arriva Medical is ineligible for reimbursement by CMS for any products or services furnished on or after November 4, 2016. See  Government RegulationArriva Medical Billing Number and Risk FactorsArriva Medicals Medicare enrollment was revoked effective November 4, 2016, and if we are unable to have this enrollment reinstated, or if Medicare were to revoke Medicare enrollment or billing privileges of other Alere entities, our business and results of operations may be harmed under Item 1A, Risk Factors elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on this matter as well as the status of the appeals processes that Arriva Medical is pursuing. 
 Our cardiometabolic business also offers a data management platform for use by our customers. Through our Alere Informatics business, we are a leading provider of data management systems for point-of-care testing in the United States. Our flagship data management product, the Alere RALS System, is a web-based system that collects patient test results and associated data from point-of-care devices, evaluates the data based on user-configurable criteria and transmits that data to a central laboratory information system. We estimate that RALS is now used in more than 2000 hospitals throughout the United States, all of which connect hospital glucose meters and more than 80% of which connect multiple device types (i.e. more than just glucose meters) to their RALS system.
We sell disposable, lateral flow rapid diagnostic tests for D-dimer and troponin I under our Clearview brand. These tests offer efficiency, as well as ease of use and accuracy, to clinics, hospitals and laboratories around the world. 
 Toxicology.    Drug abuse is a major global health problem, as well as a social and economic burden. Not only does abuse of illicit and prescription drugs cause lost workforce productivity, family conflict and drug-related crime, but it is also linked globally to the spread of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis and other blood-borne pathogens through use of contaminated needles. This misuse of drugs and drug addiction are among the costliest health problems in the U.S. and abroad. Moreover, the scope of the challenges presented by drug abuse is expanding. In 2016, the United States Department of Health and Human Services reported that the United States is in the midst of an unprecedented opioid abuse epidemic. Employers, law enforcement officials, healthcare professionals and others expend considerable effort to ensure that their applicants, employees, patients and other constituents are free of substance abuse and are getting the treatment, rehabilitation and mental health care they require. As a result, there is demand for simple and reliable laboratory-based, point-of-care and rapid toxicology tests to detect the most commonly abused substances and an evolving set of newly-formulated synthetic psychoactive substances. Physicians and treatment centers are also utilizing drug testing to identify and address signs of prescription drug misuse, whether obtained illicitly or by prescription, and more broadly, to improve outcomes in addiction medicine. Domestically and abroad, employers and governments require testing and screening services for workforce compliance with drug, alcohol and/or related fitness-for-duty health policies. 
 Urine and saliva-based screening and confirmation tests for drugs of abuse range from simple immunoassay tests to complex laboratory-based analytical procedures. The speed and sensitivity of immunoassays have made them the most widely accepted method for toxicology screening at the point of care, while laboratories offer a multitude of screening and complex confirmatory testing technologies. 
 We offer a line of drugs-of-abuse tests, reagent systems and laboratory testing options. Our toxicology business also provides employers and stakeholders with fully managed drug testing programs and various device and reagent platforms for the detection of the following illicit and prescription drugs of abuse: amphetamines/methamphetamines, cocaine, opiates, phencyclidine, tetrahydrocannabinol, acetaminophen, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, buprenorphine, ecstacy, methadone, propoxyphene and tricyclic antidepressants, and a wide range of designer drugs of abuse. In addition, our toxicology products include tests to detect alcohol. Our drug test products and laboratory services utilize urine specimens or, for certain applications, saliva, hair or other body fluids. 
 
11 
 
 We believe that early detection can lead to improved health outcomes through early intervention, treatment and recovery, and can also help employers reduce unnecessary employee injuries and related medical expenses. 
 Our rapid toxicology tests are sold primarily under the brands Alere Toxicology, Alere iScreen, eCup, Alere iCup, Alere Triage, Alere DDS2, First Check and SureStep. Our point-of-care tests come in a variety of formats, including integrated test cups that provide rapid screening in a convenient cup that targets up to 14 drugs with one sample and provides results in as little as five minutes. These point-of-care tests are primarily sold into the workplace, government, criminal justice and retail markets. The Alere Triage TOX Drug Screen panel sold for use with our Alere Triage MeterPro system detects the presence of many of the illicit and prescription drugs listed above at the point of care in approximately 15 minutes. The Alere Triage MeterPro system is used in hospital and clinical testing as a laboratory instrument to aid in the detection of drug abuse. Our Alere DDS2 Mobile Test System is an on-site, saliva-based drug detection system utilized in roadside testing, displaying results for the presence of up to six different drugs in five minutes. We currently sell this product in markets outside the United States but have begun multiple trials for roadside use by law enforcement agencies in the United States. We believe that a significant market for this evidentiary test device will develop in the United States, particularly if the trend towards the decriminalization of marijuana accelerates, and if federal and state regulators develop impairment policies. 
 With seven specialized toxicology laboratories in our global network, we offer comprehensive laboratory-based testing services to a global and diverse customer base. 
 Three of our toxicology laboratories are certified to the high regulatory standards of the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA). This certification allows us to provide services to workplace and certain government customers in certain regulated and clinical markets. In December 2016, our Redwood Toxicology Laboratory received accreditation from the American Board of Forensic Toxicology (ABFT) that encompasses post-mortem and human performance toxicology analysis for driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol (DUID) testing. This accreditation complements our SAMHSA laboratories by expanding our services to include new forensic services to government and criminal justice customers. With our ABFT accreditation, and Title 17 recognition from the California Department of Public Health, Aleres forensic laboratory is in a position to deliver innovative and timely testing services. 
 We also provide automated and efficient drug testing and occupational health services through our Alere eScreen platform and through other service-oriented businesses globally. We assist a broad range of domestic and foreign clients in the transport, oil and gas, mining, retail and related industries that follow rigorous drug testing policies. With an integrated web application and a suite of detection tools, eScreen helps automate test administration processes, linking supervisors, managers, collection sites, and employees throughout a variety of workplace testing events. Our solutions offer employers and governments the tools they need to successfully hire, monitor and maintain a drug-free, compliant, and productive workforce. We believe that our portfolio of toxicology products, laboratory tests, and occupational health services enhances our ability to compete in this market. 
 Other Non-Reportable (Alere Home Monitoring) 
 On January 9, 2015, we completed the sale of our health management business to OptumHealth Care Solutions. As a result of the sale of our health management business, as well as certain other transactions in 2015, the only component of the patient self-testing reporting segment that we retained was the Alere Home Monitoring business. In our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, the Alere Home Monitoring business was reported as a component of the professional diagnostics segment. Due to the nature of the operations of Alere Home Monitoring and the manner in which this business is conducted, we now report Alere Home Monitoring as a separate operating segment under other non-reportable.

12 
 
Similar to our professional diagnostic products, the products offered by Alere Home Monitoring analyze patient samples for evidence of a specific medical condition and measure patient response to therapy. These are also point-of-care, rapid diagnostic testing products. 
 Our Alere Home Monitoring business offers patient self-testing services. These services support anticoagulation management through frequent self-testing by patients (using various third-party PT/INR coagulation monitors) who take warfarin to control their risk for stroke and clotting disorders. These services are designed to provide physicians with actionable data that allow them to make more effective decisions in real time, deliver quality care, and put the individuals they treat on a pathway to better health. Alere Home Monitoring assists patients in acquiring home INR monitors and with insurance coverage determinations and provides physicians with a model that allows them to incorporate patient self-testing into their practices. Our program has been developed to identify candidates who we believe will benefit from self-testing protocols. The program is built around an advanced, web-based application that is intended to deliver patient results and other information to healthcare providers on a real-time basis, thereby facilitating therapy adjustments where appropriate and reducing the risk of serious events. Alere Home Monitoring offered the Alere INRatio/INRatio2 PT/INR Monitoring Systems until June 2016, when we made the decision to voluntarily withdraw those products from the market. In addition, the Alere Home Monitoring business operates the Alere VADCare and VADWatch programs to help manage VAD, or ventricular assist device, patients and remotely monitor their health after discharge to reduce the risk of possible hospital readmission. Through the Alere VADCare program, VAD patients receive equipment and supplies to power and control their implanted VADs. In addition, the VADWatch program also offers telemonitoring services that allows VAD coordinators to monitor patients after discharge and receive alerts when critical patient values fall outside pre-established ranges. These programs are designed to enable patients to be discharged from the hospital and monitor their conditions from their homes rather than remain in the hospital, which is intended to save costs for patients, hospitals, and payers and improve the quality of life for patients. 
 Consumer Diagnostics 
 In 2007, we and affiliates of The Procter & Gamble Company, or P&G, commenced a 50/50 joint venture for the development, manufacturing, marketing and sale of existing and to-be-developed consumer diagnostic products, outside the cardiology, diabetes and oral care fields. As part of this arrangement, we transferred essentially all of the assets of our consumer diagnostics business, other than our manufacturing and core intellectual property assets, to the joint venture, and P&G acquired its interest in the joint venture. Accordingly, substantially all of the consumer diagnostics product sales conducted by us prior to the formation of the joint venture, including sales of all of our products targeting the worldwide over-the-counter pregnancy and fertility/ovulation test market, are now conducted by the joint venture, which consists of unconsolidated entities operating primarily under the name SPD Swiss Precision Diagnostics GmbH, or SPD. 
 As part of the SPD joint venture, we entered into a finished product purchase agreement, pursuant to which we currently manufacture and sell to SPD substantially all of the consumer diagnostic products which it sells. We also entered into certain transition and long-term services agreements with SPD, pursuant to which we provide certain operational support services to the joint venture. Our consumer diagnostics segment recognizes the revenue and costs arising from these arrangements. SPD, in many cases, sells its products to P&G (or an affiliate of P&G) for sale in certain jurisdictions, including the United States. 
 Methods of Distribution and Customers 
 We distribute our professional diagnostic products to hospitals, reference laboratories, physician offices and other point-of-care settings through a worldwide distribution network. We have our own sales force in many countries, including most major markets. We also utilize third-party distributors to 
 
13 
 
 sell our products. Our diabetes testing supplies business, Arriva Medical, provides its products via mail-order to patients in the United States. As described further below under  Government Regulation, in late 2016, CMS revoked Arriva Medicals Medicare billing privileges and notified us that it intended to terminate Arriva Medicals competitive bidding contract with CMS, a decision that we are appealing. Our Alere Home Monitoring business, which constitutes the entire business operations of our other non-reportable segment, facilitates the distribution of PT/INR coagulation monitors in the United States by supporting patients with prescriptions for such monitors and by assisting physicians and patients with Medicare and commercial insurance reimbursement processes. Similarly, through its Alere VADCare and VADWatch programs, Alere Home Monitoring facilitates the distribution of equipment and supplies to power and control customers implanted VADs and offers telemonitoring services that allows VAD coordinators to monitor patients soon after discharge and receive alerts when critical patient values fall outside pre-established ranges. 
 We market and sell our First Check consumer drug testing products and cholesterol monitoring products in the United States through retail drug stores, retail food stores, drug wholesalers, and mass merchandisers. These products compete with other brand name drug testing products and cholesterol monitoring products based on price, performance and brand awareness. 
 During 2016, 2015 and 2014, no one customer represented more than 10% of our net revenue. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, no individual customers accounts receivable balance was more than 10% of our aggregate accounts receivable. 
 Manufacturing 
 Our primary manufacturing facilities are located in San Diego, California; Scarborough, Maine; Ottawa, Canada; Hangzhou and Shanghai, China; Jena, Germany; Matsudo, Japan; Oslo, Norway; Dundee, United Kingdom; and Yongin, South Korea. In 2016, we opened a new diagnostics manufacturing facility in Manesar, India, which produces rapid tests for the detection of infectious diseases including malaria, dengue and HIV. We also manufacture products at a number of other facilities in the United States, India, Israel and the United Kingdom. 
 Our primary manufacturing facilities are registered with FDA and/or ISO certified, as required under applicable law. We manufacture substantially all of our consumable diagnostic products at these facilities. We also manufacture the consumable diagnostic devices containing the diagnostic chemistry or other proprietary diagnostic technology, which are used in conjunction with our diagnostic or monitoring systems, and the digital tests and monitors that we supply to SPD. We contract with third parties to supply the electronic reader portion of these diagnostic or monitoring systems and to supply various other products that we sell, including the assays used in our Alere Triage BNP Test for use on Beckman Coulter laboratory systems, a majority of our IFA tests and the TechLab products. 
 Research and Development 
 Our primary research and development centers are in San Diego, California; Scarborough, Maine; Ottawa, Canada; Jena, Germany; Oslo, Norway; and Dundee, United Kingdom. We also conduct research and development at some of our other facilities, including facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Japan and South Korea. Our research and development programs focus on the development of diagnostic products for cardiometabolic disease, infectious disease and toxicology. Information about research and development expenses for the last three fiscal years is provided in the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Global Operations 
 We are a global company with major manufacturing facilities in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, India, Japan, Norway, South Korea and the United Kingdom and significant research and development operations in North America and Europe. Our professional diagnostics business is supported by offices in approximately 30 countries. 
 
14 
 
Our professional diagnostic products are sold throughout the world. Our patient self-testing products and services, offered through Alere Home Monitoring, and our diabetic testing supplies, offered through Arriva Medical, are provided almost exclusively in the United States. During 2016 and 2015, respectively, we generated approximately 54% and 56% of our net revenue from continuing operations from the United States, approximately 17% and 18% from Europe and approximately 29% and 26% from other locations. 
 For further financial information by geographic areas, see Note 19 of the notes to consolidated financial statements which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition 
 Professional Diagnostics.    Our professional diagnostics products are primarily point-of-care rapid diagnostic testing products sold into the infectious disease, cardiometabolic disease and toxicology markets. Competition for rapid diagnostic products is intense and is primarily based on price, quality, technology, speed of results, breadth of product line and distribution capabilities. Some competitors in the market for professional rapid diagnostic products, such as Becton Dickinson, are large companies with substantial resources, while numerous smaller, yet aggressive companies also compete with us, particularly where barriers to entry are low. As a result of the breadth of our product portfolio, no single competitor competes with us in every professional diagnostic product category that we supply, and our competitors differ significantly within each of our product areas of focus. Automated immunoassay systems also compete with our products, depending on, among other factors, government regulations, when labor shortages force laboratories to automate or when the unit costs of such systems are lower and other indirect costs are not taken into account. Such systems are provided by Abbott, Danaher, Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Roche, Siemens and other large diagnostic companies. 
 Our rapid lateral flow diagnostic tests targeted at infectious disease compete primarily with products offered by Becton Dickinson, Meridian Bioscience, and Quidel. Our products, particularly our HIV products, including our Pima Analyzer, also compete with tests offered by OraSure Technologies Chembio, Trinity and Becton Dickinson. Our Alere i and Alere q point-of-care analyzers compete with larger, laboratory-based analyzers from companies including Abbott, Becton Dickinson, Cepheid (which was acquired by Danaher in November 2016), Hologic and Roche, which also offer molecular technologies for amplifying DNA and RNA. 
 We also sell ELISA immunoassay diagnostic testing products, as well as serology, IFA and microbiology tests, primarily targeted at infectious and autoimmune diseases. Our ELISA tests compete against large diagnostics companies similar to those named above, and these companies manufacture and/or sell automated immunoassay systems and a wide array of diagnostic products designed for processing on those systems. Other competitors, including INOVA Diagnostics, DiaSorin and Diamedix, are smaller companies that compete based on quality and service. In the United States and Canada, we focus on matching the instrumentation and product testing requirements of our customers by offering a wide selection of diagnostic products and test equipment. The markets for our serology, IFA and microbiology products are mature and competition is based primarily on price and customer service. Our main competitors in serology and microbiology testing include Remel and Biokit. Our main competitors in IFA testing are Bio-Rad Laboratories, INOVA Diagnostics and Immuno Concepts. However, products in these categories also compete to a large extent against rapid membrane and ELISA products, whose tests are often easier to perform and read and can be more precise. 
 In cardiometabolic disease, the majority of diagnostic immunoassays utilized by physicians and other healthcare providers are performed by independent clinical reference laboratories and hospital-based laboratories using automated analyzers for batch testing. As a result, the primary competitors for our Alere Triage and Alere Cholestech LDX point-of-care testing systems, which consist of rapid diagnostic devices interpreted by compact analyzers, are the large diagnostics companies identified 
 
15 
 
 above that produce automated immunoassay systems. We expect these large companies to continue to compete vigorously to maintain their significant market share of the cardiovascular testing market. Although we offer our Alere Triage BNP test for use on Beckman Coulter Immunoassay Systems, our other primary cardiovascular products are not currently designed for automated batch testing. Our Alere Triage products and our epoc Blood Analysis System face competition from a number of systems, including Abbotts i-Stat hand-held system, in addition to the laboratory analyzers produced by the large diagnostic companies identified above and, for our epoc Blood Analysis System, near-patient systems produced by, among others, Instrumentation Laboratories, Nova Medical, Radiometer and Siemens. Our Alere Cholestech LDX system also faces direct competition from Abaxis Medical Diagnostics, which markets its point-of-care blood laboratory systems to physician office laboratories, and from Polymer Technology Systems CardioChek test. 
 In the field of diabetes, the competitors for our Afinion Test System and NycoCard Test System include Siemens Healthcare, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Roche Diagnostics, EKF and Samsung. Arriva Medical, which is our mail-order diabetes testing product supply business, primarily sells products which are covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers. Our major competitors for the sale of these products are large retail pharmacies, such as Walmart, Walgreens and CVS, independent pharmacies and a small number of mail-order suppliers. Competition for Medicare-reimbursed diabetes testing supplies, which represents the majority of our Arriva Medical business, changed significantly in 2013 as a result of the implementation by CMS of a competitive bidding process to limit the number of eligible suppliers and the fees for which they may be reimbursed. Based on the most recent bidding process, we estimate that CMS currently reimburses approximately ten suppliers that have agreed to accept a contractual reimbursement rate for mail-order diabetic testing supplies for the period from July 2016 to December 2018 that is substantially lower than the established fee schedule for these products. Arriva Medical is one of those approximately ten suppliers that was awarded a national mail-order contract. Suppliers that were not awarded contracts are unable to be reimbursed by Medicare for mail-order diabetic testing supplies. See  Government RegulationArriva Medical Billing Number and Risk FactorsArriva Medicals Medicare enrollment was revoked effective November 4, 2016, and if we are unable to have this enrollment reinstated, or if Medicare were to revoke Medicare enrollment or billing privileges of other Alere entities, our business and results of operations may be harmed under Item 1A, Risk Factors elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information regarding CMSs revocation of Arriva Medicals enrollment, as well as the status of the appeals processes that Arriva Medical is pursuing. 
 Our First Check tests compete against over-the-counter diagnostic tests sold primarily by Phamatech, but also by other smaller competitors. 
 Competitors for our drugs-of-abuse tests include many of the large diagnostics companies named above, which manufacture instrumented drug tests, reagents or instruments sold in a variety of formats to customers in the worldwide employment, transportation, government and clinical sectors, among others. Additionally, in many markets in which the barriers to entry are low, we compete with dozens of privately-held, small and emerging low-cost manufacturers of lateral flow point-of-care drug tests. Our worldwide drug testing laboratory services compete with hundreds of multi-national and regional clinical, toxicology and forensic laboratories. We also compete with a diverse set of background check companies and third party administrators that provide comprehensive services to employers. 
 Generally, the competitive positions of our professional diagnostic products may be based on, among other things, being first to market with a novel product, product performance, speed of delivering results, accuracy, convenience, cost-effectiveness, the strength of our intellectual property and price, as well as on the effectiveness of our sales force, customer support and our marketing and distribution partners. Where we face competition from large diagnostics companies, these competitors have greater resources than we do. In addition, certain competitors may have more favorable competitive positions than we do, particularly in markets outside the United States. 
 
16 
 
Consumer Diagnostics.    Substantially all of our consumer diagnostic products are sold to SPD, our joint venture. These products are sold by SPD for sale in retail markets where competition is intense and based primarily on brand recognition and price. Our revenues, as well as our share of the profits from the sale of these SPD products depend on SPDs ability to compete effectively in these markets. Competitors for SPDs products include Church & Dwights First Response brand, Perrigos Predictor brand, Prestige Brands EPT brand, and other private label suppliers. 
 Other Non-Reportable (Alere Home Monitoring).    Competition for our Alere Home Monitoring products and services is characterized by, among other factors, price, quality, technology, speed of results, breadth of product line, distribution capabilities and customer service. 
 The primary competitors for our PT/INR patient self-testing business operated by Alere Home Monitoring are mdINR and Roche Diagnostics. Alere Home Monitoring only distributes third-party PT/INR coagulation monitors following the June 2016 voluntary withdrawal of the Alere INRatio and INRatio2 Systems from the market. Roche currently accounts for a substantial proportion of domestic placements by Alere Home Monitoring of PT/INR point-of-care and patient self-testing devices. Our monitoring service is primarily marketed through a direct, dedicated sales force to clinicians who prescribe warfarin. Customer service and support levels are an important differentiator for us in this business. Our VADCare and VADWatch programs, which are also operated by Alere Home Monitoring, compete primarily with Orthodynamics and Continuum. Continuum and Medtronic account for a substantial portion of the VAD equipment placements domestically. Our VADCare and VADWatch monitoring programs are primarily marketed through a direct, dedicated sales force to clinicians and hospitals that implant VAD devices. Customer service, support, compliance and our proprietary VADWatch monitoring platform are key differentiators for Alere Home Monitoring. 
 Patents and Proprietary Technology; Trademarks 
 We believe we have built a strong intellectual property portfolio including patents, patent applications, copyrights, trade secrets and other intellectual property, which are intended to protect our present and future technologies, products and services. Our intellectual property portfolio includes patents and other intellectual property that we own and, in some cases, patents or other intellectual property that we license from third parties, which may be limited with respect to term and in terms of field of use or transferability and may require royalty payments. We generate these patent and other intellectual property rights covering significant inventions and other innovations in order to create a competitive advantage. While we believe that our licenses, patents and other intellectual property rights are of material importance to our business in the aggregate, we do not believe that any single license, patent, copyright, trade secret, trademark or other intellectual property right is in itself material to our business. 
 The medical device industry, including the diagnostic testing industry, historically has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights. 
 We believe that our history of successfully enforcing our intellectual property rights in the United States and abroad demonstrates our resolve in enforcing our intellectual property rights, the strength of our intellectual property portfolio and the competitive advantage that we believe we have in this area. From time to time in the past, we have incurred substantial costs, both in asserting infringement claims against others and in defending ourselves against patent and other intellectual property infringement claims, and we expect that we may incur substantial litigation costs, including payments in connection with settlements of litigation, as we continue to aggressively protect our technology, defend our proprietary rights and defend against infringement claims. We may not, however, continue to be successful in enforcing these rights in the future, our existing intellectual property rights may be challenged in the future and we may not be successful in defending against claims initiated against us. 
 
17 
 
We believe that certain of our trademarks are valuable assets that are important to the marketing of both our products and services. We have applied for or obtained registration for many of these trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or comparable foreign agencies. 
 We also seek to protect our trade secrets and confidential information through nondisclosure policies and confidentiality agreements. These policies and agreements, however, may not be enforceable in all jurisdictions and may not provide adequate protection to prevent either disclosure or use by another entity. 
 The medical device industry and the market for patient self-testing services place considerable importance on obtaining and enforcing patent (including licensed patents), trade secret, trademark and other intellectual property protection for new technologies, products, services and processes. Our success therefore depends, in part, on our ability to obtain and enforce the patents (including licensed patents), trademark registrations and other intellectual property rights necessary to protect our products, to obtain and preserve our trade secrets and other confidential intellectual property and to avoid or neutralize intellectual property threats from third parties. We cannot, however, guarantee our success in enforcing or maintaining our patent (including licensed patents), trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights; in obtaining (including by license) future patents, trademarks, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights in a timely manner or at all; or as to the breadth or degree of protection that our patents, trade secrets, trademark registrations or other intellectual property rights might afford us. For more information regarding the risks associated with our reliance on intellectual property rights, see the discussion in Item 1A Risk Factors elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation 
 Our businesses are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Changes in applicable laws, changes in the interpretation or application of such laws, or any failure to comply with existing or future laws, regulations or standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, business and prospects. From time to time, we have been subject to inquiries, investigations and enforcement actions by governmental authorities alleging that, or investigating whether, we have not fully complied with our legal and regulatory obligations, some of which have not yet been resolved. While we take significant steps designed to ensure that our current operations, arrangements and practices are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that we are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations or that we will be able to comply with new laws or regulations. 
 Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Most notably, all of our diagnostic products sold in the United States are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, as implemented and enforced by the FDA. Our diagnostic products sold in the United States, including any imbedded or stand-alone software which has been classified by the FDA as a Class II medical device, generally require either FDA clearance to market under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, or approval of a Premarket Application, or PMA, which may require pre-clinical and clinical trials. Foreign countries may have similar or more onerous requirements to support approvals to manufacture or market these products. The marketing of our consumer diagnostic products is also subject to regulation by the FTC. In addition, we are required to comply with regulatory requirements in countries outside the United States, which can change rapidly with relatively short notice. We must also demonstrate to the FDA that our diagnostic tests intended for home use or for use by laboratories holding a Certificate of Waiver under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, including most physician office laboratories, are simple to use with a low risk of error. Foreign countries may require similar or more onerous approvals to manufacture or market our products or to allow the use of our products in certain settings. 
 
18 
 
CLIA extends federal oversight to many clinical laboratories for clinical testing, including certain of our drug testing laboratories in the United States, by requiring that they be certified to meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Certain of our drug testing laboratories perform forensic (non-clinical) drug testing on employees of the federal government and private employers covered under the Department of Transportation guidelines and therefore the laboratories must be SAMSHA certified. SAMHSA certification includes oversight for testing federal employees and private employers covered under DOT guidelines for forensic purposes. To obtain access to controlled substances used to perform drugs-of-abuse testing in the United States, laboratories must be licensed by the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
 Certain of the clinicians who provide services in our patient self-testing business, such as nurses, must comply with individual licensing requirements, including in order to adhere to certain billing requirements of CMS and other third-party payers. We have procedures designed to verify that all of our clinicians who are subject to licensing requirements are licensed in the jurisdiction in which they are physically present and, if applicable, states in which they visit or interact with patients, to the extent such licensure is required. In addition, many states require that we have a license (or establish an exemption from holding such a license) in order to be able to dispense prescription devices within that state. 
 Under Section 6002 of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010), or the ACA, which is commonly referred to as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, and analogous state laws, we are required to collect data on and annually report to CMS and state regulatory agencies certain payments or other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and annually report certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members. The ACA is currently the subject of Congressional review and may be substantially revised, repealed or replaced. 
 Many areas of our business, including but not limited to our diabetes supply and patient self-testing services, are subject to unique licensing or permit requirements by state and local health and regulatory agencies. In addition, these and other areas of our business, including our entities that act as a Covered Entity or a Business Associate, are subject to rules and regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Office of Civil Rights, under laws such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which establishes a complex regulatory framework for safeguarding protected health information and comprehensive standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information, and the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, which establishes regulations governing, among other things, privacy and security matters associated with the electronic transmission of health information. Each state and certain foreign regulators have also established their own additional rules and regulations covering similar matters, including with respect to privacy matters. We are also required to obtain certification to participate in certain governmental payment programs, such as various state Medicaid or federal Medicare programs. Some states have established Certificate of Need/Determination of Need, or CON/DON, programs that regulate the expansion of healthcare operations. Certain aspects of our business also require that we maintain supplier numbers that are authorized by government agencies to allow us to bill or be reimbursed by government agencies, such as CMS. The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required licenses, certifications, supplier numbers or CON/DONs could adversely affect our business. We are also subject to laws regulating fraud, waste and abuse in the healthcare industry, including false claim laws. 
 Anti-kickback laws and regulations generally prohibit making payments or furnishing other benefits to influence the referral of tests billed to Medicare, Medicaid and certain other federal or state healthcare programs. In addition, federal and state anti-self-referral laws generally prohibit Medicare and Medicaid payments for clinical tests referred by physicians who have an ownership or investment interest in, or a compensation arrangement with the providing company. Some states have similar laws 
 
19 
 
 that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals and that could also affect other tests referred by clinicians with investments in or compensation arrangements with, the providing company. 
 We are also subject to a number of legal requirements relating to our international operations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, which generally prohibit engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the customs, export, trade sanctions and anti-boycott laws of the U.S., including those administered by the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Department of Commerce and the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the Treasury Department, as well as those of other nations in which we do business. These laws may prohibit us from doing business with nationals of designated countries, including, without limitation, Iran, North Korea, Syria and Cuba, or importing or exporting certain of our products and technologies, without first obtaining a license or confirming the availability of a general license. 
 In addition, we are required to comply with domestic and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy. The regulation of data privacy and security, and maintaining the confidentiality of certain patient health information, is increasing and is becoming more complex. For example, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated a safe harbor on which we and other companies relied in order to transfer to the United States certain personal information subject to protections under European Union law. In February 2016, the European Commission and the United States reached a political agreement on the EU-US Privacy Shield, a new framework for data flows between the two jurisdictions, and a draft adequacy decision was presented by the European Commission. In April 2016, a body made up of a representative from the data protection authority of each European Union member state, known as the Article 29 Working Party, expressed strong concerns about the adequacy of the EU-US Privacy Shield. In its opinion on the draft adequacy decision, the Article 29 Working Party noted that the framework did not incorporate some of the key principles of the European Union data protection regime. Accordingly, the EU-US Privacy Shield was subject to further negotiations and revisions. In July 2016, the representatives of the European member states approved the final version of the EU-US Privacy Shield, paving the way for the adoption of the decision by the European Commission, which occurred in July 2016. The final version of the EU-US Privacy Shield consists of four components: (i) the privacy shield principles, which is a code of conduct outlining protections for the handling of personal data; (ii) oversight and enforcement; (iii) an ombudsperson mechanism; and (iv) safeguards and limitations. The U.S. Department of Commerce began accepting certifications to the EU-US Privacy Shield in August 2016. 
 The EU-US Privacy Shield imposes significant obligations on U.S. companies, including us, to protect the personal information of European citizens and also requires stronger monitoring and enforcement of personal privacy by the U.S. Department of Commerce and FTC. To join the EU-US Privacy Shield, U.S. companies are required to self-certify to the Department of Commerce and publicly commit to the Privacy Shields requirements. We expect to apply for the certification to the EU-US Privacy Shield program in the first half of 2017. The European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation, which becomes effective on May 25, 2018 and replaces the existing European Union Data Protection Directive. 
 Arriva Medical Billing Number 
 As noted above, certain of our businesses, including Alere Home Monitoring, Alere Toxicology, and Arriva Medical, provide products and services directly to patients and customers, and those businesses submit claims to and receive reimbursement for such products and services from Medicare, Medicaid, and other third-party payers. 
 Arriva Medical is our durable medical equipment, or DME, supply business that furnishes diabetic testing supplies via mail order, including blood glucose monitors, test strips, lancets, lancing devices, and control solutions, as well as other related medical supplies in the United States. These products 
 
20 
 
 are generally covered by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payers. Competition for Medicare-reimbursed diabetes testing supplies, which represents the majority of our Arriva Medical business, changed significantly in 2013 as a result of the implementation by CMS of a competitive bidding process to limit the number of eligible suppliers and the fees for which they may be reimbursed. Based on the most recent bidding process, we estimate that CMS currently reimburses approximately ten suppliers that have agreed to accept a contractual reimbursement rate for mail-order diabetic testing supplies for the period from July 2016 to December 2018 that is substantially lower than the established fee schedule for these products. Arriva Medical is one of the approximately ten suppliers that was awarded a national mail-order contract. Suppliers that were not awarded contracts are unable to be reimbursed by Medicare for mail-order diabetic testing supplies. 
 On October 12, 2016, Arriva Medical received a notice, dated October 5, 2016, that its Medicare enrollment would be revoked by CMS, based on CMS assertion that, over a five-year period, out of the approximately 5.7 million Medicare claims made for about one million unique beneficiaries, Arriva had allegedly submitted claims for 211 Medicare beneficiaries who were deceased on the date their products were shipped (even if the products were appropriately ordered in advance of the patients death). Arriva Medicals initial appeal of this determination was denied by CMS, and Arrivas Medicare enrollment was revoked effective November 4, 2016, pending the outcome of further appeals. Arriva Medical conducted an investigation into the issue and does not believe that it received or, if received, retained, any Medicare reimbursement for the DME items at issue for these 211 Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, CMS subsequently provided notice that Arriva Medicals competitive bidding contract would be terminated as a result of the revocation of its enrollment. 
 On December 27, 2016, Arriva Medical filed an appeal for an administrative law judge, or ALJ, hearing seeking to permanently reinstate Arrivas Medicare enrollment status retroactive to the November 4, 2016 revocation date. On April 25, 2017, the ALJ upheld CMSs revocation of Arriva Medicals Medicare enrollment. Arriva Medical intends to proceed with the administrative appeals process by appealing the ALJ decision to the Department Appeals Board. 
 On December 28, 2016, Arriva Medical also filed a complaint in Federal District Court for the District of Columbia requesting a temporary restraining order, or TRO, and preliminary injunction, or PI, to prohibit CMS from terminating Arriva Medicals competitive bidding contract and requesting that the court require CMS to reinstate Arrivas Medicare billing status until due process could be provided in the form of the completion of the administrative appeals process prescribed by regulation. In conjunction with this case, on January 4, 2017, CMS agreed through its counsel that it would not revoke the competitive bidding contract while the administrative appeals process was underway, which mooted the request for the TRO. On March 9, 2017, the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia denied Arriva Medicals request for the PI to prohibit CMS from terminating Arriva Medicals competitive bidding contract and also denied CMSs motion to dismiss Arriva Medicals complaint. On April 17, 2017, the court issued an order dismissing Arriva Medicals complaint. 
 Unless and until its enrollment status is reactivated, Arriva Medical will be ineligible for reimbursement for any products or services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries after November 4, 2016. If the enrollment is reactivated retroactive to November 4, 2016, we would be able to bill and be reimbursed for all covered products or services furnished since that date. 
 Our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 included approximately $83.1 million in revenue attributable to Arriva Medicals products and services furnished on or before November 4, 2016 that were reimbursed by CMS and that were subject to the CMS revocation after November 4, 2016. During the period from November 4, 2016 to December 31, 2016, we furnished $9.8 million of Arrivas products and services that were subject to the CMS revocation to customers but did not recognize any revenue for such products and services because they were not eligible for reimbursement by CMS at the time we furnished them. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, Arriva Medical recognized approximately $16.5 million in revenue from the sale of products and services, such as diabetes supplies, that were reimbursed by other commercial payers and that were not subject to the

 CMS revocation. Of this amount, $2.3 million of revenue was generated after November 4, 2016. For products and services that have continued to be furnished to Medicare beneficiaries for the period from November 4, 2016 to December 31, 2016, Arriva Medical has incurred approximately $10.3 million in expenses and, as noted above, no revenue associated with the provision of these products and services has been recorded. If the enrollment is not reactivated retroactively, Arriva Medical will not be able to bill or otherwise be reimbursed (and consequently will not recognize any revenue) for the provision of these products and services. There can be no guarantee that Arriva Medicals enrollment with CMS will be reactivated. Further, if the enrollment is not restored, Arriva Medical will not be able to be reimbursed by Medicare for any products or services and will not be able to seek reenrollment in the Medicare program for at least three years from November 4, 2016. Also, the failure to have Arriva Medicals enrollment restored has resulted in one, and may result in other, third party payers indicating that they may not conduct business with Arriva Medical in the future or will not reimburse Arriva Medical for the provision of products and services to their beneficiaries.
