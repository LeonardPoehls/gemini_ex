For results of operations by business segment, see “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 Faneuil 
 Background 
 Faneuil is a Delaware corporation with headquarters in Hampton, VA. We acquired Faneuil from Harland Clarke Holdings Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Holdings Inc., for aggregate consideration of $53.0 million in 2013. 
 Faneuil is a nationally recognized leader in technology-enabled in-person and automated service delivery, particularly in regulated, highly complex environments. 
 Acquisition of Customer Management Outsourcing Business
 On May 26, 2017 (the “CMO Business Purchase Date”), Faneuil acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities associated with the customer management outsourcing business (“CMO Business”) of Vertex Business Services LLC (“Vertex”) for an adjusted purchase price of $12.7 million.  ALJ financed the acquisition with cash on hand, increased borrowings of $5.5 million on its line of credit, and the issuance of 1,466,667 shares of ALJ common stock.  The common stock was valued at $3.21 per share, which was the closing price of the common stock as listed on the NASDAQ Global Market on the CMO Business Purchase Date.
 The CMO Business, which was purchased to expand Faneuil’s presence into the utility market, provides direct customer care call center operations, back-office processes, including billing, collections and business analytics, and cloud-based customer care support exclusively for the utility industry.

 Faneuil’s customer contact employees undergo intensive training and development, followed by structured monitoring and assessments before they are certified to process customer contacts. Faneuil’s customer contact employees provide service delivery through multiple communication channels, including telephone, fax, email, web chat and face-to-face interaction. Additionally, Faneuil provides multi-lingual representatives to accommodate the communication needs of non-English-speaking customers, as well as the hearing-impaired. 
 Employees

The percentages of Faneuil net revenue derived from its significant customers for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
Customer A | | 17.7 | % | | | 36.2 | %
Customer B | | 12.3 | | | | 11.6 | 
Customer C | | 10.5 | | | ** | 

 
** Less than 10% of Faneuil net revenue.
 Customer A represented 8.6% and 17.8% of ALJ’s consolidated net revenue for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.  
 Many of Faneuil’s customers are government agencies subject to contractual budgetary ceilings. State and local funding for these agencies are approved by the respective state legislature(s) each year. Depending on budgetary constraints, the contract values may be subject to change based upon ongoing legislative approval. 
 Competition 

 Faneuil’s primary competitors are other large providers of toll services, such as Conduent, AEComm, and TransCore, Inc., as well as contact center operators such as Maximus and Automated Health Services. In many cases, Faneuil is smaller and has less financial and personnel resources than its competitors. If Faneuil cannot compete effectively to win new business and retain existing clients, its operating results will be negatively affected. To remain competitive, Faneuil must continuously implement new technologies and expand its portfolio of outsourced services and may have to make occasional strategic adjustments to its pricing for its services.
Properties 
 Faneuil leases all its properties with various locations throughout the United States for customer contact centers, walk-in retail, and administration. Corporate headquarters are located in Hampton, VA.  Faneuil’s leased facilities comprise an aggregate of approximately 398,000 square feet with leases that expire at various dates through August 2021.  Faneuil believes that its leased facilities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months. 
Backlog 
 Faneuil’s backlog represents executed contracts for future services.  The majority of Faneuil’s contracts are long-term and obligate Faneuil to provide services over multiple years.  Faneuil’s backlog may not represent guarantees of services as some of our contracts, especially with government entities, allow for cancellation under certain instances.  Faneuil adjusts backlog to reflect contract cancellations, deferrals, and revisions known at the reporting date; however, future contract modifications or cancellations may increase or reduce the backlog and future revenue.  
 
The following table reflects the amount of Faneuil’s contract backlog by the fiscal year we expect to recognize revenue (in millions): 
 
 
 | As of September 30, | 
-----------------------------------+---------------------+------
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Within one year | $ | 91.6 | | $ | 89.2 
Between one year and two years | | 64.3 | | | 58.9 
Between two years and three years | | 60.2 | | | 45.5 
Between three years and four years | | 17.4 | | | 44.6 
Thereafter | | 3.3 | | | 9.6 
 | $ | 236.8 | | $ | 247.8

 
The decrease in backlog as of September 30, 2017 compared to September 30, 2016 was due to the fulfillment of legacy contracts, slightly offset by acquisition of the CMO Business.

For more information regarding backlog, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally and our Common Stock - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.”
 Seasonality 
 Faneuil experiences seasonality within its various lines of business. For example, during the end of the calendar year through the end of the first calendar quarter, Faneuil generally experiences higher revenue with its healthcare customers as the customer contact centers increase operations during the enrollment periods of the healthcare exchanges. Faneuil’s revenue from its healthcare customers generally decreases during the remaining portion of the year after the enrollment period. Seasonality is less prevalent in the transportation industry, though there is typically an increase in volume during the summer months. 
Governmental Regulation 
 Faneuil’s business is subject to many legal and regulatory requirements in the United States, covering such matters as data privacy, consumer protection, health care requirements, labor relations, taxation, internal and disclosure control obligations, governmental affairs and immigration. For example, Faneuil is subject to state and federal laws and regulations regarding the protection of consumer information commonly referred to as “non-public personal information.” For instance, the collection of patient data through Faneuil’s contact center services and medical device tracking services is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, commonly known as HIPAA, which protects the privacy of patient data. These laws, regulations, and agreements require Faneuil to develop and implement policies to protect non-public personal information and to disclose these policies to consumers before a customer relationship is established and periodically after that. These laws, regulations, and agreements limit Faneuil’s ability to use or disclose non-public personal information for other than the purposes originally intended. Many of these regulations, including those related to data privacy, are frequently changing and sometimes conflict with existing ones amongst the various jurisdictions in which Faneuil provides services. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in liability for damages, fines, criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and restrictions on Faneuil’s ability to operate. Faneuil’s failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to Faneuil’s reputation in the marketplace, which could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Also, because a substantial portion of Faneuil’s operating costs consists of labor costs, changes in governmental regulations relating to wages, healthcare and healthcare reform and other benefits or employment taxes could have a material adverse effect on Faneuil’s business, results of operations or financial condition. 
Management 
 Faneuil is led by ALJ board member Anna Van Buren, who has served as Faneuil’s President and Chief Executive Officer since 2009 and previously served in executive roles at Faneuil since 2004. For additional information regarding Ms. Van Buren, see “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.” 
Carpets N’ More 
 Background 
 Carpets was originally organized in Nevada in 2002. We acquired Carpets from Levine Leichtman in 2014 for aggregate consideration of $5.25 million. 
 Carpets is one of the largest floor covering retailers in Las Vegas, Nevada, and a provider of multiple products for the commercial, retail and home builder markets, including flooring, countertops, cabinets, window coverings and garage/closet organizers. In addition to a stone and solid surface fabrication facility, Carpets has four retail locations in the Las Vegas area.  
Products and Services 
 Floor Coverings. Carpets provides various floor coverings to home builders, commercial and retail customers including carpet, hardwood, laminate, tile, ceramic, porcelain, natural stone, vinyl plank, vinyl tile, area rugs and specialty flooring including bamboo, leather, cork and large format tile. 
 Countertops and Surrounds. Carpets provides countertop and surrounds, primarily for bathrooms and kitchens, including natural stone, granite, ceramic, porcelain, solid surface, quartz, and piedrafina. 
 4


Cabinets and Other Products. Carpets provides kitchen, bathroom, and garage cabinets, closet and closet organizers; and window coverings including blinds, shutters, and shades. 
 Customers 
 Carpets sells to a variety of customers, including homeowners and home builders as well as to owners and operators of commercial buildings. Carpets’ home building customers include some of the largest home builders in the United States, along with local builders in and around Las Vegas, Nevada. Carpets’ commercial customers include general contractors, real estate investment firms/funds and commercial entities such as casinos and other companies looking to improve their office space. Carpets’ retail customers include the general public interested in making home improvements. 
 Carpets bids directly with home builders on residential developments and is awarded flooring, countertops and surrounds, and/or cabinet contracts. These contracts involve installing the base level products in each of the residential homes within the awarded development and, when requested, providing upgraded materials and services to the base level products. Carpets also bids on commercial work and is awarded contracts generally on a fixed price basis. These projects generally involve high-rise condos, office buildings, tenant improvements, off-strip casinos and general contractors. Carpets’ marketing activities include billboards, Internet search engine optimization, banner advertising, car wraps, affiliate websites, radio and television advertising, and referrals. 
 A small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of Carpets net revenue.  The percentages of Carpets net revenue derived from its significant customers for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2017 | | | 2016
Customer A | | 33.8 | % | | 11.5 | %
Customer B | | 24.3 | | | 28.1 | 
Customer C | | 17.7 | | | 24.7 | 

Suppliers
 Carpets has historically purchased materials from a small number of suppliers primarily to control the quality of the product and to capitalize on volume discounts.  If these suppliers were unable to provide materials on a timely basis, Carpets management believes alternative suppliers could provide the required materials with minimal disruption to the business.  Historically, Carpets has never experienced any significant delay or shortage in the supply of materials. 
 The percentages of Carpets inventory purchases from its significant suppliers for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2017 | | | 2016
Supplier A | | 20.4 | % | | 19.5 | %
Supplier B | 16.5 | | | 10.8
Supplier C | | 11.8 | | | 12.7 | 
Supplier D | | 11.3 | | | 13.0 |

Backlog
 Carpets’ backlog represents multi-year contracts with contractors to build-out communities, which typically takes about two to three years.  The following table reflects the amount of Carpets’ contract backlog by the fiscal year we expect to recognize revenue (in millions):
 
 
 | As of September 30, | 
-----------------------------------+---------------------+-----
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Within one year | $ | 21.8 | | $ | 32.5
Between one year and two years | | 25.3 | | | 29.3
Between two years and three years | | 8.6 | | | 6.3 
Between three years and four years | | 2.0 | | | 3.8 
 | $ | 57.7 | | $ | 71.9

 
The decrease at September 30, 2017, compared to September 30, 2016, was a result of the fulfilment of contracts during the year ended September 30, 2017 for contracts in place at September 30, 2016.  
 
For more information regarding backlog, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally and our Common Stock - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.
Competition 
 Carpets’ primary competitors include other flooring, countertop and surround, and cabinet providers in the Las Vegas area, such as Interior Specialist Inc. and Classic Flooring, as well as large box stores like Lowe’s, Home Depot and RC Willey. Carpets believes that its competitive advantages include a comprehensive and high-end quality solution for home builders for flooring, surrounds and cabinets, which provides them with a single point of accountability. Carpets also competes with discounted flooring companies like Cloud Carpet and Carpets Galore. 
Seasonality 
 Carpets generally experiences seasonality within the home building business as the number of houses sold during the winter months is generally lower than other times during the year. Conversely, the number of houses sold and delivered during the remaining portion of the year increases in comparison. 
Employees 
 Carpets had 436 employees, which included part-time installers, as of September 30, 2017.  All employees are located in the U.S.  None of its employees are subject to any collective bargaining agreements. Carpets considers its employee relations good. 
Properties 
 Carpets’ corporate office, four retail locations, solid surface fabrication facility, and flooring and cabinet warehouses are all leased and located in or around Las Vegas, NV.  Carpets leased facilities comprise an aggregate of approximately 108,000 square feet with leases that expire at various dates through June 2026. Carpets believes its leased facilities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months. 
Management 
 Carpets is led by Steve Chesin, who has served as its Chief Executive Officer since 2007. For additional information about Mr. Chesin, see “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”

Phoenix is a premier full-service, full-color printer with over 35 years of superior print experience. Drawing on a broad spectrum of materials and decorative technologies, Phoenix produces memorable, value-added components, heavily illustrated books, and specialty commercial products. Book publishers generally design book components to enhance the sales appeal of their books. The production of book components requires specialized equipment, materials, and finishes and often demands high-quality, intricate work. As a result, many leading publishers rely on specialty printers such as Phoenix to supply high-quality book components. This same philosophy applies to labels, packaging, and specialty commercial products, where Phoenix’s customers require the knowledge and expertise of a printer that can enhance their products for sale into the commercial marketplace. Phoenix has been servicing the publishing industry within the United States since 1979 and has formed lasting relationships with many of the biggest names in book publishing. 
 As a domestic manufacturer, Phoenix offers extensive, in-house digital pre-press capabilities and its technologically advanced UV printing platform supports an array of printing and finishing options. Phoenix’s innovative special effects include foil stamping, UV embellishments, and laminations, as well as its trademarked products LithoFoil®, MetalTone™, Look of Leather™ and VibraColor™. 
 Acquisition of Color Optics
 On July 18, 2016, Phoenix acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities from AKI, Inc. (“AKI”) in respect of AKI’s Color Optics division (“Color Optics”) for an adjusted purchase price of $6.6 million cash.   
 Color Optics is a leading printing and packaging solutions business servicing the beauty, fragrance, cosmetic and consumer-packaged goods markets.  The purchase of Color Optics complements Phoenix’s current product offerings and has allowed Phoenix to expand and diversify its product offerings by leveraging its existing core competencies.
 
Products and Services 
 Books and Components 
 Phoenix offers several products for books and components, which represents approximately 80% of Phoenix net revenue. 
 Phoenix is a leader in providing distinctive cover components and high-quality, heavily illustrated and multi-colored books for all markets. With its technologically advanced prepress and press operations as well as an array of finishing applications and innovative special effects, Phoenix is committed to producing memorable, value-added products. 
Labels and Packaging 
 In recent years, Phoenix has expanded into the label and packaging markets to leverage its unique printing and finishing capabilities as well as its trademarked special effects and extensive offerings of finishes and coatings. In 2014, Phoenix acquired the Brady Palmer Company, establishing its presence in the cut and stack label market.  With the purchase of Color Optics, Phoenix strengthened its presence in the label and packaging markets.  Phoenix is continuing to pursue growth in the folding carton and box wrap markets and has invested in additional manufacturing capabilities and sales and marketing personnel to support these efforts. 
Employees 
 Phoenix had 398 employees as of September 30, 2017, of which 10 are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. All employees are located in the U.S.  Phoenix considers its employee relations good.

Customers 
 Phoenix customers include many of the leading publishing companies.  A small number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of Phoenix net revenue.  The percentages of Phoenix net revenue derived from its significant customers for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:

 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2017 | | | 2016 | 
Customer A | | 18.8 | % | | | 21.8 | %
Customer B | | 13.0 | | | | 10.5 | 
Customer C | ** | | | | 11.3 | 

 ** Less than 10% of Phoenix net revenue.
 Suppliers
 Phoenix has historically purchased raw materials from a small number of suppliers primarily to control the quality of the product and to capitalize on volume discounts.  If these suppliers were unable to provide materials on a timely basis, Phoenix management believes alternative suppliers could provide the required materials with minimal disruption to the business.  Historically, Phoenix has never experienced any significant delay or shortage in the supply of materials. 
 The percentages of Phoenix inventory purchases from its significant suppliers for the years ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
 
 
 | Year Ended September 30, | 
-----------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2017 | | | 2016
Supplier A | | 27.8 | % | | 29.4 | %
Supplier B | | 10.3 | | | 13.2 | 

Backlog
 Phoenix’s backlog represents executed contracts that contain minimum volume commitments over multiple years for future product deliveries. Phoenix includes only the minimum commitments as backlog. As Phoenix’s executed contracts mostly provide for minimum volume commitments rather than minimum revenue commitments, the actual revenue from such contracts may differ from our backlog estimates as total order volume from Phoenix’s customers may vary. Phoenix adjusts backlog to reflect estimated order volumes delivered by its customers based on historical experience known at the reporting date; however, future  variations in order volumes by Phoenix’s customers may increase or decrease backlog and future revenue.
 The following table reflects the amount of Phoenix’s contract backlog by the fiscal year we expect to recognize revenue (in millions):
 
 
 | As of September 30, | 
-----------------------------------+---------------------+------
 | 2017 | | 2016 | 
Within one year | $ | 55.5 | | $ | 52.0 
Between one year and two years | | 48.7 | | | 46.7 
Between two years and three years | | 36.8 | | | 28.7 
Between three years and four years | | 4.7 | | | 17.4 
Thereafter | | — | | | 2.9 
 | $ | 145.7 | | $ | 147.7

 
The slight decrease as of September 30, 2017, compared to September 30, 2016, was a result of revenue recognized during the year ended September 30, 2017, from Phoenix’s backlog at September 30, 2016.  
 
For more information regarding backlog, see “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Related to our Business Generally and our Common Stock - We may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our backlog, which could reduce our revenue in future periods below the levels anticipated. This makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.”

Seasonality 
 There is seasonality to Phoenix’s business. Education book component sales (school and college) traditionally peak in the first and second quarters of the calendar year. Other book components sales traditionally peak in the third quarter of the calendar year. Book sales also traditionally peak in the third quarter of the calendar year. The fourth quarter of the calendar year traditionally has been Phoenix’s weakest quarter. These seasonal factors are not significant. 
Competition 
 The printing industry in general and the printing and manufacturing of books, in particular, is extremely competitive. Over the past several years, there has been significant consolidation in the publishing industry, such that fewer publishers control a greater share of the market. Although there are still many small, independent publishers, they do not wield the leverage held by major publishing houses. Additionally, the printing industry has experienced a reduction in demand for trade books due to the impact of the e-book market and a reduction in textbooks due to lower state government funding, alternative product formats and digital distribution of content. 
 Phoenix’s primary competitors in the printing and manufacturing of books and book components include, but are not limited to, LSC Communications, Coral Graphics, Quad Graphics and Worzalla. There is no reliable industry data available to determine Phoenix’s market share and position versus that of its competitors. With respect to book components, a portion of the products is produced by the book manufacturers and a portion by component printers. The dollar value of book components manufactured by the book manufacturers or by other component printers is unknown. Phoenix and Coral Graphics are the two primary trade book component manufacturers used by major publishers in the U.S. market. Most high-quality, heavily-illustrated and multi-colored books sold in the U.S. are produced outside of the U.S. Phoenix competes with Worzalla and several domestic book manufacturers for that portion that is produced domestically. 
 Properties 
 Phoenix owns its principal properties for corporate offices and production located in Hagerstown, MD. Phoenix’s owned facilities comprise an aggregate of approximately 276,000 square feet.  Color Optics leases approximately 84,000 square feet in Rockaway, NJ, which expires in 2020.  Phoenix believes its facilities will be adequate for at least the next 12 months.
Management 
 Phoenix is led by our board member Marc Reisch, who serves as its Chairman and previously served as its Chief Executive Officer from 2008 to 2015. For additional information regarding Mr. Reisch, see “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”
