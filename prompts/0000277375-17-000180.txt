Item 1. Business
References to “Delta”, “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to Delta Natural Gas Company, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, except as otherwise stated. We were incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky on October 7, 1949. Unless otherwise stated, “2017”, “2016” and “2015” refers to the respective twelve month periods ending June 30. Delta's NASDAQ symbol is DGAS.
General 
Delta distributes or transports natural gas to approximately 36,000 customers. Our distribution and transmission systems are located in central and southeastern Kentucky, and we own and operate an underground natural gas storage field in southeastern Kentucky. We transport natural gas to industrial customers who purchase their natural gas in the open market. We also transport natural gas on behalf of local producers and customers not on our distribution system and extract liquids from natural gas in our storage field and on our pipeline systems that are sold at market prices. We have three wholly-owned subsidiaries. Delta Resources, Inc. (“Delta Resources”) buys natural gas and resells it to industrial or large-volume customers on Delta's system. Delgasco, Inc. (“Delgasco”) buys natural gas and resells it to Delta Resources and to customers not on Delta's system. Enpro, Inc. (“Enpro”) owns and operates natural gas production properties and undeveloped acreage. 
We seek to provide dependable, high-quality service to our customers while steadily enhancing value for our shareholders. Our efforts have been focused on developing a balance of regulated and non-regulated businesses to contribute to our earnings by profitably selling, transporting, producing and processing natural gas in our service territory.
We strive to achieve operational excellence through economical, reliable service with an emphasis on responsiveness to customers. We continue to invest in facilities for the distribution, transportation and storage of natural gas. We believe that our responsiveness to customers and the dependability of the service we provide afford us additional opportunities for growth. While we seek those opportunities, we will continue a conservative strategy of managing market risk arising from fluctuations in the prices of natural gas and natural gas liquids. 
We operate through two segments, a regulated segment and a non-regulated segment. 
Our executive offices are located at 3617 Lexington Road, Winchester, Kentucky 40391. Our telephone number is (859) 744-6171. Our website is www.deltagas.com.
On February 20, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (“Merger Agreement”) with PNG Companies, LLC (“PNG”), hereinafter referred to as the “Merger”. For further information, see Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Regulated Operations
Distribution and Transportation
Through our regulated segment, we distribute natural gas to our retail customers in 23 predominantly rural counties. In addition, our regulated segment transports natural gas to large-volume customers on our system who purchase their natural gas in the open market. Our regulated segment also transports natural gas on behalf of local producers and other customers not on our distribution system.
The economy of our service area is based principally on coal mining, farming and light industry. The communities we serve typically contain populations of less than 20,000. Our three largest service areas are Nicholasville, Corbin and Berea, Kentucky. In Nicholasville we serve approximately 8,000 customers, in Corbin we serve approximately 6,000 customers and in Berea we serve approximately 4,000 customers. Some of the communities we serve continue to expand, resulting in growth opportunities for us. Industrial parks have been developed in our service areas, which could result in additional growth in industrial customers.
The Kentucky Public Service Commission exercises regulatory authority over our retail natural gas distribution and transportation services. Their regulation of our business includes approving the rates we are permitted to charge our regulated 
2

customers. The impact of this regulation is further discussed in Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 and under “Regulatory Matters” in Item 1. 
Factors that affect our regulated revenues include the rates we charge our customers, economic conditions in our service areas, competition, the cost of natural gas and weather. Our current rate design lessens the impact weather has on our regulated revenues as our rates include both fixed customer charges and volumetric rates which include a weather normalization tariff that adjusts rates due to variations in weather. Market risk arising from fluctuations in the price of natural gas is mitigated through the natural gas cost recovery rate mechanism which permits us to pass through to our regulated customers changes in the price we must pay for our natural gas supply. However, increases in our rates may cause our customers to conserve or to use alternative energy sources.
Our regulated sales are seasonal and temperature sensitive since the majority of the natural gas we sell is used for heating. During 2017, 74% of the regulated volumes were sold during the heating season (December through April). Variations in the average temperature during the winter impact our volumes sold. Our weather normalization tariff permits us to adjust the rates we charge our customers in response to winter weather that is warmer or colder than normal temperatures.
We compete with alternate sources of energy for our regulated distribution customers. These alternate sources include electricity, geo-thermal, coal, oil, propane, wood and solar.
Our large-volume regulated customers can obtain their natural gas supply by purchasing directly from interstate suppliers, local producers or marketers. Customers for whom we transport natural gas could by-pass our transportation system to directly connect to interstate pipelines or other transportation providers. Customers may undertake such a by-pass in order to seek lower prices for their natural gas transportation services. Our large-volume customers who are in close proximity to alternative supplies are likely to consider taking this action. Additionally, some of our industrial customers are able to switch to alternative sources of energy. These are competitive concerns that we continue to address by utilizing our non-regulated segment to offer these customers natural gas supply at competitive market-based rates.
Some natural gas producers in our service area can access pipeline systems other than ours, which generates competition for our transportation services. We continue our efforts to purchase or transport natural gas that is produced in reasonable proximity to our transportation facilities through our regulated segment.
As an active participant in many areas of the natural gas industry, we plan to continue efforts to expand our natural gas transmission and distribution system and customer base. We continue to consider acquisitions of other natural gas systems, some of which are contiguous to our existing service areas, as well as expansion within our existing service areas.
Natural Gas Supply
We maintain an active natural gas supply management program that emphasizes long-term reliability and the pursuit of cost-effective sources of natural gas for our customers. We purchase our natural gas from a combination of interstate and Kentucky sources. Our distribution and transportation system interconnects with interstate pipelines owned by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation (“Columbia Gas”), Columbia Gulf Transmission Corporation (“Columbia Gulf”), Tennessee Gas Pipeline (“Tennessee”) and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (“Texas Eastern”). In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we purchased approximately 99% of our natural gas from interstate sources.
Interstate Natural Gas Supply
Our regulated segment acquires its interstate natural gas supply from natural gas marketers. We currently have commodity requirements agreements with CenterPoint Energy Services, Inc. (“CenterPoint”) (formerly Atmos Energy Marketing) for our Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf, Tennessee and Texas Eastern supplied areas. Under these commodity requirements agreements, CenterPoint is obligated to supply the volumes consumed by our regulated customers in defined sections of our service areas. We are not obligated to purchase any minimum quantities from CenterPoint or to purchase natural gas from them for any period longer than one month at a time. The natural gas we purchase under these agreements is priced at index-based prices, NYMEX or at mutually agreed-to fixed prices based on forward market prices. The index-based market prices are determined based on the prices published on the first of each month in Platts' Inside FERC's Gas Market Report, plus or minus an agreed-to fixed price adjustment per million British Thermal Units of natural gas purchased. Consequently, the price we pay for interstate natural gas is based on current market prices.
Our agreements with CenterPoint for the Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf, Tennessee and Texas Eastern supplied service areas continue year-to-year unless canceled by either party by written notice at least sixty days prior to the annual anniversary 
3

date (April 30) of the agreement. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, approximately 57% of our regulated natural gas supply was purchased under our agreements with CenterPoint.
Our regulated segment purchases natural gas from Midwest Energy Services, LLC (“Midwest”) for injection into our underground natural gas storage field and to supply a portion of our system. We are not obligated to purchase any minimum quantities from Midwest, nor are we required to purchase natural gas for any periods longer than one month at a time. The natural gas is priced at index-based market prices or at mutually agreed-to fixed prices based on forward market prices. Our agreement with Midwest may be terminated upon 30 days prior written notice by either party. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, approximately 42% of our regulated natural gas supply was purchased under our agreement with Midwest.
We also purchase interstate natural gas from other natural gas marketers as needed at current market prices, determined by industry publications.
Transportation of Interstate Natural Gas Supply
Our interstate natural gas supply is transported to us from market hubs, production fields and storage fields by Tennessee, Columbia Gas, Columbia Gulf and Texas Eastern.
Our agreements with Tennessee currently extend through October, 2019 and thereafter automatically renew for subsequent five-year terms unless Delta notifies Tennessee of its intent not to renew the agreements at least one year prior to the expiration of any renewal terms. At this time, we expect to renew our agreements with Tennessee. Subject to the terms of Tennessee's Federal Energy Regulatory Commission natural gas tariff, Tennessee is obligated under these agreements to transport up to 19,600 thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) per day for us. During fiscal 2017, Tennessee transported for us a total of 1,827,000 Mcf, or approximately 50% of our regulated supply requirements, under these agreements. We have natural gas storage agreements with Tennessee under the terms of which we reserve a defined storage space in Tennessee's storage fields, which we have assigned to CenterPoint, and we reserve the right to withdraw daily natural gas volumes up to certain specified fixed quantities. These natural gas storage agreements renew on the same schedule as our transportation agreements with Tennessee.
Under our agreements with Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf, Columbia Gas is obligated to transport, including utilization of our defined storage space as required, up to 12,600 Mcf per day for us, and Columbia Gulf is obligated to transport up to a total of 4,300 Mcf per day for us. During fiscal 2017, Columbia Gas and Columbia Gulf transported for us a total of 266,000 Mcf, or approximately 7% of our regulated natural gas supply, under all of our agreements with them. Our transportation agreements with Columbia Gas continue on a year-to-year basis unless terminated by one of the parties. Our transportation agreements with Columbia Gulf extend through October, 2020 and may be extended by mutual agreement.
Columbia Gulf also transported additional volumes under agreements it has with Midwest to a point of interconnection between Columbia Gulf and us where we purchase the natural gas to inject into our storage field. The amounts transported and sold to us under the agreements Columbia Gulf has with Midwest for fiscal 2017 constituted 1,552,000 Mcf, or approximately 42% of our regulated natural gas supply. We are not a party to any of these separate transportation agreements on Columbia Gulf.
We have no direct agreement with Texas Eastern. However, CenterPoint has an arrangement with Texas Eastern to transport the natural gas to us that we purchase from CenterPoint to supply our customers' requirements in specific geographic areas. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, Texas Eastern transported approximately 11,000 Mcf of natural gas to our system, which constituted less than 1% of our natural gas supply.
Kentucky Natural Gas Supply
We have an agreement with Vinland Energy Operations, LLC (“Vinland”) to purchase natural gas on a year-to-year basis unless terminated by one of the parties. We purchased 31,000 Mcf from Vinland during fiscal 2017. The price for the natural gas we purchase from Vinland is based on the index price of spot natural gas delivered to Columbia Gas in the relevant region as reported in Platts' Inside FERC's Gas Market Report. Vinland delivers this natural gas to our customer meters directly from its own pipelines. In fiscal 2017, the natural gas we purchased from Vinland constituted approximately 1% of our regulated natural gas supply.
Natural Gas in Storage
We own and operate an underground natural gas storage field that we use to store a significant portion of our natural gas supply needs. This storage capability permits us to purchase and store natural gas during the non-heating months and then withdraw and sell the natural gas during the peak usage months. We have a legal obligation to retire wells located at this underground natural 
4

gas storage facility. However, since we expect to utilize the storage facility as long as we provide natural gas to our customers, we have determined the wells have an indeterminate life and have therefore not recorded a liability associated with the cost to retire the wells.
Regulatory Matters
The Kentucky Public Service Commission exercises regulatory authority over our retail natural gas distribution and transportation services, which includes approval of our regulated rates and tariffs. We monitor our need to file requests with them for a general rate increase for our natural gas distribution and transportation services. The Kentucky Public Service Commission has historically utilized cost-of-service ratemaking where our base rates are established to recover normal operating expenses, exclusive of natural gas costs, and a reasonable rate of return on our rate base. Rate base consists primarily of our regulated segment's property, plant and equipment, natural gas in storage and unamortized debt expense offset by accumulated depreciation and certain deferred income taxes. Our regulated rates were most recently adjusted in our 2010 rate case. We do not have any matters pending before the Kentucky Public Service Commission which would have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Our pipe replacement program tariff allows us to adjust our regulated rates annually to earn a return on capital expenditures incurred subsequent to our last rate case which are associated with the replacement of pipe and related facilities. The pipe replacement program tariff is designed to additionally recover the costs associated with the mandatory retirement or relocation of facilities.
Our natural gas cost recovery tariff permits us to adjust the rates charged to our customers to reflect changes in our natural gas supply costs and any bad debt expense related to natural gas cost. Although we are not required to file a general rate case to adjust rates pursuant to the natural gas cost recovery tariff, we are required to make quarterly filings with the Kentucky Public Service Commission. Under and over-recovered natural gas costs are collected or refunded through adjustments to customer bills beginning three months after the end of the quarter in which the actual natural gas costs were incurred. 
Our weather normalization provision tariff provides for the adjustment of our rates to residential and small non-residential customers to reflect variations from thirty-year average weather for our December through April billing cycles. These adjustments to customer bills are made on a real time basis such that there is no lag in collecting from or refunding to customers the related dollar amounts.
Additionally, we have a conservation and efficiency program tariff for our residential customers, which allows us to adjust our rates for activities performed through the program. Through this program, we perform energy audits, promote conservation awareness and provide rebates on the purchase of certain high efficiency appliances. The program helps to align our interests with our residential customers' interests by reimbursing us for the gross margins on lost sales due to operating the program and providing incentives for us to promote customer conservation. Our rates are adjusted annually to recover the costs incurred under these programs, the reimbursement of margins on lost sales and the incentives provided to us.
In addition to regulation by the Kentucky Public Service Commission, we may obtain non-exclusive franchises from the cities in which we operate authorizing us to place our facilities in the streets and public grounds. No utility may obtain a franchise until it has obtained approval from the Kentucky Public Service Commission to bid on such franchise. We hold franchises in seven of the cities we serve, and we continue to operate under the conditions of expired franchises in fifteen other cities we serve. In the other cities and areas we serve, there are no governmental organizations authorized to grant franchises or the city governments do not require a franchise. We attempt to acquire or reacquire franchises whenever feasible. Without a franchise, a city could require us to cease our occupation of the streets and public grounds or prohibit us from extending our facilities into any new area of that city. To date, the absence of a franchise has not adversely affected our operations.
On March 17, 2017, we and PNG filed a joint application with the Kentucky Public Service Commission seeking regulatory approval of the Merger, as further discussed in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under Kentucky Law, the Kentucky Public Service Commission had up to 120 days to approve the Merger and such approval is granted if the acquirer of a public utility demonstrates they possess the financial, technical, and managerial abilities to provide reasonable service. On August 15, 2017, the Kentucky Public Service Commission issued an order granting unconditional approval of the Merger and we anticipate closing to occur by September 30, 2017.

Non-Regulated Operations
Natural Gas Marketing
Our non-regulated segment includes three wholly-owned subsidiaries. Two of these subsidiaries, Delta Resources and Delgasco, purchase natural gas in the open market, including natural gas from Kentucky producers. We resell this natural gas to industrial customers on our distribution system and to others not on our system.
Factors that affect our non-regulated revenues include the rates we charge our customers, our supply cost for the natural gas we purchase for resale, economic conditions in our service areas, weather and competition. 
Our non-regulated customers can obtain their natural gas supply by purchasing directly from interstate suppliers, local producers or marketers and arranging for alternate transportation of the natural gas to their plants or facilities. Additionally, some of our industrial customers are able to switch economically to alternative sources of energy. We continue to address these competitive concerns by offering these customers natural gas supply at competitive, market-based rates.
In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, approximately 98% of our non-regulated revenue was derived from our natural gas marketing activities. In our non-regulated segment, two customers each provided more than 5% of our operating revenues for 2017. CenterPoint provided approximately $4,744,000, $5,656,000 and $7,127,000 of non-regulated revenues during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Greystone, LLC provided approximately $15,889,000, $11,555,000 and $17,852,000 of non-regulated revenues during 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. There is no assurance that revenues from these customers will continue at these levels.
Natural Gas Production
Our subsidiary, Enpro, produces natural gas that is sold to Delgasco for resale in the open market when favorable market conditions arise. Item 2 further describes Enpro's oil and natural gas leases and production properties. Enpro produced a total of 111,000 Mcf of natural gas during 2017, which was approximately 2% of our non-regulated volumes sold. 
Natural Gas Liquids
We process a portion of the natural gas in our distribution, transmission and storage system to extract liquids, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of our system. The profitability from the sales of the natural gas liquids is dependent on the amount of liquids extracted, the pricing for any such liquids as determined by a national non-regulated market and the volumes of natural gas liquids sold. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, approximately 2% of our non-regulated revenue was derived from the sale of natural gas liquids.
Natural Gas Supply
 Our non-regulated segment purchases natural gas from Midwest. Our underlying agreement with Midwest does not obligate us to purchase any minimum quantities, nor to purchase natural gas for any periods longer than one month at a time. The natural gas is priced at index-based market prices or at mutually agreed-to fixed prices based on forward market prices. Our agreement with Midwest may be terminated upon 30 days prior written notice by either party. Any purchase agreements to supply our non-regulated sales activities may have longer terms or multiple month purchase commitments. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, 91% of our non-regulated natural gas supply was purchased under our agreement with Midwest.
Additionally, our non-regulated segment purchases natural gas from CenterPoint as needed. This spot purchasing arrangement is pursuant to an agreement with CenterPoint containing an evergreen clause which permits either party to terminate the agreement by providing not less than sixty days written notice. Our purchases from CenterPoint under this spot purchase agreement are generally month-to-month. However, we have the option of forward-pricing natural gas for one or more months. The price of natural gas under this agreement is based on current market prices. In our fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, approximately 4% of our non-regulated natural gas supply was purchased under our agreement with CenterPoint.
We also purchase intrastate natural gas from Kentucky producers as needed at either current market prices, determined by industry publications, or at forward market prices.
We anticipate continuing our non-regulated activities and intend to pursue and increase these activities wherever practicable. We continue to consider acquisitions of additional production properties which are contiguous to our regulated distribution and transmission system as well as opportunities to process additional volumes of natural gas.

Merger with PNG Companies, LLC
On February 20, 2017, we entered into a Merger Agreement with PNG and Drake Merger Sub Inc. (“Merger Sub”), a new wholly owned subsidiary of PNG. The Merger Agreement provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into Delta, with Delta surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of PNG. A special meeting of shareholders was held on June 1, 2017 where shareholders voted and approved the Merger and on August 15, 2017, the Kentucky Public Service Commission issued an order granting unconditional approval of the Merger. At the effective time of the Merger, subject to customary closing conditions, each share of Delta common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the closing will be converted automatically into the right to receive $30.50 in cash per share, without interest, less any applicable withholding taxes. Upon consummation of the Merger, Delta common stock will be delisted from NASDAQ and the bank line of credit will be terminated. We anticipate closing to occur by September 30, 2017.
Subsequent to closing, a stub period dividend will be paid to Delta’s shareholders of record immediately prior to closing which is a prorated quarterly dividend calculated in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement. 
In connection with this transaction, in 2017 we incurred $1,612,000 of Merger-related expenses for costs paid to outside parties, which are reflected in operation and maintenance in the Consolidated Statement of Income. This amount does not include the cost of company personnel participating in Merger-related activities. Refer to Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of litigation related to the Merger.
Capital Expenditures
Capital expenditures during 2017 were $8.7 million and for 2018 are estimated to be $7.8 million. Our expenditures include system extensions, the replacement and improvement of existing transmission, distribution, gathering, production and storage systems as well as general facilities. 
Financing
Our capital expenditures and operating cash requirements are primarily met through the use of internally generated funds. Our short-term bank line of credit is $40 million, all of which was available at June 30, 2017.
Our current bank line of credit extends through June 30, 2019, but will be terminated upon closing of the Merger. If the Merger does not close, the bank line of credit would be available to meet capital expenditure and operating cash requirements. Additionally, the amounts and types of future long-term debt and equity financings would depend upon our capital needs and market conditions.
We currently have long-term debt with contractual maturities of $50,500,000 in the form of our Series A Notes. The Series A Notes are unsecured, bear interest at 4.26% per annum and mature on December 20, 2031. Accrued interest on the Series A Notes is payable quarterly and we are required to make a $1,500,000 principal reduction payment on the Series A Notes each December.
Employees
On June 30, 2017, we had 148 full-time employees. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory. Our employees are not represented by unions nor are they subject to any collective bargaining agreements.
Available Information
We make available free of charge on our Internet website http://www.deltagas.com under our “Investor Relations” tab, our Business Code of Conduct and Ethics, Vendor Code of Conduct and Ethics, annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, extensible business reporting language (XBRL) interactive data files, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).
