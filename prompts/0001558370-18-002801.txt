 Item 1.     Business
 Overview
 As discussed in detail in the Explanatory Note, which precedes this Part I of the Annual Report, and elsewhere in this document, Real Industry is operating as a debtor-in-possession under the jurisdiction, and pursuant to the orders, of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. As of the date of the filing of this Annual Report, Real Industry expects to emerge from Bankruptcy Proceedings in 2018 as Reorganized RELY.
 Real Industry is a Delaware holding company that has historically operated through subsidiaries. Prior to the Petition Date, our business focus was identifying acquisition opportunities and supporting the performance of our primary operating subsidiary, a global leader in aluminum recycling doing business as Real Alloy, and to make acquisitions of additional operating companies. As discussed further herein, on March 29, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Real Alloy Sale pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement. Upon closing of the Real Alloy Sale, Real Industry will no longer have any economic interest in the Real Alloy business operations. The sale is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.
 The RI Disclosure Statement discloses that upon emergence from bankruptcy, the Company expects, with the financial support of the Plan Sponsor, to continue executing its business strategy of identifying and acquiring controlling interests in operating companies. The RI Plan remains subject to approval by the Bankruptcy Court.
 A key element to our business strategy is utilizing our considerable U.S. NOLs. Our U.S. NOLs were predominantly generated by the legacy businesses of Fremont General Corporation (“Fremont”), and as of December 31, 2017, we have U.S. NOLs of approximately $960.5 million, which begin to expire if not used before our 2027 tax year. The ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets, including our U.S. NOLs, depends on our ability to generate future U.S. federal taxable income through the implementation of our business plan.
 Pre-Bankruptcy Operations
 In our effort to achieve our business objective of becoming a consistently profitable enterprise, in February 2015, we acquired Real Alloy. While our management team continued to evaluate additional acquisitions of operating businesses after Real Alloy was successfully integrated into our operations, from February 2015 thru December 2017, Real Alloy has provided substantially all of the operating activities of the Company. Headquartered in Beachwood, Ohio, Real Alloy is a global leader in third-party aluminum recycling, which includes the processing of scrap aluminum and by-products, and the manufacturing of wrought, cast, and specification or foundry alloys. Real Alloy offers a broad range of products and services to wrought alloy processors, automotive original equipment manufacturers, foundries, and casters. Further, it delivers recycled metal in liquid or solid form according to customer specifications. Real Alloy serves the automotive, consumer packaging, aerospace, building and construction, steel, and durable goods industries. Real Alloy’s facilities are capable of processing industrial (new) scrap, post-consumer (old/obsolete) scrap, and various aluminum by-products, providing it a great degree of flexibility in reclaiming high-quality recycled aluminum. Prior to the Petition Date, Real Alloy operated twenty-one facilities strategically located throughout North America and six facilities in Europe. More information on Real Alloy’s business can be found below under “Our Reportable Segments – RANA and RAEU.”
 Operations During Bankruptcy
 Following the Petition Date, the Debtors have continued to operate their businesses as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Material events that have transpired during the Chapter 11 Cases through the date of the filing of this Annual Report are summarized below.

 Real Industry Bankruptcy Proceedings
 Limitation on Transfer of Equity Interest in Real Industry. On January 17, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered a final order, approving procedures that require prior notice to the Bankruptcy Court of certain proposed transfers of beneficial ownership in the Company’s equity securities by persons who hold 4.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock or any shares of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, or by persons who would own in excess of such levels upon such transfer. The trading order also imposes certain procedures on holders of 50% or more of any class of the Company’s equity securities to report such status and to provide advance notice of planned tax deductions based on the worthlessness of such stock. This trading order serves to limit certain sales or purchases of the Company’s common or preferred equity or other actions that could reduce or eliminate the value of any NOLs under existing Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Tax Code”). Any transfers of shares or declarations of worthlessness in violation of the procedures in the trading order are null and void ab initio.
 Real Industry DIP Financing Facility. On January 24, 2018, with Bankruptcy Court approval, the Company’s entered into the RELY DIP Facility credit agreement (the “RELY DIP Credit Agreement”) in an aggregate principal amount of $5.5 million, of which the $4.0 million was available for immediate borrowing and an additional $1.5 million became available to be borrowed on January 31, 2018. The RELY DIP Facility bears interest at an annual rate of 11%, and matures on the earliest of, among other things, November 17, 2018, the effective date of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization that has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, or acceleration and termination of the RELY DIP Facility due to an event of default under the RELY DIP Credit Agreement or Bankruptcy Court order for the RELY DIP Facility. An additional 2% interest applies upon and during the continuation of an event of default. The RELY DIP Facility is secured by the assets of Real Industry and its subsidiaries, SGGH and Cosmedicine, LLC (“Cosmedicine”), but excludes any assets of the Real Alloy Debtors. Real Industry has drawn the entire amount of such facility as of the date of the filing of this Annual Report.  
 The terms of the RELY DIP Credit Agreement provide for the lenders of the RELY DIP Facility or affiliates thereof (the “RELY DIP Lenders”) to sponsor a plan of reorganization for Real Industry. They further contemplate the RELY DIP Lenders’ entry into definitive equity purchase agreements pursuant to which the RELY DIP Lenders, or their affiliates, will purchase up to 49% of the Company’s common stock at emergence from the RI Chapter 11 Case for $17.5 million (the “Equity Commitment”), inclusive of the repayment of the RELY DIP Facility. In the event that the Company terminates the Equity Commitment without the RELY DIP Lenders’ consent, the Company will owe $0.3 million and 4.9% of the Company’s outstanding stock as a break-up fee.
 Plan of Reorganization. On March 1, 2018, Real Industry filed the RI Plan and RI Disclosure Statement, each as amended thereafter, with the Bankruptcy Court, whereby the Plan Sponsor is to provide $17.5 million of capital in exchange for 49% of newly issued equity in Reorganized RELY. In addition, the RI Plan also contemplates a commitment by the Plan Sponsor to provide a credit facility of up to $500 million for the Company to pursue its business plan post-emergence from the RI Chapter 11 Case. If the RI Plan, as proposed and amended, is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, Real Industry’s existing common stockholders will receive their pro rata share of 20% of the newly issued equity in Reorganized RELY, assuming the Company’s stockholders vote to accept the RI Plan as a class. Similarly, the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, who has agreed to vote in favor of the RI Plan, will receive a $2.0 million cash payment plus 31% of the newly issued equity in Reorganized RELY, in exchange for full settlement of its $28.5 million liquidation preference and $1.8 million of accrued dividends. If the stockholders do not vote to approve the RI Plan as a class, then, upon confirmation of the RI Plan by the Bankruptcy Court, the existing common stockholders will receive 16% of the newly issued equity in Reorganized RELY, with 35% being issued to the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock, plus the aforementioned $2.0 million cash payment. As disclosed in the RI Disclosure Statement, the holder of the Redeemable Preferred Stock and three holders of approximately 15% of the Company’s common stock have entered into restructuring support agreements with the Plan Sponsor to support the RI Plan.

 Real Alloy Bankruptcy Proceedings
 Real Alloy DIP Financing Facility. On the Petition Date, the Real Alloy Debtors secured a commitment for debtor-in-possession financing (the “RA DIP Financing Facility”), which was approved on an interim basis by the Bankruptcy Court on November 20, 2017, and on a final basis on January 17, 2018. On January 19, 2018, the Real Alloy Debtors closed the transactions under which the RA DIP Financing Facility has been provided. The RA DIP Financing Facility is comprised of (i) up to $85 million in new money senior-secured priming and super-priority post-petition debtor-in-possession notes issued by Real Alloy and guaranteed by RAIH and the other Real Alloy Debtors (the “New Money DIP Term Notes”), (ii) an additional series of senior-secured priming and super-priority post-petition debtor-in-possession notes issued by Real Alloy and guaranteed by RAIH and the other Real Alloy Debtors in the aggregate principal amount of $170 million (the “Roll Up DIP Term Notes” and collectively with the New Money DIP Term Notes, the “RA DIP Notes Facility”) in exchange for $170 million of the Senior Secured Notes (as defined below), and (iii) up to $110 million in borrowing by certain of the Real Alloy Debtors under a senior secured priming and super-priority post-petition financing in the form of a revolving credit facility (“RA DIP ABL Facility”). The purchasers of the New Money DIP Term Notes were entitled to exchange, on a pro rata basis, up to $170 million of their existing Senior Secured Notes for Roll Up DIP Term Notes.
 Proceeds of up to $65 million of the New Money DIP Term Notes are being used exclusively by the Real Alloy Debtors to fund their operations, and proceeds of up to $20 million of the New Money DIP Term Notes can be used exclusively to fund the operations of the Real Alloy foreign subsidiaries. 
 The $110 million RA DIP ABL Facility includes a letter of credit sub-facility for up to $20 million.     Real Alloy Sale Process. In connection with the RA DIP Financing Facility, the Real Alloy Debtors agreed to pursue a sale of substantially all of their assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code (a “Section 363 Sale”). Pursuant to the RA DIP Financing Facility, among other things, the Real Alloy Debtors were required to meet certain milestones related to the Section 363 Sale and to obtain the prior written consent of a majority of certain required holders under the RA DIP Notes Facility and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent and collateral agent under the RA DIP ABL Facility in order to sell, or enter into a binding agreement to sell, the assets of the Real Alloy Debtors, unless the obligations under the RA DIP Financing Facility, the Senior Secured Notes and the Prior ABL Facility (defined below) are repaid in full in cash upon the closing of such sale. Under the Real Alloy bidding procedures order, a bid deadline of March 19, 2018 was set with an auction, if necessary, to occur on March 27, 2018, and a sale hearing to occur on March 29, 2018.
    
On February 2, 2018, an ad hoc group of Real Alloy Debtors’ secured noteholders stated their intention to provide a cash and credit bid for substantially all of the assets of the Real Alloy Debtors (the “Credit Bid Proposal”), to be documented in a definitive agreement. On March 7, 2018, the noteholder group, the Real Alloy Debtors, and the unsecured creditors committee in Chapter 11 Cases (the “UCC”) agreed upon the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The Asset Purchase Agreement, and a proposed form of order authorizing, among other things, the Real Alloy Debtors’ entry into the Asset Purchase Agreement, were filed with the Bankruptcy Court on March 8, 2018 and were amended thereafter.
 Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the ad hoc noteholder group agreed to acquire substantially all of the assets of the Real Alloy Debtors and the equity of their joint ventures and international subsidiaries for an estimated total purchase consideration of approximately $364 million, plus the assumption of certain liabilities. As part of reaching an agreement with the UCC, the Asset Purchase Agreement provides for the assumption by the buyer of up to $18.6 million of priority and unsecured claims against the Real Alloy Debtors’ estates. Under the Asset Purchase Agreement, holders of claims against the Real Alloy Debtors that are entitled to priority under section 503(b)(9) of the Bankruptcy Code may receive as much as a 100% recovery on such claims as an upfront payment at closing in exchange for terms including negotiated credit limits, volume, and pricing. Vendors holding general unsecured claims against the Real Alloy Debtors may also receive recoveries on their claims, depending upon credit and other commercial terms offered.  Real Industry does not expect that the transaction contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement will result in any recovery from Real Industry’s equity interest in RAIH.
 The auction was cancelled when no topping bids were received by the bid deadline. On March 29, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court approved the Asset Purchase Agreement. The transaction contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018.

 Corporate History and Structure
 Real Industry is the successor to Signature Group Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Signature Delaware”), which on January 2, 2014, completed a holding company reorganization and reincorporation from Nevada to Delaware (the “Reincorporation”). The Reincorporation was completed to take advantage of the benefits of Delaware corporate law and to provide a better organizational structure for our future acquisitions and the management of existing operations. To accomplish the Reincorporation, in late 2013, Signature Group Holdings, Inc. a Nevada corporation (“Signature Nevada”) formed SGH Holdco, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiary, SGGH. In the Reincorporation, following the approval of Signature Nevada’s stockholders, Signature Nevada merged with and into SGGH, with Signature Nevada ceasing to exist and SGGH continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary of SGH Holdco, Inc. Concurrently with the merger, SGH Holdco, Inc. was renamed Signature Group Holdings, Inc. In the Reincorporation, each outstanding share of common stock of Signature Nevada was automatically converted into one share of common stock of Signature Delaware.
