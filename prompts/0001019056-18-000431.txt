 Recent Development – Proposed Merger with TriCo Bancshares
 
As announced by the Company on December 11, 2017 and reported in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 12, 2017 (the “Current Report”), the Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization dated December 11, 2017 (the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which the Company would merge with and into TriCo Bancshares, a California corporation (“TriCo”), with TriCo being the surviving corporation. Immediately thereafter, the Company’s subsidiary bank, First National Bank of Northern California, would be merged with and into TriCo’s subsidiary bank, Tri Counties Bank. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company shareholders would receive a fixed exchange ratio of 0.9800 shares of TriCo common stock for each share of Company common stock, providing the Company shareholders with aggregate ownership on a pro forma basis of approximately 24% of the common stock of the combined company. Holders of the Company’s outstanding in-the-money stock options would receive cash, net of applicable taxes withheld, for the value of their unexercised stock options. The merger is expected to qualify as a tax-free exchange for shareholders who receive shares of TriCo common stock. The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement are expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2018, pending approvals of the Company shareholders and the TriCo shareholders, the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals, and the satisfaction of other closing conditions which are customary for such transactions. For additional information, reference should be made to the text of the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, filed as an exhibit to the Current Report, and to other information regarding TriCo and the Company, their respective businesses and the status of their proposed merger, as reported from time to time in other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

See “Competitive Data” below.
Competition
 General Competitive Factors. In order to compete with the financial institutions in their primary service areas, community banks use the flexibility that has come to define independent community banking. This includes an emphasis on service, local promotional activity and extensive use of the personal contacts of the employees, officers and directors of the Bank. The Bank’s management and employees have developed thorough a knowledge of local businesses and markets.
 Community banks also seek to provide special services and programs for individuals in their primary service area who are employed in the agricultural, professional and business fields. These services include loans for equipment, furniture and tools used in the operation and expansion of their businesses. In the event there are customers whose loan demands exceed their respective lending limits, they seek to arrange for such loans on a participation basis with other financial institutions.

Banking is a business that depends on interest rate differentials. In general, the difference between the interest rate paid by a bank to obtain their deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received by a bank on loans extended to customers and on securities held in a bank’s investment portfolio comprise the major portion of a bank’s earnings. The Bank competes with savings and loan associations, credit unions, other financial institutions and other entities for funds.
 
The interest rate differentials of a bank, and therefore its earnings, are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by statutes, as implemented by federal and state agencies. The Federal Reserve Board can and does implement national monetary policy, such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession, by its open market operations in United States government securities and adjustments to the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks from the Federal Reserve banks.
 These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits. The nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies and their impact on the Bank are not predictable.
 Competitive Data. In its market area, the Bank competes for deposit and loan customers with other banks (including those with much greater resources), thrifts and credit unions, finance companies and other financial service providers. Larger banks may have a competitive advantage because of higher lending limits and major advertising and marketing campaigns, along with significant investment banking, trust and insurance operations.
 For borrowers requiring loans in excess of the Bank’s legal lending limits, the Bank has offered, and intends to offer in the future, such loans on a participating basis with other insured financial institutions, retaining the portion of such loans which are within its legal lending limits. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank’s aggregate legal lending limit to a single borrower and such borrower’s related business interests were $19,129,000 on an unsecured basis and $31,882,000 on a fully secured basis, computed based on the Bank’s December 31, 2017 Total Risk-Based Capital of $127,528,000. The Bank’s business is concentrated in its service area, which primarily encompasses San Mateo County and Santa Clara County and the City and County of San Francisco. The economy of the Bank’s service area is dependent upon government, manufacturing, tourism, retail sales, population growth and smaller, service-oriented businesses.
 Based upon the most recent information made available by the FDIC Summary of Deposits at June 30, 2017, there were 29 commercial and savings banking institutions in San Mateo County with a total of $38,477,689,000 in deposits. The Bank had a total of 8 offices in San Mateo County with total deposits of $817,835,000 at the same date. There were 45 banking and savings institutions in the City and County of San Francisco with a total of $212,299,667,000 in deposits. The Bank had a total of 4 offices in the City and County of San Francisco with total deposits of $167,319,000. There were 45 commercial and savings banking institutions in Santa Clara County with a total of $134,865,696,000 in deposits. The Bank had one office in Santa Clara County with total deposits of $39,209,000.

SUPERVISION AND REGULATION
 General
 FNB Bancorp. The Company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Bank Holding Company Act”), and is registered as such with, and subject to supervision and regulation by, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Board of Governors”). As a registered bank holding company, the Company is required to file quarterly and annual reports with the Board of Governors, along with such additional information as the Board of Governors may require. The Company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of the California Financial Code and, as such, is subject to examination by, and may be required to file reports with, the California Department of Business Oversight.
 The common stock of the Company is subject to the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the qualification requirements of the California Corporate Securities Law of 1968, as amended. FNB Bancorp has registered its common stock under Section 12 (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The Company is also subject to the periodic reporting requirements of Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, which include, but are not limited to, annual, quarterly and other current reports required to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The common stock of the Company is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the trading symbol, “FNBG.”
 The California Corporate Disclosure Act requires publicly traded corporations incorporated or qualified to do business in California to disclose information about their past history, auditors, directors and officers. Consequently, the Company files disclosures annually with the California Secretary of State as to the name of the Company’s independent auditor, the compensation paid to each of its directors and the five most highly compensated non-director executive officers, any loans made to a director or executive officer at a “preferential” loan rate, whether any director or executive officer has been convicted of fraud or has filed in bankruptcy and any material pending legal proceedings other than ordinary routine litigation.
 The Company is required to obtain the approval of the Board of Governors before it may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank, or ownership or control of the voting shares of any bank if, after giving effect to such acquisition of shares, the Company would own or control more than 5% of the voting shares of such bank. The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits the Company from acquiring any voting shares of, or interest in, all or substantially all of the assets of a bank located outside the State of California unless such an acquisition is specifically authorized by the laws of the state in which such bank is located. Any such interstate acquisition is also subject to the provisions of the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994.
 The Company, and any non-bank subsidiary which it may acquire or organize, are deemed to be “affiliates” of the Bank within the meaning of that term as defined in the Federal Reserve Act. This means, for example, that there are limitations (a) on loans by the Bank to its affiliates, and (b) on investments by the Bank in affiliates’ stock as collateral for loans to any borrower. The Company and the Bank are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting, public sale and distribution of securities.
 In addition, regulations of the Board of Governors under the Federal Reserve Act require that reserves be maintained by the Bank in conjunction with any liability of the Company under any obligation (promissory note, acknowledgment of advance, banker’s acceptance or similar obligation) with a weighted average maturity of less than seven (7) years to the extent that the proceeds of such obligations are used for the purpose of supplying funds to the Bank for use in its banking business, or to maintain the availability of such funds.
 As provided in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, a bank holding company (such as the Company) must serve as a source of financial strength for any subsidiary of the bank holding company that is a depository institution (such as the Bank) and the federal banking agencies are directed to issue joint rules to carry out this mandate. The term “source of financial strength” means the ability to provide financial assistance to the depository institution in the event of the financial distress of the institution. See “Impact of Certain Legislation and Regulation – Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010” below.
 First National Bank of Northern California. As a national banking association licensed under the national banking laws of the United States, the Bank is regularly examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and is further subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
 This supervision and regulation includes comprehensive reviews of all major aspects of the Bank’s business and condition, including its capital ratios, allowance for possible loan losses and other factors. However, no inference should be drawn that such authorities have approved any such factors. The Bank is required to file reports with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Bank’s deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation up to the applicable legal limits.

The Company and the Bank are also subject to the applicable provisions of California law to the extent those provisions are not in conflict with or preempted by Federal banking law. This includes regulations of the California Department of Business Oversight.
 
General. Bank holding companies, such as the Company, and commercial banks, such as the Bank, are subject to extensive supervision and regulation by federal and state regulators. Various and multiple requirements and restrictions under federal and state law affect our operations, as summarized below.
 Capital Standards
 Risk-Based Capital. The Board of Governors, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for evaluating the capital adequacy of bank holding companies and banks. The guidelines were designed to make capital requirements sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banking organizations, to take into account off-balance sheet exposures and to aid in making the definition of bank capital uniform internationally. Under the risk-based guidelines and prior to amendments to the capital rules effective January 1, 2015, as described below in “Basel III - New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations,” the Company and the Bank were required to maintain capital equal to at least 8% of its assets and commitments to extend credit, weighted by risk, of which at least 4% was required to consist primarily of common equity (including retained earnings) and the remainder was to consist of subordinated debt, cumulative preferred stock, or a limited amount of loan and lease loss reserves.
 Assets, commitments to extend credit, and off-balance sheet items were categorized according to risk and certain assets considered to present less risk than others permitted maintenance of capital at less than the 8% ratio. For example, most home mortgage loans were placed in a 50% risk category and therefore required maintenance of capital equal to 4% of those loans, while commercial loans were placed in a 100% risk category and therefore required maintenance of capital equal to 8% of those loans.
 Under the risk-based capital guidelines, assets reported on an institution’s balance sheet and certain off-balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories, each of which has an assigned risk weight. Capital ratios are calculated by dividing the institution’s qualifying capital by its period-end risk-weighted assets. The guidelines established two categories of qualifying capital: Tier 1 capital (core capital including common shareholders’ equity and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock) and Tier 2 capital (supplementary capital which includes, among other items, limited life (and in the case of banks, cumulative) preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and a limited amount of reserve for credit losses. Each institution was required to maintain a minimum risk-based capital ratio (including Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital) of 8%, of which at least half was to be Tier 1 capital.
 
A leverage capital standard was adopted as a supplement to the risk-weighted capital guidelines. Under the leverage capital standard, an institution was required to maintain a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to the sum of its quarterly average total assets and quarterly average reserve for loan losses, less intangible assets not included in Tier 1 capital. Period-end assets may be used in place of quarterly average total assets on a case-by-case basis. A minimum leverage ratio was also adopted for bank holding companies as a supplement to the risk-weighted capital guidelines. The leverage ratio establishes a minimum Tier 1 ratio of 3% (Tier 1 capital to total assets) for the highest rated bank holding companies or those that have implemented the risk-based capital market risk measure. All other bank holding companies must maintain a minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% with higher leverage capital ratios required for bank holding companies that have significant financial and/or operational weakness, a high-risk profile, or are undergoing or anticipating rapid growth.
 Effective January 1, 2015, the risk-based capital regulations described above were amended to the extent described below in “Basel III - New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations.”
 Basel III – New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations. “Basel III” refers to a comprehensive set of reform measures developed by the Bank for International Settlements to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. In July 2013, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued interim final rules that revised and replaced the risk-based capital requirements (summarized above) in order to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms released by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The Basel III reforms reflected in the final rules include an increase in the risk-based capital requirements and certain changes to capital components, as well as changes to the calculation and categories of risk-weighted assets. For example, changes to risk weighted assets include increasing the original risk weight to 150% on assets past due 90 days or more or on nonaccrual, utilizing loan to value ratios in the risk weighting of mortgage loans and assigning a 150% risk weight to certain higher risk commercial real estate loans.

Effective January 1, 2015, bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $1 billion or more and banks like the Bank must comply with new minimum capital ratio requirements to be phased-in between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2019, which consist of the following: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital to total risk weighted assets ratio of 8% (unchanged); and (iv) a Tier 1 capital to adjusted average total assets (“leverage”) ratio of 4%.
 
In addition, a “capital conservation buffer” is established which when fully phased-in will require maintenance of a minimum of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to total risk weighted assets in excess of the regulatory minimum capital ratio requirements described above. The 2.5% buffer will increase the minimum capital ratios to (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new buffer requirement will be phased-in between January 1, 2016 and January 1, 2019. If the capital ratio levels of a banking organization fall below the capital conservation buffer amount, the organization will be subject to limitations on (i) the payment of dividends; (ii) discretionary bonus payments; (iii) discretionary payments under Tier 1 instruments; and (iv) engaging in share repurchases.

The federal bank regulatory agencies also implemented changes to the prompt corrective action framework, described below in “Prompt Corrective Action,” which are designed to place restrictions on insured depository institutions if their capital ratios begin to show signs of weakness. These changes took effect beginning January 1, 2015 and require insured depository institutions to meet the following increased capital ratio requirements in order to qualify as “well capitalized:” (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 10%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5%. In order to qualify as “adequately capitalized,” institutions must have (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%. See also the additional requirements of the prompt corrective action framework discussed below in “Prompt Corrective Action.”
 
Management believes that the Bank is in compliance with the minimum capital requirements, including the fully phased-in capital conservation buffer requirement, based upon its capital position at December 31, 2017. See “Capital” under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and the Results of Operations” set forth in Item 7 below and Note 19 “Regulatory Matters” in the “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” set forth in Item 8 below.

Prompt Corrective Action
 
The Board of Governors, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation have adopted regulations implementing a system of prompt corrective action pursuant to Section 38 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Section 131 of the FDIC Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”). Prior to amendments to the capital rules effective January 1, 2015, as described above in “Basel III - New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations,” the regulations established five capital categories with the following characteristics: (1) “Well capitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6% or greater and a leverage ratio of 5% or greater, and the institution is not subject to an order, written agreement, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive; (2) “Adequately capitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 4% or greater and a leverage ratio of 4% or greater, and the institution does not meet the definition of a “well capitalized” institution; (3) “Undercapitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio less than 8%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4%, or a leverage ratio of less than 4%; (4) “Significantly undercapitalized” - consisting of institutions with a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 3%, or a leverage ratio of less than 3%; (5) “Critically undercapitalized” - consisting of an institution with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2%.
 The regulations established procedures for classification of financial institutions within the capital categories, and for filing and reviewing capital restoration plans required under the regulations and procedures for issuance of directives by the appropriate regulatory agency, among other matters. The regulations imposed restrictions upon all institutions to refrain from certain actions which would cause an institution to be classified within any one of the three “undercapitalized” categories, such as declaration of dividends or other capital distributions or payment of management fees, if following the distribution or payment the institution would be classified within one of the “undercapitalized” categories. In addition, institutions which are classified in one of the three “undercapitalized” categories are subject to certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions. Mandatory supervisory actions include (1) increased monitoring and review by the appropriate federal banking agency; (2) implementation of a capital restoration plan; (3) total asset growth restrictions; and (4) limitations upon acquisitions, branch expansion, and new business activities without prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency. Discretionary supervisory actions may include (a) requirements to augment capital; (b) restrictions upon affiliate transactions; (c) restrictions upon deposit gathering activities and interest rates paid; (d) replacement of senior executive officers and directors; (e) restrictions upon activities of the institution and its affiliates; (f) requiring divestiture or sale of the institution; and (g) any other supervisory action that the appropriate federal banking agency determines is necessary to further the purposes of the regulations. Further, the federal banking agencies may not accept a capital restoration plan without determining, among other things, that the plan is based on realistic assumptions and is likely to succeed in restoring the depository institution’s capital. In addition, for a capital restoration plan to be acceptable, the depository institution’s parent holding company must guarantee that the institution will comply with such capital restoration plan. The aggregate liability of the parent holding company under the guaranty is limited to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5 percent of the depository institution’s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized, and (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such institution as of the time it fails to comply with the plan. If a depository institution fails to submit an acceptable plan, it is treated as if it were “significantly undercapitalized.” FDICIA also restricts the solicitation and acceptance of and interest rates payable on brokered deposits by insured depository institutions that are not “well capitalized.” An “undercapitalized” institution is not allowed to solicit deposits by offering rates of interest that are significantly higher than the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in the particular institution’s normal market areas or in the market areas in which such deposits would otherwise be accepted.
 Any financial institution which is classified as “critically undercapitalized” must be placed in conservatorship or receivership within ninety days of such determination unless it is also determined that some other course of action would better serve the purposes of the regulations. Critically undercapitalized institutions are also prohibited from making (but not accruing) any payment of principal or interest on subordinated debt without prior regulatory approval and regulators must prohibit a critically undercapitalized institution from taking certain other actions without prior approval, including (1) entering into any material transaction other than in the usual course of business, including investment expansion, acquisition, sale of assets or other similar actions; (2) extending credit for any highly leveraged transaction; (3) amending articles or bylaws unless required to do so to comply with any law, regulation or order; (4) making any material change in accounting methods; (5) engaging in certain affiliate transactions; (6) paying excessive compensation or bonuses; and (7) paying interest on new or renewed liabilities at rates which would increase the weighted average costs of funds beyond prevailing rates in the institution’s normal market areas.

On November 18, 2014, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation adopted the “Assessments Final Rule” which revises the FDIC’s risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to reflect changes in the regulatory capital rules, effective commencing January 1, 2015. For smaller financial institutions (with total assets less than $1 billion and which are not custodial banks), the Assessments Final Rule revised and conformed capital ratios and ratio thresholds to the new prompt corrective action capital ratios and ratio thresholds for “well capitalized” and “adequately capitalized” evaluations which were adopted by the federal banking agencies as part of the Basel III capital regulations. Consequently, effective January 1, 2015, the prompt corrective action regulations were amended to the extent described above in “Basel III – New Capital and Prompt Corrective Action Regulations.”
 
Uniform Rating System
 The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (“FFIEC”) utilizes the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System (“UFIRS”), commonly referred to as “CAMELS,” to classify and evaluate the soundness of financial institutions. Bank examiners use the CAMELS measurements to evaluate capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk.
 Effective January 1, 2005, bank holding companies such as the Company became subject to evaluation and examination under a revised bank holding company rating system.
 
The federal financial institution agencies have established bases for analysis and standards for assessing financial institution’s capital adequacy in conjunction with the risk-based and Basel III capital guidelines, including analysis of interest rate risk, concentrations of credit risk, risk posed by non-traditional activities, and factors affecting overall safety and soundness. The safety and soundness standards for insured financial institutions include analysis of (1) internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems; (2) loan documentation; (3) credit underwriting; (4) interest rate exposure; (5) asset growth; (6) compensation, fees and benefits; and (7) excessive compensation for executive officers, directors or principal shareholders which could lead to material financial loss. If an agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard, the agency may require the financial institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If the agency requires submission of a compliance plan and the institution fails to timely submit an acceptable plan or to implement an accepted plan, the agency will require the institution to correct the deficiency. The agencies may elect to initiate enforcement action in certain cases rather than rely on an existing plan, particularly where failure to meet one or more of the standards could threaten the safe and sound operation of the institution.
 
CRA Compliance
 Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) regulations evaluate banks’ lending to low and moderate income individuals and businesses across a four-point scale from “outstanding” to “substantial noncompliance,” and are a factor in regulatory review of applications to merge, establish new branches or form bank holding companies. In addition, any bank rated in “substantial noncompliance” with the CRA regulations may be subject to enforcement proceedings. The Bank has a current rating of “satisfactory” for CRA compliance.
 FDIC Insurance
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) is an independent federal agency that insures deposits of federally insured banks (such as the Bank) and savings institutions up to prescribed limits through the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”). All depository accounts of the Bank are covered by FDIC insurance up to established maximum limits (currently $250,000 per separately insured depositor). The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution for insurance coverage is based on its risk profile as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors. In 2011, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC revised the assessment rates and the deposit insurance assessment base used to calculate premiums paid to DIF. The amount of FDIC assessments paid by each DIF member institution for insurance coverage is now based on an average/total assets less average tangible equity, defined as Tier 1 capital and an institution’s risk profile as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors, with assessments ranging from 2.5 to 9 basis points for institutions in the lowest risk category to 30 to 45 basis points for those in the highest risk category.

Dividends
 
FNB Bancorp. The Company’s ability to pay cash dividends is subject to restrictions set forth in the California General Corporation Law. Funds for payment of any cash dividends by the Company could be obtained from its investments, equity sales or dividends received from the Bank. The Bank’s ability to pay cash dividends to the Company is subject to restrictions imposed under the National Bank Act and regulations promulgated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. The Company has paid cash dividends for each quarter of operations commencing with the second quarter of 2002. Future dividends will continue to be determined after consideration of the Company’s earnings, financial condition, future capital funds, regulatory requirements and other relevant factors.
 The California General Corporation Law provides that neither a corporation nor any of its subsidiaries shall make a distribution to the corporation’s shareholders unless the board of directors has determined in good faith either of the following: (1) the amount of retained earnings of the corporation immediately prior to the distribution equals or exceeds the sum of (A) the amount of the proposed distribution plus (B) the preferential dividends arrears amount; or (2) immediately after the distribution, the value of the corporation’s assets would equal or exceed the sum of its total liabilities plus the preferential rights amount. The good faith determination of the board of directors may be based upon (1) financial statements prepared on the basis of reasonable accounting practices and principles, (2) a fair valuation, or (3) any other method reasonable under the circumstances; provided, that a distribution may not be made if the corporation or subsidiary making the distribution is, or is likely to be, unable to meet its liabilities (except those whose payment is otherwise adequately provided for) as they mature. The term “preferential dividends arrears amount” means the amount, if any, of cumulative dividends in arrears on all shares having a preference with respect to payment of dividends over the class or series to which the applicable distribution is being made, provided that if the articles of incorporation provide that a distribution can be made without regard to preferential dividends arrears amount, then the preferential dividends arrears amount shall be zero. The term “preferential rights amount” means the amount that would be needed if the corporation were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution to satisfy the preferential rights, including accrued but unpaid dividends, of other shareholders upon dissolution that are superior to the rights of the shareholders receiving the distribution, provided that if the articles of incorporation provide that a distribution can be made without regard to any preferential rights, then the preferential rights amount shall be zero.
 The Board of Governors generally prohibits a bank holding company from declaring or paying a cash dividend which would impose undue pressure on the capital of subsidiary banks or would be funded only through borrowing or other arrangements that might adversely affect a bank holding company’s financial position. The Federal Reserve Board policy is that a bank holding company should not continue its existing rate of cash dividends on its common stock unless its net income is sufficient to fully fund each dividend and its prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with its capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition.
 First National Bank of Northern California. As the Bank’s sole shareholder, the Company is entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by the Bank’s Board of Directors, out of funds legally available therefore, subject to the restrictions set forth in the National Bank Act.
 The payment of cash dividends by the Bank may be subject to the approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, as well as restrictions established by federal banking law and the FDIC. Approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency is required if the total of all dividends declared by the Bank’s Board of Directors in any calendar year will exceed the Bank’s net profits for that year combined with its retained net profits for the preceding two years, less any required transfers to surplus or to a fund for the retirement of preferred stock.
 Additionally, the FDIC and/or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, might, under some circumstances, place restrictions on the ability of a bank to pay dividends.
 Impact of Certain Legislation and Regulation
 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999. The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLB Act”) eliminated most of the remaining depression-era “firewalls” between banks, securities firms and insurance companies which were established by the Banking Act of 1933, also known as the Glass-Steagall Act (“Glass-Steagall”). Glass-Steagall sought to insulate banks as depository institutions from the perceived risks of securities dealing and underwriting, and related activities. The GLB Act repealed Section 20 of Glass-Steagall, which prohibited banks from affiliating with securities firms. Bank holding companies that can qualify as “financial holding companies” can now, among other matters, acquire securities firms or create them as subsidiaries, and securities firms can now acquire banks or start banking activities through a financial holding company. The GLB Act includes provisions which permit national banks to conduct financial activities through a subsidiary that are permissible for a national bank to engage in directly, as well as certain activities authorized by statute, or that are financial in nature or incidental to financial activities to the same extent as permitted to a “financial holding company” or its affiliates. This liberalization of United States banking and financial services regulation applies both to domestic institutions and foreign institutions conducting business in the United States. Consequently, the common ownership of banks, securities firms and insurance is now possible, as is the conduct of commercial banking, merchant banking, and investment management, securities underwriting and insurance within a single financial institution using a structure authorized by the GLB Act. Neither the Company nor the Bank has determined whether or when it may seek to acquire and exercise new powers or activities under the GLB Act.

Financial holding companies are also permitted to engage in activities that are complementary to financial activities if the Board of Governors determines that the activity does not pose a substantial risk to the safety or soundness of depository institutions or the financial system in general. These standards expand upon the list of activities “closely related to banking” which have defined the permissible activities of bank holding companies under the Bank Holding Company Act. One further effect of the Act was to require that federal financial institution and securities regulatory agencies prescribe regulation to implement the policy that financial institutions must respect the privacy of their customers and protect the security and confidentiality of customers’ non-public personal information. These regulations require, in general, that financial institutions (1) may not disclose non-public information of customers to non-affiliated third parties without notice to their customers, who must have an opportunity to direct that such information not be disclosed; (2) may not disclose customer account numbers except to consumer reporting agencies; and (3) must give prior disclosure of their privacy policies before establishing new customer relationships.
 
The Patriot Act. On October 26, 2001, President Bush signed the USA Patriot Act (the “Patriot Act”), which included provisions pertaining to domestic security, surveillance procedures, border protection, and terrorism laws to be administered by the Secretary of the Treasury. Title III of the Patriot Act entitled, “International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act of 2001” includes amendments to the Bank Secrecy Act which expand the responsibilities of financial institutions in regard to anti-money laundering activities with particular emphasis upon international money laundering and terrorism financing activities through designated correspondent and private banking accounts.
 The Patriot Act contains various provisions that affect the operations of financial institutions by encouraging cooperation among financial institutions, regulatory authorities and law enforcement authorities with respect to individuals, entities and organizations engaged in, or reasonably suspected of engaging in, terrorist acts or money laundering activities. The Company and the Bank are not currently aware of any account relationships between the Bank and any foreign bank or other person or entity which would not be in compliance with the Patriot Act.
 Certain surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act expired on June 1, 2015 but were renewed the next day by the passage of the USA Freedom Act on June 2, 2015 and extended through 2019. However, the provision under which the National Security Agency (“NSA”) conducted mass phone data collection on individuals was changed to require the NSA to seek permission from a federal court in order to obtain such data from phone companies.
 The effects which the Patriot Act and any amendments to the Patriot Act or any additional legislation enacted by Congress may have upon financial institutions is uncertain; however, such legislation could increase compliance costs and thereby potentially may have an adverse effect upon the Company’s results of operations.
 Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. On July 30, 2002, President Bush signed into law the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”), legislation designed to address certain issues of corporate governance and accountability. Among other matters, key provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley include enhancement of financial disclosures and related certification requirements, rules related to audit committees, auditor independence, ethics requirements, securities trading prohibitions, securities reporting requirements, and securities listing requirements. The Company’s common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and therefore is required to comply with the Nasdaq listing standards in addition to the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley. The effect of Sarbanes-Oxley on the Company is uncertain; however, the Company has incurred, and it is anticipated that it will continue to incur costs to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley and the rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley by the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over the Company on the issuance and listing of its securities. The Company does not currently anticipate, however, that compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley and such rules and regulations will have a material effect upon its financial position or results of its operations or its cash flows.

Small Business Jobs Act of 2010. On September 27, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010 (the “SBJ Act”), which, among other matters, authorized the U.S. Treasury to buy preferred stock or subordinated debt issued by community banks with assets less than $10 billion. On September 15, 2011, as part of the Small Business Lending Fund program established under the SBJ Act, the Company issued and sold to the Secretary of the Treasury a total of 12,600 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series C (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) for a purchase price of $12,600,000. The Series C Preferred Stock qualified as Tier 1 capital. All of the $12,600,000 proceeds from the Company’s sale of its Series C Preferred Stock were immediately applied to the Company’s repurchase of outstanding shares of preferred stock which had been issued to the United States Department of the Treasury on February 27, 2009, pursuant to the TARP Capital Purchase Program authorized by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, as amended by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. On May 6, 2013, the Company redeemed 25% of the original issue $12,600,000 of Series C Preferred Stock for a cash payment of $3,150,000. Subsequently, on January 23, 2014, the remaining $9,450,000 of Series C Preferred Stock was redeemed by the Company, also in a cash transaction.
 
Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to restructure the regulation of the financial services sector by, among other things, (i) establishing a framework to identify systemic risks in the financial system implemented by a newly created Financial Stability Oversight Council and other federal banking agencies; (ii) expanding the resolution authority of the federal banking agencies over troubled financial institutions; (iii) authorizing changes to capital and liquidity requirements; (iv) changing deposit insurance assessments; and (v) enhancing regulatory supervision to improve the safety and soundness of the financial services sector. Below is a summary of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act which, directly or indirectly, may affect the Company and the Bank.
 
· | Changes to Capital Requirements. The federal banking agencies are required to establish minimum leverage and risk-based capital requirements for banks and bank holding companies which will not be lower and could be higher than established regulatory capital and leverage standards for insured depository institutions. Under these requirements, trust preferred securities will be excluded from Tier 1 capital unless such securities were issued prior to May 19, 2010 by a bank holding company with less than $15 billion in assets. The Company has no trust preferred securities outstanding. The Dodd-Frank Act requires capital increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction consistent with safety and soundness.

· | Enhanced Regulatory Supervision. The Dodd-Frank Act increases regulatory oversight, supervision and examination of banks, bank holding companies and their respective subsidiaries by the appropriate regulatory agency. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Consumer Protection. The Dodd-Frank Act created the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”) within the Federal Reserve System. The CFPB is responsible for establishing and implementing rules and regulations under various federal consumer protection laws governing certain consumer products and services. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The CFPB has primary enforcement authority over large financial institutions with assets of $10 billion or more, while smaller institutions will be subject to the CFPB’s rules and regulations through the enforcement authority of the federal banking agencies. States are permitted to adopt consumer protection laws and regulations that are more stringent than those laws and regulations adopted by the CFPB and state attorneys general are permitted to enforce consumer protection laws and regulations adopted by the CFPB. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deposit Insurance. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the deposit insurance limit for insured deposits to $250,000 per depositor and extended unlimited deposit insurance to non-interest bearing transaction accounts until December 31, 2012. Other deposit insurance changes under the Dodd-Frank Act include (i) amendment of the assessment base used to calculate an insured depository institution’s deposit insurance premiums paid to the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) by elimination of deposits and substitution of average consolidated total assets less average tangible equity during the assessment period as the revised assessment base; (ii) increasing the minimum designated reserve ratio of the DIF from 1.15% to 1.35% of the estimated amount of total insured deposits; (iii) eliminating the requirement that the FDIC pay dividends to depository institutions when the reserve ratio exceeds certain thresholds; and (iv) repeal of the prohibition upon the payment of interest on demand deposits to be effective one year after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Transactions with Affiliates. The Dodd-Frank Act enhanced the requirements for certain transactions with affiliates under Section 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, including an expansion of the definition of “covered transactions” and increasing the amount of time for which collateral requirements regarding covered transactions must be maintained. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Transactions with Insiders. Insider transaction limitations were expanded through the strengthening of loan restrictions to insiders and the expansion of the types of transactions subject to various limits, including derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, reverse repurchase agreements and securities lending or borrowing transactions. Restrictions were also placed on certain asset sales to and from an insider to an institution, including requirements that such sales be on market terms and, in certain circumstances, approved by the institution’s board of directors. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhanced Lending Limitations. The Dodd-Frank Act strengthened the existing limits on a depository institution’s credit exposure to include credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, repurchase agreements, and securities lending and borrowing transactions. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Debit Card Interchange Fees. The Dodd-Frank Act required that the amount of any interchange fee charged by a debit card issuer with respect to a debit card transaction must be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer. Within nine months of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve Board was required to establish standards for reasonable and proportional fees which may take into account the costs of preventing fraud. The restrictions on interchange fees, however, do not apply to banks that, together with their affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Interstate Branching. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized national and state banks to establish branches in other states to the same extent as a bank chartered by that state would be permitted to branch. Previously, banks could only establish branches in other states if the host state expressly permitted out-of-state banks to establish branches in that state. Accordingly, banks will be able to enter new markets more freely. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Charter Conversions. Effective one year after enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, depository institutions that are subject to a cease and desist order or certain other enforcement actions issued with respect to a significant supervisory matter were prohibited from changing their federal or state charters, except in accordance with certain notice, application and other procedures involving the applicable regulatory agencies. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Compensation Practices. The Dodd-Frank Act provided that the appropriate federal banking regulators must establish standards prohibiting as an unsafe and unsound practice any compensation plan of a bank holding company or other “covered financial institution” that provides an insider or other employee with “excessive compensation” or could lead to a material financial loss to such firm. In June 2010, prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the federal bank regulatory agencies jointly issued the Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies (“Guidance”), which requires that financial institutions establish metrics for measuring the risk to the financial institution of such loss from incentive compensation arrangements and implement policies to prohibit inappropriate risk taking that may lead to material financial loss to the institution. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Corporate Governance. The Dodd-Frank Act has enhanced corporate governance requirements to include (i) requiring publicly traded companies to give shareholders a non-binding vote on executive compensation at their first annual meeting taking place six months after the enactment and at least every three years thereafter and on so-called “golden parachute” payments in connection with approvals of mergers and acquisitions unless previously voted on by shareholders; (ii) authorizing the SEC to promulgate rules that would allow shareholders to nominate their own candidates for election as directors using a company’s proxy materials; (iii) directing the federal banking regulators to promulgate rules prohibiting excessive compensation paid to executives of depository institutions and their holding companies with assets in excess of $1.0 billion, regardless of whether or not the company is publicly traded; and (iv) authorizing the SEC to prohibit broker discretionary voting on the election of directors and on executive compensation matters.

Many of the requirements under the Dodd-Frank Act are being implemented over an extended period of time and therefore, the nature and extent of regulations that will be issued by various regulatory agencies and the impact such regulations will have on the operations of financial institutions such as the Company and the Bank is unclear. Such regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Act may impact the profitability of our business activities, require changes to certain of our business practices, impose upon us more stringent capital, liquidity and leverage ratio requirements or otherwise adversely affect our business. These changes may also require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes in order to comply with new statutory and regulatory requirements.
 
Volcker Rule. On December 10, 2013, the federal banking agencies jointly issued a final rule implementing the so-called “Volcker Rule” (set forth in Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act). The Volcker rule prohibits depository institutions, companies that control such institutions, bank holding companies, and the affiliates and subsidiaries of such banking entities, from engaging as principal for the trading account of the banking entity in any purchase or sale of one or more covered financial instruments (so-called “proprietary trading”) and imposes limitations upon retaining interests in, sponsoring, investing in and transacting with certain investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds. The effective date of the final rule restricting proprietary trading was extended to July 21, 2015, and certain other matters were extended to July 21, 2017. Neither the Company nor the Bank engages in activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule and management does not expect the Volcker Rule to have a material impact upon the Company or the Bank. 
 
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
 On December 22, 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ( the “Act”), which among other things reduced the federal corporate income tax rate to 21% effective January 1, 2018. As a result, the Company has concluded that this Act caused a reduction in the net deferred tax asset of the Company of $3 million, as of December 31, 2017, due to the revaluation of the Company’s net timing differences at the lower statutory income tax rate. The estimated fourth quarter of 2017 earnings impact was $(0.39) per average diluted share outstanding.
Future Legislation and Regulations
 
Certain legislative and regulatory proposals that could affect the Company, the Bank, and the banking business in general are periodically introduced before the United States Congress, the California State Legislature and federal and state government agencies. It is not known to what extent, if any, legislative proposals will be enacted and what effect such legislation would have on the structure, regulation and competitive relationships of financial institutions. It is likely, however, that such legislation could subject the Company and the Bank to increased regulation, disclosure and reporting requirements, more competition, and increased costs of doing business. In addition to legislative changes, the various federal and state financial institution regulatory agencies frequently propose rules and regulations to implement and enforce already existing legislation. It cannot be predicted whether or in what form any such rules or regulations will be enacted or the effect that such regulations may have on the Company and the Bank.
