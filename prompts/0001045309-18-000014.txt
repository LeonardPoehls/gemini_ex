Item 1.    BUSINESS
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
W. R. Grace & Co. is engaged in the production and sale of specialty chemicals and specialty materials on a global basis through two reportable business segments: Grace Catalysts Technologies, which includes catalysts and related products and technologies used in refining, petrochemical and other chemical manufacturing applications; and Grace Materials Technologies, which includes specialty materials, including silica-based and silica-alumina-based materials, used in coatings, consumer, industrial, and pharmaceutical applications. We entered the specialty chemicals industry in 1954, the year in which we acquired the Davison Chemical Company. Grace is the successor to a company that began in 1854 and originally became a public company in 1953. W. R. Grace & Co. is a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 7500 Grace Drive, Columbia, Maryland 21044; website is at www.grace.com; and telephone is +1 410.531.4000. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 3,700 global employees.
On January 27, 2016, Grace entered into a separation agreement with GCP Applied Technologies Inc., then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Grace ("GCP"), pursuant to which Grace agreed to transfer its Grace Construction Products operating segment and the packaging technologies business of its Grace Materials Technologies operating segment to GCP (the "Separation"). Grace and GCP completed the Separation on February 3, 2016 (the "Distribution Date"), by means of a pro rata distribution to the Company's stockholders of all of the outstanding shares of GCP common stock (the "Distribution"), with one share of GCP common stock distributed for each share of Company common stock held as of the close of business on January 27, 2016. As a result of the Distribution, GCP became an independent public company. GCP’s historical financial results through the Distribution Date are reflected in Grace’s Consolidated Financial Statements as discontinued operations.
On June 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the assets of the BASF Polyolefin Catalysts business (the "polyolefin catalysts acquisition"), which included technologies, patents, trademarks, and production plants in Pasadena, Texas, and Tarragona, Spain, for a purchase price of $250.6 million. We added the following technologies to our catalysts portfolio: (1) LYNX® high-activity polyethylene ("PE") catalyst technologies used commercially in slurry processes for the production of high-density PE resins such as bimodal film and pipe, and (2) LYNX® polypropylene ("PP") catalyst technologies used commercially in all major PP process technologies including slurry, bulk loop, stirred gas, fluid gas, and stirred bulk. The acquisition also provided us with significant additional flexibility and capacity for our global polyolefin catalysts manufacturing network.
In 2016, we exited certain Grace Materials Technologies product lines, as these product lines no longer fit into our strategic growth plans. We sold certain of these assets to unaffiliated buyers for aggregate proceeds of $12.9 million.
On February 3, 2014, Grace concluded a voluntary reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, when the joint plan of reorganization (the "Joint Plan") filed by Grace and certain other parties became effective.
On December 14, 2017, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the polyolefin catalysts business of Albemarle Corporation for $416 million, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. This acquisition would be complementary to our Specialty Catalysts business and would strengthen our catalysts technology portfolio, commercial relationships, and manufacturing network.
Grace Catalysts Technologies produces and sells catalysts and related products and technologies used in refining, petrochemical and other chemical manufacturing applications, as follows:

• | Fluid catalytic cracking catalysts - also called FCC catalysts, that help to "crack" the hydrocarbon chain in distilled crude oil to produce transportation fuels, such as gasoline and diesel fuels, and other petroleum-based products; FCC additives used to reduce sulfur in gasoline, maximize propylene production from refinery FCC units, and reduce emissions of sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides and carbon monoxide from refinery FCC units; and Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) catalysts, used to convert methanol, often derived from coal, into petrochemical feeds such as ethylene and propylene.

PRODUCTS AND MARKETS
Specialty Chemicals and Materials Industry Overview
Specialty chemicals and specialty materials are high value-added products used as catalysts, intermediates, components, protectants or additives in a wide variety of products and applications. They are generally produced in relatively small volumes (compared with commodity chemicals) and must satisfy well-defined performance requirements and specifications. Specialty chemicals and specialty materials are often critical components of end products, catalysts for the production of end products, and components used in end products. Consequently, they are tailored to meet customer needs, which generally results in close relationships with our customers.
We focus our business on the following, which we believe are important competitive factors in the specialty chemicals and specialty materials industry:

• | value-added products, technologies and services, sold at competitive prices;


• | customer service, including rapid response to changing customer needs;


• | technological leadership (resulting from investment in research and development and technical customer service); and


• | quality and reliability of product and supply.

We believe that our focus on these competitive factors enables us to deliver significant value to customers at competitive prices and operating margins notwithstanding the increased customer service and research and development costs that this commitment entails.

Grace Catalysts Technologies—Refining Catalysts
FCC Catalysts 
We are a global leader in developing and manufacturing fluid catalytic cracking, or FCC, catalysts and additives that are designed to enable petroleum refiners to increase profits by improving product yields, value and quality. Our FCC products also enable refiners to reduce emissions from their FCC units and reduce sulfur content in the transportation fuels they produce. Oil refining is a highly specialized discipline and FCC catalysts must be tailored to meet local variations in crude oil feedstocks and a refinery's product mix. We work regularly with our customers to identify the most appropriate catalyst and additive formulations for their changing needs.
Since our customers are refiners, our business is highly dependent on the economics of the petroleum refining industry. In particular, demand for our FCC products is affected by refinery throughput, the type and quality of refinery feedstocks, and the demand for transportation fuels and other refinery products, for example petrochemical feeds such as propylene.
In general, as a refinery utilizes more of its FCC unit capacity, it needs a greater amount of FCC catalyst. Refinery throughput, or the extent to which refiners utilize their available FCC capacity, is generally determined by demand for transportation fuels and petrochemical products and the availability of crude oil supply. In recent years, global economic growth, especially in emerging regions, has increased global demand for transportation fuels and petrochemical products. Retail gasoline and diesel fuel prices and the level of economic activity has also directly influenced transportation fuel demand. Improvements in vehicular fuel economy, as well as consumer trends and government policies that increase the use of non-petroleum-based fuels and/or decrease the use of petroleum-based fuels also will affect transportation fuel demand over time.
Refinery crude oil feedstocks vary in quality from light and sweet to heavy and sour. Light and sweet feedstocks are typically more expensive than heavy and sour feedstocks and yield a greater proportion of high-value petroleum products. They also yield a lower proportion of residual oil, or "resid," which is generally the lowest value component contained in crude oil. Although heavy and sour feedstocks with high resid content are typically less expensive than higher quality feedstocks, the processing of high-resid feedstocks is more difficult because these feedstocks have more impurities and higher boiling points. Heavy and sour crude oil has a relatively high level of metals, nitrogen and sulfur contamination. Our customers generally determine the feedstocks to be used in their refineries based on relative pricing and availability of various quality feedstocks. Refinery configuration and complexity also plays a role in feedstock selection; more complex refineries tend to process a higher proportion of heavy and sour feedstocks. In general, as a refinery uses more heavy and sour feedstocks, it uses a greater amount of FCC catalyst. In addition, refiners use special high value-added formulations of FCC catalysts for efficient refining of heavy and sour feedstocks. We have designed our MIDAS® catalyst, IMPACT® catalyst, NEKTOR™ catalyst, and GENESIS® catalyst product portfolios to enable our customers to increase the efficiency and yield of high-resid feedstock refining.
Many countries and regions, including the U.S., European Union, Japan, Russia, India and China have imposed regulatory limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuel. We have developed a portfolio of products designed to assist refiners in meeting their gasoline sulfur-reduction targets, including our D-PRISM® and GSR® additives and our SURCA® catalyst family.

Within certain limits, refiners have the ability to adjust their relative output of transportation fuels versus petrochemical feeds. Global economic growth, especially in emerging regions, has increased the demand for plastics at a faster rate than growth of transportation fuels. As a result, some of our refinery customers have sought increased profits from petrochemicals by increasing the yield of petrochemical feeds such as propylene from their FCC units. Our ZSM-5-based technologies, including our OLEFINSULTRA® additive products, are designed to maximize the propylene and butylene output of FCC units.
Many U.S. petroleum refiners have entered into consent decrees with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") under which the refiners have agreed to reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides. The European Union has also imposed requirements on refineries with respect to nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides emissions. FCC units are generally the largest emitters of these pollutants in a refinery. Our additives are designed to assist refineries in meeting their obligations to reduce these pollutants. Our Super DESOX® additive reduces sulfur oxides emissions from commercial FCC units. Our DENOX® additives are designed to achieve reductions in nitrogen oxides emissions comparable to those obtained from capital intensive alternatives available to a refinery, while our non-platinum-based combustion promoters XNOX® and CP®P are designed to enable refiners to control carbon monoxide emissions without increasing nitrogen oxides.
Competition in FCC catalysts and additives is based on value delivered to refiners, which is derived from differentiated technology, catalyst performance, technical and customer service and price. Our principal global FCC catalyst competitors are Albemarle, BASF, and SINOPEC. Our principal global competitors in FCC additives are Johnson Matthey, Albemarle, and BASF. We also have multiple regional competitors for FCC catalysts and additives.
An emerging market is developing for the conversion of methanol, either derived from coal gasification or from natural gas, into petrochemical feeds such as ethylene and propylene. This technology, known as Methanol-to-Olefins, or MTO, has created the need for an FCC-like catalyst for use in this processing unit. A number of MTO units have been constructed and are operating in China, with additional units in the planning and construction phases. Our MTO catalyst, GCQ™, was introduced in 2016 and has been used successfully in a number of customer MTO units. Competition is based on catalyst performance, technical service and price. Our primary competitors are UOP and Chia Tai.
Hydroprocessing Catalysts
We market hydroprocessing catalysts primarily through ART, our joint venture with Chevron. We established ART to combine our technology with that of Chevron and to develop, market and sell hydroprocessing catalysts to customers in the petroleum refining industry worldwide.
We are a leading supplier of hydroprocessing catalysts designed for processing high resid content feedstocks. We offer products for fixed-bed resid hydrotreating, on-stream catalyst replacement and ebullating-bed resid hydrocracking processes.
We also offer a full line of catalysts, customized for individual refiners, used in distillate hydrotreating to produce ultra-low sulfur content gasoline and diesel fuel, including our SMART CATALYST SYSTEM® and APART® catalyst systems. As discussed above, regulatory limitations on the sulfur content of gasoline and diesel fuel are becoming more common. These products are designed to help refiners to reduce the sulfur content of their products.
We have rights to sell hydrocracking and lubes hydroprocessing catalysts to licensees of Chevron Lummus Global (CLG) and other petroleum refiners for unit refills. These rights allow us to streamline hydroprocessing catalyst supply and improve technical service for refining customers by establishing ART as their single point of contact for all their hydroprocessing catalyst needs.
Competition in the hydroprocessing catalyst industry is based on value delivered to refiners, which is based on differentiated technology, catalyst performance, technical and customer service and price. Criterion, Albemarle, Haldor Topsoe, UOP and Axens are our leading global competitors in hydroprocessing catalysts. We also have multiple regional competitors.

We use a combination of proprietary catalyst and support technology and technology licensed from third parties to provide unique catalyst-based solutions to our customers and to provide a broad technology portfolio for enhancing collaboration opportunities with technology leaders.
Our MAGNAPORE® polymerization catalyst is used to produce high performance polyethylene in the slurry loop process for pipe and film applications. We offer our LYNX® catalysts systems for the production of high-density polyethylene resins, such as bimodal film and pipe, as well as commercial use for the production of polypropylene in all major process technologies including slurry, bulk loop, stirred gas, fluid gas, and stirred bulk. Our CONSISTA® 6th generation, non-phthalate catalysts are used to produce polypropylene resins that exhibit enhanced clarity, stiffness, and impact strength. Our POLYTRAK® polymerization catalyst is designed to achieve improved polypropylene performance, particularly for impact resistant applications such as automobile bumpers and household appliances.
Our standard and customized DAVICAT® catalysts offer a wide range of chemical and physical properties based on our material science technology for supported catalysts, polystyrene, herbicide, nutraceuticals and on-purpose olefins. Our RANEY® nickel, cobalt and copper hydrogenation and dehydrogenation catalysts are used for the synthesis of organic compounds for the fibers, polyurethanes, engineered plastics, pharmaceuticals, sweeteners and petroleum industries.
The polyolefin catalyst and supports industry is technology-intensive, and suppliers must provide products formulated to meet customer specifications. There are many manufacturers of polyolefin catalysts and supports including Univation, LyondellBasell, Albemarle and PQ, and most sell their products worldwide.
We are also a leading licensor of gas-phase polypropylene process technology to polypropylene manufacturers. Our UNIPOL® polypropylene technology is designed to have fewer moving parts and require less equipment than other competing technologies in order to reduce operating costs. This technology provides our licensees with a flexible and reliable capability to manufacture products for a broad array of end-use applications. The polypropylene process licensing industry is technology-intensive, and licensors must adapt the technology and the related licenses to meet individual customer needs. The major competing polypropylene process licensors are LyondellBasell and Lummus Novolen Technology.
Grace Catalysts Technologies—Manufacturing, Marketing and Raw Materials
Our Catalysts Technologies products are manufactured by a network of globally coordinated plants. Our integrated planning organization is responsible for the effective utilization of our manufacturing capabilities.
We use a global organization of technical professionals with extensive experience in refining processes, catalyst development, and catalyst applications to market our refining catalysts and additives. These professionals work to tailor our technology to the needs of each specific customer. We generally negotiate prices for our refining catalysts because our formulations are specific to the needs of each customer and each customer receives individual attention and technical service. We sell a significant portion of our hydroprocessing catalysts through multiple-year supply agreements with our geographically diverse customer base.
We use a global direct sales force for our polyolefin catalysts, supports and technologies and chemical catalysts that seeks to maintain close working relationships with our customers. These relationships enable us to cooperate with major polymer and chemical producers to develop catalyst technologies that complement their process or application developments. We have geographically distributed our sales and technical service professionals to make them responsive to the needs of our geographically diverse customers. We typically operate under long-term contracts with our customers.
Seasonality does not have a significant overall effect on our Catalysts Technologies reportable segment. However, sales of FCC catalysts tend to be lower in the first calendar quarter due to maintenance outages taken 
6

prior to the shift in production by refineries from home heating oil for the winter season to gasoline production for the summer season. FCC catalysts and ebullating-bed hydroprocessing catalysts are consumed at a relatively steady rate and are replaced regularly. Fixed-bed hydroprocessing catalysts are consumed over a period of years and are replaced in bulk in an irregular pattern. Since our customers periodically shut down their refining processes to replace fixed-bed hydroprocessing catalysts in bulk, our hydroprocessing catalyst sales to any customer can vary substantially over the course of a year and between years based on that customer's catalyst replacement schedule.
The principal raw materials for Catalysts Technologies products include molybdenum oxide, zeolite, caustic soda, sodium aluminate, sodium silicate, aluminum sulfate, nickel, alumina hydrate, alumina, aluminum metal, rare earths, and tungsten salt. Multiple suppliers are generally available for each of these materials; however, some of our raw materials may be provided by single sources of supply. We seek to mitigate the risk of using single source suppliers by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers or, for unique materials, by using alternative formulations from other suppliers or by passing price increases on to customers. In some instances, we produce our own raw materials and intermediates.
Prices for many of our raw materials, including metals, and energy can be volatile. In response to increases in raw material and energy costs, we generally take actions to mitigate the effect of higher costs including increasing prices, developing alternative formulations for our products, increasing productivity, and hedging purchases of certain raw materials.
As in many chemical businesses, we consume significant quantities of natural gas in the production of Catalysts Technologies products. World events and other economic factors cause volatility in the price of natural gas. Increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas and raw materials can have a significant impact on our operating margins. We have implemented a risk management program under which we hedge natural gas in a way that is designed to provide protection against price volatility.

To ensure full geographic coverage, our direct sales organization is further supplemented by a network of distributors and agents.
Seasonality does not have a significant overall effect on our Materials Technologies reportable segment; however, our adsorbents for dual frame windows are affected by seasonal and weather-related factors and the level of construction activity, and our edible oil refining agents, stabilizers and clarification aids for beer, juices and other beverages are affected by the level of consumption of beverages. These impacts are mitigated by the global scope of our business.
The principal raw materials for Materials Technologies products include sodium silicate, zeolite, soda ash, sulfuric acid, and caustic soda. Multiple suppliers are generally available for each of these materials; however, some of our raw materials may be provided by single sources of supply. We seek to mitigate the risk of using single source suppliers by identifying and qualifying alternative suppliers or, for unique materials, by using alternative formulations from other suppliers or by passing price increases on to customers. In some instances, we produce our own raw materials and intermediates.
Prices for many of our raw materials and energy can be volatile. In response to increases in raw material and energy costs, we generally take actions intended to mitigate the effect of higher costs including increasing prices, developing alternative formulations for our products, and increasing productivity.
As in many chemical businesses, we consume significant quantities of natural gas in the production of Materials Technologies products. World events and other economic factors can cause volatility in the price of natural gas. Increases or decreases in the cost of natural gas and raw materials can have a significant impact on our operating margins. We have implemented a risk management program under which we hedge natural gas in a way that is intended to provide protection against price volatility.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; RESEARCH ACTIVITIES
Competition in the specialty chemicals and specialty materials industry is often based on technological superiority and innovation. Our ability to maintain our margins and effectively compete with other suppliers depends on our ability to introduce new products based on innovative technology, as well as our ability to obtain patent or other intellectual property protection. Our research and development programs emphasize development of new products and processes, improvement of existing products and processes and application of existing products and processes to new industries and uses. Most research activity is conducted in North America and Europe.
We routinely file and obtain patents in a number of countries around the world that are significant to our businesses in order to protect our investments in innovation, research, and product development. Numerous patents and patent applications protect our products, formulations, manufacturing processes, equipment, and improvements. We also benefit from the use of trade secret information, including know-how and other proprietary information relating to many of our products and processing technologies. There can be no assurance, however, that our patents, patent applications and precautions to protect trade secrets and know-how will provide sufficient protection for our intellectual property. In addition, other companies may independently develop technology that could replicate, and thus diminish the advantage provided by, our trade secrets. Other companies may also develop alternative technology or design-arounds that could circumvent our patents or may acquire patent rights applicable to our business which might interpose a limitation on expansion of our business in the future.
Research and development expenses were approximately $54 million, $49 million, and $47 million in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. These amounts include depreciation and amortization expenses related to research and development assets and expenses incurred in funding external research projects. The amount of research and development expenses relating to government- and customer-sponsored projects (rather than projects that we sponsor) was not material during these periods. Grace also conducts research and development activities with our ART joint venture, which are not included in the amounts above.
ENVIRONMENT, HEALTH AND SAFETY MATTERS
We are subject, along with other manufacturers of specialty chemicals, to stringent regulations under numerous regional, national, provincial, state and local environment, health and safety laws and regulations relating to the manufacture, storage, handling, disposal and stewardship of chemicals and other materials. Environmental laws require that certain responsible parties, as defined in the relevant statute, fund remediation actions regardless of legality of original disposal or ownership of a disposal site. We are involved in various response actions to address the presence of chemical substances as required by applicable laws. 
We have expended substantial funds to comply with environmental laws and regulations and expect to continue to do so in the future. The following table sets forth our expenditures in the past three years, and our estimated expenditures in 2018 and 2019, for (i) the operation and maintenance of manufacturing facilities and the disposal of wastes; (ii) capital expenditures for environmental control facilities; and (iii) site remediation:

(1) | Amounts are based on environmental response matters for which sufficient information is available to estimate costs. We do not have sufficient information to estimate all of Grace's possible future environmental response costs. As we receive new information, our estimate of such costs may change materially.

Additional information about our environmental remediation activities is provided in this Report in Item 8 (Financial Statements and Supplementary Data) in the Financial Supplement under Note 10 (Commitments and Contingent Liabilities) to the Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
We continuously seek to improve our environment, health and safety performance. To the extent applicable, we extend the basic elements of the American Chemistry Council's RESPONSIBLE CARE® program to all our locations worldwide, embracing specific performance objectives in the key areas of management systems, product stewardship, employee health and safety, community awareness and emergency response, distribution, process safety and pollution prevention. We have implemented the RESPONSIBLE CARE® Security Code through a company-wide security program focused on the security of our people, processes, and systems. We have reviewed existing security (including cybersecurity) vulnerability and taken actions to enhance security systems where deemed necessary. In addition, we are complying with the Department of Homeland Security’s Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, including identifying facilities subject to the standards, conducting security vulnerability assessments and developing site security plans, as necessary.
EMPLOYEE RELATIONS
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 3,700 persons, of whom approximately 1,900 were employed in the United States and approximately 1,000 were employed in Germany. Of our total employees, approximately 2,200 were salaried and 1,500 were hourly.
Approximately 640 of our manufacturing employees in the United States are represented by unions. We have operated without a labor work stoppage for more than 10 years. We have works councils representing the majority of our European sites serving approximately 1,100 employees.
