Reverse Stock-Split
 
On April 12, 2017, the Company announced a reverse stock split of its shares of common stock at a ratio of 1-for-20. Beginning with the opening of trading on April 13, 2017, the common stock began trading on a post-split basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market ("NASDAQ"). All share and per share amounts in this Form 10-K have been reflected on a post-split basis.
 
Business Strategy
 
The Company’s core business strategy is to build a portfolio of novel immunotherapies and compounds with the potential to treat or prevent severe inflammatory diseases in dermatology, gastroenterology and cancer, develop each compound to pre-determined milestones, and license the compounds to pharmaceutical companies for advanced development and commercialization. The Company intends to obtain revenues from licensing fees, milestone payments, development fees, royalties and/or sales related to the use of our drug candidates or intellectual property for specific therapeutic indications or applications.
 
In April 2017, the Company announced a corporate restructuring with the objective of prioritizing and segregating its research and development efforts on a focused set of products in inflammatory disease and dermatology and strengthening its financial position. Under this strategy, the Company intends to focus its business on immuno-inflammation in general, and immuno-dermatology in particular, by developing its core asset, bertilimumab, and by developing topical nano-cyclosporine for the treatment of atopic dermatitis and moderate psoriasis. The Company will continue to consider the optimal path forward for its pain programs, AmiKet and LidoPAIN.
 
The Company intends to segregate its oncology business into its subsidiary, Cytovia, Inc. (“Cytovia”) and pursue a possible spin-off of Cytovia into a separate, stand-alone company. Cytovia will focus on the development and commercialization of novel immuno-oncology and hematology therapeutics, led by Ceplene, Azixa, crolibulin and the Company’s bispecific antibody platform. Additionally, Cytovia may seek to acquire commercial stage drugs in the field of immuno-oncology.
 
Products and Programs 
 
Bertilimumab

The Company’s lead product candidate, bertilimumab, is a first-in-class, humanized monoclonal antibody that targets eotaxin-1, a specific chemokine that plays a role in both innate and adaptive immune responses and modulates the cross-talk between key cells involved in inflammation. Chemokines are low molecular weight molecules that have been shown as important chemical attractants of inflammatory cells to sites of inflammation and infection.
 
Eotaxin-1 has been shown to be highly specific for eosinophils, which are inflammatory cells that play a central role in the pathogenesis of allergic airway diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, skin conditions and potentially in many other conditions. Eotaxin-1 has been validated as a bio-marker of disease severity and a therapeutic target for several inflammatory diseases, including Bullous Pemphigoid (“BP”), Ulcerative Colitis, Crohn's Disease, Severe Atopic Dermatitis, non-alcoholic steato-hepatitis ("NASH") and severe eosinophilic asthma. Recently, eotaxin-1 has been proposed as a therapeutic target for these conditions.
 
Bertilimumab is a novel personalized therapy that targets and lowers eotaxin-1 levels in many inflammatory conditions. By neutralizing eotaxin-1, bertilimumab may prevent the migration of eosinophils, thus helping to relieve inflammatory conditions associated with eotaxin-1. Bertilimumab is being studied to for improvement in outcomes for patients with diseases that either do not have therapies or where the therapies have severe limitations.
 
Bertilimumab and Bullous Pemphigoid (“BP”)
 
Published studies have demonstrated that eotaxin-1 levels are significantly increased both in serum and blister fluid in patients with BP and these elevated levels correlate with disease severity. Bertilimumab may prevent eotaxin-1-induced chemotaxis of eosinophils and neutralize eotaxin-1 in the circulation, preventing eosinophil migration. Hence, bertilimumab has the potential to eliminate the eotaxin-1 positive feedback loop which is responsible for the recruitment of both eosinophils and Th2 cells to the site of inflammation in BP.

In preclinical studies, bertilimumab was shown to be safe and well tolerated in primates. In a Phase I clinical study consisting of a single administration to healthy volunteers, bertilimumab demonstrated excellent safety and tolerability (no significant adverse events and no anti- bertilimumab antibodies) and high affinity and specificity for human eotaxin-1. The drug proved to be highly selective, with rapid and lasting biological activity.
 
In July 2015, the Company initiated planning for a Phase II study, IMNP BP-01, Evaluation of Safety, Efficacy and Pharmacodynamic Effect of Bertilimumab in Patients with Bullous Pemphigoid, at clinical sites in Israel. Study initiation refers to the training of hospital staff to allow for patient screening and immediate patient enrollment into the clinical trial upon selection. Screening began in February 2016.
 
In October 2015, the Company submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (“IND”) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) to allow recruitment of patients for the IMNP BP-01 study at sites in the United States. In November 2015, the Company obtained clearance of its IND application from the FDA.
 
The bertilimumab Phase II BP clinical trial is designed to recruit 10-15 adults, newly diagnosed with moderate to extensive BP. Primary end points include safety and efficacy, measured by a reduction in clinical symptoms and tapering down of systemic corticosteroids.
 
In March 2017, Pr. Neil Korman, Director, Clinical Trials Unit, UH Cleveland Medical Center; Director, Murdough Family Center for Psoriasis, UH Cleveland Medical Center; Professor, Dermatology, CWRU School of Medicine, and member of the Company’s Scientific Advisory Board, presented preliminary data with bertilimumab from the IMNP BP-01 study at the American Academy of Dermatology 2017 Annual Meeting in Orlando, Florida. The Bullous Pemphigoid Disease Activity Index ("BPDAI") measured in the patients who completed the study was reduced by an average of 84%. Oral prednisone was tapered down to 10mg or less. No significant adverse events were reported. Based on these preliminary results, the Company submitted a request for orphan drug designation for bertilimumab in BP. Also, based on these encouraging results as well as petitions by investigators, plans were initiated to expand the study population to include patients previously diagnosed with BP who are on corticosteroids and who cannot be successfully tapered (so-called taper resistant patients) to evaluate symptomatic improvement and reduction in the use of steroids.
 
Set forth below is a summary of the ongoing study:

Bertilimumab and Ulcerative Colitis (“UC”)
 
In June 2015, the Company initiated a Phase II study, IMNP UC-01, Evaluation of Safety, Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic of Bertilimumab in Patients with Active Moderate to Severe Ulcerative Colitis, at clinical sites in Israel. In 2016, the Company expanded the study to clinical sites in Russia.
 
IMNP UC-01 is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multi-center study, seeking to enroll 42 adult patients with active moderate to severe UC. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups, bertilimumab 10 mg/kg or matching placebo, respectively. The study consists of three periods: a screening period of up to 2 weeks, an open-label treatment period lasting 4 weeks consisting of IV infusion of bertilimumab on Days 0 and 14 and 28, and a safety and efficacy follow-up period of approximately 8 weeks. Primary end points are safety and efficacy, measured by a reduction in the Mayo Clinic Ulcerative Colitis Disease Index at 8 weeks. Secondary end points include assessment of mucosal injury and clinical remission. Patients are selected based on Mayo score and high levels of tissue eotaxin-1 as well as other standardized clinical criteria. The study is being conducted in 6 sites in Israel and 6 sites in Russia, all actively recruiting.
 
The Company is considering expanding the bertilimumab clinical development program to include severe atopic dermatitis (“AD”). Also, the Company plan to conduct preclinical studies to determine the application of bertilimumab as a possible therapeutic agent for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”).
 
The Company believes that if successfully developed and approved by the FDA, bertilimumab could address large underserved markets with limited treatment alternatives, such as BP, an orphan indication, UC, severe AD, and NASH. The Company’s current strategy is to enter into a strategic partnership with a large pharmaceutical or biotechnology company to support and accelerate the development of bertilimumab and maximize its commercial potential.
 
NanoCyclo
 
In January 2016, the Company entered into a worldwide exclusive licensing agreement with BioNanoSim Ltd., an Israeli company led by Professor Simon Benita, former Head of the Drug Research Institute at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, for the development of a topical nano-capsule formulation of cyclosporine. NanoCyclo is the first stable formulation to leverage nanotechnology to ensure local dermal penetration of and minimize systemic exposure to cyclosporine, a drug used orally for the treatment of psoriasis and AD. NanoCylco has the possibility of development under a 505(b)2 regulatory submission, which is typically a faster process than the traditional 505(b)1 regulatory submission required for new chemical entities, and may successfully address the multi-billion dollar AD and psoriasis markets.
 
Immuno-Oncology
 
The Company's immuno-oncology programs include the following:
 
Ceplene

Ceplene (histamine dihydrochloride), the Company’s lead oncology product candidate, is a first-in-class, small molecule, targeting the Histamine-2 Receptor, to be used in conjunction with low dose Interluken-2 (“IL-2”) as a means to overcome immunosuppression in AML and potentially other malignancies. Ceplene is designed to suppress tumor growth by inhibiting NOX-2, in turn inhibiting macrophage and leukemic cell ROS production, allowing IL-2 activation of Natural Killer (“NK”) cells and T cytotoxic cells (“T cells”) with consequent leukemic cell death. The Company acquired the rights to Ceplene in the U.S. and Israel in the 2013 Merger. Swedish-based Meda Pharmaceuticals own the rights to Ceplene in the rest of the world. Ceplene is approved for marketing in Europe and Israel and has been granted orphan drug status in the United States and European Union.
 
Ceplene functions in AML by reducing the immunosuppressive effects of reactive oxygen species on T cells and NK cells, permitting their effective activation by IL-2 in order to eliminate residual leukemic cells in patients who are in clinical complete remission. Data from a European Phase IV study, presented by researchers from the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden in an abstract at the American Association of Cancer Research Annual Meeting in April 2016 demonstrated that Ceplene/IL-2 treatment is highly efficacious in monocytic forms of AML (FAB M4/M5). The Company’s current research is focused on delineating the value of combining Ceplene with immune checkpoint inhibitors, which may pave the way for future trials and label expansion.
 
The Company has received guidance from the FDA and plans to finalize a Phase III protocol for a single pivotal Overall Survival study, supporting a new drug application in the U.S. for Ceplene in remission maintenance in AML. The study will compare Ceplene in combination with low dose Proleukin® (IL-2) vs placebo with low dose Proleukin. The primary end point is Overall Survival at 2 years with a secondary end point of Leukemia Free survival (LFS). An independent interim analysis will be conducted at one year for both futility, and to assess the one year efficacy based on Event Free Survival (EFS), with an opportunity for accelerated approval based on positive results.

In April 2017, the Company signed a letter of intent with Pint Pharma GmnH (“Pint”), a pharmaceutical company focused on Latin America and other markets, which binds the parties to seek agreement regarding an exclusive license by Pint of the rights to commercialize Ceplene throughout Latin America, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Mexico. Pursuant to the anticipated final agreement, Pint will be responsible for registration of Ceplene in Latin American countries based on the existing European marketing authorization and will carry out the full commercialization of the licensed product in the territory, including Ceplene registration, pricing and reimbursement, and sales and marketing activities. In conjunction with the anticipated final agreement, Pint will make an investment of $4.0 million into the Company’s oncology subsidiary, Cytovia, Inc. to be used by Cytovia exclusively for oncology related activities.
 
Crolibulin
 
Crolibulin is a novel small molecule VDA and apoptosis inducer for the treatment of patients with solid tumors and is a novel microtubule destabilizer that is selective for pathologic vasculature. Crolibulin has shown promising vascular targeting activity with potent anti-tumor activity in preclinical in vitro and in vivo studies and in a Phase I clinical trial conducted in part by the National Cancer Research Institute and the Company. The molecule has been shown to induce tumor cell apoptosis and selectively inhibit growth of proliferating cell lines, including multi-drug resistant cell lines. Murine models of human tumor xenografts demonstrated crolibulin inhibits growth of established tumors of a number of different cancer types. In preclinical animal tumor models, combination therapy has demonstrated synergistic activity with cytotoxic drugs as well as anti-angiogenic drugs. This may support further development of crolibulin by the Company or with a partner in a variety of cancers other than anaplastic thyroid cancer, including but not limited to refractory ovarian cancer and neuro-endocrine tumors.
Azixa
 
Azixa (verubulin) is a Phase II novel microtubular destabilizer that functions as a VDA. It evades multidrug resistance pumps, thus crossing the blood-brain-barrier and achieving high central nervous system concentrations. In Phase I and II clinical trials in glioblastoma multiforme (“GBM”), evidence of objective response was seen, including in patients who had failed previous bevacizumab (Avastin) therapy. Scientists in the field of angiogenesis have suggested that the combination of anti-angiogenic and VDAs may be synergistic by both disrupting existing tumor vessels and inhibiting the formation of new vessels simultaneously. The Company is continuing preclinical work studying the potential advantages of combining Azixa with immune checkpoint inhibitors. If the results of these studies warrant further investigation, the Company may plan further clinical studies for GBM as well as other solid tumors. Azixa has orphan drug status for GBM in the United States.
 
NanomAbs
 
NanomAbs is an antibody-drug conjugate platform that allows the targeted delivery of combinations of chemotherapeutics into cancer cells. NanomAbs is potentially capable of generating novel drugs with enhanced profiles as compared to stand-alone antibodies. The technology conjugates monoclonal antibodies to drug loaded nanoparticles to target drugs to specific cells. NanomAbs selectively accumulates in diseased tissues and cells, resulting in higher drug accumulation at the site of action with minimal off-target exposure. The Company plans to build a pipeline of NanomAbs for the treatment of cancer and may seek to enter into collaborative agreements with other companies to acquire complementary drugs or technologies to potentially accelerate the development of NanomAbs product candidates.
 
Bispecific Antibodies
 
In December 2015, the Company published data regarding a novel bispecific antibody in a poster presentation at the IBC Life Sciences Antibody Engineering & Therapeutics Conference in San Diego, California. The Company’s poster presentation was titled "Design and Validation of a Novel Tetravalent IgG1-like Bispecific Antibody Format". In this publication, the Company described positive study results with this novel platform for the production of tetravalent IgG1-like bispecific antibodies. The prototype bispecific antibody retained effector functions and mediated redirect killing of target cells by cytokine induced killer T cells demonstrating direct anti-cancer effects in vitro as well as anti-tumor activity and improved survival in a mouse xenograft model of disseminated leukemia. The Company believes that this newly developed platform may be used to generate novel bispecific antibodies against immune-oncology targets. This work was developed by a collaborative European consortium and funded by a European grant.

Pain
 
AmiKet / AmiKet Nano
 
AmiKet is a prescription topical analgesic cream containing a formulation of two FDA approved drugs: amitriptyline, which is a widely-used antidepressant often used in chronic pain disorders; and ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (“NMDA”) antagonist that is used as an intravenous anesthetic. AmiKet has completed Phase I and II clinical trials involving 1,700 patients for the treatment of neuropathic pain. In 2010, the FDA granted AmiKet orphan drug status for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia (“PHN”). A PHN Phase III clinical trial has been designed on the basis of two statistically significant Phase II clinical trials, including one trial which has shown comparable efficacy of Amiket and oral gabapentin. In addition to PHN, Amiket may be developed for the treatment of diabetic neuropathic pain and for the treatment of chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain.
 
The Company is considering developing a new improved formulation of the product utilizing nano-particle technology licensed from Yissum Research Development Company, the technology transfer company of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Ltd. (“Yissum”). 
 
In October 2016, the Company entered into a consulting agreement with Joseph V. Pergolizzi Jr., MD to form an operational management team, a scientific advisory board, and a board of directors for Maxim Pharmaceuticals, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary that holds the rights to AmiKet, AmiKet Nano, and LidoPAIN. In March 2017, the Company and Dr. Pergolizzi agreed to terminate the consulting agreement.
 
The Company is assessing strategic alternatives for this non-core asset.

In April 2014, the Company entered into a Waiver and Amendment to the license agreement pursuant to which Dalhousie agreed to irrevocably waive the Company’s obligation to pay the $0.5 million maintenance fee that was due on August 27, 2012 and August 27, 2013 and in any subsequent year. In addition, the Company agreed to pay Dalhousie royalties of 5% of net sales of licensed technology in countries in which patent coverage is available and 3% of net sales in countries in which data protection is available. Also, the parties agreed to amend the timing and increase the amounts of the milestone payments payable under the license agreement. As of December 31, 2016, and 2015, no amounts were due to Dalhousie.  Additional milestones payments will become due upon sub licensing and receipt of certain regulatory approvals, none of which have yet been met or received.

AmiKet Nano - Yissum
 
In June 2015, the Company entered into a definitive research and license agreement with Yissum. Under the license, the Company has obtained an exclusive, worldwide license from Yissum, with certain sublicensing rights, to make commercial use of certain of Yissum’s patents and know-how in connection with a topical nano-formulated delivery of AmiKet for the development, manufacturing, marketing, distribution and commercialization of products based on the technology. As consideration for the grant of the license, the Company is required to pay the following consideration:

· | an annual maintenance fee of $30,000 commencing on June 25, 2020, which maintenance fee shall increase by 30% each year, up to a maximum annual maintenance fee of $0.1 million and may be credited against royalties or milestone payments payable in the same calendar year;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | royalties on net sales of products (as such term is defined in the license) by the Company in the amount of up to 3%, subject to certain possible reductions in certain jurisdictions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | milestones payments of up to approximately $4.5 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory, clinical development and commercialization milestone; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | reimbursement of related patent fees
--+-------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Company will fund an annual research program in the amount of approximately $0.4 million annually, plus VAT and any applicable taxes, commencing on October 1, 2015 (or such other time as mutually agreed between the parties). The results of the research, including any patents or patent applications will automatically be licensed to the Company.
 
The Company paid $0.1 million and $0.2 million related to research fees for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
LidoPAIN - Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.
 
In December 2003, EpiCept entered into a license agreement (“License Agreement”) with Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Endo”) under, which EpiCept granted Endo (and its affiliates) the exclusive (including as to EpiCept and its affiliates) worldwide right to commercialize LidoPAIN, adhesive-backed, lidocaine-based patch for the treatment of acute lower back pain. EpiCept also granted Endo worldwide rights to use certain of EpiCept’s patents for the development of certain other non-sterile, topical lidocaine patches, including Lidoderm, Endo’s non-sterile topical lidocaine-containing patch for the treatment of chronic lower back pain. The Company assumed the License Agreement upon the Merger.
 
Under the License Agreement, the Company is entitled to receive milestone payments of up to $52.5 million upon the achievement of various milestones relating to product development, regulatory approval and sales based royalties on sales of LidoPAIN and Endo’s own back pain product, if covered by the Company’s patents. Royalties are payable until generic equivalents to the LidoPAIN product are available or until expiration of the patents covering LidoPAIN, whichever is sooner. Also, the Company is eligible to receive milestone payments from Endo of up to $30 million upon the achievement of specified regulatory and net sales milestones of Lidoderm, Endo’s chronic lower back pain product candidate, if covered by the Company’s patents. The License Agreement terminates upon the later of the conclusion of the royalty term, on a country-by-country basis, and the expiration of the last applicable EpiCept patent covering licensed Endo product candidates on a country-by-country basis. Either party may terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other or, subject to the relevant bankruptcy laws, upon a bankruptcy event of the other.
 
In July 2015, the Company and Endo amended the License Agreement. The Company transferred to Endo its previously licensed patents related to the use of topical lidocaine in acute and chronic back pain and Endo granted to the Company a royalty-free, non-exclusive, fully transferable license to those patents. Endo will make undisclosed milestone payments to the Company if Endo receives approval for a back pain indication for a lidocaine-based product. The Company regained full exclusive rights to develop, commercialize and license LidoPAIN.

Dr. Jean Kadouche and Alan Razafindrastita
 
In December 2011, Dr Jean Kadouche sold, assigned and transferred to the Company the entire right, title and interest for all countries, in and to any and all patents and inventions related to mice producing human antibodies and a method of preparation of human antibodies (the “Human Antibody Production Technology Platform”) for 40,000 shares of the Company’s common stock and $20,000 (paid to Dr. Kadouche and Alan Razafindrastita).  Through the Human Antibody Production Technology Platform and additional laboratory work, human immune systems and specific cell lines were introduced in mice, enabling the mice to produce human monoclonal antibodies. 
Shire BioChem Inc.
 
In connection with the Merger, the Company acquired a license agreement for the rights to the MX2105 series of apoptosis inducer anti-cancer compounds from Shire BioChem Inc. (“Shire BioChem”), (formerly known as BioChem Pharma, Inc.). Under the license agreement, the Company is required to pay Shire BioChem a portion of any sublicensing payments it receives if it relicenses the series of compounds or make milestone payments to Shire BioChem totaling up to $26.0 million and pay a royalty on product sales if it develops the compounds internally for the treatment of a cancer indication.
 
MabLife SAS
 
In March 2012, the Company acquired from MabLife SAS (“MabLife”), a biotechnology company specializing in research and development of antibody-based therapeutics for the treatment of cancers, autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, all right, title and interest in and to the patent rights, technology and deliverables related to the anti-Ferritin monoclonal antibody (“AMB8LK”), including its nucleotide and protein sequences, its ability to recognize human acid and basic ferritins, or a part of its ability to recognize human acid and basic ferritins.  The consideration was: $0.6 million payable in six equal installments (total payments to date totaled $0.2 million) and royalties of 0.6% of net sales of any product containing AMB8LK or the manufacture, use, sale, offering or importation of which would infringe on the patent rights with respect to AMB8LK.  The Company is required to assign the foregoing rights back to MabLife if it fails to make any of the required payments, is declared insolvent or bankrupt or terminates the agreement.
 
In February 2014, the Company acquired from MabLife all rights, titles and interests in and to the secondary patent rights related to the use of anti-ferritin monoclonal antibodies in the treatment of some cancers, Nucleotide and protein sequences of an antibody directed against an epitope common to human acidic and basic ferritins, monoclonal antibodies or antibody-like molecules comprising these sequences.
 
In the first quarter of 2015, MabLife informed the Company that it had filed for bankruptcy.
 
Intellectual Property and Exclusivity
 
The Company seeks to protect its product candidates and its technology through a combination of patents, trade secrets, proprietary know-how, regulatory exclusivity and contractual restrictions on disclosure.
 
The Company owns or licenses rights with respect to patents and patent applications relating to bertilimumab, AmiKet, Ceplene, antibodies and other product candidates. The patent positions for the Company’s product candidates and platforms include 23 granted U.S. patents, 67 granted foreign patents, 10 pending U.S. applications, and 24 pending foreign patent applications. Where possible, the Company intends to seek patent term extensions in the United States for approved products. The length of the patent term extension will vary and is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review while the patent is in force. The Company’s patent positions are as follows:
 

· | A license to a patent family that covers a composition of matter of bertilimumab and a method of using bertilimumab to screen for an antibody or antibody fragment that binds eotaxin-1, including: four registered patents in the United States and registered patents in Europe (Switzerland, Germany, France, and Ireland), Brazil, Canada, Israel, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Singapore, and one pending patent applications in the United States.

--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Company seeks to protect its proprietary information by requiring its employees, consultants, contractors, outside partners and other advisers to execute, as appropriate, nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their employment or engagement. Immune also requires confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive its confidential data or materials.
 
The Company’s commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of its technologies and product candidates as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. The Company has various compositions of matter and use patents, which have claims directed to its product candidates or their methods of use. The Company’s patent policy is to pursue, maintain, defend, retain and secure patents and patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties, for the technology, inventions and improvements related to its core portfolio of product candidates and that are or may be commercially important to the development of its business. The Company also relies on trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing innovation to develop and maintain its competitive position.
 
The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other life sciences industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based upon allegations of patent infringement. The Company believes that its current activities fall within the scope of the exemptions provided by 35 U.S.C. Section 271(e) in the United States and Section 55.2(1) of the Canadian Patent Act, each of which covers activities related to developing information for submission to the FDA and its counterpart agency in Canada. As the Company’s product candidates progress toward commercialization, the possibility of an infringement claim against it increases. Although the Company attempts to ensure that its product candidates and the methods it employs to manufacture them do not infringe other parties’ patents and other proprietary rights, competitors or other parties may assert that the Company infringed on their proprietary rights.

Trade Secrets and Proprietary Information
 
In addition to patents, the Company relies on trade secrets and technical know-how to develop and maintain its competitive position. Trade secrets and technical know-how can be difficult to protect. The Company seeks to protect its proprietary processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with its employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors and commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect its proprietary information. The Company also seeks to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of its data, trade secrets and technical know-how by maintaining physical security of its premises and physical and electronic security of its information technology systems. Although the Company has confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, such agreements or security measures may be breached, and it may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, the Company’s trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors or others.
Manufacturing
 
Immune does not own or operate manufacturing facilities for any of its products, nor does it plan to develop its own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. The Company currently depends on third party contract manufacture organizations for all of its bulk drug substance and drug candidates for its preclinical and clinical trials.
 
The raw materials that the Company requires to manufacture its product candidates are readily available commodities commonly used in the pharmaceutical industry.
 
On June 27, 2011, Immune signed a manufacturing agreement with Lonza, relating to the Phase II production of bertilimumab using Lonza’s proprietary cell line technology. Under the agreement, Lonza will produce Phase II clinical trial material at its mammalian development and manufacturing facility and prepare documentation required for submission to the FDA, including the applicable clinical trial application.  To date, two clinical batches have been produced and delivered by Lonza under this agreement. A third batch is being manufactured to support additional pilot clinical trials.  The Company relies on certain third parties to perform filling, finishing, labeling, packaging, distribution, laboratory testing and other services related to the manufacture of bertilimumab clinical supply.
 
In 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Probiogen AG to develop a new Chinese Hamster Ovary (“CHO”) derived cell line with improved characteristics, including higher productivity. In 2015, the Company transferred the cell line to STC Biologics for the development of the new manufacturing process for bertilimumab. The cell line and manufacturing process are fully owned by the Company, without any obligation to pay royalties or further consideration and without restrictions on selection of future manufacturing partners. In 2016, the Company signed an agreement for the transfer of the new manufacturing process of bertilimumab to MassBiologics for scale up and GMP production for clinical trials.
 
Manufacturers of Immune’s products are required to comply with applicable Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) regulations. GMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to spend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control in order to maintain GMP regulatory compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior Regulatory Health Authority approval before being implemented.
 
The Company and its contract manufacturers must ensure that all of the processes, methods and equipment are compliant with GMP for drugs on an ongoing basis, as mandated by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, and conduct extensive audits of vendors, contract laboratories and suppliers.
 
Contract Research Organizations
 
Immune outsources clinical trial activities to Clinical Research Organizations (“CROs”). The Company’s clinical CROs comply with guidelines from the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use, which attempt to harmonize the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) regulations and guidelines. Immune creates and implements the drug development plans and manages the CROs according to the specific requirements of the drug candidate under development. To the extent clinical research is conducted by the CROs (or the Company in the future), compliance with certain federal regulations, including but not limited to 21 C.F.R. parts 50, 54, 56, 58 and 318, which pertain to, among other things, institutional review boards, informed consent, financial conflicts of interest by investigators, good laboratory practices and submitting IND applications, may be required.

Marketing, Sales and Commercialization
 
The Company does not have any internal sales, marketing or distribution infrastructure or capabilities. In the event the Company receives regulatory approval for its product candidates, it intends, where appropriate, to pursue commercialization relationships, including strategic alliances and licensing, with pharmaceutical companies and other strategic partners, which are equipped to market and/or sell the Company’s products, if any, through their well-developed sales, marketing and distribution organizations in order to gain access to global markets. In addition, the Company may out-license some or all of its worldwide patent rights to more than one party to achieve the fullest development, marketing and distribution of any products it develops. Over the longer term, the Company may consider ultimately building an internal marketing, sales and commercial infrastructure.
Environmental Matters
 
The Company, its agents and its service providers, including its manufacturers, may be subject to various environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing air emissions, water and wastewater discharges, noise emissions, the use, management and disposal of hazardous, radioactive and biological materials and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated sites. The Company believes that its business, operations and facilities, including, to its knowledge, those of its agents and service providers, are being operated in compliance in all material respects with applicable environmental and health and safety laws and regulations.
Government Regulation
 
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our drug candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and the implementing of regulations in the FDCA. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (“NDAs”) withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 

· | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice (“GLP”) regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (“GCP”) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current GMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (the “NIH”) for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 

· | Phase I clinical trial: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase II clinical trial: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Phase III clinical trial: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Each of Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
A drug being studied in clinical trials may be made available to individual patients in certain circumstances. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act (the “Cures Act”) which was signed into law in December 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This requirement applies on the latest of 60 calendar days after the date of enactment of the Cures Act or the first initiation of a Phase II or Phase III trial of the investigational drug.
 
Marketing Approval
 
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.

17
--

 

In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (“PREA”) as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 
The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.
 
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase IV clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 
Orphan Drug Act
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of PDUFA fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements.

18
--

 

If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 
The Company intends to pursue orphan drug designation for bertilimumab as a therapeutic agent for BP and potentially for other future drug candidates as we deem it appropriate. Even if we were to obtain orphan drug designation for a drug candidate, we may not obtain orphan exclusivity and that exclusivity may not effectively protect the drug from the competition of different drugs for the same condition, which could be approved during the exclusivity period.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

· | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.

The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. However, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any drug candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of our drug candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition.
Other Healthcare Laws 
 
Because of our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors, we will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business, including our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil penalties, criminal penalties, or both.
 
The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate, among others, include: the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; certain state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; the federal healthcare programs’ Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; and state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.

In addition, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 
Healthcare Reform 
 
Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.
 
For example, implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA, among other things, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research. Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. Some of the provisions of the PPACA have yet to be implemented, and there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. In addition, the current administration and Congress will likely continue to seek legislative and regulatory changes, including repeal and replacement of certain provisions of the PPACA. In January 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the ACA to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the PPACA that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. In March 2017, following the passage of the budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation known as the American Health Care Act, which, if enacted, would have amended or repealed significant portions of the PPACA. However, consensus over the scope of the American Health Care Act could not be reached by its proponents in the U.S. House of Representatives. Thus, the proposed legislation has been withdrawn. Further, the House of Representatives recently passed the American Health Care Act of 2017 (the “AHCA”), which would repeal significant portions of the Healthcare Reform Law, if it becomes law.
 
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, in January 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.
 
The Company expects that additional federal and state, as well as foreign, healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.
 
International Regulations
 
Whether or not Immune obtains FDA approval for a product, the Company must obtain approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement also vary greatly from country to country. Although governed by the applicable country, clinical trials conducted outside of the U.S. typically are administered with the three-phase sequential process that was discussed above under “Government Regulation—U.S.” However, the foreign equivalent of an IND is not a prerequisite to performing pilot studies or Phase I clinical trials.

Under European Union regulatory systems, the Company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is required for oncology products and is available for medicines produced by biotechnology or which are highly innovative, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all member states. This authorization is a marketing authorization application. The decentralized procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval. This procedure is referred to as the mutual recognition procedure.
 
In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the U.S. Immune faces the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to the Company, its shareholders or its collaborators.
 
Research and Development
 
We have devoted substantial efforts and resources to advancing our intellectual property estate and scientific research and drug development. Generally, research and development expenditures are allocated to specific research projects. Due to various uncertainties and risks, it is not possible to accurately predict future spending or time to completion by project or project category. Research and Development costs were $8.3 million and $5.9 million during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company will require additional investments in research and development to bring its product candidates to market. 
Competition

Immune operates in highly competitive segments of the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical markets. The Company faces competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Many of the Company’s competitors have significantly greater financial, product development, manufacturing and marketing resources than the Company. Large pharmaceutical companies have extensive experience in clinical testing and obtaining regulatory approval for drugs. As a result, these companies may obtain marketing approval more rapidly than Immune may be able to and may be more effective in selling and marketing their products. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. In addition, many universities and private and public research institutes are active in cancer research, some in direct competition with the Company. Adequate protection of intellectual property, successful product development, adequate funding and retention of skilled, experienced and professional personnel are among the many factors critical to success in the pharmaceutical industry.
