ITEM 1. BUSINESS
OVERVIEW
In this report, unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” or “Enbridge Management” are intended to mean Enbridge Energy Management, L.L.C. Our shares, representing limited liability company interests (Listed Shares), are traded on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “EEQ”. References to our “shares” in this Annual Report mean, collectively, our Listed Shares and our voting shares.
We are a publicly-traded Delaware limited liability company that was formed on May 14, 2002. We are a limited partner of Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. (the Partnership), through our ownership of i-units, a special class of the Partnership’s limited partner interests. Our only investment is our limited partner interest in the Partnership. We are structured as an alternative to direct investment in master limited partnerships for investors without the complications associated with partnership tax reporting.
On April 28, 2017, the Partnership announced the results of Enbridge Inc.'s strategic review of its United States sponsored vehicles, which was conducted as a result of integration efforts post merger with Spectra Energy Corp. The Partnership reduced its quarterly distribution from $0.583 per unit to $0.35 per unit or from $2.33 per unit to $1.40 per unit on an annualized basis. As a result, of the distribution reduction our quarterly distribution of additional i-units and corresponding Listed shares distributed to the public was reduced from $0.583 per unit to $0.35 per unit.
The Partnership’s Class A common units are traded on the NYSE under the symbol “EEP,” which, together with the Class B common units, we refer to as common units. On April 27, 2017, the Partnership entered into an equity restructuring transaction with its general partner, Enbridge Energy Company, Inc. (the General Partner). As part of the equity restructuring a wholly-owned subsidiary of the General Partner irrevocably waived all of its rights associated with its Class D units and incentive distribution units (IDUs) in exchange for the issuance of Class F units. The Class F units entitle the General Partner to receive an incentive distribution for amounts distributed in excess of the Minimum Quarterly Distribution of $0.295 per unit. Also on April 27, 2017, the Partnership redeemed all of its outstanding Series 1 Preferred Units held by the General Partner at face value of $1.2 billion in cash. The Partnership funded the redemption of the Series 1 Preferred Units (the Preferred Units) through the issuance of 64 million Class A common units to the General Partner at a price of $18.66 per Class A common unit.
Previously, on January 2, 2015, the Partnership closed a transaction pursuant to which it acquired the remaining interest in the United States segment of the Alberta Clipper Pipeline from the General Partner whereby the Partnership issued to the General Partner a class of limited partner interests designated as Class E units. For more information on these transactions, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 3 - Shareholders' Equity.
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we owned an approximate 19.9% and 16.6% outstanding ownership interest of the Partnership, respectively. At December 31, 2017, the General Partner owned 100% of our 6.77 voting shares, as well as 10,494,463 of our Listed Shares, which represents 11.7% of our Listed Shares. The remaining 79,304,348 of our Listed Shares were held by the public, which represents 88.3% of our Listed Shares. Our performance depends entirely on the operations and management of the Partnership. Accordingly, we incorporate by reference the Partnership’s 10-K.
Under a delegation of control agreement among us, the Partnership and the General Partner, we manage the Partnership’s business and affairs. The General Partner is an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of Enbridge Inc., an energy transportation and distribution company based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada that we refer to herein as Enbridge.
The delegation of control agreement provides that we will not amend or propose to amend the Partnership’s agreement of limited partnership (Partnership Agreement), allow a merger or consolidation involving the Partnership, allow a sale or exchange of all or substantially all of the assets of the Partnership or dissolve or liquidate the Partnership without the approval of the General Partner.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

The General Partner remains responsible to the Partnership for actions taken or omitted by us while serving as the delegate of the General Partner as if the General Partner had taken or omitted to take such actions. The General Partner has agreed not to voluntarily withdraw as general partner of the Partnership and has agreed not to transfer its interest as general partner of the Partnership unless the transferee agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of the delegation of control agreement that apply to the General Partner.
The Partnership recognizes the delegation of rights and powers to us, and indemnifies and protects us, our officers and our directors to the same extent as it does with respect to the General Partner under the Partnership Agreement. In addition, the Partnership reimburses us for expenses to the same extent as it does with respect to the General Partner under the Partnership Agreement and reimburses us for any Texas franchise taxes and any other foreign, state and local taxes not otherwise paid or reimbursed pursuant to a tax indemnification agreement between Enbridge and us.
The delegation of control agreement with the General Partner continues until:

• | Either the General Partner has withdrawn (whether voluntarily or involuntarily) or has been removed as the general partner of the Partnership;


• | All of our shares are owned by the General Partner of the Partnership or its affiliates, and termination of the delegation of control agreement has been approved by us and the General Partner of the Partnership; or


• | Termination of the delegation of control agreement has been approved by us, the General Partner, the record holders of a majority of the outstanding Listed Shares (other than the General Partner, the record holder of the voting shares or their respective affiliates) and the record holders of the majority of the voting shares.

The General Partner is the only general partner of the Partnership. The General Partner retains its general partner interest and shares in the profits, losses and distributions from the Partnership.
If the General Partner’s power and authority as general partner are modified in the Partnership Agreement of the Partnership, then the power and authority delegated to us will be modified on the same basis. The delegation of control agreement can be amended by all parties to the agreement except for any amendment that, in the sole discretion of our board of directors, would reduce the time for any notice to which owners of our shares are entitled or would materially adversely affect the rights or preferences of the holders of our shares.
Under its Partnership Agreement, except for the available cash that the Partnership is required to retain in respect of the i-units, the Partnership distributes all of its available cash to the General Partner and limited partners on a quarterly basis. The amount of cash distributed by the Partnership depends on the operations of the Partnership and its subsidiaries and is determined by our board of directors in accordance with the Partnership Agreement. We do not, however, receive distributions of cash in respect of the i-units we own and do not otherwise have any cash flow attributable to our ownership of the i-units. Instead, when the Partnership makes cash distributions to the General Partner and holders of limited partner units other than the i-units, the number of i-units we own increases automatically under the Partnership Agreement and the amount of available cash that is attributable to the i-units is retained by the Partnership. The amount of this increase is calculated by dividing the amount of the cash distribution paid by the Partnership on each of its common units by the average closing price of one of our Listed Shares on the NYSE as determined for a 10-day trading period immediately preceding the ex-dividend date for our shares, multiplied by the number of our shares outstanding on the record date. Concurrently with the increase in the number of i-units we own, we make distributions on our shares in the form of additional shares, with the result that the number of shares that are then outstanding is equal the number of i-units that we own.
We have elected to be treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes. Therefore, an owner of our shares does not report on its United States federal income tax return any of our items of income, gain, loss and deduction relating to an investment in us. We are subject to United States federal income tax on our taxable income; however, the i-units owned by us generally are not entitled to allocations of income, gain, loss or deduction of the Partnership unless there is a liquidation of the Partnership. Therefore, we do not anticipate that we will have material amounts of taxable income resulting from our ownership of the i-units unless we enter into a sale or exchange of the i-units or the Partnership is liquidated.
