Item 1. Business
Legal Organization
AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. is a Delaware corporation that was acquired by its principal stockholders in 1998 and began trading on the Nasdaq Global Select Market on November 13, 2006. References to “AmTrust,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in other statements and information publicly disseminated by AmTrust Financial Services, Inc., refer to the consolidated operations of the holding company.
Merger Agreement
On March 1, 2018, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with Evergreen Parent, L.P. ("Evergreen Parent"), an entity formed by private equity funds managed by Stone Point Capital LLC ("Stone Point"), together with Barry D. Zyskind, Chairman and CEO of AmTrust, George Karfunkel and Leah Karfunkel (collectively, the "Karfunkel-Zyskind Family"), in which Evergreen Parent will acquire the approximately 45% of our issued and outstanding common shares that the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family and certain of its affiliates and related parties do not presently own or control. The transaction values our fully diluted equity at approximately $2.7 billion, excluding our outstanding preferred stock.
Under the terms of the proposed merger, our common shareholders who are not affiliated with the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family (the "Public Shareholders") will receive $13.50 in cash for each share of AmTrust common stock they hold. The Karfunkel-Zyskind Family and certain of its affiliates and related parties will rollover their shares of common stock for interests in Evergreen Parent. Each share of our currently outstanding preferred stock will remain outstanding and it is expected that the preferred stock will continue to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange following the consummation of the transaction.
The proposed merger is anticipated to close in the second half of 2018, subject to satisfaction or waiver of the closing conditions, including approval by regulatory authorities and our shareholders, including approval by a majority of our common shares not owned or controlled by Evergreen Parent and its affiliates, the Karfunkel-Zyskind Family and its affiliates and certain related parties, and our directors and senior officers.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Business Overview
AmTrust underwrites and provides property and casualty insurance products to niche customer groups that we believe are generally underserved within the broader insurance market. AmTrust operates in the United States ("U.S.") and internationally through three operating segments: Small Commercial Business, Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty, and Specialty Program.
Our insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the U.S. are collectively licensed to provide workers’ compensation insurance and commercial property and casualty insurance, including service contract reimbursement coverages included in our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty segment, in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
Our product mix primarily includes workers’ compensation, extended warranty and other commercial and select personal lines in property/casualty insurance. Our workers’ compensation and property/casualty insurance policyholders in the U.S. are generally small and middle market businesses. Our extended warranty clients and partners include original equipment manufacturers, distributors, e-commerce and other retailers of commercial and consumer products. Key services performed on behalf of clients and policyholders include claims administration and device refurbishment, repair, recycling and logistics programs. The majority of our products are sold through independent third-party brokers, agents, retailers or administrators.
Our business model focuses on achieving industry-leading returns on equity and long-term stockholder value through operational excellence and profitable growth with the careful management of risk. We are focused on achieving excellent customer service and retention. We pursue these goals through:

• | Disciplined underwriting and risk management frameworks that emphasize geographic and product diversification, and provide us with an in-depth understanding of our insured exposures.


• | Targeting and reaching scale amongst the small to middle size customer segments in low to medium hazard business classes throughout the U.S., Europe and increasingly in Asia. Additionally, we are focused on further enhancing our economies of scale by opportunistically expanding our geographic reach and product set, growing our network of agents and other distributors, and developing new client relationships.


• | Leveraging our proprietary technology platform in order to efficiently manage the high volume of policies and claims that result from serving large numbers of small policyholders and warranty contract holders. The technology we have developed offers a level of service that we believe is a competitive advantage in these high volume, lower risk classes of business by enhancing our ability to service, underwrite and adjudicate claims.

Since our inception in 1998, we have grown both organically and through strategic acquisitions. Our approach and strategy for acquisitions is to take relatively modest integration and balance sheet risk. In 2017 and early 2018, our acquisition activity slowed as we took several transformative actions to strengthen our balance sheet and capital base and focus upon our core business. We intend to achieve profitable growth and strengthen our capital base by pursuing select underwriting opportunities while maintaining or improving our A.M. Best ratings. For details of the impact of these transactions on our results of operations, see Item 7. "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations "– Acquisitions" and "– Strategic Investments".
Business Segments
We manage our business through three operating segments, Small Commercial Business, Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty, and Specialty Program, which are based on the products we provide and the markets we serve.

Products and services
Our Small Commercial Business segment provides workers’ compensation insurance to small businesses that operate in low and medium hazard classes and commercial package and other property and casualty insurance products to small businesses, with average annual premiums of less than $8,000 per policy. Commercial package and other low-hazard products provide a broad array of insurance to small businesses, including commercial property, general liability, inland marine, employment practices liability, commercial automobile, workers’ compensation and umbrella coverage.
Some of our preferred and commonly written low and medium classes of business include restaurants, hospitality, retail and wholesale stores, professional offices, artisan contractors, light manufacturing and service industries, among others.
Marketing and distribution
We are authorized to write our Small Commercial Business products in all 50 states. We primarily distribute our policies through a network of over 11,000 select retail and wholesale agents who are highly trained on AmTrust's preferred industry classes and are paid commissions based on the annual policy premiums submitted by agents that we choose to write. Workers’ compensation insurance pricing and coverage options are generally mandated and regulated on a state by state basis and provide coverage for the statutory obligations of employers to pay medical care expenses and lost wages for employees who are injured in the course of their employment.
We are focused on continuing to broaden our market share by enhancing our current agent relationships as well as developing new agent relationships. Our on-line quoting and application submission system permits agents and brokers to easily determine in real-time if the risk and pricing parameters for a prospective workers’ compensation client meet our underwriting criteria and delivers an application for underwriting approval to us in a paperless environment. Our underwriting system will not allow business to be placed if it does not fit within our guidelines, while enabling rapid same-day binding coverage for risks that meet our criteria. These same types of efficiencies also exist for our commercial package product business. Our system handles most clerical duties, so that our underwriters can focus on making decisions on risk submissions.
In addition to growing organically, we have further enhanced our marketing and customer liaison capabilities for small-business workers’ compensation and property and casualty insurance by acquiring companies or distribution networks and renewal rights from companies that have long-standing, established agent relationships, underwriting and claims management expertise, and/or infrastructure to provide additional support to our platform. These transactions have also enabled us to further expand our geographic reach and offer additional products.

Competition
We believe the small business component of the workers’ compensation market is generally less competitive than the broader insurance market because the smaller policy size and lower average premiums needed by these types of policyholders generally do not fit the underwriting criteria of many of our competitors. Our highly customized, scalable and proprietary technology platform enables us to individually underwrite, manage and control losses in a cost-effective manner for a large number of small policies while still providing quality customer service and responsive claims management to our clients and the agents that distribute our products. We believe these factors have been key to our ability to achieve high retention and renewal rates.
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we did not derive over ten percent of our Small Commercial Business revenue from any one customer.

Transfer of Equity Interest in U.S.-based Fee Businesses
On November 3, 2017, we and Mayfield Holdings LLC (“Mayfield”), entered into a Contribution and Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) with MH JV Holdings L.P. (“Investor”), a newly-formed investment vehicle owned by affiliates of Madison Dearborn Partners, related to the Investor’s acquisition of a majority interest in the portion of our U.S.-based fee businesses that (a) act as managing general agents for the distribution, underwriting and procurement of property and casualty insurance on behalf of certain our affiliates and other insurance carriers and (b) design, develop, market and act as third party administrators for programs for service contracts, limited warranties and replacement plans as further described in the Acquisition Agreement (the “U.S.-based fee business”). On February 28, 2018, we completed the transfer of the U.S.-based fee business to Mayfield and the Investor's acquisition of a majority interest in Mayfield. Additional information is presented in Note 28. “Subsequent Events” to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Form 10-K. The following description of our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty segment summarizes our business as of December 31, 2017, without regard to the transfer of the U.S. -based fee business that occurred shortly before we filed this Form 10-K.
Products and services
Our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty segment provides custom designed coverages, such as accidental damage plans, mechanical breakdown protection and payment protection plans offered in connection with the sale of consumer and commercial goods in the U.S. and Europe, and certain niche property, casualty and specialty liability risks in the U.S. and Europe, including general liability, employers’ liability and professional and medical liability. Our model is focused on developing coverage plans by evaluating and analyzing historical product and industry data to establish appropriate pricing and contract terms and enhancing the profitability of the plans by limiting the frequency and severity of losses while delivering superior customer service. We own Lloyd's property and casualty insurance syndicates that focus on general insurance and provide access to a Lloyd's underwriting platform for brokers. We also serve as a third party administrator to provide claims handling and call center services to the consumer products and automotive industries in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia.
Our specialty risk business primarily covers the following risks:

• | legal expenses in the event of unsuccessful litigation;


• | property damage for residential properties;


• | home emergency repairs caused by incidents affecting systems, such as plumbing, wiring or central heating;


• | latent defects that materialize on real property after building or completion;

TABLE OF CONTENTS


• | payment protection to insureds if they become unable to meet financial obligations under finance contracts;


• | guaranteed asset protection (“GAP”) to cover the difference between an insurer’s settlement and the asset value in the event of a total loss; and


• | general liability, employers’ liability, public liability, negligence of advisers and liability of health care providers and medical facilities.

Our extended warranty business covers selected consumer and commercial goods and other risks, including:

• | automotive;


• | consumer electronics and appliances;


• | commercial equipment; and


• | recreational vehicle and power sports.

Marketing and distribution
Through our insurance subsidiaries, we are licensed to provide specialty risk and extended warranty coverage in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Ireland and the United Kingdom and, pursuant to European Union law, certain other European Union member states. Through our subsidiary, AmTrust at Lloyd's, we are also licensed to underwrite business internationally in locations where Lloyd's is licensed.
We market our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty products through unaffiliated third parties that, in lieu of a commission, charge an administrative fee, based on the policy amount, to the manufacturer or retailer that offers the extended warranty or accidental damage coverage plan. Accordingly, the success of our business is dependent upon our ability to motivate these third parties to sell our products and support them in their sales efforts. 
We carefully select administrators with extensive industry knowledge and target industries and coverage plans that have demonstrated consistently favorable loss experience. Additionally, we utilize extensive historical claims data and detailed actuarial analysis to ensure our ability to more accurately forecast the frequency and severity of losses and draft restrictive, risk-specific coverage terms with clearly identified coverage restrictions to further reduce the level of losses. Our efficient and proactive claims management process enables us to ensure superior customer service, and if necessary, proactively adjust our premiums based on changes in actual loss experience.
We underwrite our specialty risk coverage on a coverage plan-level basis, which involves substantial data collection and actuarial analysis as well as analysis of applicable laws governing policy coverage language and exclusions. We prefer to apply a historical rating approach in which we analyze historical loss experience of the covered product or similar products rather than an approach that attempts to estimate our total exposure without such historical data. In addition, we believe that the quality of the marketing and claims administration service provided by the warranty administrator is a significant driver of the profitability of the product. Accordingly, a critical evaluation of the prospective warranty administrator is an important component of underwriting a plan. The results of our underwriting analysis are used to determine the premiums we charge and drive the description of the plan coverage and exclusions. The underwriting process generally takes three months or more to complete.
In our extended warranty business, we issue policies to our clients that provide for payment or replacement of goods to meet our clients’ contractual liabilities to the end purchasers of the warranty under contracts that have coverage terms with durations ranging from one to 120 months depending on the type of product. In the event that the frequency or the severity of loss on the claims of a program exceeds original projections, we generally have the right to increase premium rates for the balance of the term of the contract and, in Europe, the right to cancel prior to the end of the term. We believe that the profitability of each coverage plan we underwrite is largely dependent upon our ability to accurately forecast the frequency and severity of claims and manage the claims process efficiently. We continuously collect and analyze claims data in order to forecast future claims trends. We also provide warranty administration services in the U.S. and internationally.
We market our extended warranty and GAP products in the U.S. and internationally primarily through brokers and third party warranty administrators, through a direct marketing group and our own warranty administrators AMT Warranty and Car Care Plan. Third party administrators generally handle claims on our policies and provide monthly loss reports. We review the monthly reports and if the losses are unexpectedly high, we generally have the right under our policies to adjust our pricing or cease underwriting new business under the coverage plan. We routinely audit the claims paid by the administrators and hire third party experts to validate certain types of claims. For example, we engage engineering consultants to validate claims made on coverage we provide on heavy machinery. We generally settle our extended warranty claims in-kind - by repair or replacement - rather than in cash. When possible, we negotiate volume fixed-fee repair or replacement agreements with third parties to reduce our loss exposure.

For a discussion of the various risks we face related to our foreign operations, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
Competition
We believe that our proprietary technology platform and strong industry expertise provide us a competitive advantage. We also believe the niche markets in the Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty sector in which we do business are less competitive than most other insurance sectors (including workers’ compensation insurance). We believe our Specialty Risk and Extended Warranty teams are recognized for their knowledge and expertise in their targeted markets. Nonetheless, we face significant competition, including several internationally well-known insurers that have greater financial, marketing and management resources and experience than we have. We believe that our competitive advantages include our ownership of both a U.S. warranty provider and a U.K. warranty provider, which enables us to directly administer the business, the ability to provide technical assistance to non-affiliate warranty providers, experienced underwriting, resourceful claims management practices and good relations with warranty administrators in the European Union, Asia and the U.S.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Products and services
Our Specialty Program segment provides workers’ compensation, general liability, commercial auto liability, property coverage, excess and surplus lines programs and other specialty commercial property and casualty insurance to narrowly defined, homogeneous groups of small and middle market accounts whose business model and risk profile generally requires in-depth knowledge of a specific industry or sector focus in order to appropriately evaluate, price and manage the coverage risk. The type of risk covered by this segment is larger in premium size and generally covers more specialized classes than our Small Commercial Business segment. In recent years, we began re-underwriting, implementing rate changes and/or terminating certain unprofitable programs, which generated a decrease in our premium writings in this segment.
Policyholders in this segment primarily include the following types of industries:

• | retail;


• | wholesale;


• | service operations;


• | artisan and general contracting;


• | moving and storage;


• | agriculture;


• | professional liability; and


• | healthcare

Marketing and distribution
The Specialty Program business is distributed through a limited number of qualified general and wholesale agents to whom we pay commission for the services they perform (underwriting, marketing, policy administration, etc.). We restrict our agent network to managing general agents and other wholesale agents and claims administrators who have experience underwriting certain types of risk and who, subject to our underwriting standards, originate and assist in managing a book of business and may share in the portfolio risk. Our products and underwriting criteria often entail customized coverage, loss control and claims services as well as risk sharing mechanisms. 
We establish the underwriting standards used with our general agency partners by conducting detailed actuarial analysis using historical and industry data. Prior to entering into a relationship with an agency, we perform extensive due diligence on the agent including a review of underwriting, claims and financial control areas that generally takes three to nine months to complete. Additionally, once we have entered into a relationship with a general agent, we carefully monitor the loss experience of the portfolio associated with each agent on a monthly basis and conduct onsite underwriting, claims and financial audits.
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we did not derive over ten percent of our Specialty Program revenue from any one customer. During 2015, we derived over ten percent of our Specialty Program revenue from one customer.

Competition
Our Specialty Program segment employs a niche strategy of targeting specialized business within the specific niche classes for each program. Our product expertise, management experience, availability of filings, efficient operations, system capabilities and speed to market helps to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors. Our competitive A.M. Best rating and financial size allow us to compete favorably for target business.
Reinsurance
Reinsurance is a transaction between insurance companies in which the original insurer, or ceding company, remits a portion of its policy premiums to a reinsurer, or assuming company, as payment for the reinsurer assuming a portion of the insured policies’ risk. Reinsurance agreements may be proportional in nature, under which the assuming company participates in the premiums and losses of the ceding company via a pro rata share. Under these “quota share reinsurance” arrangements, the ceding company transfers, or cedes, a percentage of the risk under each policy within the covered class or classes of business to the reinsurer and recovers the same percentage of the ceded loss and loss adjustment expenses. The ceding company pays the reinsurer that same percentage of the insurance premiums on the ceded policies, less a ceding commission. Reinsurance agreements may also be structured so that the assuming company indemnifies the ceding company against all or a specified portion of losses on underlying insurance policies in excess of a specified amount, which is called an “attachment level” or “retention.” The assuming company provides this indemnification for a premium, usually determined as a percentage of the ceding company’s insurance premiums for the covered class or classes of business. This arrangement is known as “excess of loss reinsurance.” Excess of loss reinsurance may be written in layers, in which a reinsurer or group of reinsurers accepts a band of coverage up to a specified amount. Any liability exceeding the coverage limits of the reinsurance program is retained by the ceding company. 
We believe reinsurance is a valuable tool to appropriately manage the risk inherent in our insurance portfolio as well as to enable us to reduce earnings volatility and generate stronger returns. We also utilize reinsurance agreements to increase our capacity to write a greater amount of profitable business. Our insurance subsidiaries utilize reinsurance agreements to transfer portions of the underlying risk of the business we write to various affiliated and third-party reinsurance companies. Reinsurance does not discharge or diminish our obligation to pay claims covered by the insurance policies we issue; however, it does permit us to recover certain incurred losses from our reinsurers and our reinsurance recoveries reduce the total aggregate of losses that we may incur as a result of a covered loss event. 
The total amount, cost and limits relating to the reinsurance coverage we purchase may vary from year to year based upon a variety of factors, including the availability of quality reinsurance at an acceptable price and the level of risk that we choose to retain for our own account. For a more detailed description of our reinsurance arrangements, including our quota share reinsurance agreement with Maiden Reinsurance Ltd. (“Maiden Reinsurance”) (the “Maiden Quota Share”), see “Reinsurance” in “Item 7.

An “A” rating is the third highest of the 16 categories used by A.M. Best, and is assigned to companies that have, in A.M. Best’s opinion, an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders. On November 6, 2017, A.M. Best announced that it had placed the Company's ratings under review with negative implications (as denoted by the symbol "u" in the summary above), following our announcement of our entry into a definitive agreement to transfer a portion of our U.S.-based fee business and our reserve strengthening during third-quarter 2017. On March 2, 2018, after our announcements regarding the closing of the transfer of a majority interest in a portion of our U.S.-based fee business and the proposed merger, A.M. Best confirmed our ratings remained unchanged.
Many insurance buyers, agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by A.M. Best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance. These current ratings were derived from an in-depth evaluation of these subsidiaries’ financial strengths, operating performances and business profiles. A.M. Best evaluates, among other factors, our capitalization, underwriting leverage, financial leverage, asset leverage, capital structure, quality and appropriateness of reinsurance, adequacy of reserves, quality and diversification of assets, liquidity, profitability, spread of risk, revenue composition, market position, management, market risk and event risk. A.M. Best ratings are

Regulation
General
The business of insurance and reinsurance is regulated in most countries, although the degree and type of regulation vary significantly from one jurisdiction to another. We are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S. and in Europe, which for us primarily consists of the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as in Bermuda. 
United States
As of December 31, 2017, we had twenty-four operating insurance subsidiaries domiciled in the United States (the “U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries”).
Holding Company Regulation
We qualify as a holding company system under laws that regulate insurance holding company systems. Each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile (and in any other state in which the insurance company may be deemed to be commercially domiciled by reason of concentration of its business within such state) and periodically furnish information concerning its ownership, operations and transactions, particularly with other companies within the holding company system that may materially affect its operations, management or financial condition.
The insurance laws in most states provide that all transactions among members of an insurance holding company system must be fair and reasonable. These laws require disclosure of material transactions within the holding company system and, in some cases, prior notice of or approval for certain transactions. All transactions within a holding company system affecting an insurer must have fair and reasonable terms and are subject to other standards and requirements established by law and regulation.
Dividends
State insurance laws require our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries to maintain certain levels of policyholders’ surplus and restrict payment of dividends. In general, the maximum amount of dividends a U.S. Insurance Subsidiary may pay in any 12-month period without prior regulatory approval is the greater of adjusted statutory net income or 10% of statutory policyholders’ surplus as of the preceding calendar year end. Most states restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay dividends in excess of its statutory unassigned surplus or earned surplus, and state insurance regulators may limit or restrict an insurance company’s ability to pay dividends, if such a dividend has been paid within the previous year, as a condition to issuance of a certificate of authority or as a condition to approval of a change of control, or for other regulatory reasons.
Change of Control
State insurance holding company laws require advance approval by the respective state insurance departments of any change of control of an insurer. Control is generally presumed to exist through the direct or indirect ownership of 10% or more of the voting securities of a domestic insurance company or any entity that controls a domestic insurance company. In addition, insurance laws in many states contain provisions that require pre- and post-notification to and prior approval from the insurance departments of a change of control of certain non-domestic insurance companies licensed in those states, as well as post-notification of a change of control of certain agencies and third party administrators. Obtaining these approvals may result in the material delay of, or deter, any such transaction. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of AmTrust, including through transactions, and in particular unsolicited transactions, that some or all of our stockholders might consider to be desirable.
State Insurance Regulation
Insurance companies are subject to regulation and supervision by the department of insurance in the state in which they are domiciled and, to a lesser extent, other states in which they are authorized to conduct business. The primary purpose of such regulatory powers is to protect individual policyholders. State insurance authorities have broad regulatory, supervisory and administrative powers. For example, our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries’ policy rates and forms, including workers’ compensation policies, are closely regulated in all states. Workers’ compensation insurers are also subject to regulation by the specific workers’ compensation regulators in the states in which they provide such insurance.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries are required to file detailed financial statements and other reports with the departments of insurance in all states in which they are licensed to transact business. These reports include details concerning claims reserves held by the insurer, specific investments held by the insurer, and numerous other disclosures about the insurer’s financial condition and operations. These financial statements are subject to periodic examination by the department of insurance in each state in which they are filed. The quarterly and annual financial reports to the state insurance regulators utilize statutory accounting principles ("SAP"), which are different from GAAP. Statutory accounting principles are a basis of accounting developed to assist insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies, and are primarily focused on protection of policyholders. GAAP focuses more on income and cash flows, and gives more consideration to appropriately matching revenue and expenses, and accounting for management's stewardship of assets.
State insurance laws and insurance departments also regulate and limit the amounts and types of investments that insurers are permitted to make. Certain investments (such as real estate) are prohibited by certain jurisdictions. Each of our domiciliary states has its own regulations and limitations over investments. To ensure compliance in each state, we review our investment portfolio quarterly based on each state’s regulations and limitations.
In addition, many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from a particular market or particular line of business. For example, states may limit an insurer’s ability to cancel or not renew policies. Laws and regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject program withdrawals to prior approval requirements may restrict the ability of our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries to exit unprofitable markets.
Insurance agencies, producers, third party administrators, claims adjusters and service contract providers and administrators are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states in which they conduct business. Many of our subsidiaries and certain of our employees are subject to licensing requirements and regulation by insurance regulators in various states.
NAIC Initiatives
Over the past several years, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has revised the U.S. insurance solvency regulatory framework to include capital requirements, governance and risk management, group supervision, accounting and financial reporting and reinsurance. The NAIC is focused upon the concept of “enterprise risk” within an insurance company holding system and the NAIC imposes extensive informational requirements on insurers in order to protect the licensed insurance companies from enterprise risk. Additionally, the NAIC requires insurers to perform an Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) and, upon request of a state, file an ORSA Summary Report with the state. Also, in 2016, the NAIC adopted the Corporate Governance Annual Filing Model Regulation and the Corporate Governance Annual Disclosure Model Act, which requires us to file a confidential report prepared by the insurer or insurance group, the purpose of which is to provide the most relevant information necessary to permit state regulators to gain an understanding of the corporate governance structure, policies and practices utilized by the insurer.
Federal Regulatory Changes
From time to time, various regulatory and legislative changes have been proposed in the insurance industry. Among the proposals that have in the past been or are at present being considered are the possible introduction of federal regulation in addition to, or in lieu of, the current system of state regulation of insurers and proposals in various state legislatures (some of which have been enacted) to conform portions of their insurance laws and regulations to various model acts adopted by the NAIC.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 gives the Federal Reserve supervisory authority over a number of financial services companies, including insurance companies, if they are designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as “systemically important.” In such a case, the Federal Reserve’s supervisory authority could include the ability to impose heightened financial regulation upon that insurance company which could impact its capital, liquidity and leverage requirements as well as its business and investment conduct. We have not been designated as "systemically important" by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.
The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (“TRIA”), as extended by the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“TRIPRA”), requires that commercial property and casualty insurance companies, like our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries, offer coverage (with certain exceptions, such as with respect to commercial auto liability) for certain acts of terrorism and has established a federal assistance program through the end of 2020 to help such insurers cover claims for terrorism-related losses.

State Insurance Department Examinations
As part of their regulatory oversight process, state insurance departments conduct periodic detailed and risk-focused financial examinations of insurance companies domiciled in their states, generally once every three to five years. Examinations are generally carried out in cooperation with the insurance departments of other states under guidelines promulgated by the NAIC.
A second type of regulatory oversight examination of insurance companies involves a review by an insurance department of an authorized company’s market conduct, which entails a review and examination of a company’s compliance with laws governing marketing, underwriting, rating, policy-issuance, claims-handling and other aspects of its insurance business during a specified period of time. Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries are subject to both types of these examinations from time to time. Any adverse findings by state insurance departments could result in significant fines and penalties, which could negatively affect profitability.
Guaranty Fund Assessments
Various states levy assessments on all member insurers in a particular state on the basis of the proportionate share of the premiums written by the member insurers in the lines of business in which impaired, insolvent or failed insurers are engaged. Some states permit member insurers to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets. Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries have established accruals for their portion of guaranty fund assessments with respect to insurers that are currently subject to insolvency proceedings.
Residual Market Programs
Many states require insurers licensed to provide workers’ compensation and commercial automobile insurance to participate in a residual market program to provide these types of insurance to those entities that have not or cannot procure coverage from an insurer on a voluntary basis. The level of required participation is generally determined based on an insurer’s volume of the voluntarily issued business in that state. The mechanics of how each state’s residual markets operate may differ, but generally, risks are assigned to a servicing carrier pursuant to a state administered plan (“Assigned Risk Plans”), which is reinsured through a pooling arrangement where the results of all policies provided through these administered pools are shared by the participating companies.
Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiary, Technology Insurance Company, Inc. (“TIC”), acts as a servicing carrier for certain workers’ compensation Assigned Risk Plans. Servicing carrier contracts are generally awarded based on a competitive bidding process. As a servicing carrier, we receive fee income for our services but do not retain any underwriting risk, which is fully reinsured by the various National Council on Compensation Insurance ("NCCI") pools. 
Second Injury Funds
A number of states operate trust funds that reimburse insurers and employers for claims paid to injured employees for aggravation of prior conditions or injuries. These state-managed trust funds are funded through assessments against insurers and self-insurers providing workers’ compensation coverage in a particular state. We received recoveries of approximately $3.3 million, $4.3 million and $6.1 million from such state-managed trust funds in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The aggregate amount of cash we paid for assessments to state-managed trust funds for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was approximately $28.8 million, $25.8 million and $23.4 million, respectively.
Risk-Based Capital Regulations
Our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries are required to report their risk-based capital based on a formula developed and adopted by the NAIC that attempts to measure statutory capital and surplus needs based on the risks in the insurer’s mix of products and investment portfolio. The formula is designed to allow insurance regulators to identify weakly-capitalized companies. Under the formula, a company determines its “risk-based capital” by taking into account certain risks related to the insurer’s assets (including risks related to its investment portfolio and ceded reinsurance) and the insurer’s liabilities (including underwriting risks related to the nature and experience of its insurance business). The insurance departments in our domiciliary states generally require a minimum total adjusted risk-based capital equal to 150% of an insurance company’s authorized control level risk-based capital. At December 31, 2017, each of our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries’ risk-based capital levels exceeded the minimum total adjusted risk-based capital ratio.

Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios
The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System, or IRIS, is part of a collection of analytical tools designed to provide state insurance regulators with an integrated approach to screening and analyzing the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states, and is intended to assist state insurance regulators in targeting resources to those insurers in greatest need of regulatory attention. IRIS generates key financial ratios results based on financial information obtained from insurers’ annual statutory statements. Each ratio has an established “usual range” of results. Unusual values are viewed as part of a regulatory early monitoring system. An insurance company may fall out of the usual range for one or more ratios because of specific transactions that are in themselves immaterial or because of certain reinsurance or pooling structures or changes in such structures. Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of any 2017 IRIS ratio results outside the usual range for our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries. In all instances in prior years, regulators have been satisfied upon follow-up that no regulatory action was required with respect to any ratio outside of the usual range.
Credit for Reinsurance
In addition to regulatory requirements imposed by the jurisdictions in which they are licensed, reinsurers’ business operations are affected by regulatory requirements in various states governing “credit for reinsurance” that are imposed on their ceding companies. The Non-Admitted and Reinsurance Reform Act (“NRRA”) prohibits a state in which a U.S. ceding insurer is licensed but not domiciled from denying credit for reinsurance for the insurer’s ceded risk if the cedant’s domestic state regulator recognizes credit for reinsurance. The ceding company in this instance is permitted to reflect in its statutory financial statements a credit in an aggregate amount equal to the ceding company’s liability for unearned premiums (which are that portion of premiums written that apply to the unexpired portion of the policy period), loss reserves and loss expense reserves to the extent ceded to the reinsurer. AII, which reinsures TIC, which itself reinsures and pools the risks of our U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries, is not licensed, accredited or approved in any state in the U.S. The great majority of states, however, permit a credit to statutory surplus resulting from reinsurance obtained from a non-licensed or non-accredited reinsurer to be recognized to the extent that the reinsurer provides a letter of credit, trust fund or other acceptable security arrangement. AII posts security to permit TIC to receive credit for reinsurance on the pooled business of the U.S. Insurance Subsidiaries ceded to AII by TIC pursuant to our intercompany pooling and reinsurance agreements.
Privacy and Data Security Regulations
The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which, among other things, protects consumers from the unauthorized dissemination of certain personal information, and various states’ regulations address privacy issues. Certain aspects of these laws and regulations apply to all financial institutions, including insurance and finance companies, and require us to maintain appropriate policies and procedures for managing and protecting certain personal information of our policyholders. We may also be subject to future privacy laws and regulations, which could impose additional costs and impact our results of operations or financial condition. Model regulations have been established in conjunction with the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, and similar provisions have been adopted in several states regarding the safeguarding of policyholder information.
Insurance regulators have been giving increased attention to data security, and new laws and regulations that would impose new requirements and standards for protecting personally identifiable information of insurance company policyholders. For example, the New York Department of Financial Services adopted comprehensive cybersecurity requirements that became effective during 2017. The regulations require that each covered entity (which includes any entity operating under or required to operate under a license, registration, charter, certificate, permit, accreditation or similar authorization under the New York insurance law) establish a cybersecurity program under which the entity must maintain a detailed cybersecurity plan, designate a chief information security officer, enact a cybersecurity policy and maintain a cybersecurity-related event reporting system. We established such a program in 2017. In addition, the NAIC has adopted the Cybersecurity Bill of Rights, a set of directives aimed at protecting consumer data, and is working on a new model data security law that is expected to incorporate the directives and impose additional requirements to the extent adopted by applicable states’ legislation. The NAIC has also included enhanced guidance related to cybersecurity in its handbook for state insurance examiners.
We are subject to the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which all E.U. Member States must implement by May 2018. GDPR is global in scope to the extent that it applies to all business in the E.U. and any business outside the E.U. that process E.U. personal data of individuals in the E.U. The regulation is in place to enhance the rights and protections of E.U. citizens' personal data and non-compliance can potentially lead to financial penalties. The introduction of GDPR, and any resultant changes in E.U. member states’ national laws and regulations, may increase our compliance obligations and may necessitate the review and implementation of policies and processes relating to our collection and use of data. We have undertaken significant preparedness work ahead of the implementation date of May 2018.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

To the best of our knowledge, we are in compliance with all applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations.
Telephone and Email Sales Regulations
The U.S. Congress, the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Trade Commission and various states have promulgated and enacted rules and laws that govern telephone and email solicitations. There are numerous state statutes and regulations governing telephone sales activities and email solicitations that do or may apply to our operations, including the operations of our call centers. Federal and state “Do Not Call” regulations must be followed for us to engage in telephone sales activities. In addition, both the federal and state statutes have rules governing commercial email messages restricting the content of the messages, as well as the method and manner of distribution, including requiring certain opt-out mechanisms.
Regulatory Coordination 
State regulators in the U.S. and regulatory agencies outside the U.S. are increasingly coordinating the regulation of internationally active insurance groups through participation in supervisory colleges. A supervisory college, as defined by the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, is a forum for cooperation and communication between the involved supervisors established for the fundamental purpose of facilitating the effectiveness of supervision of entities that belong to an insurance group; facilitating both the supervision of the group as a whole on a group-wide basis; and improving the legal entity supervision of the entities within the insurance group. Our regulators conducted a supervisory college for our insurance group in 2017.
Ireland
AIU is a non-life insurance company organized under the laws of Ireland, and is subject to the regulation and supervision of the Central Bank of Ireland (the “Central Bank”) pursuant to the Insurance Acts 1909 to 2000, as amended (the “Insurance Acts”), and the European Union (Insurance and Reinsurance) Regulations 2015 (the “Regulations”). AIU is authorized to underwrite various classes of non-life insurance business, and, as an Irish authorized insurance company, is permitted to carry on insurance business in any other member state of the European Economic Area by way of freedom to provide services, on the basis that it has notified the Central Bank of its intention to do so, or by way of freedom of establishment, subject to the approval of the Central Bank, and subject to complying with such conditions as may be laid down by the regulator of the jurisdiction in which the insurance activities are carried out for reasons of the “general good.”
Qualifying Shareholders
The Insurance Acts and Regulations require that anyone acquiring or disposing of a direct or indirect holding in an insurance company that represents 10% or more of the capital or voting rights of such company or makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over management of the company (“qualifying holding”) in an insurance company (such as AIU), or anyone who proposes to decrease or increase that holding to 20%, 33%, 50% or such other level of ownership that results in the insurance company becoming the acquirer’s subsidiary (“specified levels”), must first notify the Central Bank of their intention to do so. It also requires any insurance company that becomes aware of any acquisitions or disposals of its capital, such that such holdings amount to a qualifying holding exceeding or falling below the specified levels, to notify the Central Bank. If the Central Bank is not satisfied as to the suitability of the acquirer in view of the necessity to ensure the sound and prudent management of the insurance undertaking, it may oppose the proposed transaction. Under the European Communities (Assessment of Acquisitions in the Financial Sector) Regulations 2009, there is a strict time-frame for the assessment of a proposed transaction, which may take up to 80 working days. 
Any person having a shareholding of 10% or more of the issued share capital in AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. or AmTrust Equity Solutions, Ltd. (the direct parent of AIU) or a 20% or more holding in the intermediate companies between AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. and AmTrust Equity Solutions, Ltd. would be considered to have an indirect holding in AIU at or over the 20% limit. Any change that resulted in the indirect acquisition or disposal of a shareholding of greater than or equal to 10% in the share capital of AIU, or a change that resulted in an increase to or decrease below one of the specified levels, would need to be approved with the Central Bank prior to the transaction. The Central Bank’s approval would be required if any person were to acquire a shareholding equal to or in excess of 10% of AIU’s outstanding common stock or in excess of one of the specified levels.
AIU is required, at such times as may be specified by the Central Bank, and at least once a year, to notify the Central Bank of the names of shareholders possessing qualifying holdings and the size of such holdings.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Restrictions on Dividends
As a matter of Irish company law, AIU is restricted to declaring dividends only out of profits available for distribution, which are a company’s accumulated realized profits less its accumulated realized losses. Such profits may not include profits previously distributed or capitalized and such losses do not include amounts previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. 
Bermuda
Classification
AII is registered as an insurer by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”) under the Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda, as amended (the “Insurance Act - Bermuda”). The BMA is responsible for the day-to-day supervision of insurers and monitors compliance with the solvency and liquidity standards imposed by the Insurance Act - Bermuda. Since January 1, 2016, AII has been registered as a Class 3B insurer. As a Class 3B insurer, AII can carry on general business, broadly including all types of insurance business other than long-term business. AII is also licensed as a Class C insurer to carry on long-term business, which broadly includes life insurance and disability insurance with terms in excess of five years. 
Annual and Quarterly Financial Statements, Annual Statutory Financial Return and Annual Capital and Solvency Return
AII is required to file annually with the BMA financial statements, a statutory financial return and a capital and solvency return, and file quarterly financial statements. The statutory financial return for an insurer includes, among other matters, statutory financial statements, a report of the approved auditor on the statutory financial statements, and, a declaration of compliance confirming compliance with various minimum criteria, including certifying the company meets the minimum solvency margin. Where an insurer’s accounts have been audited for any purpose other than compliance with the Insurance Act - Bermuda, an express statement to that effect must be filed with the statutory financial return. The capital and solvency return includes AII's Bermuda Solvency Capital Return model for a Class 3B insurer, a commercial insurer's solvency self-assessment, a catastrophe risk return and a schedule of loss triangles or reconciliation of net loss reserves, schedule of solvency, financial condition report, an opinion of the company’s loss reserve specialist, a schedule of eligible capital and an economic balance sheet. The capital and solvency return also includes a capital and solvency declaration that the return fairly represents the financial condition of AII in all material respects. AII is also required to file audited U.S. GAAP annual financial statements, which are published by the BMA.
Insurance Code of Conduct
The Insurance Code of Conduct prescribes the duties and standards with which registered insurers must adhere and comply, to ensure that the registered insurer implements sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls. Failure to comply with these requirements is a factor considered by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner. Any failure to comply with the requirements of the Insurance Code of Conduct could result in the BMA exercising its statutory powers of intervention.
Minimum Solvency Margin, Enhanced Capital Requirement and Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions
Under the Insurance Act - Bermuda, the value of the general business assets of a registered Class 3B insurer, such as AII, must exceed the amount of its general business liabilities by an amount greater than the prescribed minimum solvency margin. AII is required, with respect to its general business, to maintain a minimum solvency margin equal to the greatest of the following: (a) 25% of the enhanced capital requirement (“ECR”); (b) $1.0 million; (c) 20% of net premiums written up to $6.0 million plus 15% of net premiums written over $6.0 million; or (d) 15% of loss and other insurance reserves. AII is also required to maintain available statutory capital and surplus at least equal to its ECR. The BMA has also established a target capital level (“TCL”) for each insurer subject to an enhanced capital requirement equal to 120% of its ECR. Failure to maintain statutory capital at least equal to the TCL would likely result in increased regulatory oversight.
AII could not declare or pay dividends during any financial year if it is in breach of its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio or if it would fail to meet such margin or ratio as a result. In addition, BMA approval would be required prior to declaring or paying dividends in any financial year AII failed to meet its minimum solvency margin or minimum liquidity ratio on the last day of any financial year.
As a registered Class 3B insurer, AII is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends of more than 25% of its previous year’s total statutory capital and surplus unless it files with the BMA an affidavit stating it will continue to meet its minimum capital requirements. In addition, AII is prohibited, without the approval of the BMA, from reducing by 15% or more its total statutory capital as set out in its previous year’s financial statements. 
16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

As a registered Class C long-term insurer, AII is required to establish and maintain a long-term business fund and no payment may be made directly or indirectly from AII’s long-term business fund for any purpose other than a purpose related to AII’s long-term business, unless such payment can be made out of any surplus certified by AII’s approved actuary to be available for distribution otherwise than to policyholders. With respect to its long-term business, AII must maintain a minimum solvency margin of the greater of $0.5 million or 1.5% of assets and certain additional restrictions apply to AII’s ability to declare or pay dividends. AII’s approved actuary must certify that AII’s long-term business assets exceeds its long-term business liabilities (based on Bermuda’s Economic Balance Sheet technical provisions) by the amount of the dividend and the greater of $0.5 million or 1.5% of assets, and any such dividend shall not exceed the aggregate of such excess and other funds properly available for the payment of dividends. AII applies annually for an exemption from the Bermuda Solvency Capital Return model for a Class C insurer as AII has not written any long-term insurance business.
Minimum Liquidity Ratio
Under the Insurance Act - Bermuda, an insurer engaged in general business, such as AII, is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities. 
Notification of New or Increased Shareholder Control and Objection to Shareholder Controller
Pursuant to the Insurance Act - Bermuda, any person who becomes a holder of at least 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of our shares or AII’s shares (a “shareholder controller”) must notify the BMA within 45 days of becoming such a holder. AII must also notify the BMA if any person has become or ceased to be a shareholder controller of AII, within 45 days of becoming aware of the relevant facts. For so long as we have a subsidiary that is an insurer registered under the Insurance Act - Bermuda, the BMA may at any time object to a person becoming a new shareholder controller or being a holder of 10% or more of our shares if the BMA determines that the person is not or is no longer fit and proper to be such a holder. In any such case, the BMA may require a shareholder to reduce its holding of our shares and direct, among other things, that such shareholder’s voting rights shall not be exercisable.
Insurance Manager Reporting Requirements
The BMA has regulatory oversight of insurance managers as part of Bermuda's insurance regulatory framework. The BMA introduced the Insurance Manager Code of Conduct and requires insurance managers to file specific details via an Insurance Manager's Return. The Insurance Manager's Return requires, among other things, details around directors and officers of the insurance manager, the services provided by the entity, and details of the insurers managed by the insurance manager.
United Kingdom
AmTrust Europe Ltd. ("AEL"), AMT Mortgage Insurance Limited ("AMIL") and Motors Insurance Company Limited ("MIC") are non-life insurance companies organized under the laws of the United Kingdom (including the Companies Act 2006 and the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 ("FSMA")). As insurance companies, AEL, AMIL and MIC are “dual regulated” by both the Prudential Regulation Authority ("PRA"), a subsidiary of the Bank of England, and the Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"). The stated objective of the United Kingdom government for this dual regulation is to foster a regulatory culture of judgment, expertise and proactive supervision. The FCA takes a more proactive, interventionist approach and has been given a product intervention power that enables it to act quickly to ban or impose restrictions on financial products. The FCA can also make public (through a warning notice), at a much earlier stage in enforcement proceedings, a statement that enables consumers, firms and market users to understand the nature of its concerns that will usually name the company under investigation and, in certain circumstances, name an individual. 
AEL and MIC are both authorized to underwrite various classes of non-life insurance business within the United Kingdom and, for certain of these classes, they are authorized to underwrite risks within some member states of the European Economic Area under the European Council Non-Life Insurance Directives. This is either on a “freedom of services” or on a “freedom of establishment” basis and is subject to complying with such “general good” conditions as may be laid down by the local regulatory authorities. AMIL is a monoline insurer specializing in mortgage insurance and is authorized to underwrite risks within some member states of the European Economic Area under the European Council Non-Life Insurance Directives on both a "freedom of services" and "freedom of establishment" basis.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

Change in Control
The FSMA requires controllers of insurers to be approved by the PRA and the FCA. This includes individuals or corporate bodies who wish to take, or increase, control in an authorized insurer. A change in control also occurs when an existing controller decreases control.
A controller is a person or entity who (i) owns or controls 10% or more of the issued share capital or voting power of the authorized insurer, (ii) owns or controls 10% or more of the issued share capital or voting power of a controller of the authorized insurer, or (iii) who otherwise can exercise significant management control of the authorized insurer or one of its controllers. In the case of AEL, this includes (but is not limited to) AmTrust Financial Services, Inc., AII, AII Insurance Management Limited, AII Reinsurance Broker Ltd., AmTrust Equity Solutions, Ltd., AIL, AmTrust North America, Inc. and Barry Zyskind, Leah Karfunkel and George Karfunkel. In the case of MIC, it also includes the aforementioned and Car Care Plan (Holdings) Limited.
Financial Requirements and Regulatory Guidelines
AEL, AMIL and MIC are required to maintain regulatory capital resources in accordance with the Solvency Capital Requirement ("SCR") determined under Solvency II. The SCR is the amount of funds that an insurance firm is required to hold in the European Union, which covers existing business as well as new business expected over the course of 12 months. The SCR can be calculated under either the Standard Formula approach or by using an Internal Model, which requires PRA approval. As of December 31, 2017, AEL, AMIL and MIC each use the Standard Formula approach to calculate their respective SCR and each have maintained capital resources in excess of their respective required SCR.
Restrictions on Dividends
AEL, AMIL and MIC may only make distributions out of profits available for distribution and only with the PRA’s prior consent. Profits available for distribution are the accumulated, realized profits of an insurer so far as not previously distributed or capitalized, less the insurer's accumulated, realized losses so far as not previously written off in a reduction or reorganization of capital. The test of whether the distribution is legal is applied by reference to relevant accounts complying with specified requirements.
Lloyd's
We participate in the Lloyd’s market through our ownership of AmTrust Syndicates Limited, a managing agent for syndicates 1206, 44, 2526, 1861, 5820 and 779 (the "Lloyd’s managing agent"). The Lloyd’s managing agent is dual-regulated by the FCA and PRA. The Society of Lloyd’s, the FCA and the PRA have statutory responsibilities, including under the Lloyd’s Acts 1871 - 1982 and FSMA, in relation to the supervision of insurance business underwritten in the Lloyd’s markets and the supervision of managing agents operating in the market at Lloyd’s. 
The FCA, the PRA and Lloyd's have complementary objectives in ensuring that the Lloyd's market is appropriately regulated. To minimize duplication, there are arrangements between them for co-operation on supervision and enforcement.
Our Lloyd’s operations are also governed by The Council of Lloyd’s, which, through the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, is responsible for regulating and directing the business of insurance at Lloyd’s in line with its statutory powers, subject to its bylaws and in furtherance of the objects of Lloyd’s. Lloyd’s prescribes, in respect of its managing agents and corporate members, certain minimum standards relating to their management and control, solvency and various other requirements. By entering into a membership agreement with Lloyd’s, our Lloyd’s managing agent undertook to comply with Lloyd’s bylaws and regulations as well as the provisions of the Lloyd’s Acts and the Financial Services and Markets Act that are applicable to it. The operation of syndicates 1206, 44, 2526, 1861, 5820 and 779, as well as the Lloyd’s managing agent and its directors, is subject to the Lloyd’s supervisory regime.
Members of Lloyd’s must support their underwriting capacity by providing a deposit (referred to as “Funds at Lloyd’s” or “FAL”) in the form of cash, securities or letters of credit in an amount determined by Lloyd’s equal to a specified percentage of the member’s underwriting capacity. Each member calculates the amount of such deposit through the completion of an annual capital adequacy exercise and submits the results of this exercise to Lloyd’s for approval. Lloyd’s then advises the member of the amount of deposit that is required. When a managing agent of a syndicate proposes to increase underwriting capacity for the following underwriting year, the consent of the Council of Lloyd’s may be required.
The Council of Lloyd’s has wide discretionary powers to regulate members’ underwriting at Lloyd’s. It may, for instance, change the basis on which syndicate expenses are allocated or vary the FAL ratio or the investment criteria applicable to the

provision of FAL. Exercising any of these powers might affect the return on an investment of the corporate member in a given underwriting year. Further, the annual business plans of a syndicate are subject to the review and approval of the Lloyd’s Franchise Board, which is responsible for setting risk management and profitability targets for the Lloyd’s market and operates a business planning and monitoring process for all syndicates.
If a member of Lloyd’s is unable to pay its debts to policyholders, such debts may be payable by the Lloyd’s Central Fund, which acts similarly to state guaranty funds in the U.S. If Lloyd’s determines that the Central Fund needs to be increased, it has the power to assess premium levies on current Lloyd’s members. The Council of Lloyd’s has discretion to call or assess up to 3% of a member’s underwriting capacity in any one year as a Central Fund contribution.
Solvency II
The European Union’s executive body, the European Commission, implemented a new capital adequacy and risk management regulation called “Solvency II” that applies to our businesses across the European Union (including the United Kingdom) and impacts AEL, AMIL, MIC, our Lloyd's syndicates, AIU and our Luxembourg entities. Solvency II became effective on January 1, 2016 and imposes new requirements with respect to capital structure, technical provisions, solvency calculations, governance, disclosure and risk management.
