 Business

 GENERAL
  
 As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the “Company” refers, unless the context otherwise requires, to PGI Incorporated and its subsidiaries. The Company’s executive offices are at 212 S. Central, St. Louis, Missouri, 63105, and its telephone number is (314) 512-8650.
  
 The Company, a Florida corporation, was founded in 1958, and up until the mid 1990’s was in the business of building and selling homes, developing and selling home sites and selling undeveloped or partially developed tracts of land. Over approximately the last 25 years, the Company’s business focus and emphasis changed substantially as it has concentrated its sales and marketing efforts almost exclusively on the disposition of its remaining real estate. This change was prompted by its continuing financial difficulties due to the principal and interest owed on its debt.
  
 During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, Sugarmill Woods, Inc. (“Sugarmill Woods”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, sold its largest parcel of real estate, approximately 369 acres located in Hernando County, Florida (“the Property”), to the State of Florida Department of Transportation (“Florida DOT”) and a small parcel of land in Citrus County, Florida. The Company’s remaining land inventory consists of 6 single family lots, an approximate 7 acre parcel and some other minor parcels of real estate consisting of easements in Citrus County, Florida, which are owned through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sugarmill Woods. In addition, Punta Gorda Isles Sales, Inc. (“PGIS”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, owns 12 parcels of real estate in Charlotte County, Florida, which total approximately 60 acres, but these parcels have limited value because of associated developmental constraints such as wetlands, easements, and/or other obstacles to development and sale.
  
 As of December 31, 2016, the Company had no employees, and all services provided to the Company are through contract services.
  
 MOST RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
  
 As noted above, during fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, Sugarmill Woods sold the Property to the Florida DOT and a small parcel of land located in Citrus County, Florida to another purchaser. On June 17, 2016 two contracts were executed for the sale of the Property between Sugarmill Woods and the Florida DOT. The property was encumbered by secured creditor claims, and the sale of the Property closed on June 21, 2016 for $9,000,000. The Florida DOT desired to acquire the Property in connection with the northward extension of the Suncoast Parkway as part of the Suncoast Parkway, Project 2.

 The proceeds from the sale of the Property of $9,000,000 were received on June 23, 2016 and payment of the primary lender debt totaling $500,000, in principal, and all accrued interest related to such debt totaling $470,000, was made to PGIP LLC (“PGIP”), the holder of the first mortgage note and an affiliate of the Company. In addition, on June 23, 2016, the remaining principal of the collateralized convertible debentures totaling $1,500,000, and a portion of the accrued interest related to such debentures totaling $5,455,000, was paid to the holders of such debentures. Love Investment Company (“LIC”), and Love-1989 Florida Partners, LP (“Love-1989”), each affiliates of Love-PGI Partners, L.P. (“L-PGI), held such collateralized convertible debentures. Prior to December 31, 2016, L-PGI was the Company’s primary preferred stock shareholder. Effective December 31, 2016, L-PGI liquidated and assigned the 2,260,760 shares of common stock of the Company and 1,875,000 shares of preferred stock of the Company that were held by L-PGI to LIC in conjunction with settling its remaining indebtedness.
