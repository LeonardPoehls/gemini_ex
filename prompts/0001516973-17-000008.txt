Item 1. Business
Our Company
MTGE Investment Corp. (“MTGE”, the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”) was incorporated in Maryland on March 15, 2011 and commenced operations on August 9, 2011 following the completion of our initial public offering (“IPO”). We are externally managed by MTGE Management, LLC (our “Manager,” formerly known as American Capital MTGE Management, LLC). The parent company of our Manager was acquired by AGNC Investment Corp. (“AGNC”), effective July 1, 2016, and as a result of that transaction, we are no longer affiliated with American Capital, Ltd. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MTGE.”
We invest in, finance and manage a leveraged portfolio of real estate-related investments, which we define to include agency residential mortgage-backed securities (“agency RMBS”), non-agency securities, other mortgage-related investments and other real estate investments. Agency RMBS include residential mortgage pass-through certificates and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMOs”) structured from residential mortgage pass-through certificates for which the principal and interest payments are guaranteed by a government-sponsored enterprise (“GSE”), such as Federal National Mortgage Association (“Fannie Mae”) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“Freddie Mac”), or by a U.S. Government agency, such as Government National Mortgage Association (“Ginnie Mae”). Non-agency securities include securities backed by residential mortgages that are not guaranteed by a GSE or U.S. Government agency and credit risk transfer securities (“CRT”). Other mortgage-related investments may include mortgage servicing rights (“MSR”), commercial mortgage-backed securities (“CMBS”), prime and non-prime residential mortgage loans, commercial mortgage loans and mortgage-related derivatives. Other real estate investments may include equity investments in properties subject to long-term triple-net leases operated by third-parties and debt investments in skilled nursing facility and senior housing properties secured by mortgages on the underlying real estate and personal property.
We operate so as to qualify to be taxed as a (“REIT”) under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). As such, we are required to distribute annually at least 90% of our taxable net income. As long as we qualify as a REIT, we will generally not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate taxes on our REIT taxable income to the extent that we distribute all of our annual REIT taxable income to our stockholders. It is our intention to distribute 100% of our taxable net income, after application of available tax attributes, within the limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code, which may extend into the subsequent taxable year.
Investment Strategy
Our principal investment objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of quarterly dividends and net asset value appreciation. In pursuing this objective, we rely on our Manager's expertise to construct and manage a diversified mortgage investment portfolio by identifying asset classes that, when properly financed and hedged, are selected to produce attractive returns across a variety of market conditions and economic cycles, considering the risks associated with owning such investments. Specifically, our investment strategy is designed to:

• | manage an investment portfolio of real estate-related investments;


• | capitalize on discrepancies in relative market valuations for real estate-related investments;


• | manage financing, interest rate, prepayment, extension and credit risks;


• | provide regular quarterly distributions to our stockholders;


• | continue to qualify as a REIT;


• | remain exempt from the requirements of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”);


• | generate attractive risk-adjusted returns; and


• | manage our net asset value risk within reasonable bands.

Targeted Investments
We may invest in, finance and manage real estate-related investments, which we define as agency RMBS, non-agency mortgage investments, other mortgage-related investments and other real estate investments, including the principal assets set forth in each of the following asset classes:
 2

Agency Securities

• | Agency RMBS. Our primary agency securities investments consist of agency pass-through certificates representing interests in “pools” of mortgage loans secured by residential real property. Monthly payments of principal and interest made by the individual borrowers on the mortgage loans underlying the securities, which are guaranteed by a GSE to holders of the securities, are in effect “passed through,” net of fees paid to the issuer/guarantor and servicers of the securities, to the holders of the securities. In general, mortgage pass-through certificates distribute cash flows from the underlying collateral on a pro rata basis among the holders of the securities. Holders of the securities also receive guarantor advances of principal and interest on delinquent loans in the mortgage pools. We also invest in agency CMOs, which are structured instruments representing interests in agency residential pass-through certificates, and interest-only, inverse interest-only and principal-only securities, which represent the right to receive a specified proportion of the contractual interest or principal flows of specific agency CMO securities. 


• | To-Be-Announced Forward Contracts (“TBA”). TBAs are forward contracts to purchase or sell agency RMBS. TBA contracts specify the coupon rate, issuer, term, and face value of the bonds to be delivered, with the actual bonds to be delivered only identified shortly before the TBA settlement date.

Non-Agency Securities

• | Non-agency RMBS. Non-agency RMBS are securities issued by a private institution such as a commercial bank and backed by residential mortgages, for which the payment of principal and interest is not guaranteed by a GSE or government agency. As such, non-agency RMBS can carry a significantly higher level of credit exposure relative to the credit exposure of agency RMBS. Non-agency RMBS are often referred to as private label RMBS. Non-agency RMBS may benefit from credit enhancement derived from structural elements, such as subordination, overcollateralization or insurance. We may purchase highly-rated instruments that benefit from credit enhancement or non-investment grade instruments that absorb credit risk. We focus primarily on non-agency RMBS where the underlying mortgages are secured by residential properties within the United States. Non-agency RMBS are backed by residential mortgages that can be comprised of prime mortgage or non-prime mortgage loans. 


• | CRT. CRT securities are risk sharing instruments that transfer a portion of the risk associated with credit losses within pools of conventional residential mortgage loans from the GSEs and/or third parties to private investors, such as us. Unlike Agency RMBS, full repayment of the original principal balance of CRT securities is not guaranteed by a GSE or other third party; rather, “credit risk transfer” is achieved by writing down the outstanding principal balance of the CRT securities if credit losses on the related pool of loans exceed certain thresholds. By reducing the amount that issuers are obligated to repay to holders of CRT securities, they are able to offset credit losses on the related pool of loans. 

Other Mortgage-Related Investments

• | CMBS. CMBS are securities that are structured utilizing collateral pools comprised of commercial mortgage loans. CMBS can be structured as pass-through securities, where the cash flows generated by the collateral pool are passed on pro rata to investors after netting servicer or other fees, or where cash flows are distributed to numerous classes of securities following a predetermined waterfall, which may give priority to selected classes while subordinating other classes. We may invest across the capital structure of these securities and intend to focus on CMBS where underlying collateral is secured by commercial properties located within the United States. 


• | Mortgage servicing rights. MSR represent the right to service mortgage loans, which involves activities such as collecting mortgage payments, escrowing and paying taxes and insurance premiums, and forwarding principal and interest payments to the mortgage lender. In return for providing these services, the holder of an MSR is entitled to receive a servicing fee, typically specified as a percentage (expressed in basis points) of the serviced loan's unpaid principal balance. We may invest in MSR associated with either agency or non-agency mortgage loans. 


• | Mortgage-related derivatives. As part of our investment and risk management strategy, we may enter into derivative transactions as a method of enhancing our risk/return profile and/or hedging existing or emerging risks within our investment portfolio. These transactions may include, but are not limited to, buying or selling forward positions and credit default swaps. Our Manager's implementation of this strategy is based upon overall market conditions, the level of volatility in the mortgage market, size of our investment portfolio and our qualification as a REIT. 

 3


• | Other mortgage-related investments may also include mortgage REIT equity securities, residential and commercial mortgage loans, excess interest-only instruments and other investments that may arise as the mortgage market evolves.

Other Real Estate Investments
Our other real estate investments include equity investments in healthcare and other senior living facilities which are leased to or operated by third parties who conduct all business operations of the facilities and debt investments secured by such facilities. We would expect such facilities to consist of the following:

• | Skilled Nursing Facilities. Skilled nursing facilities (“SNF”) are licensed healthcare facilities that provide restorative, rehabilitative and nursing care for people not requiring the more extensive and sophisticated treatment available at acute care hospitals. Treatment programs include physical, occupational, speech, respiratory and other therapies, including sub-acute clinical protocols such as wound care and intravenous drug treatment. Charges for these services are generally paid by a combination of government reimbursement and private sources. 


• | Assisted Living Facilities. Assisted living facilities (“ALF”) are licensed healthcare facilities that provide personal care services, support and housing for those who need help with activities of daily living, such as bathing, eating and dressing, yet require limited medical care. The programs and services may include transportation, social activities, exercise and fitness programs, beauty or barber shop access, hobby and craft activities, community excursions, meals in a dining room setting and other activities sought by residents. These facilities are often in apartment-like buildings with private residences ranging from single rooms to large apartments. Certain ALFs may offer higher levels of personal assistance for residents requiring memory care as a result of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia. Levels of personal assistance are based in part on local regulations. 


• | Independent Living Facilities. Independent living facilities (“ILF”), also known as retirement communities or senior apartments, are not healthcare facilities. The facilities typically consist of entirely self-contained apartments, complete with their own kitchens, baths and individual living spaces, as well as parking for tenant vehicles. They are most often rented unfurnished, and generally can be personalized by the tenants, typically an individual or a couple over the age of 55. These facilities offer various services and amenities such as laundry, housekeeping, dining options/meal plans, exercise and wellness programs, transportation, social, cultural and recreational activities, on-site security and emergency response programs.

Investment in Residential Credit Solutions, Inc.
Residential Credit Solutions, Inc. (“RCS”) has approvals from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the requisite state licenses to hold and manage MSR as well as residential mortgage loans, or whole loans. As of December 31, 2016, RCS managed a servicing portfolio of approximately 27 thousand residential mortgage loans, representing approximately $5.3 billion in unpaid principal balances. RCS operates as a servicing oversight platform with respect to its owned MSR, which are subserviced by Ditech Financial (“Ditech”), a subsidiary of Walter Investment Management Corp.
Active Portfolio Management Strategy
Our Manager employs an active management strategy on our behalf designed to achieve our principal objectives of generating attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders through a combination of quarterly dividends and net asset value appreciation. Our Manager chooses investments based on their assessment of relative risk-return profiles and their ability to effectively hedge a portion of the investments' exposure to market risks. The composition of our portfolio and strategies will vary based on our Manager's view of prevailing market conditions and the availability of suitable investment, hedging and funding opportunities. As a result, we may experience investment gains or losses when we sell investments that we believe no longer provide attractive risk-adjusted returns, when we believe more attractive alternatives are available elsewhere, or when we believe it is prudent to reduce aggregate exposure or a particular type of risk embedded in the portfolio. We may also experience gains or losses as a result of our hedging strategies or due to credit losses on our non-agency securities or other real estate related investments.
Financing Strategy
As part of our investment strategy, we leverage our investment portfolio to increase potential returns to our stockholders. We may finance our investments, subject to market conditions, through a combination of financing arrangements, including, but not limited to, repurchase agreements, warehouse facilities, securitizations, term financing facilities and dollar roll transactions. 
 4

We finance our investments primarily by entering into master repurchase agreements. A repurchase transaction acts as a financing arrangement under which we effectively pledge our investment assets as collateral to secure a loan. Our borrowings pursuant to these repurchase transactions generally have maturities that range from 30 to 180 days, but may have maturities of fewer than 30 days or more than one year. Under our repurchase agreements, our financing rate typically tracks short term rates such as one, three or six month London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus or minus a fixed spread.
Our leverage varies depending on market conditions, our portfolio composition and our Manager's assessment of risks and returns. We finance different asset classes through the most efficient means available for a particular asset class at any given time. Therefore, our overall leverage is highly dependent on our investment portfolio composition. We generally expect our leverage to be within four to seven times the amount of our stockholders' equity. However, under certain market conditions, we may operate at leverage levels outside of this range for extended periods of time. 
We seek to diversify our funding exposure by entering into repurchase agreements with multiple counterparties. We had master repurchase agreements with 32 financial institutions as of December 31, 2016. The terms of our master repurchase agreements generally conform to the terms in the standard master repurchase agreement as published by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (“SIFMA”) with respect to repayment, margin requirements and the segregation of all securities sold under the repurchase transaction. In addition, each lender may require that we include supplemental terms and conditions to the standard master repurchase agreement. Typical supplemental terms and conditions include changes to the margin maintenance requirements, purchase price maintenance requirements, requirements that all controversies related to the repurchase agreement be litigated in a particular jurisdiction and cross default provisions. These provisions may differ for each lender and certain of these terms may not be determined until we engage in a specific repurchase transaction. 
We may finance the acquisition of agency RMBS by entering into TBA dollar roll transactions in which we would sell a TBA contract for current month settlement and simultaneously purchase a similar, but not identical, TBA contract for a forward settlement date. Prior to the forward settlement date, we may choose to roll the position out to a later date by entering into an offsetting TBA position, net settling the paired off positions for cash, and simultaneously entering into a similar TBA contract for a later settlement date. In such transactions, the TBA contract purchased for a forward settlement date is priced at a discount to the TBA contract sold for settlement/pair off in the current month. This difference (or discount) is referred to as the “price drop.” The price drop is the economic equivalent of net interest carry income on the underlying agency RMBS over the roll period (interest income less implied financing cost) and is commonly referred to as “dollar roll income.” Consequently, dollar roll transactions represent a form of off-balance sheet financing. In evaluating our overall leverage at risk, our Manager considers both our on-balance and off-balance sheet financing.
We seek to finance the acquisition of our healthcare related real estate investments primarily through long term mortgage debt provided by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Department of Housing Development (“HUD”). We may also finance our healthcare investments through the use of shorter term secured debt or bridge-loan financing obtained from other lenders. 
Risk Management Strategy
We use a variety of strategies to reduce our exposure to market risks, including interest rate, prepayment, extension and credit risks to the extent that our Manager believes is prudent, taking into account our investment strategy, the cost of the hedging transactions and our intention to qualify as a REIT. Our hedging strategies are generally not designed to protect our net asset value from “spread risk” (also referred to as “basis risk”), which is the risk that the yield differential between our investments and our hedges fluctuates. In addition, while we use interest rate swaps and other supplemental hedges to attempt to protect our net asset value against moves in interest rates, we may not hedge certain interest rate, prepayment or extension risks if we believe that bearing such risks enhances our return profile, or if the hedging transaction would negatively impact our REIT status.

• | Interest Rate Risk. We hedge some of our exposure to interest rate mismatches between the interest we earn on our longer term investments and the interest we pay on our shorter term borrowings. Because a majority of our funding costs fluctuate based on short-term interest rate indices, such as the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR and the vast majority of our investments are assets that have fixed rates of interest and could mature in up to 40 years, the interest we earn on these assets generally does not move in tandem with the interest rates that we pay on our funding agreements. We may experience reduced income, losses, or a significant reduction in our net asset value due to adverse interest rate movements. In order to attempt to mitigate a portion of such risk, we utilize certain hedging techniques to attempt to lock in a portion of the net spread between the interest we earn on our assets and the interest we pay on our financing. 

 5

Additionally, because prepayments on residential mortgages generally accelerate when interest rates decrease and slow when interest rates increase, mortgage securities typically have “negative convexity.” In other words, certain mortgage securities in which we invest may increase in price more slowly than similar duration bonds, or even fall in value, as interest rates decline. Conversely, certain mortgage securities in which we invest may decrease in value more quickly than similar duration bonds as interest rates increase. In order to manage this risk, we monitor, among other things, the “duration gap” between our mortgage assets and our hedge portfolio as well as our convexity exposure. Duration is an estimate of the relative expected percentage change in market value of our mortgage assets or our hedge portfolio that would be caused by a parallel change in short and long-term interest rates. Convexity exposure relates to the way the duration of our mortgage assets or our hedge portfolio changes when the interest rate or prepayment environment changes. 
The value of our mortgage assets may also be adversely impacted by fluctuations in the shape of the yield curve or by changes in the market's expectation about the volatility of future interest rates. We analyze our exposure to non-parallel changes in interest rates and to changes in the market's expectation of future interest rate volatility and take actions to attempt to mitigate these risks.

• | Prepayment Risk. Because residential borrowers have the option to prepay their mortgage loans at par at any time, we face the risk that we will experience a return of principal on our investments faster than anticipated. Prepayment risk generally increases when interest rates decline. In this scenario, our financial results may be adversely affected as we may have to invest that principal at potentially lower yields. 


• | Extension Risk. Because residential borrowers have the option to make only scheduled payments on their mortgage loans, rather than prepay their mortgage loans, we face the risk that a return of capital on our investment will occur slower than anticipated. Extension risk generally increases when interest rates rise. In this scenario, our financial results may be adversely affected as we may have to finance our investments at potentially higher costs without the ability to reinvest principal into higher yielding securities because the rate at which borrowers refinance their mortgages, sell the property collateralizing the mortgage, or otherwise pay incremental principal payments occurs at a slower pace than was originally expected. 


• | Credit Risk. We accept mortgage credit exposure at levels our Manager deems prudent within the context of our diversified investment strategy. Therefore, we may retain all or a portion of the credit risk on the loans underlying our non-agency RMBS, as well as any future investments in CMBS and individual residential and commercial mortgages. We seek to manage this risk through prudent asset selection, pre-acquisition due diligence, post-acquisition performance monitoring, and sale of assets where we identify negative credit trends. We may also manage credit risk with credit default swaps or other financial derivatives that our Manager believes are appropriate. 


• | Spread Risk. When the market spread between the yield on our investments and benchmark interest rates widens, our net asset value could decline if the value of our investments falls by more than the offsetting fair value increases on our hedging instruments, creating what we refer to as “spread risk” or “basis risk.” The spread risk associated with our agency and non-agency securities and the resulting fluctuations in the fair value of these securities can occur independent of changes in benchmark interest rates and may relate to other factors impacting the mortgage and fixed income markets, such as actual or anticipated monetary policy actions by the Federal Reserve (“the Fed”), market liquidity, or changes in required rates of return on different assets. 


• | Risks Related to Other Real Estate Investments. Our healthcare and independent living real estate investments are exposed to counterparty risk, including, for our equity investments, the ongoing ability of our tenant (the facility operator) to satisfy its lease obligations, or for our debt investments, the ongoing ability of the borrower (the facility owner) to make principal and interest payments. As such, our healthcare-related investments are heavily dependent upon the successful operation of the facilities by our counterparties. These operators and borrowers may be impacted by factors specific to the healthcare sector, including, but not limited to, regulatory changes, government reimbursement reductions and revisions to licensure or certification requirements. Additionally, healthcare real estate investments are relatively illiquid, generally cannot be sold quickly and may be subject to impairment charges based on factors such as market conditions and operator performance. We seek to manage these risks through detailed pre-transaction due diligence of target properties and associated operators, prudent asset selection, and active post-acquisition monitoring. 

The principal instruments that we use to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate, prepayment and extension risks are interest rate swaps and options to enter into interest rate swaps (“interest rate swaptions”). We also utilize forward contracts 
 6

for the purchase or sale of agency RMBS on a generic pool, or a TBA contract, basis and on a non-generic, specified pool basis, and we utilize U.S. Treasury securities and U.S. Treasury futures contracts, primarily through short sales. We may also purchase or write put or call options on TBA securities and we may invest in other types of mortgage derivatives, such as interest and principal-only securities.
Our hedging instruments are generally not designed to protect our net asset value from spread risk. Consequently, while we use interest rate swaps and other supplemental hedges to attempt to protect our net asset value against moves in interest rates, such instruments typically will not protect our net asset value against spread risk and, therefore, our net asset value could decline.
The risk management actions we take may lower our earnings and dividends in the short term to further our objective of maintaining attractive levels of earnings and dividends over the long term. In addition, some of our hedges are intended to provide protection against larger rate moves and as a result may be relatively ineffective for smaller changes in interest rates. There can be no certainty that our Manager's projections of our exposures to interest rates, prepayments, extension, credit or other risks will be accurate or that our hedging activities will be effective and, therefore, actual results could differ materially.
Income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk may not constitute qualifying gross income under one or both of the gross income tests applicable to REITs. Therefore, we may have to limit our use of certain hedging techniques, which could expose us to greater risks than we would otherwise want to bear, or implement those hedging techniques through a taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”). Implementing our hedges through a TRS could increase the cost of our hedging activities because a TRS would be subject to tax on income and gains.
Our Manager
We are externally managed by our Manager pursuant to the terms of a management agreement. Our Manager is responsible for administering our business activities and day-to-day operations, subject to the supervision and oversight of our Board of Directors. All of our officers and the members of our mortgage investment team and other support personnel, other than employees of RCS, are employees of the parent company of our Manager.
The management agreement with our Manager has a current renewal term through August 9, 2017 and automatic one-year extension options thereafter. The management agreement may be terminated by us without cause, as defined in the management agreement, upon 90 days’ prior written notice to the Manager. Our Manager may terminate the management agreement without cause, as defined in the management agreement, after the completion of the current renewal term, or the expiration of any automatic subsequent renewal term, provided that our Manager provides us 180 days' prior written notice of non-renewal of the management agreement. If we were to terminate the management agreement without cause, we must pay a termination fee on the last day of the applicable term, equal to three times the average annual management fee earned by our Manager during the prior 24-month period immediately preceding the most recently completed month prior to the effective date of termination. We may only terminate the management agreement with or without cause with the consent of a majority of our independent directors. Our Manager is responsible for, among other things, performing all of our day-to-day functions, determining investment criteria in conjunction with our Board of Directors, sourcing, analyzing and executing investments, asset sales and financings and performing asset management duties.
We pay our Manager a base management fee payable monthly in arrears in an amount equal to 1/12 of 1.50% of our month-end stockholders' equity, adjusted to exclude the effect of any unrealized gains or losses included in retained earnings, each as computed in accordance with GAAP. There is no incentive compensation payable to our Manager pursuant to the management agreement. We reimburse our Manager for expenses directly related to our operations incurred by our Manager, excluding employment-related expenses.
Exemption from Regulation Under the Investment Company Act
We conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, in reliance on the exemption provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act. As long as we qualify for this exemption, we will not be subject to leverage and other restrictions imposed on regulated investment companies, which would significantly reduce our ability to use leverage. Section 3(c)(5)(C), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires us to invest at least 55% of our assets in “mortgages and other liens on and interest in real estate” or “qualifying real estate interests” and at least 80% of our assets in qualifying real estate interests and “real estate-related assets.” In satisfying this 55% requirement, based on pronouncements of the SEC staff and in certain instances our own judgment, we treat agency RMBS issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgage loans in which we hold all of the certificates issued by the pool (“whole pool” 
 7

securities) as qualifying real estate interests. We typically treat “partial pool” and other mortgage securities where we hold less than all of the certificates issued by the pool as real estate-related assets.
Real Estate Investment Trust Requirements
We have elected to be taxed as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code. As long as we qualify as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal or state corporate income tax on our taxable net income to the extent that we annually distribute all of our taxable net income to stockholders within the time limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends on our ability to meet on a continuing basis various qualification requirements imposed upon REITs by the Internal Revenue Code, including satisfying certain organizational requirements, an annual distribution requirement and quarterly asset and annual income tests. The REIT asset and income tests are of particular significance as they restrict the extent to which we can invest in certain types of securities and conduct certain hedging activities within the REIT. Consequently, we may be required to limit these activities or conduct them through a TRS. We believe that we have been organized and operate in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a REIT.
Income Tests
In order to continue to qualify as a REIT, we must satisfy two gross income requirements on an annual basis. 

1. | At least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year generally must be derived from investments in real property or mortgages on real property.


2. | At least 95% of our gross income in each taxable year generally must be derived from some combination of income that qualifies under the 75% gross income test described above, as well as other dividends, interest, and gains from the sale or disposition of stock or securities, which need not have any relation to real property.

Interest income constitutes qualifying mortgage interest for purposes of the 75% gross income test described above to the extent that the obligation upon which such interest is paid is secured by a mortgage on real property. We expect that substantially all of our income from our agency and non-agency MBS will continue to be qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. Income from CRT securities is treated as non-qualifying income for the 75% gross income test, which potentially limits our ability to invest in CRT securities.
There is no direct authority with respect to the qualification of income or gains from TBAs as gains from the sale of real estate assets or other qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test. We treat gains from TBAs as qualifying income for purposes of the 75% gross income test and we treat TBAs as qualifying assets for purposes of the 75% asset test described below based on an opinion of legal counsel.
Income and gains that we derive from instruments that we use to hedge the interest rate risk associated with our borrowings incurred to acquire real estate assets will generally be excluded from both the numerator and the denominator for purposes of the 75% and 95% gross income test, provided that specified requirements are met.
Asset Tests
At the close of each calendar quarter, we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets. 

1. | At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by some combination of “real estate assets,” cash, cash items, U.S. Government securities, and, under some circumstances, stock or debt instruments purchased with new capital. For this purpose, mortgage-backed securities and mortgage loans are generally treated as “real estate assets.” Assets that do not qualify for purposes of the 75% asset test are subject to the additional asset tests described below. 


2. | The value of any one issuer's securities that we own may not exceed 5% of the value of our total assets.


3. | We may not own more than 10% of any one issuer's outstanding securities, as measured by either voting power or value. The 5% and 10% asset tests do not apply to securities of a TRS or QRS and the 10% asset test does not apply to “straight debt” having specified characteristics and to certain other securities described below. 


4. | The aggregate value of all securities of all TRSs that we hold may not exceed 25% of the value of our total assets. For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the limit is reduced to 20% of the value of total assets. 

If we should fail to satisfy the income or asset tests, such a failure would not cause us to lose our REIT qualification if we were able to eliminate the discrepancy within a 30 day cure period, in the case of the asset test or satisfy certain relief provisions and pay any applicable penalty taxes and other fines. Please also refer to the “Risks Related to Our Taxation as a 
 8

REIT” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for further discussion of REIT qualification requirements and related items.

Corporate Information
Our executive offices are located at Two Bethesda Metro Center, 12th Floor, Bethesda, MD 20814 and our telephone number is (301) 968-9220.
We make available all of our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports as well as our Code of Ethics and Conduct free of charge on our internet website at www.MTGE.com as soon as reasonably practical after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. These reports are also available on the SEC internet website at www.sec.gov.
Competition
Our success depends, in large part, on our ability to acquire assets at favorable spreads over our borrowing costs. In acquiring mortgage-related investments, we compete with mortgage REITs, mortgage finance and specialty finance companies, savings and loan associations, banks, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, mutual funds, institutional investors, investment banking firms, other lenders, governmental bodies and other entities. These entities and others that may be organized in the future may have similar asset acquisition objectives and increase competition for the available supply of mortgage assets suitable for purchase. Additionally, our investment strategy is dependent on the amount of financing available to us in the repurchase agreement market, which may also be impacted by competing borrowers. Our investment strategy will be adversely impacted if we are not able to secure financing on favorable terms, if at all.
Employees
We are managed by our Manager pursuant to the management agreement between our Manager and us. Other than employees of RCS, we do not have any employees. As of December 31, 2016, RCS had 18 employees.
