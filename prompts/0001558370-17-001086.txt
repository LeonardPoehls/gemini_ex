     Item 1.  Business
     Overview
     Sanchez Energy Corporation (together with our consolidated subsidiaries, “Sanchez Energy,” the “Company,” “we,” “our,” “us” or similar terms), a Delaware corporation formed in August 2011, is an independent exploration and production company focused on the acquisition and development of U.S. onshore unconventional oil and natural gas resources, with a current focus on the horizontal development of significant resource potential from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. We also hold an undeveloped acreage position in the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale (“TMS”) in Mississippi and Louisiana, which offers future upside opportunity. As of December 31, 2016, we have assembled approximately 278,000 net leasehold acres with an approximate 94% average working interest in the Eagle Ford Shale. For the year 2017, we plan to invest substantially all of our capital budget in the Eagle Ford Shale. We continue to evaluate opportunities to increase both our acreage and our producing assets through acquisitions. Our successful acquisition of such assets will depend on both the opportunities and the financing alternatives available to us at the time we consider such opportunities. We have included definitions of some of the oil and natural gas terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K in the “Glossary of Selected Oil and Natural Gas Terms.”
     Listed below is a table of our significant consummated transactions since January 1, 2014:

      * On December 14, 2016, we completed the initial closing of the Cotulla Disposition for cash consideration of approximately $153.5 million. Subsequently, a second closing on an additional portion of the assets was completed for cash consideration of approximately $7.1 million, and the Cotulla Disposition remains subject to post-closing adjustments and potential future closings.
    
On December 14, 2016, the Company completed the initial closing of the Cotulla Disposition (as defined in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures”) for cash consideration of approximately $153.5 million. Subsequent to December 31, 2016, a second closing on an additional portion of the Cotulla Assets was completed for cash consideration of approximately $7.1 million, and the Cotulla Disposition remains subject to post-closing adjustments and potential future closings. The assets sold included (based on the Company’s internal estimates) estimated net proved reserves, as of the effective date of June 1, 2016, of approximately 6.9 MMBoe.  Proved developed reserves are estimated to account for approximately 90% of the total net proved reserves. As of the effective date of June 1, 2016, the Cotulla Assets consisted of approximately 15,000 net acres with 112 gross (93 net) wells producing approximately 3,000 Boe/d.
     On November 22, 2016, the Company completed the disposition of its 50% equity interests in Carnero Processing, LLC (“Carnero Processing”) to SPP, a joint venture that is 50% owned by Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) (“Targa”).  The Company received aggregate cash consideration of approximately $55.5 million and SPP agreed to assume approximately $24.5 million of the Company’s remaining capital contribution commitments in connection

with the acquisition (the “Carnero Processing Disposition”). The purchase price was determined through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and SPP, including independent committees of both entities.
     On November 22, 2016, the Company also completed the Production Asset Transaction (as defined in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures”) cash consideration of $25.6 million after $1.4 million in normal and customary closing adjustments. The purchase price was determined through arm’s length negotiations between the Company and SPP, including independent committees of both entities. The Production Asset Transaction included the disposition of working interests in 23 producing Eagle Ford wellbores located in Dimmit and Zavala counties in South Texas together with escalating working interests in an additional 11 producing wellbores located in the Palmetto Field in Gonzales County, Texas to SPP. The effective date of the Production Asset Transaction was July 1, 2016. 
     On July 5, 2016, the Company completed the disposition of its 50% equity interest in Carnero Gathering, LLC (“Carnero Gathering”) a joint venture that is 50% owned by Targa, to SPP for an initial payment of approximately $37.0 million and the assumption by SPP of the Company’s remaining capital commitments to Carnero Gathering, estimated at approximately $7.4 million as of that date (the “Carnero Gathering Disposition”). In addition, SPP is required to pay the Company an earnout based on natural gas received above a threshold volume and tariff at Carnero Gathering’s delivery points from the Company and other producers. Carnero Gathering owns a total of approximately 45 miles (10 miles of which remain under construction as of December 31, 2016) of high pressure natural gas gathering pipelines that currently connect SPP’s Western Catarina Midstream system to nearby pipelines in South Texas. The Carnero Gathering System is designed to directly connect to a cryogenic natural gas processing plant in South Texas that is expected to be operational in the spring of 2017. The Company’s 50% equity interest in this processing plant was conveyed to SPP in the Carnero Processing Disposition.
     On October 14, 2015, the Company completed the Western Catarina Midstream Divestiture (as defined in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures”) for an adjusted purchase price of $345.8 million in cash. In connection with the closing of the Western Catarina Midstream Divestiture, the Company entered into a Firm Gathering and Processing Agreement (the “Gathering Agreement”) on October 14, 2015 for an initial term of 15 years under which production from approximately 35,000 acres in Dimmit County and Webb County, Texas will be dedicated for gathering by Catarina Midstream, LLC (“Catarina Midstream”). In addition, for the first five years of the Gathering Agreement, SN Catarina, LLC will be required to meet a minimum quarterly volume delivery commitment of 10,200 barrels per day of crude oil and condensate and 142,000 Mcf per day of natural gas, subject to certain adjustments.  
     On March 31, 2015, we completed the Palmetto Disposition (as defined in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data —Note 3, Acquisitions and Divestitures”) for an adjusted purchase price of approximately $83.4 million. The effective date of the transaction was January 1, 2015. The aggregate average working interest percentage initially conveyed was 18.25% per wellbore and, upon January 1 of each subsequent year after the closing, the working interest of the purchaser, a wholly owned subsidiary of SPP, will automatically increase in incremental amounts according to the purchase agreement until January 1, 2019, at which point the purchaser will own a 47.5% working interest, and we will own a 2.5% working interest in each of the wellbores. 
     On June 30, 2014, we completed our acquisition of 106,000 net contiguous acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas (the “Catarina Acquisition”) in the Eagle Ford Shale with an effective date of January 1, 2014. All proved reserves in the Catarina area are covered under lease acreage that is held by production, which acreage amounted to approximately 29,000 acres. Under the lease we have a 100% working interest and 75% net revenue interest in the lease acreage over the Eagle Ford Shale formation from the top of the Austin Chalk formation to the base of the Buda Lime formation. The 77,000 acres of undeveloped acreage that were included in the Catarina Acquisition are subject to a continuous drilling obligation. Such drilling obligation requires us to drill (i) 50 wells in each annual period commencing on July 1, 2014 and (ii) at least one well in any consecutive 120‑day period in order to maintain rights to any future undeveloped acreage. Up to 30 wells drilled in excess of the minimum 50 wells in a given annual period can be carried over to satisfy part of the 50 well requirement in the subsequent annual period on a well for well basis. The lease also created a customary security interest in the production therefrom in order to secure royalty payments to the lessor and

other lease obligations. Our current capital budget and plans include drilling at least the minimum annual well requirement necessary to maintain access to such undeveloped acreage.
     Our Business Strategies
     Our primary business objective is to increase reserves, production and cash flows at an attractive return on invested capital. Our business strategy is currently focused on exploiting long‑life, unconventional oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas reserves from the Eagle Ford Shale as well as other projects that directly enhance the profitability of our oil and gas development activities. Key elements of our business strategy include:
· | Efficiently develop our Eagle Ford Shale leasehold positions. We intend to efficiently drill and develop our acreage position to maximize the value of our resource potential. At December 31, 2016, approximately 67% of our proved reserves were proved undeveloped. As of December 31, 2016, we had 473 net wells, and had identified over 3,000 net locations, for potential future drilling in our Eagle Ford Shale area that will be our primary targets in the near term. In 2017, we plan to invest between $395 million and $440 million on development drilling and completion in the Eagle Ford Shale, which represents 100% of our 2017 drilling and completion budget and 93% of our total 2017 capital budget. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhance returns by focusing on operational and cost efficiencies. We are focused on the improvement of our operating measures and have significant experience in successfully converting early‑stage resource opportunities into cost‑efficient development projects. We believe the magnitude and concentration of our acreage within our core project areas provide us with the opportunity to capture economies of scale, including the ability to directly procure goods and services from manufacturers, drill multiple wells from a single pad, utilize centralized production and fluid handling facilities and implement a line-management approach to improve efficiencies in drilling and completions. In addition, we focus on midstream and other projects that serve our production and add optionality to end markets, ultimately enhancing our realized prices. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Adopt and employ leading drilling and completion techniques. We are focused on enhancing our drilling and completion techniques to maximize recovery of reserves. Industry methods with respect to drilling and completion have significantly evolved over the last several years, resulting in increased initial production rates and recoverable hydrocarbons per well through the implementation of longer laterals, more tightly spaced fracture stimulation stages and large proppant volumes. We evaluate industry drilling results and monitor the results of other operators to improve our operating practices, and we expect our drilling and completion techniques to continue to evolve. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Leverage our relationship with our affiliates to expand unconventional assets. SOG, headquartered in Houston, Texas, is a private full service oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration and development of oil and natural gas primarily in the South Texas and onshore Gulf Coast areas on behalf of its affiliates. The Company refers to SOG and its affiliates (but excluding the Company), collectively, as the “Sanchez Group.” Various members of the Sanchez Group have drilled or participated in over 3,000 wells, directly and through joint ventures, and have invested substantial amounts of capital in the oil and natural gas industry since 1972. During this period, they have carefully cultivated relationships with mineral and surface rights owners in and around our core areas and compiled an extensive technological database that we believe gives us a competitive advantage in acquiring additional leasehold positions in these areas. We have unrestricted access to the proprietary portions of the technological database related to our properties and SOG is otherwise required to interpret and use the database for our benefit. We plan to leverage our affiliates’ expertise, industry relationships and size to opportunistically expand reserves and our leasehold positions in the Eagle Ford Shale and other onshore unconventional oil, condensate, NGL and natural gas resources.

· | Pursue strategic acquisitions to grow our leasehold position in the Eagle Ford Shale and seek opportunistic entry into new basins. We believe that we will be able to identify and acquire additional acreage and producing assets in the Eagle Ford Shale at attractive valuations by leveraging our longstanding relationships in and knowledge of South Texas. We also plan to selectively target additional

domestic basins that would allow us to employ our strategies on attractive acreage positions that we believe are similar to our Eagle Ford Shale acreage.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain substantial financial liquidity and flexibility. As of December 31, 2016, we had a liquidity position of approximately $800 million, consisting of approximately $500 million of cash and cash equivalents and $300 million of availability under our undrawn Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (defined in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data —Note 5, Long‑Term Debt”), which had a $350 million borrowing base (with a $300 million aggregate elected commitment amount). We evaluate our level of operating activity in light of both actual commodity prices and changes we are able to make to our costs of operations and, based upon this evaluation, adjust our capital spending program as appropriate. In addition, we expect to continue to regularly review acquisition opportunities from third parties or other members of the Sanchez Group. We have entered into and intend to continue executing hedging transactions for a significant portion of our expected production to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices.

      Our Competitive Strengths
     We believe the following competitive strengths will allow us to successfully execute our business strategies:
    
· | Geographically concentrated leasehold position in leading North American unconventional oil resource trends. We have assembled a current leasehold position of approximately 278,000 net acres in the Eagle Ford Shale, which we believe to be one of the highest rates of return unconventional oil and natural gas formations in North America. In addition to further leveraging our base of technical expertise in our project areas, our geographically concentrated acreage position allows us to establish economies of scale with respect to drilling, production, operating and administrative costs, in addition to further leveraging our base of technical expertise in our project areas. We believe that our recent well results and offset operator activity in and around our project areas have significantly de‑risked our acreage position such that there are low geologic risks and ample repeatable drilling opportunities across our core operating areas. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Proven low cost operator. We are recognized as one of the lowest cost operators in the Eagle Ford Shale. We utilize a combination of initiatives that have improved the efficiency of our operations and reduced the cost of sourcing goods and services. The Company has implemented systems and processes that provide complete transparency for our well program across our organization thereby eliminating drag and waste on repetitive tasks. We have also segmented and optimized each step in drilling and completing a well. In addition, our supply chain management team takes a rigorous and methodical approach to reducing the total delivered costs of purchased good and services by examining costs on their most granular level. Goods and services are commonly sourced directly from suppliers, eliminating the middleman and their markups. Additionally, we constantly review the value chain for opportunities to internally provide services in order to further reduce, or provide sustainability in, current costs.

· | Demonstrated ability to drive liquids production and reserves growth. Our average production for the full year 2016 was approximately 53,350 Boe/d, substantially all of which was from the Eagle Ford Shale. This compares to approximately 52,600 Boe/d for the full year 2015. Our total proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 192.8 MMBoe, an increase of approximately 51% over the prior year. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Large oil‑weighted multi‑year drilling inventory. We have an inventory of over 3,000 net locations for potential future drilling on our acreage position in the oil, natural gas and condensate, or black oil and volatile oil and gas, windows of the Eagle Ford Shale. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Experienced management and strong technical team. Our team is comprised of individuals with a long history in the oil and natural gas business, and a number of our key executives have prior experience as members of public company management teams. Furthermore, members of the Sanchez Group have a 40‑plus year operating history in the areas in which we operate, providing us with extensive knowledge of the basins and the ability to leverage longstanding relationships with mineral owners. Through SOG, we have access to an experienced staff of oil and natural gas professionals including geophysicists, geologists, drilling and completion engineers, production and reservoir engineers and technical support personnel. SOG’s technical team has significant experience and expertise in applying the most sophisticated

      Core Properties
     Eagle Ford Shale
     We and our predecessor entities have a long history in the Eagle Ford Shale, where, as of December 31, 2016, we have assembled approximately 278,000 net leasehold acres with an approximate 94% average working interest and have over 3,300 gross (3,050 net) locations for potential future drilling. For the year 2017, we plan to invest substantially all of our capital budget in the Eagle Ford Shale. 
     In our Catarina area, we have approximately 106,000 net acres in Dimmit, LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas with a 100% working interest. We anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $2.9 million and $3.3 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. Current Estimated Ultimate Recovery (“EUR”) per well in Catarina is expected to range between 400 MBoe and 1,200 MBoe. We have identified between 1,300 and 1,650 gross and net locations for potential future drilling on our Catarina acreage. For the year 2017, we plan to spend $160 million to $170 million to spud 49 net wells and complete 53 net wells in our Catarina area.
     In our Maverick area, we have approximately 100,000 net acres in Dimmit, Frio, LaSalle, Zavala, and McMullen Counties, Texas with an average working interest of approximately 96%. We believe that our Maverick acreage lies in the black oil window, where we anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $3.0 million and $4.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. Current EUR per well in Maverick is expected to range between 300 MBoe and 400 MBoe. We have identified up to 1,100 gross (1,000 net) locations based on 75 acre well‑spacing for potential future drilling on our Maverick area. For the year 2017, we plan to spend $100 million to $110 million to spud 35 net wells and complete 35 net wells in our Maverick area.
     In our Javelina area, we have approximately 39,500 net acres in LaSalle and Webb Counties, Texas with an average working interest of 100%. Our Javelina acreage encompasses proven Eagle Ford down-dip areas. We currently anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $6.0 million and $7.5 million per well based on our current estimates. We expect average EUR per well in Javelina to range between 1,500 MBoe and 2,500 MBoe. We have identified up to 265 gross (265 net) locations based on 120 acre well-spacing for potential future drilling on our Javelina area. For the year 2017, we do not plan to drill any wells in this area.
     In our Palmetto area, we have approximately 8,000 net acres in Gonzales County, Texas with an average working interest of approximately 49%. We believe that our Palmetto acreage lies in the volatile oil window where we anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $5.5 and $6.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. Current EUR per well in Palmetto is expected to range between 500 MBoe and 600 MBoe. We have identified up to 295 gross (143 net) locations based on 40 acre well‑spacing for potential future drilling in our Palmetto area. For the year 2017, we plan to spend $5 million to $10 million to spud 2 net wells and complete three net wells in our Palmetto area.
     In our Marquis area, we have approximately 21,000 net acres, the majority of which are in southwest Fayette and northeast Lavaca Counties, Texas with a 100% working interest. We believe that our Marquis acreage lies in the volatile oil window, where we anticipate drilling, completion and facilities costs on our acreage to be between $4.0 million and $5.0 million per well based on our current estimates and historical well costs. Current EUR per well in Marquis is expected to range between 275 MBoe and 375 MBoe. We have identified up to 200 gross and net locations based on 60 acre well‑spacing for potential future drilling on our Marquis acreage. For the year 2017, we do not have any planned capital spending on drilling and completions in our Marquis area.

 Tuscaloosa Marine Shale
     In August 2013, we acquired approximately 40,000 net undeveloped acres in what we believe to be the core of the TMS for cash and shares of our common stock (the “TMS Transaction”). In connection with the TMS Transaction, we established an area of mutual interest (“AMI”) in the TMS with SR Acquisition I, LLC (“SR”), a subsidiary of our affiliate Sanchez Resources, LLC (“Sanchez Resources”), which included a carry on drilling costs for up to 6 gross (3 net) wells. As part of the TMS Transaction, we acquired all of the working interests in the AMI owned at closing from three sellers (two third parties and one related party of the Company, SR), resulting in our owning an undivided 50% working interest across the AMI through the TMS formation. 
     Total consideration for the transactions consisted of approximately $70 million in cash and the issuance of 342,760 common shares of the Company, valued at approximately $7.5 million. The total cash consideration provided to SR, an affiliate of the Company, was $14.4 million, before consideration of any well carries. The acquisitions were accounted for as the purchase of assets at cost at the acquisition date. We also committed, as a part of the total consideration, to carry SR for its 50% working interest in an initial 3 gross (1.5 net) TMS wells to be drilled within the AMI (the “Initial Well Carry”) with an option to drill an additional 6 gross (3 net) TMS wells (“Additional Wells”) within the AMI. In August 2015, after completing the Initial Well Carry, the Company signed an agreement with SR whereby the Company paid SR approximately $8 million in lieu of drilling the remaining two Additional Wells (the “Buyout Agreement”). The Buyout Agreement stipulates that SN has earned full rights to all acreage stated in the TMS Transaction and effectively terminates any future well carry commitments.
 As of December 31, 2016, the AMI held rights to approximately 98,000 (64,000 net) acres, of which we owned approximately 45,600 net acres. The TMS development is currently challenged due to high well costs and depressed commodity prices. We believe that the TMS play has significant development potential and still has significant upside as changes in technology, commodity prices, and service prices occur. The average remaining lease term on the acreage is over 2 years, giving us ample time to allow other industry participants to further de‑risk the play.
     Oil and Natural Gas Reserves and Production
     Internal Controls
     Our estimated reserves at December 31, 2016 were prepared by Ryder Scott Company, L.P. (“Ryder Scott”), our independent third-party reserve engineers pursuant to their report dated January 24, 2017, which is filed as an exhibit to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to continue to have our reserve estimates prepared semi‑annually by Ryder Scott. Our internal professional staff works closely with Ryder Scott to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data that is furnished to them for their reserve estimation process. All of the reserve information maintained in our reserve engineering database is provided to the external engineers. In addition, we provide Ryder Scott other pertinent data, such as seismic information, geologic maps, well logs, production tests, material balance calculations, well performance data, operating procedures and relevant economic criteria. We make all requested information, as well as our pertinent personnel, available to the external engineers as part of their evaluation of our reserves. The estimated proved reserves attributable to the Comanche Assets (as defined in “Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that the Comanche Acquisition will be consummated in the anticipated timeframe, on the terms described herein, or at all.”) are as of June 30, 2016, are based on our internal evaluation and interpretation of reserve and other information provided to us in the course of our due diligence with respect to the Comanche Acquisition (as defined in “Item 1A. Risk Factors—There can be no assurance that the Comanche Acquisition will be consummated in the anticipated timeframe, on the terms described herein, or at all.”) and have not been independently verified or estimated.     Technology Used to Establish Reserves
     Under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), proved reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas that by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. The term “reasonable certainty” implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and natural gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate. Reasonable certainty can be established using techniques that have been proven effective by actual production from projects in the same reservoir or 

 
  8

 
an analogous reservoir or by other evidence using reliable technology that establishes reasonable certainty. Reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies (including computational methods) that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation.
     To establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, Ryder Scott employed technologies that have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability. The technologies and economic data used in the estimation of our reserves include, but are not limited to, electrical logs, radioactivity logs, core analyses, geologic maps and available downhole and production data, seismic data and well test data. Reserves attributable to producing wells with sufficient production history were estimated using appropriate decline curves or other performance relationships. Reserves attributable to producing wells with limited production history and for undeveloped locations were estimated using performance from analogous wells in the surrounding area and geologic data to assess the reservoir continuity. These wells were considered to be analogous based on production performance from the same formation and completion using similar techniques.
     Qualifications of Responsible Technical Persons

       (1)Our estimated net proved reserves and related standardized measure were determined using index prices for oil and natural gas, without giving effect to commodity derivative contracts, held constant throughout the life of our properties. The unweighted arithmetic average first‑day‑of‑the‑month prices for the prior twelve months were $42.75/Bbl for WTI Cushing oil, $19.97/Bbl for NGLs and $2.49/MMBtu for Henry Hub natural gas at December 31, 2016. These prices were adjusted by lease for quality, transportation fees, geographical differentials, marketing bonuses or deductions and other factors affecting the price realized at the wellhead. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the average realized prices for oil, NGLs and natural gas were $37.95 per Bbl, $13.72 per Bbl and $2.50 per Mcf, respectively. For a description of our commodity derivative contracts, please read “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Operating Costs and Expenses—Commodity Derivative Transactions” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and

Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Derivative Instruments.”
     (2)  One Boe is equal to six Mcf of natural gas or one Bbl of oil or NGLs based on a rough energy equivalency. This is a physical correlation and does not reflect a value or price relationship between the commodities.
     (3)  Standardized measure is calculated in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”), Topic 932, Extractive Activities—Oil and Gas. For further information regarding the calculation of the standardized measure, see “Supplementary Information on Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Development and Production Activities (Unaudited)” included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
     The data in the table above represents estimates only. Oil, NGLs and natural gas reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, NGLs and natural gas that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil, NGLs and natural gas that are ultimately recovered. For a discussion of risks associated with reserve estimates, please read “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our estimated reserves and future production rates are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our estimated reserves.”
     Future prices realized for production and costs may vary, perhaps significantly, from the prices and costs assumed for purposes of these estimates. The standardized measure amounts shown above should not be construed as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The 10% discount factor used to calculate standardized measure, which is required by Financial Accounting Standard Board (“FASB”) pronouncements, is not necessarily the most appropriate discount rate. The present value, no matter what discount rate is used, is materially affected by assumptions as to timing of future production, which may prove to be inaccurate.
     Development of Proved Undeveloped Reserves
     None of our proved undeveloped reserves (“PUD”) at December 31, 2016 are scheduled to be developed on a date more than five years from the date the reserves were initially booked as proved undeveloped. Historically, our drilling and development programs were substantially funded from capital contributions, cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and equity securities. Based on our current expectations of our cash flows and drilling and development programs, which includes drilling of proved undeveloped locations, we believe that we can fund the drilling of our current inventory of proved undeveloped locations and our expansions and extensions in the next five years from our cash on hand combined with cash flow from operations and utilization of available borrowing capacity under our credit facility.
     At a pace of approximately 30 wells per rig per year, our current 293 PUD drilling locations will all be developed within the next five years by running an average gross rig count of two rigs. As of December 31, 2016, we were running two active rigs and have an approved annual budget that allows for approximately six rigs to be run through 2017. For a more detailed discussion of our liquidity position, please read “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources.”

 As of December 31, 2016, we identified 293 gross (282 net) PUD drilling locations which we anticipate drilling within the next five years. The table below details the activity in our PUD locations from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016:

PUDs as of December 31, 2016 | 46,332 | 37,606 | 268,136 | 128,627 

      Excluding acquisitions, we expect to make capital expenditures related to drilling and completion of wells of approximately $265 million to $290 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. We plan to spend approximately 80% to 88% of these capital expenditures on development of PUDs in 2017. Technical revisions of PUD estimates are the result of changes in forecasted performance. There are net positive changes on our PUD forecast driven by better performance on our Catarina asset. As a result of price change, 131 PUD locations were removed. The total PUD volume impacted by price changes are 37.2 MMBoe as a result of locations that were removed from our Catarina, Cotulla, Marquis and Palmetto assets.        For more information about our historical costs associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves, please read “Supplementary Information on Oil and Natural Gas Exploration, Development and Production Activities (Unaudited)” included in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
     Reconciliation of PV‑10 to Standardized Measure
     PV‑10 is derived from the Standardized Measure of discounted future net cash flows, which is the most directly comparable financial measure in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). PV‑10 is a computation of the Standardized Measure on a pre‑tax basis. PV‑10 is equal to the Standardized Measure at the applicable date, before deducting future income taxes, discounted at 10%. We believe that the presentation of PV‑10 is relevant and useful to investors because it presents the discounted future net cash flows attributable to our estimated net proved reserves prior to taking into account future corporate income taxes, and it is a useful measure for evaluating the relative monetary significance of our oil and natural gas properties. Further, investors may utilize the measure as a basis for comparison of the relative size and value of our reserves to other companies. We use this measure when assessing the potential return on investment related to our oil and natural gas properties. PV‑10, however, is not a substitute for the Standardized Measure. Our PV‑10 measure and the Standardized Measure do not purport to present the fair value of our oil and natural gas reserves.

      As of December 31, 2016, approximately 58% of our acreage was held by production. As of December 31, 2016, we have leases that were not held by production and not impaired representing 8,768 net acres (all which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2017, 15,539 net acres (all of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2018, and 105,859 net acres (94,088 of which were in the Eagle Ford Shale) expiring in 2019 and beyond. We anticipate that our current and future drilling plans along with selected lease extensions will address the majority of our leases expiring in the Eagle Ford Shale in 2017 and beyond. In addition to these lease expirations, we also have a continuous development obligation in our Catarina area that requires us to drill, but not complete, (i) 50 wells in each annual period commencing on July 1, 2014 and (ii) at least one well in any consecutive 120 day period in order to maintain rights to any future undeveloped acreage.
     Delivery Commitments
     We have made commitments to certain purchasers to deliver a portion of our natural gas production from our Catarina area. 
     As of December 31, 2016, in our Catarina area, we have three contracts that require us to deliver portions of our natural gas, with delivery requirements through 2020, 2021 and 2022, respectively. Under our contract expiring in 2020, we are required to deliver 207 Bcf of natural gas through the Catarina Midstream gathering facilities. Under our contract expiring in 2021, we are required to deliver approximately 79 Bcf of natural gas. Under our contract expiring in 2021, which begins in 2017, we are required to deliver approximately 228 Bcf of natural gas. During 2016, we recorded expenses related to deficiencies on delivery commitments of approximately $1.6 million. These amounts were recorded to natural gas production expenses in our consolidated statement of operations and were not considered material to the financial statement line item or to the consolidated financial statements as a whole. We do not expect to have additional expenses in 2017 related to deficiencies on our natural gas delivery commitments.
     Also in our Catarina area, we have one contract that requires us to deliver a portion of our oil production through the Catarina Midstream gathering facilities. This contract expires in 2020 and requires us to deliver approximately 15 MMBbls of oil. We do not expect to have additional expenses in 2017 related to deficiencies on our oil delivery commitments.
     Operations
     Oil and Natural Gas Leases
     The typical oil and natural gas lease agreement covering our properties provides for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any well drilled on the lease premises. The lessor royalties 

 
  16

 
and other leasehold burdens on our Eagle Ford properties range from 20.8% to 36.7%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us ranging from 63.3% to 79.2%.
     Marketing and Major Customers
     For the year ended December 31, 2016, purchases by three of our customers accounted for more than 10% (33%, 20%, and 14%, respectively) of our total revenues. The three customers, who are not affiliates of the Company, purchased oil, NGLs and natural gas production from us pursuant to existing marketing agreements with terms that are currently on “evergreen” status and renew on a month‑to‑month basis until either party gives 30‑day advance written notice of non‑renewal.
     Since the oil, NGLs and natural gas that we sell are commodities for which there are a large number of potential buyers and because of the adequacy of the infrastructure to transport oil, NGLs and natural gas in the areas in which we operate, if we were to lose one or more customers, we believe that we could readily procure substitute or additional customers such that our production volumes would not be materially affected for any significant period of time.
     Hedging Activities
     We enter into commodity derivative contracts with unaffiliated third parties to achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to short‑term fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices. For a more detailed discussion of our hedging activities, please read “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Operating Costs and Expenses—Commodity Derivative Transactions,” “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates—Derivative Instruments” and “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”     Competition
     We operate in a highly competitive environment for leasing and acquiring properties and in securing trained personnel. Our competitors specifically include major and independent oil and natural gas companies that operate in our project areas. These competitors include, but are not limited to, Carrizo Oil & Gas, Inc., Chesapeake Energy Corporation, EOG Resources, Inc., Marathon Oil Corporation, SM Energy Company and Noble Energy, Inc. Many of our competitors possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours, which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects, as well as evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to find and develop reserves will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry.
     We are also affected by the competition for and the availability of equipment, including drilling rigs, completion equipment and materials. We are unable to predict when, or if, shortages of such equipment may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation programs.
     Title to Properties
     Prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas properties, we perform title reviews on significant leases, and depending on the materiality of properties, we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions. As a result, title examinations have been obtained on a significant portion of our properties. After an acquisition, we review the assignments from the seller for scrivener’s and other errors and execute and record corrective assignments as necessary.
     As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we initially conduct only a cursory review of the titles to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves. Prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties, we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects. To the 

 
  17

 
extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties, we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense. We generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property.
     We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material assets. Although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases, such as customary interests generally retained in connection with the acquisition of real property, customary royalty interests and contract terms and restrictions, liens under operating agreements, liens related to environmental liabilities associated with historical operations, liens for current taxes and other burdens, easements, restrictions and minor encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry, we believe that none of these liens, restrictions, easements, burdens and encumbrances will materially detract from the value of these properties or from our interest in these properties or materially interfere with our use of these properties in the operation of our business. In addition, we believe that we have obtained sufficient rights‑of‑way grants and permits from public authorities and private parties for us to operate our business in all material respects as described in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
     Seasonal Nature of Business
     Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months, resulting in seasonal fluctuations in the price we receive for our natural gas production. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations.     Environmental Matters and Regulation
     General
     Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of the environment or occupational health and safety. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the Texas Railroad Commission (“Commission”), issue regulations, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures that carry substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties and may result in injunctive obligations for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may, among other things (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling, production and transportation activities; (iii) govern the sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process; (iv) limit or prohibit drilling or injection activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, seismically active areas, and other protected areas; (v) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; (vi) result in the suspension or revocation of necessary permits, licenses and authorizations; (vii) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations; and (viii) require that additional pollution controls be installed. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations. Furthermore, liability under such laws and regulations is often strict (i.e., no showing of “fault” is required) and can be joint and several. 
     These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, The U.S. Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.

 The trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. Any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage transport, disposal, or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we could incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While we believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing 
 requirements will not materially affect us, there is no assurance that this situation will continue in the future. 
     The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
     Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling
     Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict and, in some cases, joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, or CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons considered to be responsible for the release, deemed “responsible parties,” of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the current owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, past owners or operators at the time a hazardous substance was released at the site, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons are subject to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover the costs they incur from the responsible classes of persons. It is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file common law-based claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, and despite the “petroleum exclusion” of Section 101(14) of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we may have liability for releases of hazardous substances at our properties by prior owners or operators or other third parties. 
     The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, as amended, or RCRA, and comparable state statutes and their implementing regulations, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the auspices of the EPA, most states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Federal and state regulatory agencies can seek to impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for alleged non-compliance with RCRA and analogous state requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development, and production of oil or natural gas, if properly handled, are exempt from regulation as hazardous waste under Subtitle C of RCRA. These wastes, instead, are regulated under RCRA's less stringent solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws. It is possible, however, that certain oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future and therefore be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. Indeed, legislation has been proposed from time to time in The U.S. Congress to re-categorize certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes.” Also, in December 2016, the EPA agreed in a consent decree to review its regulations of oil and gas waste.  It has until March 2019 to determine whether any revisions are necessary. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs 

 
  19

 
to manage and dispose of wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. 
     We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the requirements of CERCLA, RCRA, and related state and local laws and regulations, that we hold all necessary and up-to-date permits, registrations and other authorizations required under such laws and regulations and that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake response or corrective measures, which could include removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, cleanup of contaminated property or performance of remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination.
     Water and Other Water Discharges and Spills
 The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, as amended, also known as the Clean Water Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, or the SDWA, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or the OPA, and analogous state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including oil, produced waters and other hazardous substances, into federal and state waters. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by EPA or an analogous state agency. The discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, is also prohibited, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. The underground injection of fluids is subject to permitting and other requirements under state laws and regulation. 
     Furthermore, the EPA is examining regulatory requirements for “indirect dischargers” of wastewater – i.e., those that send their discharges to private or publicly owned treatment facilities, which treat the wastewater before discharging it to regulated waters. On June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment, or CWT, facilities) accepting oil and gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.
 Costs may be associated with the treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Obtaining permits also has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs. 
 The OPA amends the Clean Water Act and establishes strict liability and natural resource damages liability for unauthorized discharges of oil into waters of the United States. The OPA is the primary federal law imposing oil spill liability. The OPA contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to petroleum releases into waters of the United States, including the requirement that operators of offshore facilities and certain onshore facilities near or crossing waterways must maintain certain significant levels of financial assurance to cover potential environmental cleanup and restoration costs.  The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict liability that, in some circumstances, may be joint and several for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a 

 
  20

 
release, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. 
 Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and the underground injection of fluids and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure, or SPCC plans, in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.  We maintain all required discharge permits necessary to conduct our operations, and we believe we are in substantial compliance with their terms. 
     Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing
     Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common process used by oil and natural gas exploration and
 production operators in the completion of certain oil and natural gas wells whereby water, sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate production of oil and/or natural gas. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act, or SDWA, regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control, or UIC, Program.  Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC Program, and thus the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. The EPA, however, has asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the UIC Program. On February 12, 2014, the EPA published a revised UIC Program guidance for oil and natural gas hydraulic fracturing activities using diesel fuel. The guidance document describes how regulations of Class II wells, which are those wells injecting fluids associated with oil and natural gas production activities, may be tailored to address the purported unique risks of diesel fuel injection during the hydraulic fracturing process. Although the EPA is not the permitting authority for UIC Class II programs in Texas, Mississippi, and Louisiana, where we maintain acreage, the EPA is encouraging state programs to review and consider use of the above-mentioned guidance.  In addition, the EPA plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by June 2018, which would describe a proposed mechanism - regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both - to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures.  Furthermore, legislation to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed in recent sessions of The U.S. Congress.
     The protection of groundwater quality is extremely important to us. We believe that we follow all state and federal regulations and apply industry standard practices for groundwater protection in our operations. These measures are subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators. Our policy and practice is to follow all applicable guidelines and regulations in the areas where we conduct hydraulic fracturing. Accordingly, we set surface casing strings below the deepest usable quality fresh water zones and cement them back to the surface in accordance with applicable regulations, potential lease requirements and other legal requirements to ensure protection of existing fresh water zones. Also, prior to commencing drilling operations for the production portion of the hole, the surface casing strings are pressure tested to ensure mechanical integrity.
     Although not presently relevant to our current 2017 development plans, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, implementation of a casing and cementing program, management of recovered fluids, and submission to BLM of detailed information about the proposed operation, including wellbore geology, the location of faults and fractures, and the depths of all usable water. On June 21, 2016, the United States District Court for Wyoming set aside the rule, holding that the BLM lacked Congressional authority to promulgate the rule. The BLM has appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals.
 Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, on December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing to impact drinking water resources finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic 

 
  21

 
activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing.
 These ongoing or proposed studies, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells under the SDWA or other regulatory mechanism. 
 Also, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances or otherwise require the public disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in December 2011, the Commission adopted rules and regulations requiring that oil and gas operators publicly disclose the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. Also, in May 2013, the Commission adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. The new rules took effect in January 2014. Additionally, on October 28, 2014, the Commission adopted disposal well rule amendments designed, amongst other things, to require applicants for new disposal wells that will receive non-hazardous produced water and hydraulic fracturing flowback fluid to conduct seismic activity searches utilizing the U.S. Geological Survey. The searches are intended to determine the potential for earthquakes within a circular area of 100 square miles around a proposed, new disposal well. The disposal well rule amendments, which became effective on November 17, 2014, also clarify the Commission's authority to modify, suspend or terminate a disposal well permit if scientific data indicates a disposal well is likely to contribute to seismic activity. The Commission has used this authority to deny permits for waste disposal sites. 
     A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country alleging that hydraulic fracturing practices have induced seismic activity and adversely impacted drinking water supplies, use of surface water, and the environment generally. Several states and municipalities have adopted, or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances.  These or any other new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing or the disposal of produced water and flowback fluid in underground injection wells could make it more difficult or costly for us to drill and produce from conventional and tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings. 
 Further federal, state and/or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing could result in additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business that may arise if additional federal or state and/or local laws are enacted. 
     Air Emissions
     The federal Clean Air Act, as amended, or the CAA, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that subject oil and natural gas production, processing, transmission, and storage operations to regulation under the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”) programs. The rule includes NSPS for completions of hydraulically fractured gas wells and establishes specific new requirements for emissions from compressors, controllers, dehydrators, storage vessels, natural gas processing plants and certain other equipment. The final rule seeks to achieve a 95% reduction in Volatile Organic Compounds (“VOCs”) emitted by requiring the use of reduced emission completions or "green completions" on all hydraulically fractured wells constructed or refractured after January 1, 2015. The EPA received numerous requests for reconsideration of these rules from both industry and the environmental community, and court challenges to the rules were also filed. In response, the 

 
  22

 
EPA has issued, and will likely continue to issue, revised rules responsive to some of the requests for reconsideration. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and VOC emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector. On the same day, the EPA finalized a plan to implement its minor new source review program in Indian country for oil and natural gas production, and it issued for public comment an information request that will require companies to provide extensive information instrumental for the development of regulations to reduce methane emissions from existing oil and gas sources. 
     Also, on November 15, 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and gas operations on federal and Indian lands. The rule requires operators to use currently available technologies and equipment to reduce flaring, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, and replace outdated equipment that vents large quantities of gas into the air. The rule also clarifies when operators owe the government royalties for flared gas.  State and industry groups have challenged this rule in federal court, asserting that the BLM lacks authority to prescribe air quality regulations. In addition, Congress has taken certain initial steps to repeal the rule pursuant to the Congressional Review Act, though it remains uncertain whether the rule will ultimately be repealed.
 These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects, and our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations and, potentially, criminal enforcement actions. While we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next few years for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions-related issues, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
     Climate Change
     In recent years, federal, state and local governments have taken steps to reduce emissions of GHGs. The EPA has finalized a series of GHG monitoring, reporting and emission control rules for the oil and natural gas industry, and the U.S. Congress has, from time to time, considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions. Almost one-half of the states have already taken measures to reduce emissions of GHGs primarily through the development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap-and-trade programs.
     Furthermore, in December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties (COP-21) of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016 and establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions.  Also, on June 29, 2016, the leaders of the United States, Canada and Mexico announced an Action Plan to, among other things, boost clean energy, improve energy efficiency, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Action Plan specifically calls for a reduction in methane emissions from the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. It remains unclear whether and how the results of the 2016 U.S. election could impact the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions at the federal and state level.
 Restrictions on GHG emissions that may be imposed could adversely affect the oil and natural gas industry. The adoption of any legislation or regulations that otherwise limit emissions of GHGs from our equipment and operations, could require us to incur increased operating costs to monitor and report on GHG emissions or reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory requirements. Any GHG emissions legislation or regulatory programs applicable to power plants or refineries could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce. Consequently, legislation and regulatory programs to reduce GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 
 In addition, claims have been made against certain energy companies alleging that GHG emissions from oil and natural gas operations constitute a public nuisance under federal and/or state common law. As a result, private individuals may seek to enforce environmental laws and regulations against us and could allege personal injury or 

 
  23

 
property damages. While our business is not a party to any such litigation, we could be named in actions making similar allegations. An unfavorable ruling in any such case could significantly impact our operations and could have an adverse impact on our financial condition.
 Moreover, there has been public discussion that climate change may be associated with extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornados and snow or ice storms, as well as rising sea levels. Another possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Some studies indicate that climate change could cause some areas to experience temperatures substantially colder than their historical averages. Extreme weather conditions can interfere with our production and increase our costs and damage resulting from extreme weather may not be fully insured. However, at this time, we are unable to determine the extent to which climate change may lead to increased storm or weather hazards affecting our operations.
     National Environmental Policy Act
     Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, as amended, or NEPA. NEPA requires federal agencies, including the DOI, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will prepare an Environmental Assessment to evaluate the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that may be made available for public review and comment. Currently, we have minimal exploration and production activities on federal lands. However, to the extent our current or future activities on federal lands are subject to the requirements of NEPA, this process has the potential to delay the receipt of governmental permits and the development of oil and natural gas projects. Authorizations under NEPA also are subject to protest, appeal or litigation, which can delay or halt projects.     Endangered Species Act
     The Federal Endangered Species Act, or the ESA, and analogous state statutes restrict activities that may adversely threatened or endangered species or their habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Federal agencies are required to insure that any action authorized, funded or carried out by them is not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species or modify their critical habitat. While some of our facilities on federal lands may be located in areas that are designated as habitat for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may identify, however, previously unidentified endangered or threatened species or may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of a threatened or endangered species, which could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected areas.     Occupational Safety and Health Act
     We are also subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA's hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the OSHA requirements.     Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Additionally, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations that are binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the oil and natural gas industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.

 Drilling and Production
     Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties and municipalities, in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:
· | the location of wells;
--+-----------------------


· | the method of drilling and casing wells;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | the disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the plugging and abandoning of wells; and
--+------------------------------------------


· | notice to surface owners and other third parties.
--+--------------------------------------------------

      State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration, while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. 
     Natural Gas Regulation
 The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation. FERC's regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas. 
 The FERC also possesses regulatory oversight over natural gas markets, including the purchase, sale and transportation activities of non-interstate pipelines and other natural gas market participants. FERC possesses substantial enforcement authority for violations of the Natural Gas Act, or NGA, including the ability to assess civil penalties, order disgorgement of profits and recommend criminal penalties. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 amended the NGA to grant FERC new authority to facilitate price transparency in markets for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce, and to prohibit market manipulation. FERC's anti-manipulation regulations apply to FERC jurisdictional activities, which have been broadly construed by the FERC. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rules, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial civil and criminal penalties, including civil penalties of up to $1.0 million per day, per violation. 
 In 2008, FERC took additional steps to enhance its market oversight and monitoring of the natural gas industry. Order No. 704, as clarified in orders on rehearing, requires buyers and sellers of natural gas above a de minimis level, including entities not otherwise subject to FERC jurisdiction, to submit an annual report to FERC describing their wholesale physical natural gas transactions that use an index or that contribute to or may contribute to the formation of a gas index. The FERC also contemplated expanding the industry's reporting requirements. On November 15, 2012, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking comments whether requiring quarterly reporting of every gas transaction within the FERC's jurisdiction that entails physical delivery for the next day or the next month would provide useful information for improving natural gas market transparency.  The FERC ultimately determined that imposing a quarterly 

 
  25

 
reporting requirement is not necessary at this time and exercised its discretion to terminate the Notice of Inquiry on November 17, 2015. 
 Although natural gas prices are currently unregulated, The U.S. Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by The U.S. Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of our properties. Sales of condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. 
     State Regulation
     The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill.
     The oil and natural gas industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
     Employees
     We currently do not have any employees. Pursuant to our Services Agreement with SOG (the “Services Agreement”), SOG performs services for us, including the operation of our properties. Please also read “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data —Note 9, Related Party Transactions.” As of December 31, 2016, SOG had approximately 235 employees, including 27 engineers, 13 geoscientists and 13 land professionals. None of these employees are represented by labor unions or covered by any collective bargaining agreement. We believe that SOG’s relations with its employees are satisfactory.
     We also contract for the services of independent consultants involved in land, engineering, regulatory, accounting, financial and other disciplines as needed.
     Offices
     For our principal offices, we currently share offices with other members of the Sanchez Group under leases entered into by the Company covering approximately 90,000 square feet of office space in Houston, Texas at 1000 Main Street, Suite 3000, Houston, Texas 77002, expiring in 2025.
