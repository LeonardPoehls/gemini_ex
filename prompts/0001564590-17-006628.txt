ITEM 1: BUSINESS
General
 We are a publicly traded (OTCQX: ATLS) Delaware limited liability company formed in October 2011. Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “Atlas Energy Group, LLC,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our” and “our company,” refer to Atlas Energy Group, LLC, and our combined and consolidated subsidiaries.
 On February 27, 2015, our former owner, Atlas Energy, L.P. (“Atlas Energy”), transferred its assets and liabilities, other than those related to its midstream assets, to us, and effected a pro rata distribution of our common units representing a 100% interest in us, to Atlas Energy’s unitholders (the “Separation”). Concurrently with the distribution of our units, Atlas Energy and its remaining midstream interests merged with Targa Resources Corp. (“Targa”; NYSE: TRGP) and ceased trading.
 Our operations primarily consisted of our ownership interests in the following:
  
• | During the period September 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, Titan, an independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs with operations in basins across the United States. Titan Management holds the Series A Preferred Share of Titan, which entitles us to receive 2% of the aggregate of distributions paid to shareholders (as if we held 2% of Titan’s members’ equity, subject to potential dilution in the event of future equity interests and to appoint four of seven directors). As discussed further below, Titan is the successor to the business and operations of ARP;

• | Through August 31, 2016, 100% of the general partner Class A units, all of the incentive distribution rights, and an approximate 23.3% limited partner interest (consisting of 24,712,471 common limited partner units) in ARP. As discussed further below, ARP was the predecessor to the business and operations of Titan;

• | 12.0% limited partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners, L.P. (“Lightfoot L.P.”) and a 15.9% general partner interest in Lightfoot Capital Partners GP, LLC (“Lightfoot G.P.” and together with Lightfoot L.P., “Lightfoot”), the general partner of Lightfoot L.P., an entity for which Jonathan Cohen, Executive Chairman of our board of directors, is the Chairman of the board of directors. Lightfoot focuses its investments primarily on incubating new MLPs and providing capital to existing MLPs in need of additional equity or structured debt.

Our cash flows and liquidity are substantially dependent upon AGP’s annual management fee and distributions from AGP, Lightfoot, and Titan. Neither AGP nor Titan are currently paying distributions. Though we consolidate the operations of AGP (and, prior to July 27, 2016, we consolidated the operations of ARP) for financial reporting purposes, AGP’s annual management fee and distributions from Lightfoot are currently our only sources of liquidity to satisfy our obligations under our credit agreements.  In addition, the obligations under our first lien credit agreement mature in September 2017. As a result, we continue to face liquidity issues and are currently considering, and are likely to make, changes to our capital structure to maintain sufficient liquidity, meet our debt obligations and manage and strengthen our balance sheet. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business— Our long term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time, and we are currently considering, and are likely to make, changes to our capital structure to maintain sufficient liquidity, meet our debt obligations and manage and strengthen our balance sheet.”
 AGP Overview
 
AGP’s primary business objective is to generate an attractive total return, consisting of current distributions and capital appreciation, through the acquisition of oil and gas assets in North America. As of December 31, 2016, AGP’s estimated proved reserves were 23 Bcfe. Of the estimated proved reserves, approximately 30% were proved developed and approximately 87% were oil. For the year ended December 31, 2016, its average daily net production was approximately 5.7 MMcfe. 
 On November 2, 2016, AGP’s Board of Directors determined to suspend its quarterly common unit distributions, beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2016, in order retain its cash flow and reinvest in its business and assets  At this time, AGP can provide no certainty as to when or if distributions will be reinstituted.
 As of December 31, 2016, AGP’s production positions were in the following areas:
 8


Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford Shale is an Upper Cretaceous-age formation that is prospective for horizontal drilling in approximately 26 counties across South Texas. Target vertical depths range from 4,000 to some 11,000+ feet with thickness from 40 to over 400 feet. The Eagle Ford formation is considered to be the primary source rock for many conventional oil and gas fields including the prolific East Texas Oil Field, one of the largest oil fields in the contiguous United States. AGP owns oil, natural gas and NGL interests in approximately 2,833 net acres, of which 1,592 are undeveloped, non-producing net acres and 704 are developed net acres, in the Eagle Ford Shale in Atascosa County, Texas. AGP acquired its Eagle Ford position through a series of acquisitions in 2014 and 2015 for approximately $100 million. During the year, AGP averaged 5.3 MMcfe/d net production volumes. AGP estimates 23 Bcfe of total proved reserves for its Eagle Ford position, of which 89% are oil. 
 Marble Falls. The Marble Falls play is Pennsylvanian-age formation located above the Barnett Shale and beneath the Atoka at depths of approximately 5,500 feet and ranges in thickness from 50 and 500 feet. AGP owns oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids interests in approximately 2,208 net acres, of which 770 are undeveloped, non-producing net acres and 1,438 are developed net acres in the Marble Falls formation and the Barnett Shale, in Jack County, Texas. During the year, AGP averaged 0.32 MMcfe/d net production volumes. AGP estimates 0.5 Bcfe of total proved reserves for its North Texas positions, of which 100% are proved developed and producing (“PDP”). 
 
Mississippi Lime. The Mississippi Lime formation is an expansive carbonate hydrocarbon system and is located at depths between 4,000 and 7,000 feet between the Pennsylvanian-aged Morrow formation and the Devonian-age world-class source rock Woodford Shale formation. The Mississippi Lime formation can reach 600 feet in gross thickness, with a targeted porosity zone between 50 and 100 feet thickness. AGP owns a non-operated 21.25% working interest in two wells in the Mississippi Lime formation in Garfield County, Oklahoma, operated by SandRidge Energy, Inc. During the year, AGP averaged 0.043 MMcfe/d net production volumes. AGP estimates 0.15 Bcfe of proved reserves in its Mississippi Lime positions, of which 45% are gas. 
 Lightfoot Overview
 Lightfoot is a private investment vehicle that focuses on investing directly in master limited partnership-qualifying businesses and assets. Lightfoot investors include affiliates of, and funds under management by, GE EFS, us, BlackRock Investment Management, LLC, Magnetar Financial LLC, CorEnergy Infrastructure Trust, Inc. and Triangle Peak Partners Private Equity, LP. As of December 31, 2016, we own an approximate 15.9% interest in Lightfoot’s general partner and a 12.0% interest in Lightfoot’s limited partner.
 Lightfoot’s stated strategy is to make investments by partnering with, promoting and supporting strong management teams to build growth-oriented businesses or industry verticals. Lightfoot provides extensive financial and industry relationships and significant master limited partnership experience, which assist in growth via acquisitions and development projects by identifying:
  
• | efficient operating platforms with deep industry relationships;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | significant expansion opportunities through add-on acquisitions and development projects;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | stable cash flows with fee-based income streams, limited commodity exposure and long-term contracts; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | scalable platforms and opportunities with attractive fundamentals and visible future growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 On November 6, 2013, ARCX, a master limited partnership owned and controlled by Lightfoot Capital Partners, L.P., began trading publicly on the NYSE. ARCX is focused on the terminalling, storage, throughput and transloading of crude oil and petroleum products in the East Coast, Gulf Coast and Midwest regions of the United States. ARCX’s cash flows are primarily fee-based under multi-year contracts. Lightfoot has a significant interest in ARCX through its ownership of a 27.1% limited partner interest, Lightfoot Capital Partners, G.P., the general partner, and all of Lightfoot’s incentive distribution rights. Lightfoot intends to utilize ARCX to facilitate future organic expansions and acquisitions for its energy logistics business.
 Titan Overview
 Titan is a publicly traded (OTCQX: TTEN) Delaware limited liability company and independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, with operations in basins across the United States with a focus on the horizontal development of significant resource potential from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. Titan sponsors and manages tax-advantaged investment partnerships (the “Drilling Partnerships”) in which it co-invests, to finance a portion of its natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids production activities. Titan Management holds the Series A Preferred Share of Titan, which entitles us to receive 2% of the aggregate of distributions paid to shareholders (as if we held 2% of Titan’s member’ equity, subject to potential dilution in the event of future 
 9


equity interests) and to appoint four of seven directors. As discussed further below, Titan is the successor to the business and operations of ARP
 Recent Developments
 ARP Restructuring and Emergence from Chapter 11 Proceedings
 On July 25, 2016, we, solely with respect to certain sections thereof,  along with ARP and certain of its subsidiaries, entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with (i) lenders holding 100% of ARP’s senior secured revolving credit facility (the “First Lien Lenders”), (ii) lenders holding 100% of ARP’s second lien term loan (the “Second Lien Lenders”) and (iii) holders (the “Consenting Noteholders” and, collectively with the First Lien Lenders and the Second Lien Lenders, and their respective successors or permitted assigns that become party to the Restructuring Support Agreement, the “Restructuring Support Parties”) of approximately 80% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 7.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “7.75% Senior Notes”) and the 9.25% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “9.25% Senior Notes” and, together with the 7.75% Senior Notes, the “Notes”) of ARP’s subsidiaries, Atlas Resource Partners Holdings, LLC and Atlas Resource Finance Corporation (together, the “Issuers”). Under the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Restructuring Support Parties agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to support ARP’s Restructuring (the “Restructuring”) pursuant to a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the “Plan”).
 On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court,” and the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Filings”). The cases commenced thereby were jointly administered under the caption “In re: ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.”
 ARP operated its businesses as “debtors in possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 11 and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, all suppliers, vendors, employees, royalty owners, trade partners and landlords were unimpaired by the Plan and were satisfied in full in the ordinary course of business, and ARP’s existing trade contracts and terms were maintained. To assure ordinary course operations, ARP obtained interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions seeking authority to use cash collateral on a consensual basis, pay wages and benefits for individuals who provide services to ARP, and pay vendors, oil and gas obligations and other creditor claims in the ordinary course of business.
 On August 26, 2016, an order confirming the Plan was entered by the Bankruptcy Court. On September 1, 2016, (the “Plan Effective Date”), pursuant to the Plan, the following occurred:
  
• | the First Lien Lenders received cash payment of all obligations owed to them by ARP pursuant to the senior secured revolving credit facility (other than $440 million of principal and face amount of letters of credit) and became lenders under Titan’s first lien exit facility credit agreement, composed of a $410 million conforming reserve-based tranche and a $30 million non-conforming tranche.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Second Lien Lenders received a pro rata share of Titan’s second lien exit facility credit agreement with an aggregate principal amount of $252.5 million. In addition, the Second Lien Lenders received a pro rata share of 10% of the common equity interests of Titan, subject to dilution by a management incentive plan.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Holders of the Notes, in exchange for 100% of the $668 million aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest as of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Filings, received 90% of the common equity interests of Titan, subject to dilution by a management incentive plan.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | all of ARP’s preferred limited partnership units and common limited partnership units were cancelled without the receipt of any consideration or recovery.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ARP transferred all of its assets and operations to Titan as a new holding company and ARP dissolved. As a result, Titan became the successor issuer to ARP for purposes of and pursuant to Rule 12g-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Titan Management received a Series A Preferred Share of Titan, which entitles Titan Management to receive 2% of the aggregate of distributions paid to shareholders (as if it held 2% of Titan’s members’ equity, subject to potential dilution in the event of future equity interests and to appoint four of seven directors) and certain other rights. Four of the seven initial members of the board of directors of Titan are designated by Titan Management (the “Titan Class A Directors”). For so long as Titan Management holds such preferred share, the Titan Class A Directors will be appointed by a majority of the Titan Class A Directors then in office. Titan has a continuing right to purchase the preferred share at fair market value (as determined pursuant to the methodology provided for in Titan’s limited liability company agreement), subject to the

receipt of certain approvals, including the holders of at least 67% of the outstanding common shares of Titan unaffiliated with Titan Management voting in favor of the exercise of the right to purchase the preferred share.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We were not a party to ARP’s Restructuring. We remain controlled by the same ownership group and management team and thus, ARP’s Restructuring did not have a material impact on the ability of management to operate us or our other businesses.
 In connection with ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings on July 27, 2016, we deconsolidated ARP’s financial statements from our  combined consolidated financial statements, as we no longer had the power to direct the activities that most significantly impacted ARP’s economic performance; however, we retained the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of ARP and therefore applied the equity method of accounting for our investment in ARP up to the Plan Effective Date. As a result of these changes, our combined consolidated financial statements subsequent to ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings will not be comparable to our combined financial statements prior to ARP’s Chapter 11 Filings. Our financial results for future periods following the application of equity method accounting will be different from historical trends and the differences may be material.
 On the Plan Effective Date, we determined that Titan is a variable interest entity based on its limited liability company agreement and the delegation of management and omnibus agreements between Titan and Titan Management, which provide us the power to direct activities that most significantly impact Titan’s economic performance, but we do not have a controlling financial interest. As a result, we do not consolidate Titan but rather apply the equity method of accounting as we have the ability to exercise significant influence over Titan’s operating and financial decisions.
 AGP’s Primary Offering Suspension. On November 2, 2016, AGP’s management decided to temporarily suspend its current primary offering efforts in light of new regulations and the challenging fund raising environment until such time as market participants have had an opportunity to ascertain the impact of such issues. At this time, AGP can provide no certainty as to when or if its primary offering efforts will be reinstituted.
 AGP’s Cash Distributions Suspension. On November 2, 2016, AGP’s Board of Directors determined to suspend its quarterly common unit distributions, beginning with the three months ended September 30, 2016, in order to retain its cash flow and reinvest in its business and assets. At this time, AGP can provide no certainty as to when or if distributions will be reinstituted.
Gas and Oil Production
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, our combined consolidated gas and oil production revenues, expenses, and volumes consisted of AGP’s gas and oil production activities and ARP’s gas and oil production activities through July 27, 2016. We deconsolidated ARP for financial reporting purposes as of the date of the Chapter 11 Filings and therefore our 2016 combined consolidated financial statements will not be comparable to our 2015 and 2014 combined consolidated financial statements.

Includes the impact of cash settlements on ARP’s commodity derivative contracts not previously included within accumulated other comprehensive income following our decision to de-designate hedges beginning on January 1, 2015. Cash settlements on ARP’s commodity derivative contracts excluded from production revenues consisted of $62.6 million and $48.6 million associated with natural gas derivative contracts and $26.5 million and $35.8 million associated with crude oil derivative contracts for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Cash settlements on ARP’s natural gas liquids derivative contracts excluded from production revenues were $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 (see “Item 8. Financial Statements – Note 8”).

Drilling Activity
 The number of wells we drill will vary depending on, among other things, the amount of money we have available and the money raised by ARP’s Drilling Partnerships, the cost of each well, the estimated recoverable reserves attributable to each well and accessibility to the well site. The following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells we drilled, both gross and net during the periods indicated:

We do not operate any of the rigs or related equipment used in our drilling operations, relying instead on specialized subcontractors or joint venture partners for all drilling and completion work. This enables us to streamline operations and conserve capital for investments in new wells, infrastructure and property acquisitions, while generally retaining control over all geological, drilling, engineering and operating decisions. We perform regular inspection, testing and monitoring functions on each of our operated wells.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any ongoing drilling activities.  
 
Contractual Revenue Arrangements
 Natural Gas and Oil Production 
 Natural Gas. We market the majority of our natural gas production to gas marketers directly or to third party plant operators who process and market our gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically tied to a regional index. The pricing index for our Eagle Ford production is primarily Houston Ship Channel, primarily Waha for our Marble Falls production and primarily Southern Star for our Mississippi Lime production. 
 We  sell the majority of natural gas produced at monthly, fixed index first of the month prices and a smaller portion at index daily prices. We do not have delivery commitments or firm transportation contracts for fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.
 Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is picked up by an oil company or a common carrier acting on behalf of the oil purchaser. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking/pipeline charges. We do not have delivery commitments or firm transportation contracts for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements. 
 Natural Gas Liquids. NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining “dry” gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport or sale to end users or marketers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting plant residue natural gas is sold as indicated above and our NGLs are generally priced and sold using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional processing indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a percentage retention by the processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments or firm transportation contracts for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.
 For the year ended December 31, 2016, Tenaska Marketing Ventures, Interconn Resources LLC and Chevron accounted for approximately 29%, 15% and 14%, respectively, of ARP’s natural gas, oil and NGL production revenues with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% for this period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Shell Trading Company and Enterprise Crude Oil LLC individually accounted for approximately 64% and 29%, respectively, of AGP’s natural gas, oil and NGL production revenues with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% for this period.
 Competition
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive. We encounter strong competition from independent oil and gas companies, MLPs and from major oil and gas companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling equipment and arranging for the services of trained personnel. Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to pay more for desirable leases, or to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties or prospects than our financial or other resources will permit. 
 Competition is strong for attractive oil and natural gas properties and there can be no assurances that we will be able to compete satisfactorily when attempting to make acquisitions. In general, sellers of producing properties are influenced primarily by the price offered for the property, although a seller also may be influenced by the financial ability of the purchaser to satisfy post-closing indemnifications, plugging and abandoning operations and similar factors. 
 15


We also may be affected by competition for drilling rigs, human resources and the availability of related oilfield services and equipment. In the past, the oil and natural gas industry has experienced shortages of drilling rigs, equipment, pipe and personnel, which have delayed development drilling and other exploitation activities and have caused significant price increases. We are unable to predict when, or if, such shortages may occur or how they would affect our development and exploitation program. 
 Seasonal Nature of Business
 Seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other operations in certain areas where we may acquire producing properties. In addition, it is possible that we will acquire oil and gas properties that are subject to flooding, drought or tornados. These seasonal anomalies can pose challenges for meeting our drilling objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel during the drilling season, which could lead to shortages and increased costs or delay our operations. Generally demand for natural gas is higher in summer and winter months. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter natural gas requirements during off-peak months. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. 
Environmental Matters and Regulation
 Our operations relating to drilling and waste disposal are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As operators within the complex natural gas and oil industry, we must comply with laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or affect our business activities in many ways, such as by:

• | restricting the way waste disposal is handled;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | limiting or prohibiting drilling, construction and operating activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, non-attainment areas, tribal lands or areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring the acquisition of various permits before the commencement of drilling;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring the installation of expensive pollution control equipment and water treatment facilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restricting the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with siting, drilling, completion, production, and plugging activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring remedial measures to reduce, mitigate and/or respond to releases of pollutants or hazardous substances from existing and former operations, such as pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enjoining some or all of the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring preparation of a Resource Management Plan, an Environmental Assessment, and/or an Environmental Impact Statement with respect to operations affecting federal lands or leases.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where pollutants or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Neighboring landowners and other third parties can file claims for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by noise and/or the release of pollutants or wastes into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of natural gas and oil production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the natural gas and oil industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently enact new, and revise existing, environmental laws and regulations, and any new laws or changes to existing laws that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements for the natural gas and oil industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
 We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and compliance with existing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Nevertheless, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Moreover, we cannot assure future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs.

Environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our operations include the following:
 National Environmental Policy Act. Natural gas and oil exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or “NEPA.” NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major federal agency actions having the potential to significantly affect the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will typically require an Environmental Assessment to assess the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that will be made available for public review and comment. All of our proposed exploration and production activities on federal lands, if any, require governmental permits, many of which are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects.
 Hydraulic Fracturing.  In recent years, federal, state, and local scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing has increased.  Regulation of the practice remains largely the province of state governments, except for a Bureau of Land Management rule that would have imposed conditions on fracturing operations on federal lands, which was enjoined by a federal court holding BLM lacked the authority to adopt the rule.  Common elements of state regulations governing hydraulic fracturing may include, but not be limited to, the following: requirement that logs and pressure test results are included in disclosures to state authorities; disclosure of hydraulic fracturing fluids and chemicals, potentially subject to trade secret/confidential proprietary information protections, and the ratios of same used in operations; specific disposal regimens for hydraulic fracturing fluids; replacement/remediation of contaminated water assets; and minimum depth of hydraulic fracturing.  In December 2016, EPA released the final report of its study of the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water in the U.S. finding that the hydraulic fracturing water cycle can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.  Those circumstances included where (1) there are water withdrawals for hydraulic fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, (2) hydraulic fracturing fluids and chemicals or produced water are spilled, (3) hydraulic fracturing fluids are injected into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, and (4) hydraulic fracturing wastewater is stored or disposed in unlined pits.  If new federal regulations were adopted as a result of these findings, they could increase our cost to operate.
 Oil Spills.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”), contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. While we believe we have been in compliance with OPA, noncompliance could result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities.
 Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, the federal regulations that implement the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws and regulations a number of different types of requirements on our operations.  First, these laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the relevant state. These permits may require pretreatment of produced waters before discharge. Compliance with such permits and requirements may be costly. Second, the Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The precise definition of waters and wetland subject to the dredge-and-fill permit requirement has been enormously complicated and is subject to on-going litigation.  A broader definition could result in more water and wetlands being subject to protection creating the possibility of additional permitting requirements for some of our existing or future facilities.  Third, the Clean Water Act also requires specified facilities to maintain and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans and to take measures to minimize the risks of petroleum spills.   Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for failure to obtain or non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of the Clean Water Act.
 Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, the federal regulations that implement the Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including drilling sites, processing plants, certain storage vessels and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations also apply to entities that use natural gas as fuel, and may increase the costs of customer compliance to the point where demand for natural gas is affected.  Clean Air Act rules impose additional emissions control requirements and practices on some of our operations. Some of our new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to comply with new or revised requirements. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and potentially criminal enforcement actions. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations.  While we will likely be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment to comply with applicable regulations and to obtain and maintain operating permits and approvals for air 
 17


emissions, we believe that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than other similarly situated companies.
 Greenhouse Gas Regulation and Climate Change. To date, legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions have not had a material impact on our business.  Under the past eight years during the Obama Administration several Clean Air Act regulations were adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and a couple foundational regulations were upheld by the courts.  President Trump pledged during the election campaign to suspend or reverse many if not all of the Obama Administration’s initiatives to reduce the nation’s emissions of greenhouse gases.  Some of the foundational regulations, however, appear unyielding.  It would be a significant departure from the principle of stare decisis for the Supreme Court to reverse its decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007) holding that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” covered by the Clean Air Act.  Similarly, reversing EPA’s final determination that greenhouse gases “endanger” public health and welfare, 74 Fed. Reg. 66,496 (Dec. 15, 2009), upheld in Coalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v. EPA, 684 F.3d 102 (D.C. Cir. 2012), would seem to require development of new scientific evidence that runs counter to general discoveries since that determination.  
 On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth explaining how his Administration would withdraw, rescind, revisit, or revise virtually every element the Obama Administration’s program for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Executive Order, some actions had immediate effect.  Other actions, including those most directly affecting our operations and the overall consumption of fossil fuels, will be the subject of potentially lengthy notice-and-comment rule-making.  With respect to rules more directly applicable to the types of operations AGP conducts, the Executive Order directed EPA to undertake new rule-making to revise or rescind 2015 methane emissions standards for new or modified wells.  Similarly, the Order directed the Department of Interior to re-write a 2015 rule imposing restrictions on fracturing operations conducted on federal land and a 2016 rule restricting flaring of methane emissions from oil and gas extraction on federal land. With respect to rules of greater applicability affecting overall consumption of fossil fuels, the Order instructed EPA to rewrite (1) the 2015 Clean Power Plan – the rule aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by one-third (compared to 2005 levels), and (2) the 2015 New Source Rule setting greenhouse gas emission requirements for construction of new power plants.  
 While we generally foresee a less stringent approach to the regulation of greenhouse gases, undoing the Obama Administrations regulations of greenhouse gas emissions will necessarily involve lengthy notice-and-comment rulemaking and the resulting decisions may then be subject to litigation by those opposed to rolling back existing regulations.  Thus, it could be several years before existing regulations are off the books.  Opponents of the rollbacks, including states and environmental groups, may then decide to sue large sources of greenhouse gas emissions for the alleged nuisance created by such emissions.  In 2011, the Supreme Court held that federal common law nuisance claims were displaced by the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from large sources of emissions. If the Administration fails to pursue regulation of emissions from such sources or takes the position that it has no authority to do regulate their emissions, then it is possible that a court would find common law nuisance claims are no longer displaced.    
 Although further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations may stall at the federal level, it is possible that, in the absence of additional federal regulatory action, states may pursue additional regulation of our operations, including restrictions on new and existing wells and fracturing operations, as many states already have done.
 Waste Handling. The Solid Waste Disposal Act, including RCRA, and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of “hazardous wastes” and the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. With authority granted by federal EPA, individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas constitute “solid wastes,” which are regulated under the less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, but there is no guarantee that the EPA or individual states will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous in the future. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes, and waste compressor oils may be regulated as “solid waste.” The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some “hazardous wastes” that are subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements.  We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with the requirements of RCRA and related state and local laws and regulations.  More stringent regulation of natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes could increase the costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
 CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on persons who are considered under the statute to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” (but excluding petroleum) into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property 
 18


damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  Our operations are, in many cases, conducted at properties that have been used for natural gas and oil exploitation and production for many years. Although we believe that we utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal.  We are not presently aware the need for us to respond to releases of hazardous substances that would impose costs that would be material to our financial condition. 
 OSHA and Chemical Reporting Regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or “OSHA,” and comparable state statutes.  On March 25, 2016, OSHA published its final Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica final rule, which imposes specific requirements to protect workers engaged in hydraulic fracturing.  81 Fed. Reg. 16,285.  The requirements of that final rule as it applies to hydraulic fracturing become effective June 23, 2018, except for the engineering controls component of the final rule, which has a compliance date of June 23, 2021.  We expect implementation of the rule to result in significant costs.  The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.  If the sectors to which community-right-to-know or similar chemical inventory reporting are expanded, our regulatory burden could increase.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements.
 Hydrogen Sulfide. Exposure to gas containing high levels of hydrogen sulfide, referred to as sour gas, is harmful to humans and can result in death. We conduct our natural gas extraction activities in certain formations where hydrogen sulfide may be, or is known to be, present. We employ numerous safety precautions at our operations to ensure the safety of our employees. There are various federal and state environmental and safety requirements for handling sour gas, and we are in substantial compliance with all such requirements.
 Drilling and Production. State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of natural gas and oil properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploitation while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of natural gas and oil we can produce from our or its wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax or impact fee with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.
 State Regulation and Taxation of Drilling. The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, Pennsylvania has imposed an impact fee on wells drilled into an unconventional formation, which includes the Marcellus Shale. The impact fee, which changes from year to year, is based on the average annual price of natural gas as determined by the NYMEX price, as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the last trading day of each calendar month. For example, based upon natural gas prices for 2015, the impact fee for qualifying unconventional horizontal wells spudded during 2015 was $45,300 per well, while the impact fee for unconventional vertical wells was $9,100 per well. The payment structure for the impact fee makes the fee due the year after an unconventional well is spudded, and the fee will continue for 15 years for an unconventional horizontal well and 10 years for an unconventional vertical well. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources.
 States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum limits on daily production allowable from natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of natural gas that may be produced from our wells, the type of wells that may be drilled in the future in proximity to existing wells and to limit the number of wells or locations from which we can drill. Texas imposes a 7.5% tax on the market value of natural gas sold, 4.6% on the market value of condensate and oil produced and an oil field clean up regulatory fee of $0.000667 per Mcf of gas produced,  a regulatory tax of $.001875 and the oil field clean-up fee of $.00625 per barrel of crude. New Mexico imposes, among other taxes, a severance tax of up to 3.75% of the value of oil and gas produced, a conservation tax of up to 0.24% of the oil and gas sold, and a school emergency tax of up to 3.15% for oil and 4% for gas. Alabama imposes a production tax of up to 2% on oil or gas and a privilege tax of up to 8% on oil or gas. Oklahoma imposes a gross production tax of 7% per Bbl of oil, up to 7% per Mcf of natural gas and a petroleum excise tax of .095% on the gross production of oil and gas.
 The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect upon our unitholders.

Other Regulation of the Natural Gas and Oil Industry. The natural gas and oil industry is extensively regulated by federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the natural gas and oil industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden on the industry. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the natural gas and oil industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the natural gas and oil industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in their industries with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
 Legislation continues to be introduced in Congress and development of regulations continues in the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies concerning the security of industrial facilities, including natural gas and oil facilities. Our operations may be subject to such laws and regulations. Presently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the potential costs to comply with any such facility security laws or regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial.
 Employees
 We employed approximately 389 persons as of December 31, 2016. Some of our officers may spend a substantial amount of time managing the business and affairs of AGP, Titan and their affiliates other than us and may face a conflict regarding the allocation of their time between our business and affairs and their other business interests.
