ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introductory Summary.
Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. provides post-acute care services to skilled nursing facility, referred to as"skilled nursing center", "nursing center", or "center", patients and residents in ten states, primarily in the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest United States. Unless the context indicates otherwise, references herein to “Diversicare,” “the Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” include Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. and all of our consolidated subsidiaries. Diversicare Healthcare Services, Inc. was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 1994.
The post-acute care profession encompasses a broad range of non-institutional and institutional services. For those among the aging, infirmed, or disabled requiring temporary or limited special services, a variety of home care options exist. As the need for assistance in activities of daily living develop, assisted living centers become the most viable and cost effective option. For those amongst the aging, disabled, or infirmed requiring more extensive assistance and intensive care, skilled nursing center care may become the only viable option. We have chosen to focus our business primarily on the skilled nursing centers sector and to specialize in this aspect of the post-acute care continuum.
Principal Address and Website.
Our principal executive offices are located at 1621 Galleria Boulevard, Brentwood, Tennessee 37027. Our telephone number at that address is 615.771.7575, and our facsimile number is 615.771.7409. Our website is located at www.dvcr.com. The information on our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Operating and Growth Strategy.
Our operating objective is to optimize market position in the delivery of health care and related services to the patients and residents in need of post-acute care in the communities in which we operate. Our strategic operations development plan focuses on (i) providing a broad range of high quality, cost-effective post-acute care services; (ii) improving skilled mix in our nursing centers via enhanced capabilities for rehabilitation and transitional care; (iii) building clinical competencies and programs consistent with marketplace needs; and (iv) clustering our operations on a regional basis. Interwoven into our objectives and operating strategy is our mission:
• Improve Every Life We Touch 
• Provide Exceptional Healthcare 
• Exceed Expectations
• Increase Shareholder Value
Strategic operating initiatives. Our key strategic operating initiatives include improving skilled mix in our nursing centers by enhancing our staffing complement to address the increased medical complexity of certain patients, increasing clinical competencies, and adding clinical programs. The investments in nursing and clinical care have been implemented in concert with additional investments in nursing center-based sales representatives to cultivate referral and Managed Care relationships. These investments have positioned us and are expected to continue to position us to be a destination for patients covered by Medicare and Managed Care as well as certain private pay individuals. These enhancements and investments have positioned us to admit higher acuity patients. 
Another strategic operating initiative was to implement an Electronic Medical Records (“EMR”) platform. See description of our EMR implementation below. We completed the implementation of Electronic Medical Records in all our nursing centers in December 2011, and implement EMR at all new centers near the time we commence operations.
To achieve our objectives, we:
Provide a broad range of quality cost-effective services. Our objective is to provide a variety of services to meet the needs of the increasing post-acute care population requiring skilled nursing and rehabilitation care. Our service offerings currently include skilled nursing, comprehensive rehabilitation services, programming for Life Steps and Memory Care units (described below) and other specialty programming. By addressing varying levels of acuity, we work to meet the needs of the population we serve. We seek to establish a reputation as the provider of choice in each of our markets. Furthermore, we believe we are able to deliver quality services cost-effectively, compared to other healthcare providers along the spectrum of care, thereby expanding the population base that can benefit from our services.

Improve skilled mix in our nursing centers. By enhancing our registered nurse coverage and adding specialized clinical care, we believe we can admit patients with more medically complex conditions, thereby improving skilled mix and reimbursement. The investments in nursing and clinical care are being conducted in concert with additional investments in nursing center-based sales representatives to develop referral and Managed Care relationships. These investments will better attract quality payor sources for patients covered by Medicare, Managed Care and Medicare replacement payors as well as certain private pay individuals. We will also continue our program for the renovation and improvement of our nursing centers to attract and retain patients and residents. 
Cluster operations on a regional basis. We have developed regional concentrations of operations in order to achieve operating efficiencies, generate economies of scale and capitalize on marketing opportunities created by having multiple operations in a regional market area.
Key elements of our growth strategy are to: 
Increase revenues and profitability at existing nursing centers. Our strategy includes increasing center revenues and profitability through improving payor mix, providing an increasing level of higher acuity care, obtaining appropriate reimbursement for the care we provide, and providing high quality patient care. Ongoing investments are being made in expanded nursing and clinical care. We continue to enhance center-based marketing initiatives to promote higher occupancy levels and improved skilled mix at our nursing centers. 
Development of additional specialty services. Our strategy includes the development of additional specialty units and programming in nursing centers that could benefit from these services. The specialty programming will vary depending on the needs of the specific market, and may include complex medical and rehabilitation services, as well as memory care units and other specialty programming. These services allow our centers to meet market needs while improving census and payor mix. A center specific assessment of the market and the current programming being offered is conducted related to specialty programming to determine if unmet needs exist as a predictor of the success of particular niche offerings and services.
Acquisition, leasing and development of new centers. We continue to pursue and investigate opportunities to acquire, lease or develop new centers, focusing primarily on opportunities that can leverage our existing infrastructure. 
Nursing Centers and Services.
Diversicare provides a broad range of post-acute care services to patients and residents including skilled nursing, ancillary health care services and assisted living. In addition to the nursing and social services usually provided in long-term care centers, we offer a variety of rehabilitative, nutritional, respiratory, and other specialized ancillary services. As of December 31, 2016, our continuing operations consist of 76 nursing centers with 8,453 licensed skilled nursing beds. Our nursing centers range in size from 48 to 320 licensed nursing beds. The licensed nursing bed count does not include 496 licensed assisted living beds. Our continuing operations include centers in Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Texas.

(1) | The number of Licensed Nursing Beds is based on the regulatory licenses for the nursing center. The Company reports its occupancy based on licensed nursing beds. The number of Available Nursing Beds represents Licensed Nursing Beds reduced by beds removed from service. Available Nursing Beds is subject to change based upon the needs of the centers, including configuration of patient rooms, common usage areas and offices, status of beds (private, semi-private, ward, etc.) and renovations. The number of Licensed and Available Nursing Beds does not include 496 Licensed Assisted Living/Residential Beds, all of which are also available, and the number of centers excludes one stand-alone Assisted Living Facility in Ohio. These beds are excluded from the bed counts as our operating statistics such as occupancy are calculated using Nursing Beds only. 

Our nursing centers provide skilled nursing health care services, including nutrition services, recreational therapy, social services, housekeeping and laundry services. Skilled nursing care is provided for post-acute patients and residents with comorbidities. This care includes assessment using evidence based tools; individualized care plan development based on identified areas of risk and care needs; and skilled interventions such as IV services. We also provide for the delivery of ancillary medical services at the nursing centers we operate. These specialty services include rehabilitation therapy services, such as audiology, speech, occupational and physical therapies, which are provided through licensed therapists and registered nurses, and the provision of medical supplies, nutritional support, infusion therapies and related clinical services. The majority of these services are provided using our internal resources and clinicians.
Within the framework of a nursing center, we may provide other specialty care, including:
Transitional Care Unit. Many of our nursing centers have units designated as transitional care units, our designation for patients requiring transitional care following an acute stay in the hospital. These units specialize in short-term nursing and rehabilitation with the goal of returning the patient to their highest potential level of functionality. These units provide enhanced services with emphasis on upgraded amenities. The design and programming of the units generally appeal to the clinical and hospitality needs of individuals as they progress to the next appropriate level of care. Specialized therapeutic treatment regimens include orthopedic rehabilitation, neurological rehabilitation and complex medical rehabilitation. While these patients generally have a shorter length of stay, the intensive level of nursing and rehabilitation required by these patients typically results in higher levels of reimbursement.
Memory Care Unit. Like our transitional care units, many of our nursing centers have memory care units, our designation for advanced care for dementia-related disorders including Alzheimer's disease. The goal of the units is to provide a safe, homelike and supportive environment for cognitively impaired patients, utilizing an interdisciplinary team approach. Family and community involvement complement structured programming in the secure environment instrumental in fostering as much resident independence and purposeful quality of life as long as possible despite diminished capacity.
3

Enhanced Therapy Services. We have complemented our traditional therapy services with programs that provide electrotherapy, vital stimulation, ultrasound and shortwave diathermy therapy treatments that promote pain management, wound healing, muscle strengthening, and/or contractures management, improving outcomes for our patients and residents receiving therapy treatments. 
Other Specialty Programming. We implement other specialty programming based on a center's specific needs. We have developed two adult day care centers on nursing center campuses. We have developed specialty programming for bariatric patients (generally, patients weighing more than 350 pounds) at one of these centers as these individuals have unique psychosocial and equipment needs. 
Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement. We have in place a Quality Assurance and Performance Improvement (“QAPI”) program, which is focused on monitoring and improving all aspects of the care provided in a center by identifying outcomes and acting on areas of improvement. The QAPI program in our centers addresses all systems of care and management practices. Key quality indicators are determined and performance goals and benchmarks are established based on industry research standards via a Balanced Scorecard. Gaps and opportunities in performance versus benchmarks are addressed with analysis and performance improvement plans. Outcomes from each center in the areas of quality, employee workplace, customer satisfaction, and stewardship are collected monthly and overseen by regional and company quality committees. 
Implement Electronic Medical Records. We completed the initial implementation of EMR in our nursing centers in December 2011. EMR improves our ability to accurately record the care provided to our patients and quickly respond to areas of need. We now implement the use of EMR near the time of acquisition for new centers. EMR improves customer and employee satisfaction, nursing center regulatory compliance and provides real-time monitoring and scheduling of care delivery. We believe our EMR system supports our quality initiatives and positions us for higher acuity service offerings. Our EMR system is comprehensive in its functionality, providing key components, such as: 

• | Tracking Activities of Daily Living (“ADLs”). ADLs are the functions that each person must perform on a daily basis including, but not limited to, getting dressed, bathing, and eating. ADL tracking allows us to capture the provision of care provided by our nursing, dietary and housekeeping staff in assisting with ADLs quickly, efficiently and electronically. 


• | Progress Notes. Progress notes are an important component of our medical records. Licensed nursing professionals provide documentation reflecting assessment of each patient's condition and intervention of skilled care provided. The EMR system provides means for a comprehensive chronological record resulting in improved capture, monitoring and review of documentation of condition and care provided. 


• | Medications. Our patients receive a number of daily medications. This module assists with electronic tracking and documenting of required medications and treatments. This provides a more accurate and efficient care system for our nurses and patients. 


• | Wound Module. This allows for an evidence-based risk assessment to drive patient specific interventions to prevent skin breakdown. When skin abnormalities are present, it provides for accurate depiction of anatomical location and description which drives individualized care treatments. 


• | Incident Module. Allows for capturing any event, such as a fall, and provides quality assurance steps for root cause and patient-specific care plans. 

For all modules, the EMR system provides a dashboard that can be reviewed at a number of kiosks throughout the nursing center, allowing our staff to securely access a list of upcoming patient care tasks and providing supervisors a tool to help manage and monitor staff performance. We believe the EMR system provides better support, efficiency, and improves the quality of care for our patients. We originally invested approximately $112,000 per nursing center to deploy EMR in all our centers at the time of implementation. We currently implement EMR at each of the centers we acquire or at which time we assume operations during the transition process.
Organization. Our nursing centers are currently organized into ten regions, each of which is supervised by a regional vice president. The regional vice president is generally supported by specialists in several functions, including clinical, human resources, marketing, revenue cycle management and administration, all of whom are employed by us. The day-to-day operations of each of our nursing centers are led by an on-site, licensed administrator. The administrator of each nursing center is supported by other professional personnel, including a medical director, who assists in the medical management of the nursing center, and a director of nursing, who supervises a team of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses and nurse aides. Other personnel include those providing therapy, dietary, activities and social service, housekeeping, laundry, maintenance and office services. The majority of personnel at our nursing centers, including the administrators, are our employees.

Marketing.
We believe that skilled nursing care is fundamentally a local business in which both patients and their referral sources are typically based in the immediate geographic area in which the nursing center is located. Our marketing plan and related support activities emphasize the role and contributions of the administrators, admissions coordinators and clinical liaisons of each nursing center, all of whom are responsible for developing relationships with various referral sources such as doctors, hospitals, hospital case managers and discharge planners, and various healthcare and community organizations. Training, sales tools and job aids are provided for the sales and marketing teams for the product knowledge, market knowledge, and selling skills necessary to support their efforts in the field. As part of our business strategy, we have dedicated sales and marketing personnel who develop strong partnerships with physicians and hospital executives as well as Accountable Care Organizations ("ACO"), Bundled Payments Initiatives ("BPI"), and Managed Care organizations. We believe these relationships will be mutually beneficial, providing the community with high quality healthcare while helping customers to navigate choices, manage transitions, and control costs.
At the local level, our sales and marketing efforts are designed to:
•Identify and develop strong healthcare partnerships
•Help facilitate smooth transitions between care settings
•Promote collaboration with ACOs, BPIs, and healthcare organizations
•Educate referral sources and community on our key differentiators and capabilities 
•Position ourselves as a valuable resource and healthcare partner
•Enhance the customer experience
•Contribute to a strong community presence
•Promote higher occupancy levels
•Foster optimal payor mix
In addition to soliciting admissions from current and potential referral sources, we emphasize involvement in community and healthcare events and opportunities to promote a public awareness of our nursing centers and services. Activities include ongoing family councils and community based “family night” functions, providing the opportunity to educate the public on various topics such as Medicare benefits, powers of attorney, and other topics of interest. We also promote a positive customer experience, best practices, strong surveys, and a high Star Rating; we seek feedback through third-party resident and family surveys. We host tour and “open house” opportunities, where members of the local community are invited to visit the center to see any improvements or to better understand our environment and services. We look for ways to offer increased clinical capabilities and services to better meet the needs of the community and referral sources. In addition, we have regional oversight to support the overall marketing strategies in each local center, in order to promote higher occupancy levels and improved payor and case mixes at our nursing centers. We offer the resources and metrics for strong healthcare partnerships with our referral sources, including ACOs and other Managed Care partners. Our support center marketing personnel support regional and local marketing personnel and efforts.
We have monthly marketing programs and ongoing marketing initiatives, developed internally, that focus on educating and meeting the needs of our customers while growing our business. Resources are also available to assist each nursing center administrator in analysis of local demographics and competition with a view toward complementary service development. We consider the primary referral area in long-term care to generally lie within a five-to-fifteen-mile radius of each nursing center depending on population density; consequently, we focus on local marketing efforts rather than broad-based advertising.
Acquisitions, Significant Transactions and Divestitures. 
Acquisitions
On February 26, 2016, the Company exercised its purchase options to acquire the real estate assets for Diversicare of Hutchinson in Hutchinson, Kansas and Clinton Place in Clinton, Kentucky for $4,250,000 and $3,300,000, respectively.

Lease Termination
Effective May 31, 2016, the Company entered into an Agreement with Avon Ohio, LLC to amend the original lease agreement, thus terminating the Company's right of possession of the center. As a result, the Company incurred lease termination costs of $2,008,000 in the second quarter of 2016. Under the amended agreement, the Company is required to pay $300,000 per year through the term of the original lease agreement, July 31, 2024. For accounting purposes, this transaction was not reported as a discontinued operation, which is in accordance with the modified authoritative guidance for reporting discontinued operations, effective January 1, 2015. A disposal is now required to be reported in discontinued operations only if the disposal represents a strategic shift that has (or will have) a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results.

Pharmacy Partnership
Effective October 28, 2016, the Company and its partners entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell the pharmacy joint venture. The sale resulted in a $1,366,000 recorded gain on the sale of the Company's interest in the joint venture during the year ended December 31, 2016. The transaction also resulted in an immaterial gain contingency, which has not been recorded and income has not been recognized. 
Discontinued Operations 
Effective April 3, 2014, the Company entered into an asset purchase agreement with Rose Terrace Acq., LLC to sell its skilled center facility in Culloden, West Virginia. The original asset purchase agreement was subject to a number of conditions including an amendment to the Master Lease with Omega Health Investors, Inc. ("Omega") to terminate the lease only with respect to two other skilled nursing centers in West Virginia, state licensure and regulatory approval. 
Effective July 1, 2014, the Company completed the transaction with Rose Terrace Acq., LLC to sell Rose Terrace, a 90-bed skilled nursing center in Culloden, West Virginia for a sales price of $16,500,000. The Company also entered into the Fifteenth Amendment to the Master Lease with Omega to terminate the lease only with respect to two other skilled nursing centers in Danville and Ivydale, West Virginia, and concurrently entered into an operations transfer agreement with American Health Care Management, LLC, an affiliate of the purchaser with respect to the two skilled nursing centers located in Danville and Ivydale, West Virginia. The amendment effectively reduced the annual rent payments due under the Master Lease by $1,900,000. Upon completion of the transaction, Diversicare no longer operates any skilled nursing centers in the state of West Virginia. In conjunction with the closing of the sale, the Company paid the balance of the $8,000,000 mortgage loan outstanding on the Rose Terrace center. The Company will continue to defend, and make cash payments related to professional liability claims asserted against these nursing centers for events occurring prior to July 1, 2014.
Nursing Center Industry.
We believe there are a number of significant trends within the post-acute care industry that will support the continued growth of the nursing center profession. These trends are also likely to impact our business. These factors include:
Demographic trends. The primary market for our post-acute health care services is comprised of persons aged 75 and older. This age group is one of the fastest growing segments of the United States population. As the number of persons aged 75 and over continues to grow, we believe that there will be corresponding increases in the number of persons who need skilled nursing care.
Cost containment pressures. In response to rapidly rising health care costs, governmental and other third-party payors have adopted cost-containment measures to reduce admissions and encourage reduced lengths of stays in hospitals and other acute care settings. As a result, hospitals are discharging patients earlier and referring elderly patients, who may be too sick or frail to manage their lives without assistance, to nursing centers where the cost of providing care is typically lower than hospital care. 
Limited supply of centers. As the nation's population of seniors continues to grow, life expectancy continues to expand, and there continue to be limitations on granting Certificates of Need (“CON”) for new skilled nursing centers, so we believe that there will be continued demand for skilled nursing beds in the markets in which we operate. CON laws generally require a state agency to determine public need for any construction or expansion of healthcare facilities. We believe that the CON process tends to restrict the supply and availability of licensed skilled nursing center beds. High construction costs, limitations on state and federal government reimbursement for the full costs of construction, and start-up expenses also act to restrict growth in the supply for such centers. 
Reduced reliance on family care. Historically, the family has been the primary provider of care for seniors. We believe that the increase in the percentage of dual income families, the reduction of average family size and the increased mobility in society will reduce the role of the family as the traditional care-giver for aging parents. We believe that this trend will make it necessary for many seniors to look outside the family for assistance as they age.
Competition.
The post-acute care business is highly competitive. We face direct competition for additional centers, and our centers face competition for employees and patients. Some of our present and potential competitors for acquisitions are significantly larger and have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources. Competing companies may offer new or more modern centers or new or different services that may be more attractive to patients than some of the services we offer.
The nursing centers operated by us compete with other centers in their respective markets, including rehabilitation hospitals and other skilled and personal care residential centers. In the few urban markets in which we operate, some of the long-term care 
7

providers with which our centers compete are significantly larger and have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than our centers. Some of these providers are not-for-profit organizations with access to sources of funds not available to our centers. Construction of new long-term care centers near our existing centers could adversely affect our business. We believe that the most important competitive factors in the long-term care business are: a nursing center's local reputation with referral sources, such as acute care hospitals, physicians, religious groups, other community organizations, Managed Care organizations, and a patient's family and friends; physical plant condition; the ability to identify and meet particular care needs in the community; the availability of qualified personnel to provide the requisite care; and the rates charged for services. There is limited, if any, price competition with respect to Medicaid and Medicare patients, since revenues for services to such patients are strictly controlled and are based on fixed rates and cost reimbursement principles. Although the degree of success with which our centers compete varies from location to location, we believe that our centers generally compete effectively with respect to these factors.
Revenue Sources
We classify our revenues from patients and residents into four major categories: Medicare, Medicaid, managed care, and private pay and other. Medicaid revenues are those received under the traditional Medicaid program, which provides benefits to those in need of financial assistance in the securing of medical services. Medicare revenues include revenues received under both Part A and Part B. Managed Care revenues are received from insurance entities, including third-party plans that administer Medicare benefits, known as Medicare Advantage plans. The private pay and other revenues are composed primarily of individuals or parties who directly pay for their services. Included in the private pay and other category are patients who are hospice beneficiaries as well as the recipients of Veterans Administration benefits. Veterans Administration payments are made pursuant to renewable contracts negotiated with these payors.
The following table sets forth net patient revenues related to our continuing operations by payor source for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands):

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 
Medicaid | $ | 215,381 | | | 50.6 | % | | $ | 188,323 | | | 48.6 | % | $ | 166,497 | | 48.4 | %
Medicare | 117,143 | | | 27.5 | % | | 112,305 | | | 29.0 | % | | 101,806 | | 29.6 | %
Managed Care | 29,066 | | | 6.8 | % | | 27,856 | | | 7.2 | % | | 23,178 | | 6.7 | %
Private Pay and other | 64,473 | | | 15.1 | % | | 59,111 | | | 15.2 | % | | 52,711 | | 15.3 | %
Total | $ | 426,063 | | | 100.0 | % | | $ | 387,595 | | | 100.0 | % | $ | 344,192 | | 100.0 | %

The following table sets forth average daily skilled nursing census by payor source for our continuing operations for the periods presented:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Medicaid | 3,448 | | 68.1 | % | 3,104 | 67.1 | % | 2,844 | 67.0 | %
Medicare | 591 | | 11.7 | % | 577 | 12.5 | % | 540 | 12.7 | %
Managed Care | 178 | | 3.5 | % | 173 | 3.7 | % | 151 | 3.6 | %
Private Pay and other | 844 | | 16.7 | % | 772 | 16.7 | % | 709 | 16.7 | %
Total | 5,061 | | 100.0 | % | 4,626 | 100.0 | % | 4,244 | 100.0 | %

Consistent with the nursing center industry in general, changes in the mix of a center's patient population among Medicaid, Medicare, Managed Care, and private pay and other can significantly affect the profitability of the center's operations. We will attempt to increase revenues from non-governmental sources to the extent capital is available to do so. However, private payors, including managed care payors, are increasingly demanding that providers accept discounted fees or assume all or a portion of the financial risk for the delivery of health care services. Such measures may include capitated payments, which can result in significant losses to health care providers if patients require expensive treatment not adequately covered by the capitated rate.
Medicare and Medicaid Reimbursement
A significant portion of our revenues are derived from government-sponsored health insurance programs. Our nursing centers derive revenues under Medicaid, Medicare, Managed Care, Private Pay and other third party sources. We employ third-party specialists in reimbursement and also use these services to monitor regulatory developments to comply with reporting requirements and to ensure that proper payments are made to our operated nursing centers. 
Medicare
Medicare is a federally-funded and administered health insurance program for the aged and for certain chronically disabled individuals. Part A of the Medicare program covers certain services furnished by skilled nursing centers and other institutional providers and inpatient hospital services. Part B covers physician services, durable medical equipment, various outpatient services and certain ancillary services. Medicare generally covers skilled nursing center services for beneficiaries who require nursing care or rehabilitation services after a qualifying hospital stay. Medicare pays a per diem rate for each beneficiary, adjusted for patient acuity and additional factors such as geographic differences in wage rates. The payment rates are set forth under a prospective payment system that uses nursing and therapy indexes to assign a payment rate to each beneficiary. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) updates the rates annually. The payment rates cover all services to be provided to a beneficiary, including room and board, skilled nursing care, therapy, and medications. 
In July 2016, CMS issued its final rule outlining Medicare payment rates and policies for skilled nursing centers for federal fiscal year 2017, which began October 1, 2016. CMS projects that aggregate payments to skilled nursing centers will increase by a net 2.4% for fiscal year 2017. This reflects a 2.7% market basket increase, reduced by a 0.3% multi-factor productivity adjustment required by Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ("PPACA"). The payment rates for fiscal year 2016, which were projected to increase aggregate payments to skilled nursing centers by 1.2%, reflected a 0.6% forecast error reduction and the 0.5% productivity reduction required by PPACA. For fiscal year 2018, the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) requires the payment update for skilled nursing centers to be 1%. 
In addition to the adjustments described above, payment rates are reduced pursuant to ongoing sequestration. The Budget Control Act of 2011 (“BCA”) requires automatic spending reductions to reduce the federal deficit, including Medicare spending reductions of up to 2% per fiscal year, with a uniform percentage reduction across all Medicare programs. CMS began imposing a 2% reduction on Medicare claims in April of 2013. These reductions have been extended through 2025. 
CMS has increasingly introduced policies intended to shift Medicare to value-based payment methodologies, tying reimbursement to quality of care rather than quantity. For example, CMS has implemented the Quality Reporting Program, under which skilled nursing centers are required to report quality data. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, skilled nursing centers that fail to submit required data will be subject to a 2% reduction to the annual market basket update. The Skilled Nursing Facility Value-Based Purchasing (“SNF VBP”) Program, which begins on October 1, 2018, will make incentive payments available to skilled nursing centers based on their past performance on a specified quality measure. The first measure under this program is the 30-day potentially preventable readmission measure, which assesses the rate of unplanned, potentially preventable hospital readmissions for skilled nursing center patients within 30 days of discharge from a prior admission to a hospital. CMS will fund the SNF VPB Program incentive payment pool by withholding and then redistributing 2% of skilled nursing center payments, beginning in fiscal year 2019.

In addition, CMS has established the Five-Star Quality Rating System to assist the public in choosing a skilled care provider. Each nursing home is given a rating between 1 and 5 stars, which is published on the Nursing Home Compare website. The overall star rating is determined by three components: information from the last three years of health inspections, staffing information, and quality measures. The rating is based, in part, on the quality data nursing centers are required to report. For example, nursing centers must report the percentage of short-stay residents who are successfully discharged into the community and the percentage who had an outpatient emergency department visit. We remain diligent in continuing to provide outstanding patient care to achieve high rankings for our centers, as well as assuring that our rankings are correct and appropriately reflect our quality results.
Therapy Services. Reimbursement for physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language pathology services covered under Medicare Part B is determined according to the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”), which is updated annually. If a beneficiary receives multiple therapy treatments in one day, Medicare Part B pays the full rate for the therapy unit of service that has the highest Practice Expense (“PE”) component. A multiple procedure payment reduction is applied to the second and subsequent therapy units, reducing reimbursement to 50% of the applicable PE component. 
Therapy services covered under Medicare Part B are subject to an annual dollar-amount payment cap per beneficiary. These limitations on reimbursement are determined on a calendar year basis. For 2017, the limit on incurred expenses is $1,980 per patient for physical and speech therapy services combined, and a separate $1,980 per patient limit applies for occupational therapy services. Deductible and coinsurance amounts paid by the beneficiary for therapy services count toward the amount applied to the limit. 
 A temporary two-tier exceptions process permits providers to request reimbursement of therapy services beyond the caps in certain situations. The MACRA extended the exceptions process through December 31, 2017. The first tier, the automatic exceptions process, can be used for claims beyond the caps, up to a $3,700 threshold. The second tier, a targeted review process, may apply when a beneficiary’s incurred expenses exceed a $3,700 threshold. MACRA eliminated a previous requirement for manual medical review of all claims exceeding the $3,700 threshold, instead providing for a targeted post-payment reviews to be conducted by Supplemental Medical Review Contractors. These claim reviews focus on providers with a high percentage of patients receiving therapy beyond the threshold and on therapy provided in specified settings, including skilled nursing centers. 
MACRA also provides for a 0.5% increase to the MPFS rates each calendar year through 2019, subject to other adjustments. It required the establishment of the Quality Payment Program (“QPP”), a payment methodology intended to reward high-quality patient care. Beginning in 2017, physicians and certain other clinicians are required to participate in one of two QPP tracks, which will affect Medicare payments in 2019. The Advanced Alternative Payment Model (“Advanced APM”) track makes incentive payments available for participation in specific innovative payment models approved by CMS. A provider with sufficient participation in an Advanced APM is exempt from the reporting requirements and payment adjustments imposed under the second track, the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”). Providers electing to participate in MIPS will tie payment to performance with respect to clinical quality, resource use, clinical improvement activities, and meaningful use of electronic health records. MIPS will consolidate components of three existing incentive programs, including the Value-Based Payment Modifier program and the Physician Quality Reporting System. 
Medicaid 
Medicaid is a medical assistance program for the indigent that is funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states. Federal law requires states to cover certain nursing center services for Medicaid-eligible individuals when other payment options are unavailable. However, Medicaid eligibility requirements and benefits vary by state, and states may impose limitations on nursing services. States may also establish levels of service or payment methodologies by acuity or specialization of a nursing center. 
PPACA, as currently structured, requires states to expand Medicaid coverage by adjusting eligibility requirements such as income thresholds. However, the future of the Medicaid expansion is uncertain as a result of the 2016 federal elections. Further, a number of states have opted out of the Medicaid expansion provisions. Some states that opted out of the expansion provisions are evaluating alternatives such as waiver plans to extend or replace existing supplemental payment programs. 
For example, effective February 1, 2015, the Company began participating in Indiana's Upper Payment Limit ("UPL") supplemental payment program, which provides supplemental Medicaid payments for skilled nursing centers that are licensed to non-state government entities such as county hospital districts. One skilled nursing center previously operated by the Company entered into a transaction with one such hospital district participating in the UPL program, providing for the transfer of the license from the Company to the hospital district. The Company's operating subsidiary retained the management of the center on behalf of the hospital district. The agreement between the hospital district and the Company is terminable by either party. Termination would fully restore the prior license status.
We receive the majority of our annual Medicaid rate increases during the third quarter of each year. The rate changes received in 2016 and 2015, along with increased Medicaid acuity in our acuity based states, were the primary contributor to our 2.3% increase 
10

in average rate per day for Medicaid patients in 2016 compared to 2015. Based on the rate changes received during the third quarter of 2016, we expect a favorable impact to our rate per day for Medicaid patients as we move into 2017 due to modest rate increases in many of the states within which we operate.
Several states in which we operate face budget shortfalls, which could result in reductions in Medicaid funding for nursing centers. Pressures on state budgets are expected to continue in the future. Certain of the states in which we operate are actively seeking ways to reduce Medicaid spending for nursing center care by such methods as capitated payments and substantial reductions in reimbursement rates. Some states are promoting alternatives such as community and home-based services. We are unable to predict what, if any, reform proposals or reimbursement limitations will be implemented in the future, or the effect such changes would have on our operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived 27.5% and 50.6% of our total patient revenues related to continuing operations from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, respectively.  Any health care reforms that significantly limit rates of reimbursement under these programs could, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our financial position and profitability. 
Employees.
As of February 2, 2017, we employed approximately 7,400 employees, referred to as "team members", in connection with our continuing operations, approximately 6,700 of which are considered full-time team members. We believe that our team member relations are good. Approximately 843 of our team members are represented by a labor union.
Although we believe we are able to employ sufficient nurses and therapists to provide our services, a shortage of health care professional personnel in any of the geographic areas in which we operate could affect our ability to recruit and retain qualified team members and could increase our operating costs. We compete with other health care providers for both professional and non-professional team members and with non-health care providers for non-professional team members. This competition contributed to a significant increase in the salaries that we had to pay to hire and retain these team members. As is common in the health care industry, we expect the salary and wage increases for our skilled healthcare providers will continue to be higher than average salary and wage increases nationally.
Supplies and Equipment.
We purchase drugs, solutions and other materials and lease certain equipment required in connection with our business from many suppliers. We have not experienced, and do not anticipate that we will experience, any significant difficulty in purchasing supplies or leasing equipment from current suppliers. In the event that such suppliers are unable or fail to sell us supplies or lease equipment, we believe that other suppliers are available to adequately meet our needs at comparable prices. National purchasing contracts are in place for all major supplies, such as food, linens and medical supplies. These contracts assist in maintaining quality, consistency and efficient pricing. Based on contract pricing for food and other supplies, we expect cost increases in 2017 to be relatively the same or slightly lower than the increases we experienced in 2016. 
Government Regulation.
The health care industry is subject to numerous laws and regulations of federal, state and local governments. These laws and regulations include, but are not necessarily limited to, matters such as licensure, accreditation, government health care program participation requirements, reimbursement for patient services, quality of patient care and Medicare and Medicaid fraud and abuse. Over the last several years, government activity has increased with respect to investigations and allegations concerning possible violations by health care providers of fraud and abuse statutes and regulations, false claims statutes, HIPAA violations, as well as laws and regulations governing quality of care issues in the skilled nursing profession in general. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in exclusion from government health care programs together with the imposition of significant fines and penalties, as well as significant repayments for patient services previously billed. Compliance with such laws and regulations is subject to ongoing government review and interpretation, as well as regulatory actions in which government agencies seek to impose fines and penalties. The Company is involved in regulatory actions of this type from time to time. 
Licensure and Certification. 
All our nursing centers must be licensed by the state in which they are located in order to accept patients, regardless of payor source. In most states, nursing centers are subject to CON laws, which require us to obtain government approval for the construction of new nursing centers or the addition of new licensed beds to existing centers. Our nursing centers must comply with detailed statutory and regulatory requirements on an ongoing basis in order to qualify for licensure, as well as for certification as a provider eligible to receive payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Generally, the requirements for licensure and Medicare/Medicaid certification are similar and relate to quality and adequacy of personnel, quality of medical care, record keeping, dietary services, patient rights, and the physical condition of the nursing center and the adequacy of the equipment used therein. Each center is subject to periodic inspections, known as “surveys” by health care regulators, to determine compliance with all applicable 
11

licensure and certification standards. Such requirements are both subjective and subject to change. If the survey concludes that there are deficiencies in compliance, the center is subject to various sanctions, including but not limited to monetary fines and penalties, suspension of new admissions, non-payment for new admissions and loss of licensure or certification. Generally, however, once a center receives written notice of any compliance deficiencies, it may submit a written plan of correction and is given a reasonable opportunity to correct the deficiencies. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to maintain such licenses and certifications for our centers or that we will not be required to expend significant sums in order to comply with regulatory requirements. 
Health care and health insurance reform.
In March 2010, significant legislation concerning health care and health insurance was passed, including the “Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act” (“Patient Protection Act”), along with the “Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010” (“Reconciliation Act”), collectively defined as the “Legislation.” We expect this Legislation to impact our Company, our employees and our patients in a variety of ways. Some aspects of these new laws have been implemented while others will be phased in over the next several years when all mandates become effective. This Legislation significantly changes the future responsibility of employers with respect to providing health care coverage to employees in the United States. We have not estimated the financial impact of the Legislation and the costs associated with complying with the increased levels of health insurance we will be required to provide our employees and their dependents in future years. We expect the Legislation will result in increased operating expenses.
We also anticipate this Legislation will continue to impact our Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement as well, though the timing and ultimate level of that impact is currently unknown as we anticipate that many of the provisions of the Legislation may be subject to further clarification and modification through the rule making process. The Legislation expands the role of home-based and community services, which may place downward pressure on our sustaining population of Medicaid patients. These reforms include the possible modifications to the conditions of qualification for payment, bundling of payments to cover both acute and post-acute care and the imposition of enrollment limitations on new providers. The provisions of the Legislation discussed above are examples of recently-enacted federal health reform provisions that we believe may have a material impact on the long-term care industry and on our business. However, the foregoing discussion is not intended to constitute, nor does it constitute, an exhaustive review and discussion of the Legislation.
Skilled nursing centers are required to bill Medicare on a consolidated basis for certain items and services that they furnish to patients, regardless of the cost to deliver these services. This consolidated billing requirement essentially makes the skilled nursing center responsible for billing Medicare for all care services delivered to the patient during the length of stay.
CMS has instituted a number of new exploratory test programs designed to extend the reimbursement and financial responsibilities under consolidated billing beyond the traditional discharge date to include a broader set of bundled services. Such examples may include, but are not exclusive to, home health, durable medical equipment, home and community based services, and the cost of re-hospitalizations during a specified bundled period. Today, these test programs for bundled reimbursement are confined to a small set of clinical conditions. This bundled form of reimbursement could be extended to a broader range of diagnosis related conditions in the future. Because of the untested nature of this new form of reimbursement, the potential impact on skilled nursing center utilization and reimbursement is currently unknown. The process for defining bundled services has not been fully determined by CMS and therefore is subject to change during the rule making process.
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 Compliance. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) has mandated an extensive set of regulations to standardize electronic patient health, administrative and financial data transactions and to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information. We have a HIPAA compliance committee and designated privacy and security officers.
The HIPAA transaction standards are intended to simplify the electronic claims process and other healthcare transactions by encouraging electronic transmission rather than paper submission. These regulations provide for uniform standards for data reporting, formatting and coding that we must use in certain transactions with health plans. The HIPAA security regulations establish detailed requirements for safeguarding protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. Some of the security regulations are technical in nature, while others are addressed through policies and procedures. We implemented or upgraded computer and information systems as we believe necessary to comply with the new regulations.
The HIPAA regulations related to privacy establish comprehensive federal standards relating to the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information (“protected health information”). The privacy regulations establish limits on the use and disclosure of protected health information, provide for patients' rights, including rights to access, to request amendment of, and to receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information, and require certain safeguards for protected health information. In addition, each covered entity must contractually bind individuals and entities that furnish services to the covered entity or perform a function on its behalf, and to which the covered entity discloses protected health information, to restrictions on the use 
12

and disclosure of that protected health information. In general, the HIPAA regulations do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or grant greater privacy rights to individuals. Thus, we must reconcile the HIPAA regulations and other state privacy laws.
Although we believe that we are in material compliance with these HIPAA regulations, inadvertent violations of these regulations may occur in the course of our business. For this and other reasons, the HIPAA regulations are expected to continue to impact us operationally and financially and may pose increased regulatory risk.
Self-Referral and Anti-Kickback Legislation. 
The health care industry is subject to state and federal laws which regulate the relationships of providers of health care services, physicians and other clinicians. These self-referral laws impose restrictions on physician referrals to any entity with which they have a financial relationship, which is a broadly defined term. We believe our relationships with physicians are in compliance with the self-referral laws. Failure to comply with self-referral laws could subject us to a range of sanctions, including civil monetary penalties and possible exclusion from government reimbursement programs. There are also federal and state laws making it illegal to offer anyone anything of value in return for referral of patients. These laws, generally known as “anti-kickback” laws, are broad and subject to interpretations that are highly fact dependent. Given the lack of clarity of these laws, there can be no absolute assurance that any health care provider, including us, will not be found in violation of the anti-kickback laws in any given factual situation. Strict sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties, may be imposed for violation of the anti-kickback laws.
Reporting Obligations under Section 111 of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007 (“MMSEA”). 
Since January 1, 2010, we have reported specific information regarding all claimants and claim settlements involving Medicare participants so CMS can recover Medicare funds expended to provide healthcare treatment to the claimant. The requirements are to ensure that CMS is notified so that it may recoup the amounts paid for services from the settlement proceeds. This does not result in us making additional payments to CMS for these services provided and does not result in an incremental cost to us. Strict sanctions, including fines and penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and criminal penalties, may be imposed for non-compliance with these reporting obligations.
