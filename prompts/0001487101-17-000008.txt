As of December 31, 2016, KeyW had 1,058 employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we derived 94% of our revenue from continuing operations, from U.S. government customers, including 78% of revenues derived from the IC and special military customers, acting as both prime contractor and subcontractor. Most of our contracts provide for a total contract period of five years, with an initial contract period of one year and the balance in one-year period renewal options. Historically, contract renewal options are rarely not exercised.
For 2016, 2015 and 2014, our revenue from continuing operations reflecting that of KeyW and our acquisitions, from the date of acquisition, was $288 million, $298 million and $279 million, respectively, based on accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Our 2016 revenue from continuing operations was derived from over 200 contracts (a combination of prime contracts and subcontracts), the 10 largest of which accounted for approximately 54% of our 2016 actual revenue from continuing operations, with no individual contract accounting for greater than 15% of our 2016 revenue from continuing operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016 we derived approximately 3% of our revenue from continuing operations from international customers. 
Our Market Opportunity
KeyW solutions and products focus on serving IC customers including the NSA, the NGA, the AGC, and other agencies within the IC and DoD. In addition, we provide products and services to U.S. federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, foreign governments and other entities in the Cyber and Counter Terrorism markets.
We believe that KeyW's capabilities and offerings are well-aligned with national security priorities and we have structured our strategic business development efforts to target these opportunities. The current government fiscal year (GFY) 2017 budget requests approximately $19 billion in cybersecurity funding, up 35% year-over-year, and we believe that the total addressable DoD 
2

information technology, or IT, budget is approximately $38.2 billion for GFY 2017. Additionally, approximately $6.8 billion of the GFY 2017 budget request is earmarked for the DoD's cyberspace operations, an increase of approximately $900 million (or 15%) over GFY 2016. The increase is largely associated with anticipated growth in the DoD's Cyber Mission Forces and other defensive and offensive cyberspace activities. In addition, we have been successful at identifying, acquiring and integrating companies with capabilities to address the growing cybersecurity threat and evolving customer missions.
Intelligence
The IC is a constellation of 17 agencies and organizations, including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, within the Executive Branch that work both independently and collaboratively to gather and analyze the intelligence necessary to conduct foreign relations and national security activities. The rapid pace of technological innovation and evolution of the security threat environment — physical and digital — requires highly specialized service providers who can ensure the IC and DoD maintain their technology leadership position to serve the security interests of the United States. To maintain superiority over adversaries, there is strong demand from the IC and DoD for cutting-edge technologies in areas such as Signal Processing, Cyber and Intelligence Analysis and Operations.
The IC represented an approximately $72 billion addressable market in GFY 2016. The intelligence budget is divided between the National Intelligence Program (NIP), managed by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the Military Intelligence Program (MIP), managed by the Secretary of Defense. The NIP, which supports agencies such as the National Reconnaissance Office, the NSA and the Central Intelligence Agency, represented an approximately $54 billion annual budget in GFY 2016 and has grown at a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 3% since 2006, despite significant government budgetary pressures. The positive budgetary trends are driven by the need to produce actionable intelligence to combat the evolving asymmetric and widely distributed threat landscape. Growth is expected to continue, driven by the extreme demands on legacy, non-standardized infrastructure and emergence of new technologies to collect, transport and store, analyze and operate an increasing amount of data.
Funding areas of the NIP are focused on maintaining technological advancement and superiority in the following areas:

• | Sustaining key investments to strengthen intelligence collection and critical operational capabilities supporting counterterrorism, counterintelligence and counterproliferation;


• | Protecting the IC's core mission areas and maintaining global coverage to remain vigilant against emerging threats;


• | Promoting increased intelligence sharing and advancing IC integration through continued investment in enterprise-wide capabilities and use of cloud technology to facilitate greater efficiency and improve the safeguarding of information across the intelligence information environment; and


• | Identifying resources for strategic priorities, including advanced technology to improve strategic warning, evolved collection and exploitation capabilities and increased resiliency.

Cybersecurity
Cybersecurity is receiving increased attention and budget funding at a time when there are widespread and effective threats that demonstrate the vulnerability of U.S. public and private data and communications networks. Recent headlines highlighting high-profile cases of unauthorized access, digital espionage, identity theft, malicious code and other cyber-crimes in both public and private sectors have reinforced the need for a more robust cyber security infrastructure. An increase in hacking attacks on key national security infrastructure systems, such as the DoD computer system, has heightened the need for improved threat protection. Additionally, the expansion of anti-terrorism efforts to cyberspace highlights the need for improved global cyber coordination and security measures.
The Office of Management and Budget highlights cybersecurity as a key priority for maintaining U.S. national security. The significant increase in overall U.S. federal resources for cybersecurity supports a broad-based cybersecurity strategy for securing the U.S. government, enhancing the security of critical infrastructure and important technologies and investing in next-generation tools and workforce. As part of the passage of the Cybersecurity Act of 2015, the Obama administration implemented the Cybersecurity National Action Plan to develop short-term and long-term actions to improve cybersecurity on national and local levels. 
Counter Terrorism
The war against terrorism has shifted the focus of the IC, the DoD and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) towards utilizing technology-centric weapons and strategies, data mining and analysis and counterterrorism solutions. The published U.S. National Military Strategy highlights counter terrorism as a joint force prioritized mission and underscores related initiatives as key investment priorities for the foreseeable future. Similarly, the National Security Strategy highlights the war against the persistent 
3

threat of terrorism as a pillar to maintain national security. Counter terrorism is highlighted as the top priority in DHS budget requests.
U.S. Federal Government Contracts
We derive substantially all our revenue from U.S. Government customers. In fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, we generated approximately 94%, 94% and 95%, respectively, of our total revenue from contracts where the end customer was the U.S. Government, which has a highly structured and regulated competitive procurement process. Our intelligence and defense customers typically exercise independent contracting authority and do not use General Services Administration or other government-wide acquisition contracts to obtain our services or products.
Subcontracts accounted for approximately 46% of our revenue in 2016, and prime contracts accounted for 54%. In 2015 subcontracts accounted for approximately 44% of our revenue and prime contracts accounted for approximately 56% of our revenue. Our prime contracts have been awarded as both sole-source and competitive awards; our subcontracts have been awarded competitively from prime contractors.
Sole-source award contracts
Under a sole-source award contract, the purchase of goods or services is made from a single source without competitive bidding. It is awarded usually, but not always, by a federal government agency after soliciting and negotiating with only one firm. These contracts can be negotiated much more quickly than a typical competitive contract providing there is adequate demonstration of both need and the likelihood that any attempt to obtain bids would only result in one person or company able to meet the need. Urgency is often the rationale for sole-source contracts. Sole-source contracts may be awarded based on a variety of different compensation models, including firm-fixed price (FFP), time-and-materials (T&M), cost-plus-fixed-fee, or level-of-effort contracts based on negotiations, risk and cost uncertainty.
Single award contracts
Under single award contracts with defined statements of work, a federal government agency solicits, qualifies, and then requests proposals from interested contractors. The agency then evaluates the bids and typically awards the contract to a single contractor for a specified service or product.
Multiple award contracts
Under indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity, or ID/IQ, contracts, a federal government agency can form preferred provider relationships with one or more contractors. This category includes agency-specific ID/IQ contracts; blanket purchase agreements, or BPAs; government-wide acquisition contracts, or GWACs; and General Services Administration, or GSA, schedule contracts. These umbrella contracts, often referred to as vehicles, outline the basic terms and conditions under which federal government agencies may order services. ID/IQ contracts are typically managed by one sponsoring agency, and may be either for the use of a specific agency or available for use by any other agency of the federal government. ID/IQ contracts available for use by any agency of the federal government are commonly referred to as GWACs.
Contractors within the industry compete to be pre-selected to perform work under an ID/IQ contract. An ordering agency then issues delivery orders, commonly known as task orders, for services to be performed under the contract. If the ID/IQ contract has a single prime contractor, only that contractor may be awarded delivery orders. If the contract has multiple prime contractors, the award of each delivery order typically will be competitively determined among the pre-selected contractors.
GSA schedules are listings of services and products, along with their respective prices, offered by federal government contractors. The schedules are negotiated and maintained by the GSA for use by any federal agency or other authorized entity, including state and local governments. When an agency selects services or products under a GSA schedule contract, the competitive process is limited to qualified GSA schedule contractors.
Contract types
We generate revenue under various types of contracts, which includeT&M, fixed-price-level-of-effort, FFP and cost reimbursable contracts. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we derived revenue from such contracts on an actual basis as follows:
4


 | Year ended December 31, 2016
Contract Type | (in millions) | | (percentage) | 
Time & Materials | $ | 55.6 | | 19.3 | %
Fixed-Price-Level-of-Effort | 59.2 | | 20.6 | % 
Firm-Fixed-Price | 80.7 | | 28.0 | % 
Cost Reimbursement | 92.5 | | 32.1 | % 


 | Year ended December 31, 2015
Contract Type | (in millions) | | (percentage) | 
Time & Materials | $ | 67.7 | | 22.7 | %
Fixed-Price-Level-of-Effort | 64.3 | | 21.6 | % 
Firm-Fixed-Price | 79.5 | | 26.7 | % 
Cost Reimbursement | 86.4 | | 29.0 | % 

Time-and-materials contracts. Under a T&M contract, we are paid a fixed hourly rate for each direct labor hour expended and we are reimbursed for allowable material costs and out-of-pocket expenses. To the extent our actual direct labor and associated costs vary in relation to the fixed hourly billing rates among various labor categories provided in the contract, we will generate profit or we could incur a loss.
Fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts. Fixed-price-level-of-effort contracts are substantially like T&M contracts except that they require a specified level of effort over a stated period of time.
Firm-fixed-price contracts. FFP contracts provide for a fixed price for specified products, systems and/or services. If actual costs vary from planned costs on a FFP contract, we generate more or less than the planned amount of profit and may even incur a loss. Our FFP contracts are primarily for our products.
Cost reimbursable contracts. Cost reimbursable contracts provide for reimbursement of our direct contract costs and allowable and allocable indirect costs, plus a fee.
Backlog
We define backlog to include both funded and unfunded orders for products and services under existing signed contracts, assuming the exercise of all options relating to those contracts, less the amount of revenue we have previously recognized under those contracts. We define funded backlog as the portion of backlog for which funding currently is appropriated and obligated to us under a contract or other authorization for payment signed by an authorized purchasing authority. Unfunded backlog includes all contract options that have been priced but not funded. Unfunded backlog considers contract ceiling value under multiple award contracts, and includes estimates of future potential delivery orders that might be awarded under multiple award ID/IQ contract vehicles, GWACs or GSA schedule contracts.
As of December 31, 2016, our total backlog was $716 million, of which $174 million was funded and $542 million was unfunded. As of December 31, 2015, our total backlog was $524 million, of which $103 million was funded and $421 million was unfunded. 
Total backlog may fluctuate from period to period depending on our success rate in winning contracts and the timing of contract awards, renewals, modifications and cancellations. We expect to recognize a substantial portion of our funded backlog as revenue within the next 12 months. However, the U.S. Government may terminate any contract at any time.

Customers
We derive substantially all of our revenue from continuing operations from contracts with U.S. government agencies involved with national security missions. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our revenue from continuing operations was derived 51% from contracts with the NSA, 16% from contracts with the U.S. Army, 7% from contracts with the NGA, 18% from contracts with other elements of the DoD excluding the NSA, the U.S. Army and the NGA, 2% from work for other major intelligence agencies and other intelligence, defense, homeland security and law enforcement organizations and 6% from commercial and international customers. 
Long-term relationships between intelligence customers and contractors develop because of the high level of security clearances required to work on projects and unique technical requirements of intelligence customers. For example, some members of our management have been working closely with the NSA for over 25 years, during which time they have completed numerous projects and we have several projects currently on-going with the NSA.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths will allow us to take advantage of the trends in our industry:
Ability to develop, field, and operate end-to-end intelligence solutions. Through a combination of acquisitions and organic technology development, KeyW has assembled a collection of capabilities that when combined, are capable of supporting our customers' end-to-end intelligence mission in airborne, ground and cyber domains. We intend to leverage these customer-proven capabilities to extend our market penetration to other organizations and agencies, foreign and domestic, and to drive organic growth.
Focus on core cyber superiority, geospatial intelligence and intelligence strengths. We focus on delivering cyber superiority, geospatial intelligence and intelligence support to the IC. We deliver a full range of cyber engineering services and solutions, geospatial intelligence services and solutions and cyber intelligence products. Mastering cyberspace and thereby attaining cyber superiority is a core mission of the IC. We believe that our focus gives our customers faster and more innovative solutions than those offered by our competitors.
Agile intelligence, cybersecurity and cyber age operations expertise. We have significant experience in building signal and information processing solutions, cybersecurity, cyber superiority and geospatial intelligence solutions, using agile methodologies for the IC to support mission critical activities and complex national security problems. Our team has established a strong reputation for responding quickly to customer requirements, and for partnering with our customers to identify and define these requirements. The changes in the threat environment that have occurred since 2001 have put enormous pressure on the IC to respond more quickly and in a more integrated way than ever before. We believe that we have a culture of innovation and agility that allows us to respond more quickly and with greater impact than other organizations.
Successful track record of acquiring and integrating key businesses. Since our founding, we have assembled, through a series of highly selective strategic acquisitions, a single distinct, integrated and cohesive platform that provides high quality and complementary cybersecurity, cyber superiority and geospatial intelligence capabilities, solutions and products to meet the demanding needs of our customers' missions.
Strong Intelligence Community experience and network. Our leadership and employees have significant expertise in the IC and a lengthy track record with many members of the IC. Our insight into the IC's needs and our mission focus allow us to articulate and support our customers' needs as they emerge, placing us at the forefront of solutions being offered. The senior members of our leadership and technology teams have a record of supporting the IC's programs for the past 20 to 30 years. Our long-term relationships establish the basis of trust required to understand and support mission-critical requirements. During this period, our executives have gained access to the highest levels of the IC, allowing them to provide thought leadership in the transformation of the intelligence process to respond to challenges of cyber age operations and a rapidly changing asymmetrical global threat environment.
Skilled employees with high-level security clearances. As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,058 employees. Approximately 80% of our employees have U.S. government security clearances, with approximately 73% holding top secret or higher clearance. This concentration of highly-skilled and cleared personnel allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements and gives us on-going insight into our customers' toughest national security problems. The requirement for these clearances and the time and process required to attain them are significant barriers to entering this market.
ISR sensor development, rapid deployment and sustainment of airborne collection platforms. Our highly-customized, integrated airborne collection solutions are lower cost than traditional ISR platforms and complemented by complete flight services and 
6

ongoing sustainment and logistics support of the collection platforms. We rapidly deploy solutions tailored to meet the most urgent requirements for ISR imagery in support of tactical missions and rapid mapping of large areas in some of the world's most challenging locations, thus placing us at the center of the trend towards actionable intelligence.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to continue growing our business by providing affordable, advanced engineering and technology solutions that solve complex problems such as preventing cyber threats, transforming data into intelligence and combating global terrorism and to leverage our capabilities and innovations in this field to government intelligence, defense, and federal, state and local civil government customers. Key elements of our strategy to accomplish our continued growth objective include:
Pursuing strategic, capability-enhancing acquisitions. We will continue to proactively pursue selective strategic acquisitions that expand our intelligence and cyber platform of capabilities and solutions, provide access to new customers and provide increased scale in a consolidating landscape of providers to the IC. This will include companies that are leaders in supporting the U.S. intelligence and defense communities, as well as technologies and solutions in cybersecurity and other areas of innovation that are critical to the transformation of the intelligence and defense communities into cyber age operations and to improve the overall cybersecurity posture of the intelligence and defense communities.
Leverage IC experience in certain agencies to address new growth markets in the Intelligence, Cyber, and Counterterrorism Communities. KeyW has a meaningful presence in two of the 17 organizations that make up the IC (including the Office of the Director of National Intelligence) and a modest presence in three other agencies. A key growth strategy is to leverage the unique capabilities we have developed in our core customers to expand into the agencies where KeyW does not have a significant presence. We believe the capabilities we have developed for current customers will be attractive to other members of the IC, enabling a significant growth opportunity for KeyW. To expand our IC presence, we have invested in building a best-in-class business development team with a proven capability of penetrating new customer agencies and winning large new prime contracts.
Building and leveraging our research and development efforts. We intend to continue utilizing company and customer-funded research and development to develop technologies, products and solutions that have significant potential for near-term as well as long-term value in the markets we serve. We will continue to use intellectual property that we create internally or license from other companies in the areas of network traffic intelligence, cybersecurity, cyber intelligence and geospatial intelligence to build products and solutions to further penetrate the intelligence and defense market.
Competition
We sell our services and products primarily to the intelligence, cyber and counter terrorism communities. The level of security clearances required for this work limits the range of competitors against whom we compete for customers in these communities. In addition, the number of competitors is limited even further by the level of technical expertise required to deliver products and services to our government customers. We compete either as prime contractor or as a subcontractor, depending on the requirements and scope of the project.
Our competitors include both large competitors that offer a broad range of services and capabilities and smaller boutique organizations that are highly focused on particular capabilities, solutions and customers. Our larger competitors include divisions of large defense contractors such as Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company and Northrop Grumman Corporation. We also face competition from a number of large, well-established government contractors such as Leidos Inc., Booz Allen Hamilton Corporation, CACI International, Inc. and others. The smaller competitors are generally privately held corporations with strong capabilities in delivering specific elements of a solution for a narrow range of customers. See “Risk Factors” for a description of the various risks we may face from our competitors.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing capabilities support modest volume product manufacturing consistent with our customers' needs for products that evolve rapidly and on a regular basis. We use a combination of in-house resources and contract manufacturing support provided by third parties. We believe that this approach to our manufacturing needs allows us to carefully manage capital investment while maintaining our ability to meet surges in the volume of customer requirements.
Research and Development
Innovation is an important part of our business model. We look for opportunities to create long-term growth opportunities, on a sole-source basis, by leveraging our in-depth knowledge of our customers' missions and needs, and our ability to use internal research and development (IR&D). Our product and solutions business has evolved through a combination of customer development 
7

and IR&D. We frequently develop a core capability or technology and then customize this capability or technology to meet specific customer requirements.
Our research and development, or R&D, consists of IR&D that is an allowable expense under U.S. Government contracts and research and development that is performed at our expense. Spending on R&D activities may vary, depending on the opportunities that we see and customer requirements. Research and development costs totaled $4.6 million, $3.4 million and $4.6 million for years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. As a percent of revenue R&D was 1.6%, 1.2% and 1.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Intellectual Property
We own seven patents and have four pending patent applications. We have twelve federally registered trademarks, one pending federal trademark registration applications, and four registered copyrights. As we develop intellectual property, we make a determination, with the support of outside patent counsel, of the best manner in which to protect it whether through patent or copyright, or as trade secret. When we acquire companies that have developed intellectual property and have patents pending, we make a determination, with the support of outside patent counsel, of whether we need to continue pursuing the pending patent applications. In conjunction with several of our products, we have developed intellectual property that we are protecting as trade secrets. We have made this determination based on the costs and risks involved, as well as on the pace at which changes are being made to the products. As we build our solutions and products, we also make use of third-party intellectual property for which we purchase licenses, as necessary. We integrate technology, including hardware and software, based on designs and architectures that we develop with our customers.
Regulatory Matters
We must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. The Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, which mandates uniform policies and procedures for U.S. Government acquisitions and purchased services, governs the majority of our contracts. Individual agencies also have acquisition regulations that provide implementing language for the FAR or that supplement the FAR.
Other federal regulations require certification and disclosure of cost or pricing data in connection with contract negotiations for certain types of contracts, define allowable and unallowable costs, govern reimbursement rights under cost-based contracts, and restrict the use, dissemination and exportation of products and information classified for national security purposes.
A substantial portion of the Company’s revenue and costs are subject to audit by the U.S. Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). Billings under government contracts are based on provisional rates that permit recovery of allowable overhead, and general and administrative expenses not exceeding certain limits. These rates are subject to review by the government on an annual basis. When final determination and approval of the allowable rates have been made, billings may be adjusted. Incurred cost audits through December 31, 2010 have been completed without material adjustment to proposed costs. 
Our federal government business is also subject to laws, regulations, and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of classified information and, under U.S. export control laws, the export of certain products and technical data.
Additionally, federal government contracts, by their terms, generally can be terminated at any time by the federal government, without cause, for the convenience of the federal government. If a federal government contract is so terminated, we would be entitled to receive compensation for the services provided and costs incurred through the time of termination, plus settlement expenses and a negotiated amount of profit. Federal government contractors who fail to comply with applicable U.S. Government procurement-related statutes and regulations may be subject to potential contract termination, suspension and debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government, or other remedies. See “Risk Factors” for a description of the various risks we may face regarding laws and regulations relating to U.S. Government contracts.
2016 Developments
During 2016, we continued to establish the Company as a viable and competitive entity within our target markets in part by growing our prime contract base. We intend to continue our acquisition strategy as we find the right complementary companies at the right price.
During the first quarter of 2016, we completed the sale of our Systems Engineering and Technical Assistance (SETA) business. The SETA business was not deemed an individually significant component of our Company. Management decided to sell the SETA business in connection with the ongoing strategic review of our overall business, through which we have determined that the growth potential of both KeyW's core business and the SETA business could be maximized if the two businesses were separated. The sale of the SETA business eliminated KeyW’s conflicts at two key government agencies and will allow our Company to focus 100% on technology development opportunities across the Intelligence Community. However, the sale of SETA did not represent 
8

a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our operations and financial results and, accordingly, the business historical results and the gain on sale were classified within continuing operations on our Consolidated Statements of Operations. Because the sale of SETA was not deemed a discontinued operation, its assets and liabilities of the business were not reclassified as held for sale on our December 31, 2015, balance sheet.
During the second quarter of 2016, the Company sold the Hexis Cyber Solutions, Inc. ("Hexis") business in its entirety. The Hexis business marketed our HawkEye products and related maintenance and services to the commercial cyber sector and comprised our entire former Commercial Cyber Solutions reportable segment. Our Commercial Cyber Solutions segment is reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements as a discontinued operation, and all the financial data in this filing has been recast to present our Commercial Cyber Solutions segment as a discontinued operation for all periods presented (refer to Note 16 - Businesses Held for Sale, Discontinued Operations and Dispositions to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15 of this Annual Report for more information).
