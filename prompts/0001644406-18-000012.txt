Hostess - Who We Are
Timeline Since Relaunch
Hostess Brands, Inc. is a leading packaged food company whose brands date back to 1919, when the Hostess® CupCake was introduced, followed by Twinkies® in 1930. Our brands represent 17.2% of the Sweet Baked Goods (“SBG”) category according to Nielsen total universe for the 52-week ended December 30, 20171. 
We believe our strong brand history and our market position in the SBG category provide an unparalleled platform to execute our strategic initiatives.

The Brand
Hostess® has been an iconic American brand for generations. In April 2013, we acquired the Hostess® and Dolly Madison® brands out of the bankruptcy liquidation proceedings of its prior owners, free and clear of all prior liabilities, contracts, deferred taxes and other “legacy” issues. After a brief hiatus in production, we began providing Hostess products to retailer partners and consumers nationwide in July 2013. We offer a variety of new and classic treats under the Hostess® brand including Twinkies®, Cupcakes, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Donettes®, and Zingers® among others. By combining Hostess’ strong reputation with innovative technology and a Direct-To-Warehouse (“DTW”) business model, we rapidly recaptured market share. 
In nearly five years we have invested approximately $200 million to upgrade our manufacturing footprint, implement new IT systems and enhance production efficiency through the installation of automated baking and packaging lines. These investments, combined with our DTW distribution model, have reestablished Hostess’ leading, premium brand position in the $6.6 billion U.S. SBG category and have increased our distribution channels and paved new growth opportunities for the Company.
Our DTW distribution model uses centralized distribution centers and common carriers to fill orders, with products generally delivered to our customers’ warehouses. This model has eliminated the need for Direct-Store-Delivery (“DSD”) routes and drivers which has allowed us to expand our core distribution while gaining access to new channels (e.g., further penetration into convenience, drug store, dollar, foodservice, and cash & carry). We have both renewed and added relationships with retailers and distributors around the country.

Our Growth Strategy
Our strategy is to be the premium sweet baked goods market leader in the United States by producing innovative products which enable us to grow faster than the SBG category.  This growth will be driven by our strategic initiatives: 
Strategic initiatives

– | Core distribution expansion


– | Innovation


– | Expansion of white space


– | Platform for future acquisitions

Our strategic initiatives have been a key part of our success since our launch in 2013. We continue to execute on these as we launch items that expand on our core distribution and whitespace opportunities. With our recent acquisition of the Cloverhill® bakery in February 2018, we continue to leverage our position and deliver on our strategic initiatives. 
Core Distribution Expansion
We plan to capitalize on the strength of the Hostess® brand and our attractive retailer economics in order to drive growth by generating new customers and increasing the number of stores carrying our products. With the potential afforded by the extended reach of the warehouse model, distribution and market share gains are expected to come from traditional channels (“core expansion”) through our investment in quality, targeted marketing, product renovation and a focus on our top brands and SKUs that continue to deliver. Our top 7 brands in 2017 represented 74.0% of our net revenue for the fiscal year and 82.9% of our market share for the 52-weeks ending December 30, 2017. The Company grew total distribution points by 11% in 2017. 
Our brand strategy, combined with investments in highly effective marketing and brand-building, has resulted in what we believe to be one of the strongest brand equities in snacking. While we have re-established and grown our presence throughout the traditional channels in which Old Hostess previously operated, there remains further opportunity to close the gap in market share relative to Old Hostess’ penetration. By expanding points of distribution, increasing SKU assortments and recapturing shelf space in existing retailers, we plan to continue our top line growth. Our top three products (Donettes®, Twinkies® and Cupcakes) have All Commodity Volume (“ACV”) distribution rates in core channels that are significantly higher than the average rate achieved by other products in our portfolio (based on Nielsen 52 weeks ending December 30, 2017) . These high levels are directly correlated to our focused approach on our strategic initiatives. By applying this tailored and focused approach to our other existing product lines, we will work with retailers to expand the average number of SKUs offered and attempt to reduce distribution gaps. The average number of products selling at core retailers today is approximately 23 items.
Innovation
7

Our innovation is key to fueling our growth. We extend the Hotess® brand in segments to meet consumer demand. In doing this, we are devoted to maintaining our iconic brands while contemporizing in order to stay relevant with consumers into the future. Supporting our premium position requires us to evolve with changing consumer preferences and trends.
The success of our product innovation is in part driven by understanding consumer preferences, providing awareness and trials by partnering with our customers, all while maintaining our iconic brands and product quality. With strong innovation from previous years, we continued in 2017 with a robust pipeline of innovation including peanut butter products, Hostess Bake Shop™, and Hostess Bakery Petites™. This, combined with flavor innovation in 2017 with the Golden Cup Cake, Chocolate Cake Twinkies®, and White Fudge Ding Dongs®, led to a contribution of approximately $62.5 million of net revenue from products launched in 2017. We will continue this innovation and expect to introduce a number of new items in early 2018. 
During 2017 we launched Hostess Bakery Petites™, a premium snacking platform made with no artificial flavors or colors or high fructose corn syrup. We believe there is growth potential in providing an on-the-go snacking option for ingredient conscious consumers. We continue to develop new flavors and platforms, and have a robust innovation pipeline that expands the Hostess brand across categories. 
The in-store bakery (“ISB”) sections of grocery and club retailers are increasingly utilized to provide a differentiated shopping experience and to showcase product offerings. Our Superior on Main® and Hostess Bake Shop™ brands include eclairs, madeleines, brownies, and iced cookies, as well as preservative-free and gluten-free products offered in the ISB section.
The breakfast sub-category is a significant opportunity for the Company where our share is 15%, nearly a 5.0% share gap compared to All Day Snacking. This sub-category represents approximately 51.3% of the $6.6 billion SBG category according to Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2017. According to a July 2016 study by Mintel, convenience and brand preference continue to influence snack selection, as over half of U.S. consumers rate portability as a key attribute in breakfast items. These consumption trends play to our strengths as our products conveniently come packaged in both single-serve and multipack varieties. In addition, we have launched a line of Hostess jumbo muffins, danishes, and glazed donuts, which have been well-received as new breakfast offerings. Further to this, we expect our recent acquisition of the Cloverhill® bakery in Chicago to enable us to leverage our current platform and to expand our breakfast capabilities in this core product category. 
We also understand the need to continually evolve while maintaining the tradition and offerings our loyal consumer base has come to know and love. We have been actively investing in new product development and building our long-term pipeline, leveraging our innovation pipeline and commercialization process to bring new products to market in a timely fashion. Our product innovation strategy is organized around four key objectives:

• | Complementing our existing product offering by launching classic products not yet launched or entirely new products in SBG sub-segments where we currently do not compete;


• | Launching line extensions to drive sub-brand reach;


• | Unlocking new consumer segments with new benefits and / or occasions; and


• | Expanding into new categories and markets to drive highly incremental growth.

Whitespace opportunity
We continue to penetrate ISB in the grocery and club channels. Our ISB focus is on core product support and seasonality-relevant core extensions by leveraging the Superior on Main® market presence and product offerings. We have had early success with our licensing in frozen retail and continue to expand into food service through our relationship with a national distributor. We have products that are now packaged for sale in Mexico, the United Kingdom and Canada through third parties. Our products are also sold on various e-commerce platforms.

Platform for future acquisitions
We believe we serve as a platform for growth. Within the fragmented consumer packaged goods market, there exists the opportunity to drive value creation through acquisitions by leveraging our brand, platform, infrastructure and performance driven management culture. We are committed to seeking-out opportunities that add new capabilities to our already broad offerings. 
The acquisition of the Cloverhill® bakery in Chicago, IL, announced in February 2018, is an example where we can leverage our warehouse model and expand our existing breakfast capabilities1. As we explore other opportunities, we will consider our ability to leverage the brand in indulgent Snacking, expand into ISB, and integrate existing SBG business to be produced on our existing assets or integrate a broader market to leverage our warehouse model. 
Our experienced management team includes several individuals who have successfully managed and acquired consumer businesses. We believe our scale, access to capital and management experience will allow us to consider both small and large acquisitions in the future and to integrate them in a seamless fashion.
1 For the 52-week period ended December 30, 2017, Breakfast represented 51% of the SBG category and we had a 15% share compared to All Day Snacking, which represents 49% of the SBG category, where we had a 20% share
The Category: Large and Attractive
Nearly all U.S. consumers eat snacks at least once per day. The U.S. SBG category is one of the largest categories within the broader $97 billion U.S. Total Snack category, with estimated retail sales of $6.6 billion in 2017 according to Nielsen U.S. total universe for the 52 weeks ended December 30, 2017. The SBG category includes breakfast items (e.g., donuts, breakfast danishes, and muffins) and all-day snacking items (e.g., snack cakes, pies, bars, brownies, blondies, and cookies). According to The Nielsen Company, the Sweet Snacks category (Candy, Cookies, Desserts, Fruit Snacks, SBG) accounted for 59.2% of the Total Snacks category dollars. 
Since its reintroduction to the market in 2013, the Hostess® brand has contributed significantly to the total growth of the SBG category. During the Hostess® brand’s hiatus from 2012 to 2013 the category declined by 8%. From the reintroduction of Hostess® through December 31, 2017, the category has grown 14%. 
During 2017, the Hostess® brands contributed $38 million or 3.5% to the category’s growth. All other brands on a combined basis declined $95 million. The Hostess® brand’s 17.2% share of the category represents an opportunity for continued growth in comparison to its pre-hiatus share of 22.8%. Hostess® is the number one brand in the two largest SBG category segments: snack cakes and doughnuts. These two segments accounted for 49% of total category sales volume. The brand’s average price point is at an 80% premium over the category leader.
Competitive landscape
9

Hostess® is #2 in the U.S. SBG category. The top three brands account for 60% of the SBG retail sales according to Nielsen, while the rest of the category remains fairly fragmented. With limited private label penetration within the category (3.5% market share vs. 19.5% for overall packaged food), consumers have shown a strong preference for trusted brands within the SBG category. The leading positions are solidified through extensive product portfolios, strong brand awareness, established distribution capabilities and long-standing relationships with critical high-volume retailers. Furthermore, high levels of capital investment are required to establish manufacturing and distribution capabilities of meaningful scale, providing additional barriers to entry.
Seasonality
Sweet baked goods revenues tend to be moderately seasonal, with declines during the early winter period, which we believe are attributable to altered consumption patterns during the holiday season. We expect this trend to continue and continue to be applicable to our business. We strive to mitigate the seasonality by running certain targeted promotional campaigns.
Strategy Execution
Our Competitive Strengths
Leading brands synonymous with American snacking
We believe that we have maintained our brand power and category awareness for nearly a century by satisfying consumers’ need for fun, light-hearted treats. We believe our portfolio of highly recognized products is synonymous with American snacking, and there is perhaps no better indicator of this than our 90%+ brand awareness, according to a Harman Atchison study in 2014. We believe that we have established our leadership position in the SBG segment through the strength and quality of our products, developing and promoting a brand that unites our loyal consumer base and by pricing our products at a reasonable premium to other snacking alternatives. 
The New Hostess is an innovation engine
When we relaunched Hostess®, we set out to challenge the status quo business model of our competitors. We established our innovative DTW distribution model and heavily invested in our bakeries, which has resulted in energy, labor and time savings, along with the ability to achieve efficiently made quality products. These investments paved the way for new product innovation. Unlike Old Hostess, whose DSD model required new products to be manufactured on various lines in multiple facilities in order to facilitate distribution across the country, we can now leverage our existing infrastructure and produce new products on one line in one facility. Centralized production allows us to continually innovate and bring new products to market while not disrupting the production of our existing product portfolio.
We are devoted to maintaining our iconic brands while contemporizing in order to stay relevant with consumers into the future. We believe that to support our premium position, we must continually evolve with changing consumer preferences and trends. As such, we have created an infrastructure that allows us to remain flexible. We continue to develop new flavors and platforms, and have a robust innovation pipeline that expands the Hostess® brand across categories. Recent launches include White Fudge Ding Dongs®, Hostess Bake Shop™ , Hostess Bakery Petites™ and Peanut Butter Ho Hos®. Collectively, we believe our product launches have been successful and augmented our top line growth. Product launches in 2017 have resulted in net revenue of $62.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
DTW Distribution Model
We believe our DTW distribution model has created a substantial whitespace opportunity, which is one of the key drivers that we expect to fuel our future growth. We have greater access to convenience, drug and dollar stores. Distributing to these channels under a DSD model can be inefficient due to small average drop size. Similarly, we have an opportunity to continue building distribution in the drug store channel after having successfully established a strong presence. Historically, DSD snack cake companies have competed with candy and tobacco distributors; however, our 
10

DTW model has enabled us to partner with these third-party distributors who can profitably penetrate both the convenience store and drug store channels and who are looking for opportunities to gain share in the SBG category. For 2017, convenience and drug stores accounted for 32.6% of net revenues. We have established a strong presence and market share in the drug store channel and are focused on continuously expanding coverage of convenience stores. These partnerships further expand our distribution reach in a highly efficient manner, and we believe they will add to our growth potential going forward.
We utilize a DTW distribution system, using centralized distribution centers and common carriers. From our five baking facilities, products are shipped to three distribution centers located in Shorewood, Illinois, Carthage, Missouri and Worcester, Massachusetts. Each distribution center is owned and operated by third parties. The distribution centers are able to fill customer orders and reduce inventory on hand as a result of this centralized consolidation of inventory. Products are delivered to customers’ warehouses from the distribution centers using common carriers. A small number of our customers pick up their orders directly from our distribution centers.
 The DTW model is enabled by our extended shelf life (“ESL”) technology. Some of our products are shipped frozen at the request of certain retailers. As a result of our DTW model, we do not keep a significant backlog of finished goods inventory, as our fresh bakery products are promptly shipped to our distribution centers after being produced.
Highly efficient and profitable business model.
We continue to invest heavily in automation, which allows for improved product quality, consistency and efficiency. However, the benefits of our industry redefining model are felt even after our products leave the bakery. By shipping products using prebuilt, shippable display cases through our DTW network, we believe we now offer retailers an enhanced merchandising asset and the ability to execute nationwide marketing campaigns with retail-ready displays placed in stores across the country all on the same day. Given the impulse driven nature of the category, in-store displays are a key differentiator in driving sales velocities.
Our business model is supported by cost-advantaged manufacturing and distribution, expanded channel/retail store reach and enhanced in-store merchandising capabilities, and offers retailers attractive margins that incentivize further distribution of our products.
We believe that impulse purchase decisions are another fundamental driver of retail sales in the SBG category, which makes prominent in-store placement an essential growth lever. The DTW model provides us with a competitive advantage through the ability to utilize retail-ready corrugated displays. These pre-built displays are visually impactful, produced economically, and require minimal in-store labor to assemble or load, thus providing cost-efficient display vehicles that benefit both the retailer and us alike. Preloaded displays also allow us full control over our brand marketing, which allows us to execute retailer-wide campaigns regionally or nationally in a consistent manner, providing a unique competitive advantage across the entire SBG category, which is predominantly DSD-served.
Investment of Capital
With nearly $200 million invested in the business since the re-launch in 2013, combined with our growth strategy, we anticipate continued investment in the business under our strategic initiatives. Our capital investment focus will be on operational capabilities that directly support or expand our growth and innovation. Further, we anticipate continued investment in automation and productivity gains.
Production
We produce Hostess® and/or Dolly Madison® products at three baking facilities located in Emporia, Kansas; Columbus, Georgia; and Indianapolis, Indiana. In-Store bakery products are produced at two baking facilities located in Southbridge, Massachusetts. We have invested heavily in baking and packaging technology to improve productivity and efficiency, including installing two Autobake systems and a fully-automated packaging system. A portion of our products are co-manufactured and packaged under our brands and sold through our distribution facilities.
11

Our state of the art Autobake technologies have resulted in significant energy, labor and time savings. The technology provides fully-automated industrial baking ovens and systems, combining cost efficient, compact and continuous baking solutions that can be custom configured. The first Autobake, which exclusively produces Twinkies®, was installed in Emporia, Kansas in July 2014. Its capabilities include equipment that fully-automates the packaging process (from wrapping to palletizing). We installed the second Autobake in Emporia in March 2015, which exclusively produces cupcakes.
Raw Materials
Our principal raw materials are flour, sweeteners, edible oils and compound coating, as well as corrugate and films used to package our products. We utilize various buying strategies to lock in prices for various raw materials and packaging to reduce the impact of commodity price fluctuations. In addition, we are dependent on natural gas as fuel for firing our ovens. Our third-party common carriers use gasoline and diesel as fuel for their trucks.
We have strategic, long-term relationships with our key suppliers for our raw materials and packaging that help leverage our buying power. While the cost of some raw materials has, and may continue to, increase or decrease over time, we believe that we will be able to purchase an adequate supply of raw materials as needed. We also sole source certain raw materials. We have multiple vendors that meet the Company’s supply requirements for the sole sourced materials, except in the case of the enzymes used in our ESL technology. With respect to the enzymes, we continue to evaluate other sources in order to maintain business continuity and flexibility.
Customers
Our top 10 customers in 2017 accounted for 59.9% of total net revenue. During 2017, our largest customer, Wal-Mart and affiliates, represented 20.4% of our net revenue. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of 2017 net revenue. The loss of, or a material negative change in, our relationship with Wal-Mart or any of our other top 10 customers could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our customers include mass merchandisers, supermarkets and other retailers, distributors, convenience, drug and dollar stores.
Competition
We face competition from other brands, large national bakeries, smaller regional operators, supermarket chains with their own private label brands, and grocery stores with their own in-store bakery departments. The key competitive factors in the industry include product quality, price, customer service, brand recognition and loyalty, promotional activities, access to retail outlets, sufficient shelf-space and ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. Some of our largest national competitors include Flowers Foods, Inc., Group Bimbo, S.A. and McKee Foods Corporation. In addition, we also compete with regional sweet goods branded manufacturers and other companies, including in the ISB space, that produce cookies, candies and other sweet snacks. At times, we experience pricing pressure in certain of our markets from competitor promotions and other pricing practices. However, we believe our brand recognition, product quality and innovation have generated consumer loyalty to many of our products help mitigate this impact.
Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed to the success of our business. In particular, our trademarks, including our registered Hostess® and Dolly Madison® brand trademarks and our sub-brand trademarks, including Twinkies®, Ding Dongs®, Ho Hos®, Zingers®, Sno Balls®, and Donettes®, are valuable assets that we believe reinforces our consumers’ favorable perception of our products.
From time to time, third parties have used names similar to ours, have applied to register trademarks similar to ours and, we believe, have infringed or misappropriated our intellectual property rights. Third parties have also, from time to time, opposed our trademarks and challenged our intellectual property rights. We respond to these actions on a case-by-case basis.
12

We rely on laws and regulations, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights.
Research and Development
The majority of our research and development spend is dedicated to enhancing and expanding our product lines, responding to changing consumer preferences and trends and continuing to enhance the taste of our products. In addition, our research and development organization provides technical support to ensure that our core products are consistently produced in accordance with our high standards of quality and specifications. Finally, this department is charged with developing processes to reduce our costs without adversely affecting the quality of our products.
Government Regulation
Our operations, including the manufacturing, processing, formulating, packaging, labeling and advertising of products, are subject to regulation by various federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”), and the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”). Our products are subject to various local, state, and federal laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business. We must comply with provisions regulating registrations and licensing, health and sanitation standards, current Good Manufacturing Practices and traceability, food labeling, equal employment, wage and hour requirements, and environmental protection, among others. We take compliance and the safety of our products seriously and take all steps that we consider necessary or appropriate to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 1,340 people. Of our total workforce, approximately 1,170 were located at our bakery facilities. The remaining workers comprised functions including operations management, sales and supply chain, among others. In early 2015, we entered into collective bargaining agreements with the local unions of the Bakery, Confectionary, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union in Indianapolis, Indiana and Columbus, Georgia. Approximately 360 employees are covered by these collective bargaining agreements.
We consider our relations with employees to be good and have not experienced a strike or significant work stoppage.
Employee Safety and Environmental Sustainability
We are committed to keeping our employees safe, protecting the environment and providing developmental opportunities for our employees.  We endeavor to be a company of energized people and to be a good corporate citizen.
Our goal is to create a higher standard of living and quality of life for our employees and our communities. New automation, safety investments and behavioral safety training have resulted in higher employee engagement and lower workers’ compensation costs. We meet periodically with local and state leaders to discuss business planning and ways to become a better community partner with educational, municipal and regulatory agencies.  We promote participation in charitable organizations and make philanthropic donations in some of the communities where we operate.
We also routinely donate a portion of our excess production to food banks in areas where we operate.
