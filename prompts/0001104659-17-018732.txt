ITEM 1.                        BUSINESS.
Our Corporate History and Background
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 05, 2013. Our original business plan was to sell freshly squeezed juices from mobile stands in London, United Kingdom, but this business was not successful and we did not generate any revenue from this business.
 
On October 28, 2016, Roman Ehlert, our sole director, officer and principal stockholder, transferred an aggregate of 6,000,000 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 73.98% of our issued and outstanding capital stock on a fully-diluted basis, to Jun Chen, Jian Xiong, Guili Xiong, Shuwen Du, Lianze Xiong, Gang Deng, Guoping Wang, Zhongnan Liu, Yue Wang, Yebiao Ding, Xiuyuan Bai and Jiahong Du, for an aggregate purchase price of $228,000, which resulted in a change of control of our company. Mr. Ehlert resigned as our sole director and officer upon closing of this transaction and appointed Mr. Jun Chen as our sole director, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer.
 
On December 16, 2016, we entered into a share purchase agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with PGL and its shareholders, pursuant to which we agreed to acquire 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of PGL in exchange for 500,000,000 shares of our common stock.  Closing will occur on or before June 18, 2017 (the Closing) and will be contingent upon completion of a full valuation and audit of the financial position of PGL. In January 2017, these 500,000,000 shares were issued to the shareholders of PGL. All shares issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement have been held in escrow and deemed to be in the full control of the Company until the Closing.
 
On the same date, Mr. Jun Chen resigned as our sole officer, effective as of December 19, 2016, but continued to serve as a member of our board of directors. Mr. Zonghua Chen was appointed as our Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Financial Officer effective as of December 19, 2016.  In addition, effective as of December 19, 2016, our board of directors was increased from one (1) to five (5) members and Zonghua Chen and Maozi Cong were appointed to our board, with two (2) vacancies remaining, and Mr. Zonghua Chen was appointed as the Chairman.
 
On December 19, 2016, our shareholders approved an increase to the number of authorized shares from 75,000,000 shares to 750,000,000 shares and added 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. The board of directors of the Company is authorized to provide for the issuance of preferred stock in series, with such designations, preferences and relative participating, optional or other special rights and qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The Company filed a Certificate of Amendment with the State of Nevada, effective on December 20, 2016, increasing the number of authorized shares from 75,000,000 shares to 750,000,000 shares and adding a new class of 250,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share.
Our Business
 
During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2017, other than seeking to consummate a combination transaction with a profitable, privately held operating business, we were not engaged in any significant business activities and had no operations or revenues.  We incurred limited operating expenses necessary to maintain our status as a corporation in good standing and conduct search for and evaluation of potential business opportunities.
 
Upon the closing the transaction contemplated by the Purchase Agreement, we expect to refocus our business as an innovative O2O(ONLINE TO OFFLINE) business platform operator covering both online E-commerce and offline commercial chain entity of three dimensional synchronous operation together with integrated comprehensive services for consumer manufacturing enterprises.
 
Employees
 
At present, we have no employees other than our officer and director.  We presently do not have pension, health, annuity, insurance, stock options, profit sharing or similar benefit plans; however, we may adopt such plans in the future.  There are presently no personal benefits available to any officers or directors.
