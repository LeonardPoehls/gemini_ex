 Summary
  
 Advanced Environmental Recycling Technologies, Inc. (the Company, AERT, we, our or us), founded in 1988, develops and commercializes technologies to recycle waste polyethylene plastics and develops, manufactures, and markets value-added, green building products. The majority of our products are composite building materials that are a superior replacement for traditional wood or plastic products for exterior applications in building and remodeling homes and for certain other industrial or commercial building purposes. Our products are made primarily from approximately equal amounts of recycled polyethylene plastic and waste wood fiber, which have been cleaned, sized and reprocessed utilizing our patented and proprietary technologies. Our products have been extensively tested, and are sold or distributed by leading companies such as Lowe’s Companies, Inc. (Lowe’s), BlueLinx Corp. (BlueLinx), Cedar Creek LLC (Cedar Creek) and CanWel Building Materials Ltd. (CanWel), our Canadian distributor for Lowe’s Canada. Our products are primarily used in renovation and remodeling by consumers, homebuilders, and contractors as an exterior environmentally responsible (“Green”) building alternative for decking, railing, and trim products.
  
 We currently manufacture all of our composite products at extrusion facilities in Springdale, Arkansas. We operate a plastic recycling, blending and storage facility in Lowell, Arkansas, where we also lease a warehouse and land for inventory storage. We also operate a plastic recycling, cleaning, and reformulation facility at Watts, Oklahoma.
 
 
 
  Products
  
 Building on our base process and materials, we manufacture the following product lines:
  
   ●
 Commercial and residential decking planks and accessories such as balusters and handrails under the MoistureShield®, MoistureShield® Pro and ChoiceDek® brands,

 
   ●
 Exterior door components,

 
   ●
 Green recycled plastic resin compounds.

 
 The wood fiber content of our products gives them many properties similar to all-wood products, but we believe that the plastic content renders our products superior to both all-wood or all-plastic alternatives because:
  
   ●
 Unlike wood, our products do not require preservatives or treatment with toxic chemicals or annual sealing or staining.

 
   ●
 Our products are less subject to thermal contraction or expansion and have greater dimensional stability than competing all-plastic products.

 
   ●
 Our products are engineered for superior moisture-resistance and will not decompose like wood.

 
   ●
 Our products are less subject to rotting, cracking, warping, splintering, insect infestation, and water absorption than conventional wood materials.

 
   ●
 Our products are aesthetically enhanced to provide a wood-like or grained surface appearance.

 
   ●
 Our products are combined with coloring agents and/or other additives to provide various colors and aesthetics.

 
   ●
 Since 2006, our products have contained a mildewcide to inhibit the growth of mold.

 
   ●
 Our latest generation of products offers colors and textures to more closely resemble the natural look of wood.

 Based upon our extensive product testing and successful extended field history, we offer a 25-year limited replacement warranty on our ChoiceDek® Foundations™ and a limited lifetime replacement warranty on our MoistureShield® products against rot and fungal decay, and termite and insect damage.
  
  Marketing and Sales
  
 General Market Strategy. Our products are designed for applications where we can add the greatest value and address market needs, i.e., for external applications where wood is prone to rot and/or requires substantial annual maintenance in the form of staining or sealing. Though we believe there are many possible applications for our wood/plastic composite technology, we have focused our resources and personnel on outdoor decking and handrail components and door and other original equipment manufacturer (OEM) components that represent the most attractive market opportunities at this time. Within these markets, we are constantly working to develop and improve strong customer relationships.
  
 Sales and Customer Service. We provide sales support and customer service through our own marketing department, contract marketing through outside commissioned representatives, Lowe’s, and training programs for our customers and their sales associates. We also promote our decking products through interactive displays at national, regional, and local home and garden shows, as well as through in-store displays. Our in-house sales and customer support team is focused on serving commercial decking contractors and customers, and supporting the sales professionals at our regional building products distributors, as well as Lowe’s. Information and customer service are provided through the websites www.choicedek.com and www.moistureshield.com, and through a national toll-free customer assistance telephone number: 1-800-951-5117.
  
 Cyclical Nature of Building Products Industry. Our products are used primarily in home improvement and new home construction. The home improvement and housing construction industries are subject to significant fluctuations in activity generally due to seasonal climate changes. Reductions in activity have an adverse effect on the demand for our products. We have focused a large portion of our business on the remodel and repair market segment, which we believe is less cyclical than the new homebuilding market.
  
 Facility Upgrades/Product Innovation. In our ongoing pursuit to satisfy our customers and to keep up with changing trends in the marketplace, we continuously work to develop new products and improve existing products. We have invested significantly in our extrusion operations over the last several years. The aesthetics of our products, which are overwhelmingly composed of recycled materials, have improved with technology advances.
  
 The composite decking business is continuously evolving. The technology used to manufacture wood/plastic composite (WPC) boards has advanced significantly over the last several years, and many contemporary products have much improved aesthetics. Going forward, it will be important for us to continue to innovate, keep in close touch with consumer trends and focus on regional market trends while remaining competitive with all-wood, all-plastic and WPC decking.
  
  Our Brands
  
 ChoiceDek® Decking. We currently sell our ChoiceDek® branded decking and railing products in the home improvement warehouse (HIW) market through Lowe’s. Approximately 50% of our revenue in 2016 was from ChoiceDek® products. This market segment primarily focuses on the do-it-yourself (DIY) market in which homeowners buy, build, and install their own decks. The ChoiceDek® brand is sold to consumers exclusively at Lowe’s. ChoiceDek® is promoted through in-store displays and an ongoing print and marketing campaign targeting the HIW decking market. We maintain a nationwide sales and customer service group, and Lowe’s also conducts national print and television ads for the products it carries, including from time to time, our ChoiceDek® brand of decking and railing products.
  
 MoistureShield® Decking. Our MoistureShield® brand line (which includes Pro, Vantage, Refine and Vision) of decking products is currently sold to select primary distributors, who re-sell to lumber dealers and contractor yards for sale to local deck builders and home builders. Most of our MoistureShield® customers are purchasing, or have been exposed to, competing brands of composite decking. On this higher end segment, we believe success will require converting customers from competing products to our brands. As with all of AERT’s products, it can be installed on the ground, in the ground or in the water. Approximately 40% of our revenues in 2016 were from MoistureShield® products.

 Door Component Products. We sell our MoistureShield® industrial products to door manufacturers for use as component parts in products. For example, we manufacture door rails built into doors by Therma-Tru Corporation, Northwest Hardwoods, and JELD-WEN, and door frames for Quanex Building Products. In marketing these products, we emphasize the value-added feature of the MoistureShield® composite product, which, unlike competing wood products, can be engineered to incorporate certain desired end-product characteristics that save our customers time and expense. Customers also avoid the need for chemical treatments to their final product, which are often otherwise necessary to prevent rot and sustain durability. The durability of our MoistureShield® composite components allows our customers to extend the lifetime or warranties of their products while reducing warranty claims costs. We are unable to predict the future size of the markets for MoistureShield® industrial products; however, we believe that the national door and window and commercial and residential trim markets are large, and will allow us to diversify our customer base over time as we add production capacity and focus on additional opportunities.
  
  Competition
  
 Our products compete with high-grade western pine, cedar and other premium woods, aluminum, high-performance plastics, and an increasing number of composites and other construction materials. We believe that our products have superior characteristics, which make them a better value for the consumer; however, they are initially more expensive than traditional wood products. Additionally, manufacturers of some competing products have long-established ties to the building and construction industry and have well-accepted products.
  
 Sales of non-wood decking products to date represent a small portion of the decking market. Pressure treated pine, cedar, redwood and other traditional woods constitute the vast majority of annual decking sales in the United States. We therefore view manufacturers and suppliers of wood decking as our principal competitors. The wood decking industry is highly segmented with many small to medium-sized manufacturers. Wood decking is principally a commodity that competes as the low-priced product, whereas the more expensive non-wood products must compete on features and performance.
  
 Among manufacturers of alternative decking materials, we view Trex Company, AZEK Building Products, Tamko Building Products, and Fiber Composites LLC as our primary competitors. We believe that our MoistureShield® products have superior characteristics and are competitively priced. We emphasize durability, which means that manufacturers and homebuilders using our products should see reduced warranty callbacks and higher customer satisfaction. Our product competes not only on durability, but also the ability of the customer to order a product that is custom manufactured to its specifications.
  
  Customer Concentration
  
 We have significant customer concentration, with two customers, Lowe’s and BlueLinx representing approximately 45% and 10%, respectively, of our revenue in 2016. A loss of Lowe’s, or a major reduction in their business, would cause a significant reduction in our liquidity. We continue to broaden our distribution network by adding new distributors for our MoistureShield® brand which will reduce our customer concentration.
 Intellectual Property and Proprietary Technology
  
 Our products are built for hostile external environmental conditions. Our recycling processes focus on intensive cleaning and reformulating of our raw materials prior to extrusion. Our extrusion process is unique and focuses on total encapsulation of the wood fibers. Our composite manufacturing process and our development efforts in connection with waste plastics reclamation technologies involve patents and many trade secrets that we consider to be proprietary. We have also developed certain methods, processes, and equipment designs for which we have sought additional patent protection.
  
 Our patents cover plastic recycling processes, methods, and apparatus or other specially designed equipment as well as the composite product that we manufacture. We have also received patents with regard to our mixed recycled plastic resin identification and reformulation technologies. One of our patents expires in 2018, one in 2021 and the remainder expire in 2028.
  
 We continue to update and refine our recycling processes, procedures, and technologies, and we have included these updates in our most recently issued patents and pending patent applications. We have taken additional measures to protect our intellectual property and trade secrets by restricting access to our facilities and maintaining a policy of nondisclosure, which includes requiring confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements among our associates.
  
 Expenditures for research and development activities for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 were $0.7 million and $0.6 million, respectively.

  Raw Materials
  
 Wood Fiber. The wood fiber we use is primarily waste byproduct generated by hardwood furniture, cabinet and flooring manufacturers. However, we see competition for scrap wood fiber for use as a fuel to replace other fuels for both residential and industrial applications.
  
 Recycled Plastics. We use primarily post-consumer waste polyethylene. The largest portion of the plastic materials we use is mixed with paper and other non-plastic materials, which lessens its value to other plastic recyclers. By principally sourcing these contaminated waste plastics prior to processing; we produce a usable but lower-cost feedstock for our composite extrusion lines. We believe our investments in recycling technology and infrastructure creates a significant raw material cost advantage compared to several of our virgin resin-based competitors while offering a more competitive green building product.
  
 Competition for Raw Materials. As the wood/plastic composites industry grows, we compete for raw materials with other plastic recyclers or plastic resin producers. We believe that our ability to use more contaminated polyethylene limits the number of competitors. Nonetheless, we expect to continue to encounter new entrants into the plastics reclamation business. We increased our capacity for processing waste plastic in recent years, which reduced our dependence on outside suppliers and gave us more control over our costs.
  
  Industry Standards
  
 Our decking and railing products comply with the International Building Code and the International Residential Code as well as the 1997 Uniform Building Code™ (UBC) and the BOCA® National Building Code/1999 (BNBC). The International Code Council – Evaluation Service (ICC-ES) publishes evaluation reports for building products. These evaluation reports inform the consumer, commercial and residential markets, that the products listed in such reports comply with the UBC and BNBC when they are used in the prescribed application and installed according to the manufacturer’s installation instructions. In 2009, we converted from the legacy evaluation report, NER-596, to ESR-2388 from ICC-ES. In Canada, compliance of our products to the UBC and BNBC is documented in evaluation report CCMC 13191-R from the Canadian Construction Materials Center. We utilize an independent third-party to ensure continuing compliance of our products with applicable building codes.
  
 The Company has also received from ICC-ES a Verification of Attributes Report, also known as VAR-1015, that verifies the content of recycled materials in our decking, railing and OEM products.
  
  Employees
  
 Due to the seasonality of our business and timing of orders received from our largest customers, the number of permanent employees is adjusted throughout the course of the year. At December 31, 2016 we had 351 full-time employees compared to 401 full-time employees at December 31, 2015.
 Proposed Merger
  
 On March 16, 2017, the Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) with Oldcastle Architectural, Inc., a Delaware corporation (Parent), and Oldcastle Ascent Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub), under which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the Merger) with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.
