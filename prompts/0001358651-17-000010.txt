ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Our Company

Founded over 100 years ago, we are one of the largest omni-channel luxury fashion retailers in the world, with approximately $4.7 billion in revenues for fiscal year 2017, of which approximately 31% were transacted online. Our Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and MyTheresa brands represent fashion, luxury and style to our customers. We offer a distinctive selection of women’s and men’s apparel, handbags, shoes, cosmetics and precious and designer jewelry from premier luxury and fashion designers to our loyal and affluent customers “anytime, anywhere, any device.” We have a longstanding heritage of providing the highest level of personalized, concierge-style service to our customers through our experienced team of sales associates.
Under each of our primary brands, we offer our customers a curated and compelling assortment of narrowly distributed merchandise from luxury and fashion designers, including Chanel, Gucci, Brunello Cucinelli, Tom Ford, Christian Louboutin, Valentino, Saint Laurent, Prada, Akris, David Yurman, Ermenegildo Zegna, Loro Piana, Brioni, Louis Vuitton, Goyard and Van Cleef & Arpels. We believe we are the retail partner of choice to luxury designers because we offer distinctive distribution channels that access our loyal and affluent customers and adhere to strict presentation, marketing and promotional standards consistent with the luxury experience. We also have a long history of identifying, partnering with and nurturing emerging designers with the potential for rapid growth. The combined offering from established and emerging designers ensures our merchandise assortment remains unique, compelling and relevant as fashion trends evolve.
As a leader in omni-channel retailing, we provide our customers a deep assortment of luxury merchandise and a consistent, seamless shopping experience, whether our customers shop in our stores, on our websites or via e-mail, text or phone communications with our sales associates. Our comprehensive digital platform integrates and personalizes the online and in-store experience. We empower our sales associates with mobile devices and proprietary technology to improve their connection with our customers and we utilize advanced analytics to personalize merchandise presentations to our customers when they shop online. We believe that a significant portion of the total luxury spending of our customers is digitally influenced via purchases researched and/or transacted online.
We engage our customers primarily through three brands:
Neiman Marcus. Our Neiman Marcus brand caters to affluent luxury customers. We operate 42 full‑line stores in marquee retail locations in major U.S. markets. Our stores are designed to provide a modern, luxurious ambiance by blending art, architecture and technology. In addition, we provide our customers access to our Neiman Marcus brand through our online platform, neimanmarcus.com, and our mobile app.

Bergdorf Goodman. Our Bergdorf Goodman brand caters to the most discerning luxury clientele. We operate two full‑line stores that feature elegant shopping environments in landmark locations on Fifth Avenue in New York City and through our Bergdorf Goodman online platform, bergdorfgoodman.com. 
MyTheresa. Our MyTheresa brand appeals to younger, fashion‑forward, luxury customers, primarily from Europe, Asia and the Middle East. We operate mytheresa.com, our mobile app and the THERESA flagship store in Munich, Germany.
We conduct our specialty retail stores and online operations on an omni-channel basis. As our store and online operations have similar economic characteristics, products, services and customers, our operations constitute a single omni-channel reportable segment. 
The Acquisition
On October 25, 2013, the Company merged with and into Mariposa Merger Sub LLC ("Mariposa") pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated September 9, 2013, by and among Neiman Marcus Group, Inc. ("Parent"), Mariposa and the Company, with the Company surviving the merger (the "Acquisition"). As a result of the Acquisition and the Conversion (as defined below), the Company is now a direct subsidiary of Mariposa Intermediate Holdings LLC ("Holdings"), which in turn is a direct subsidiary of Parent. Parent is owned by entities affiliated with Ares Management, L.P. and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (together, the "Sponsors") and certain co-investors. Previously, the Company was a subsidiary of Newton Holding, LLC, which was controlled by investment funds affiliated with TPG Global, LLC (collectively with its affiliates, "TPG") and Warburg Pincus LLC (together with TPG, the "Former Sponsors"). On October 28, 2013, the Company and NMG (as defined below) each converted from a Delaware corporation to a Delaware limited liability company (the "Conversion"). References made to "we," "our" and "us" are used to refer to the Company and its subsidiaries, as appropriate to the context.
The Company's operations are conducted through its direct wholly owned subsidiary, The Neiman Marcus Group LLC ("NMG").
Certain financial information of the Company and its subsidiaries is presented on a consolidated basis and is presented as "Predecessor" or "Successor" to indicate whether it relates to the period preceding the Acquisition or the period succeeding the Acquisition, respectively. The Acquisition and the allocation of the purchase price were recorded for accounting purposes as of November 2, 2013, the end of our first quarter of fiscal year 2014. In connection with the Acquisition, the Company incurred substantial new indebtedness, in part in replacement of former indebtedness. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources." In addition, the purchase price paid in connection with the Acquisition was allocated to state the acquired assets and liabilities at fair value. The purchase accounting adjustments increased the carrying value of our property and equipment and inventory, revalued our intangible assets related to our tradenames, customer lists and favorable lease commitments and revalued our long-term benefit plan obligations, among other things. As a result, the Successor financial information subsequent to the Acquisition is not necessarily comparable to the Predecessor financial information.
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to July 31.  Like many other retailers, we follow a 4-5-4 reporting calendar, which means that each fiscal quarter consists of thirteen weeks divided into periods of four weeks, five weeks and four weeks.  All references to (i) fiscal year 2017 relate to the fifty-two weeks ended July 29, 2017, (ii) fiscal year 2016 relate to the fifty-two weeks ended July 30, 2016 and (iii) fiscal year 2015 relate to the fifty-two weeks ended August 1, 2015. References to fiscal year 2014 and years preceding and fiscal year 2018 and years thereafter relate to our fiscal years for such periods. 
Certain amounts presented in tables are subject to rounding adjustments and, as a result, the totals in such tables may not sum.

Our InCircle loyalty program is designed to cultivate long‑term relationships with our U.S. customers. This program includes marketing features, such as private in‑store events, as well as the ability to accumulate points for qualifying purchases. Almost 40% of our total U.S. revenues in fiscal year 2017 were generated by our InCircle loyalty program members who achieved reward status. On a per customer basis, these customers spend approximately 11 times more with us than our other customers.
Our Brands
We operate three primary luxury brands—Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and MyTheresa—which offer the highest level of personalized, concierge-style service and a distinctive selection of women’s and men’s apparel, handbags, shoes, cosmetics and precious and designer jewelry from premier luxury and fashion designers to our loyal and affluent customers “anytime, anywhere, any device.” Our luxury brands comprise a unique, omni-channel retailing model that enables us to leverage our relationships with luxury and fashion designers within each brand to optimize our merchandise allocations and assortments and to expand our customer base and brand awareness by exposing customers of each brand to our other brands through our online platforms and our multi‑brand InCircle loyalty program.
 We also operate Last Call, an off-price fashion brand catering to aspirational, price-sensitive yet fashion-minded customers, and Horchow, a luxury home furnishings and accessories brand. Our Last Call brand sources end-of-season and post-season clearance merchandise from our Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman brands and purchases other off-price merchandise directly from designers for resale, which enables us to effectively manage our inventory while expanding our brand awareness to aspirational, price‑sensitive customers. Our Horchow brand also enhances our brand awareness to purchasers of luxury home furnishings and accessories who may not otherwise be customers of our luxury fashion retail brands.
Neiman Marcus. Neiman Marcus offers distinctive luxury merchandise, including women’s couture and designer apparel, contemporary sportswear, handbags, shoes, cosmetics, men’s clothing and accessories, precious and designer jewelry, decorative home accessories, fine china, crystal and silver, children’s apparel and gift items. Our customers access our Neiman Marcus brand and purchase merchandise through our 42 full-line Neiman Marcus stores located in 18 states and the District of Columbia, our print catalogs, our online platform, neimanmarcus.com, and our mobile app.
Our Neiman Marcus stores are located in marquee retail locations in major metropolitan markets across the United States and are organized as a collection of designer boutiques for established and emerging luxury and fashion designers, each of which is carefully curated by our Neiman Marcus merchandising team. Our Neiman Marcus stores are designed to provide a modern, luxurious ambiance by blending art, architecture and technology. We deliver exceptional customer service and a premier shopping experience through our knowledgeable, professional and well-trained sales associates, our loyalty program and our in‑store dining experiences.
Our Neiman Marcus online platform and mobile app are organized by both product category and designer, and are curated to provide a highly personalized, boutique-like experience for our online customers by offering a wide selection of merchandise and around-the-clock customer assistance. Our web pages adjust to our customers’ preferences based on their prior visits and purchases, allowing customers to select their favorite items, see items new to the site since their last visit and request to be informed of new merchandise or events at their local Neiman Marcus store. Our “Product Configurator” allows customers to customize select items, including shoes and boots, with special colors, fabrics and monograms. Our personalization expertise extends beyond our online platform to our customers through advanced digital e-mail and advertising programs.
Bergdorf Goodman. Bergdorf Goodman is a premier retailer in New York City known for its high-luxury merchandise, which includes women’s couture and designer apparel, contemporary sportswear, handbags, shoes, cosmetics, men’s clothing and accessories, precious and designer jewelry, decorative home accessories, fine china, crystal and silver, children’s apparel and gift items. Our customers access our Bergdorf Goodman brand and purchase merchandise through our two Bergdorf Goodman stores, our print catalogs and our Bergdorf Goodman online platform, bergdorfgoodman.com.
Our two Bergdorf Goodman stores are landmark locations on iconic Fifth Avenue in New York City. The elegant, meticulously designed and decorated and visually stunning stores are tourist attractions and have been featured in numerous films and television shows. Like Neiman Marcus, they feature a collection of designer boutiques for established and emerging luxury and fashion designers, each of which is carefully curated by our Bergdorf Goodman merchandising team to include our narrowly distributed, highly differentiated and distinctive luxury merchandise. Bergdorf Goodman stores feature the same level of dedication to exceptional customer service as Neiman Marcus and often showcase innovative new customer service and marketing strategies, including promotional local same-day delivery and online social initiatives.

Our Bergdorf Goodman online platform, like Neiman Marcus, is organized by both product category and designer, and is curated to provide a boutique-like experience for our customers by offering personalized presentation of a wide selection of merchandise and around-the-clock customer assistance.
MyTheresa. In October 2014, we acquired MyTheresa, a luxury retailer headquartered in Munich, Germany. MyTheresa offers an assortment of merchandise focused on luxury, first-season fashion curated by the MyTheresa merchandising team. Customers access our MyTheresa brand through mytheresa.com, our mobile app and the THERESA flagship store in Munich, Germany. Our MyTheresa online platform offers a unique combination of editorial content on the latest trends and a broad offering of merchandise.
Last Call. Last Call is an off-price fashion goods retailer. Our customers purchase merchandise through our 38 Last Call stores and our online platform, lastcall.com. Merchandise offered under our Last Call brand includes, among other things, end-of-season and post-season clearance goods sourced directly from our Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman brands or other off-price merchandise purchased from designers for resale. During fiscal year 2017, we began a process to assess our Last Call footprint and closed four of our Last Call stores. On September 12, 2017, we announced that we will be closing ten additional Last Call stores in fiscal year 2018 in order to optimize our Last Call store portfolio. We will continue to evaluate our off-price business and seek to optimize the operations of Last Call in the future. 
Horchow. We also operate the Horchow brand, which offers luxury home furnishings and accessories primarily through horchow.com and print catalogs.
Customer Service and Marketing
We have a longstanding heritage of providing the highest level of personalized, concierge-style service to our customers through our experienced team of sales associates and personal stylists. We believe our superior customer service enables us to cultivate long-term customer relationships and build strong loyalty to our brands. We are committed to providing our customers with a premier shopping experience at all of our brands, whether in-store or through our online platforms, through the following elements of our comprehensive customer service model:

• | omni-channel marketing programs designed to promote customer awareness of our offerings of the latest fashion trends and services;


• | our InCircle loyalty program designed to cultivate long-term relationships with our customers;


• | our proprietary credit card program facilitating the extension of credit to our customers;


• | knowledgeable, professional and well-trained sales associates; and


• | customer-friendly websites.

We believe we offer our customers fair return policies consistent with the practices of other luxury and specialty retailers and generally more favorable than designer-owned boutiques and websites. We believe these policies help to cultivate long-term relationships with our customers.

Marketing Programs.  We conduct a wide variety of omni-channel marketing programs that allow us to engage with our customers in multiple ways. We use our marketing programs to develop and maintain relationships with customers, communicate fashion trends and information and generate excitement about the designer brands we carry. The programs include in-store and online events, social promotions and targeted communications leveraging digital and traditional media.

We maintain an active calendar of events to promote our marketing programs. The events, many of which are connected to our InCircle loyalty program, include integrated in-store and online promotions of the merchandise of selected designers or merchandise categories. We also hold seasonal in-store and online trunk shows by leading designers featuring the newest fashions from the designer and participate in charitable functions and partnerships in each of our markets. Trunk shows and in-store promotions at our Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman stores feature a variety of national and international designers such as Chanel, Brunello Cucinelli, Tom Ford, David Yurman and Ermenegildo Zegna.

We maintain a social media presence for Neiman Marcus, Bergdorf Goodman and MyTheresa on blogs, Twitter, Instagram, Pinterest, Facebook and Snapchat. Social content includes insider fashion news, designer profiles, product promotion, customer service and event support. Posts and replies to customers are updated multiple times per day. Each platform is designed to reinforce our position as a fashion leader as well as to highlight the expertise and insider knowledge of our fashion directors and merchants.

Through our print media programs, we mail various publications to our customers communicating upcoming in-store events, new merchandise offerings and fashion trends. In connection with these programs, Neiman Marcus produces The Book approximately six to eight times each year. The Book is a high-quality shoppable magazine featuring the latest fashion trends that is mailed on a targeted basis to our customers. We also mail an annual Christmas Book known for both practical and lavish gift ideas as well as our over-the-top Fantasy Gifts that can only be found at Neiman Marcus. Our other print publications include the Bergdorf Goodman Magazine, the MyTheresa magazine, specialty catalogs and specific designer mailers.

In addition to print publications, we leverage our websites and online advertising through banner ads and paid searches to communicate and connect with customers seeking fashion information and products online. We believe that our online and print catalog operations complement our full-line retail stores and enable our customers to choose the channel that best fits their needs at any given time.

InCircle Loyalty Program.  Our InCircle loyalty program is designed to cultivate long-term relationships with our U.S. customers. Our loyalty program focuses on our most active customers and includes marketing features such as private in-store events and the ability to accumulate points for qualifying purchases. Increased points are periodically offered in connection with promotional and other events. Upon attaining specified point levels, points are automatically redeemed for gift cards. Almost 40% of our total U.S. revenues in fiscal year 2017 were generated by our InCircle loyalty program members who achieved reward status. On a per customer basis, these customers spend approximately 11 times more with us than our other customers.

Proprietary Credit Card Program.  We maintain a proprietary credit card program in the U.S. through which credit is extended to customers and have a related marketing and servicing alliance with affiliates of Capital One Financial Corporation ("Capital One"). Historically, our customers holding a proprietary credit card, all of whom are members of our InCircle loyalty program, have tended to shop more frequently and have a higher level of spending than customers paying with cash or third party credit cards. In fiscal years 2017 and 2016, approximately 42% of our U.S. revenues were transacted through our proprietary credit cards. We utilize data collected through our proprietary credit card program in connection with promotional events and customer relationship programs to target specific customers based upon their past spending patterns for certain designers, merchandise categories and store locations.
Pursuant to our agreement with Capital One (the "Program Agreement"), Capital One currently offers credit cards and non-card payment plans under both the "Neiman Marcus" and "Bergdorf Goodman" brand names. We receive payments from Capital One based on sales transacted on our proprietary credit cards. These payments are based on the profitability of the credit card portfolio as determined under the Program Agreement and are impacted by a number of factors including credit losses incurred and our allocable share of the profits generated by the credit card portfolio, which in turn may be impacted by credit ratings as determined by various rating agencies. These factors are more fully described in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results—Income From Credit Card Program." In addition, we receive payments from Capital One for marketing and servicing activities we provide to Capital One.

In connection with the Program Agreement, we have changed and may continue to change the terms of credit offered to our customers. In addition, Capital One has discretion over certain policies and arrangements with credit card customers and may change these policies and arrangements in ways that affect our relationships with these customers. The Program Agreement terminates July 2020 (renewable thereafter for three-year terms), subject to early termination provisions.

Sales Associates.  Our sales associates instill and reinforce a culture of relationship-based service valued by our customers. We compensate our sales associates primarily on a commission basis and provide them with training in the areas of customer service, selling skills and product knowledge. Our sales associates participate in active clienteling programs, utilizing both print and digital media, designed to maintain contact with our customers between store visits and to provide personalized updates on the latest merchandise offerings and fashion trends. We empower our sales associates to act as personal shoppers and, in many cases, as the personal style advisor to our customers. In our online operations, customers may interact with knowledgeable sales associates using online chat capabilities offered on our websites or by dialing a toll-free telephone number.
We have equipped our sales force with smartphones enabled with our proprietary mobile technology, which has enabled our sales associates to strengthen relationships with our customers through text messages and e-mails. The mobile apps available to our sales associates include our business dashboard, which shows a customer’s purchase history across channels, the customer’s alteration details and other service details. The sales associate is also given product recommendations and reasons to contact customers for events or offers.
7


Our sales associates are experienced. Sales associates who have been with us for longer than one year have an average tenure of approximately ten years and had a turnover rate in fiscal year 2017 of 26%. These tenured associates are highly productive, with more than 40% of them generating over $750,000 of revenues each in fiscal year 2017.
Customer-Friendly Online Platforms.  We believe that we offer a high level of service to customers shopping online through user-friendly smartphone apps and websites, site speeds and functionality and many features such as personalized recommendations, runway videos of apparel, detailed product descriptions, sizing information, interviews with designers and multiple angle shots of merchandise. In addition, we place high importance on quick, accurate product delivery and offer customers a variety of options to take delivery of their purchases and make returns, including free shipping and returns, same-day delivery and buy online and pick up in store. We also offer customers an efficient and friendly call center.
Merchandise

We carry a broad selection of narrowly distributed, highly differentiated and distinctive luxury merchandise carefully curated by our highly skilled merchandising groups. We believe our merchandising experience and in‑depth knowledge of our customers and the markets within which we operate allow us to select an appropriate merchandise assortment that is tailored to fully address our customers’ lifestyle needs.
Our experienced merchandising personnel determine the merchandise assortment and quantities to be purchased for each of our brands and the allocation of merchandise to each store. Our merchant and planning organizations for Neiman Marcus stores and Neiman Marcus online are combined to create an omni-channel team and align inventory in stores and online to deliver a superior shopping experience to our customers. As of October 3, 2017, we had approximately 400 merchandise buyers and merchandise planners.
Our percentages of revenues by major merchandise category for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:

 | Fiscal year ended
 | July 29, 2017 | | July 30, 2016 | | August 1, 2015
Women’s Apparel | 32 | % | | 32 | % | 32 | %
Women’s Shoes, Handbags and Accessories | 29 | | | 28 | | 28 | 
Men’s Apparel and Shoes | 12 | | | 12 | | 12 | 
Cosmetics and Fragrances | 12 | | | 11 | | 11 | 
Designer and Precious Jewelry | 9 | | | 10 | | 10 | 
Home Furnishings and Decor | 5 | | | 5 | | 5 | 
Other | 1 | | | 2 | | 2 | 
 | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Substantially all of our merchandise is delivered to us by our designers as finished goods and is manufactured in numerous locations, including Europe and the United States and, to a lesser extent, China, Mexico and South America.
Our major merchandise categories are as follows:

Women’s Apparel.  Women’s apparel consists of dresses, eveningwear, suits, coats and sportswear separates—skirts, pants, blouses, jackets and sweaters. We work with women’s apparel designers to present the merchandise and highlight the best of the designer's product. Our primary women’s apparel designers include Chanel, Brunello Cucinelli, Akris, Valentino, Dolce & Gabbana, Escada and The Row. 

Women’s Shoes, Handbags and Accessories.  Women’s accessories include belts, gloves, scarves, hats and sunglasses and complement our shoes and handbags assortments. Our primary designers in this category include Christian Louboutin, Chanel, Manolo Blahnik, Valentino, Saint Laurent, Jimmy Choo and Gucci in ladies' shoes and Chanel, Prada, Gucci, Bottega Veneta, Balenciaga, Saint Laurent, Louis Vuitton, Chloe and Celine in handbags.

Men’s Apparel and Shoes.  Men’s apparel and shoes include suits, dress shirts and ties, sport coats, jackets, trousers, casual wear and eveningwear as well as business and casual footwear. Our primary designers in this category include Ermenegildo Zegna, Brioni, Brunello Cucinelli, Burberry and Tom Ford in men’s clothing and sportswear and Ermenegildo Zegna, Brioni, Salvatore Ferragamo, Gucci and Tom Ford in men’s accessories and shoes.
8


Cosmetics and Fragrances.  Cosmetics and fragrances include facial and skin cosmetics, skin therapy and lotions, soaps, fragrances, candles and beauty accessories. Our primary designers of cosmetics and beauty products include La Mer, Chanel, Sisley, Creed, La Prairie, Estee Lauder, Dior and Tom Ford.

Designer and Precious Jewelry.  Our designer and precious jewelry offering includes women’s necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings and watches that are selected to complement our apparel merchandise offering. Our primary designers in this category include David Yurman, John Hardy and Ippolita in designer jewelry and Chanel and Van Cleef & Arpels in precious jewelry. We often sell precious jewelry that has been consigned to us from the designer.
Home Furnishings and Decor.  Home furnishings and decor include linens, tabletop, kitchen accessories, furniture, rugs, decorative items (frames, candlesticks, vases and sculptures) and collectibles. Merchandise for the home complements our apparel offering in terms of quality and design. Our primary designers in this category include Jay Strongwater, MacKenzie-Childs and Baccarat.

Luxury and Fashion Designer Relationships

Our merchandise assortment consists of a broad selection of narrowly distributed, highly differentiated and distinctive luxury merchandise purchased from both well-known luxury designers and new and emerging fashion designers. We communicate with our designers frequently, providing feedback on current demand for their products, suggesting changes to specific product categories or items and gaining insight into their future fashion direction. Certain designers sell their merchandise or certain of their design collections exclusively to us and other designers sell to us pursuant to their limited distribution policies. Our relationships and purchasing power with designers allow us to obtain a broad selection of quality merchandise. Our women’s and men’s apparel and fashion accessories merchandise categories are especially dependent upon our relationships with designers. We monitor and evaluate the sales and profitability performance of each designer and adjust our future purchasing decisions from time to time based upon the results of this analysis. We have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our principal merchandising sources. In addition, our designer base is diverse, with only two designers representing more than 5% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2017. These designers represented 8.9% and 5.9% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2017. The breadth of our sourcing helps mitigate risks associated with a single brand or designer.

Consistent with industry business practice, we receive allowances from certain of our designers in support of the merchandise we purchase for resale. We also receive advertising allowances from certain of our designers, substantially all of which represent reimbursements of direct, specified and incremental costs we incur to promote the designers' merchandise. In addition, we receive allowances from certain merchandise designers in conjunction with compensation allowances for employees who sell the designers' merchandise. For more information related to allowances received from designers, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15.

To expand our product assortment, we offer certain merchandise, primarily precious jewelry, that has been consigned to us from the designer. As of July 29, 2017 and July 30, 2016, we held consigned inventories with a cost basis of approximately $393.1 million and $416.5 million, respectively. Consigned inventories are not reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we do not take title to consigned merchandise.
Inventory Management
 We manage our inventory on an omni‑channel basis, and our processes and facilities are designed to optimize merchandise productivity. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we launched an integrated merchandising and distribution system, which we refer to as "NMG One". NMG One was designed to enable us to purchase, share, manage and sell our inventories across our omni-channel operations and brands more efficiently. 
The majority of the merchandise we purchase is initially received at one of our centralized distribution facilities. We utilize distribution facilities in Longview, Texas, the Dallas-Fort Worth area, Pittston, Pennsylvania and Munich, Germany and three regional service centers in the United States. Our distribution facilities are linked electronically to our various merchandising teams to facilitate the distribution of goods to our stores.

We utilize electronic data interchange technology with certain of our designers, which is designed to move merchandise onto the selling floor quickly and cost-effectively by allowing designers to deliver floor-ready merchandise to the distribution facilities. In addition, we utilize high-speed automated conveyor systems capable of scanning the bar-coded labels on incoming cartons of merchandise and directing the cartons to the proper processing areas. Many types of merchandise are processed in the receiving area and immediately “cross docked” to the shipping dock for delivery to the stores. Certain processing areas are staffed with personnel equipped with hand-held radio frequency terminals that can scan a designer's bar 
9


code and transmit the necessary information to a computer to record merchandise on hand. We utilize third party carriers to distribute our merchandise to individual stores.

We operate primarily on a pre-distribution model through which we allocate merchandise on our initial purchase orders to each store. This merchandise is shipped from our designers to our distribution facilities for delivery to designated stores. We closely monitor the inventory levels and assortments in our retail stores to facilitate reorder and replenishment decisions, satisfy customer demand and maximize sales.

We utilize a “locker stock” inventory management program to maintain a portion of our most in-demand and high fashion merchandise at our Longview and Pittston distribution facilities. Locker stock inventory can be shipped to the stores that demonstrate the highest customer demand or directly to our store and online customers. This program helps us to restock inventory at individual stores more efficiently, to maximize the opportunity for full-price selling and to minimize the potential risks related to excess inventories.

The two distribution centers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area support primarily our online operations in the United States, and our distribution center outside of Munich, Germany supports our MyTheresa operations. These distribution centers facilitate the receipt and storage of inventories from designers, fulfill customer orders on a timely and efficient basis and receive, research and process customer returns.

Capital Investments

We invest capital to support our long-term business goals and objectives with a goal of generating strong financial returns. We invest capital in the development and construction of new and existing stores, online platforms, distribution and support facilities and information technology. Since fiscal year 2013, we have made gross capital expenditures aggregating $1.1 billion related primarily to (i) enhancements to our merchandising and store systems; (ii) investments in our online platforms and technology and information systems; (iii) the construction of new stores in Garden City, New York (Long Island) (opened in fiscal year 2016) and in Fort Worth, Texas (opened in fiscal year 2017) and a distribution facility in Pittston, Pennsylvania; and (iv) the remodel of our Bergdorf Goodman women's and men’s stores in New York City and Neiman Marcus stores in the following cities:

• | Bal Harbour, Florida;


• | Chicago, Illinois;


• | Oak Brook, Illinois;


• | Beverly Hills, California; and


• | Palo Alto, California.

In fiscal year 2017, we had gross capital expenditures of approximately $205 million. Net of developer contributions, capital expenditures for fiscal year 2017 were approximately $167 million. Currently, we project gross capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 to be $208 to $218 million. Net of developer contributions, capital expenditures for fiscal year 2018 are projected to be $155 to $165 million. 
We are focused on operating only in attractive markets that can profitably support our stores as well as maintaining the quality of our stores and online platforms and, consequently, our brands. We conduct extensive demographic, marketing and lifestyle research to identify attractive retail markets with a high concentration of our target customers prior to our decision to construct a new store. We typically receive cash allowances from developers related to the construction of our stores, thereby reducing our cash investment in these stores. We received construction allowances aggregating $37.4 million in fiscal year 2017, $38.3 million in fiscal year 2016 and $34.7 million in fiscal year 2015. Our recent and upcoming Neiman Marcus store openings significantly expand our presence in New York: 

• | Roosevelt Field: We opened a 111,000 square‑foot full‑line Neiman Marcus store in Garden City, New York in February of fiscal year 2016. 


• | Hudson Yards: We signed a lease to open a flagship full‑line Neiman Marcus store on Manhattan’s flourishing west side at Hudson Yards, a new $25 billion, 28‑acre mixed‑use development project. The approximately 190,000 square‑foot, multi‑level store, which we currently expect to open in fiscal year 2019, marks the first full‑line Neiman Marcus store in New York City and will anchor the one‑million square‑foot Shops at Hudson 

10


Yards. This new store will offer Neiman Marcus’s signature mix of the world’s most exclusive luxury designers and superior customer service to New York residents and visitors.

In addition to the construction of new stores, we also invest in our existing stores to drive traffic, increase our selling opportunities and enhance customer service.
Competition

The luxury retail industry is highly competitive and fragmented. We compete for customers with luxury and premium multi-branded retailers, designer-owned proprietary boutiques, specialty retailers, national apparel chains, pure-play online retailers, individual specialty apparel stores and "flash sale" businesses that primarily sell out-of-season products. We compete for customers principally on the basis of quality and fashion, customer service, value, assortment and presentation of merchandise, marketing and customer loyalty programs and, in the case of Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman, store ambiance. Retailers that compete directly with us for distribution of luxury fashion brands include Saks Fifth Avenue, Barneys New York, Net-a-Porter, designer boutiques and other national, regional and local retailers. Nordstrom and Bloomingdale's feature a limited offering of luxury merchandise and compete with us to a lesser extent.

We believe we differ from other national retailers by:

• | our approach to omni-channel retailing;


• | distinctive merchandise assortments, which we believe are more upscale than other luxury and premium multi-branded retailers, and exclusive merchandise offerings that are only available in our stores;


• | excellent customer service;


• | prime real estate locations;


• | premier online websites; and


• | elegant shopping environments.

We believe we differentiate ourselves from regional and local luxury and premium retailers through:

• | our omni-channel approach to business;


• | strong national brands;


• | diverse product selection;


• | loyalty program;


• | customer service;


• | prime shopping locations; and


• | strong designer relationships that allow us to offer the top merchandise from each designer.


Designer-owned proprietary boutiques and specialty stores carry a much smaller selection of designer brands and merchandise, lack the overall shopping experience we provide, have a limited number of retail locations and generally offer more restrictive return policies.

Employees

As of October 3, 2017, we had approximately 13,700 full-time employees. Our staffing requirements fluctuate during the year as a result of the seasonality of the retail industry. We hire additional temporary associates and increase the hours of part-time employees during seasonal peak selling periods. Except for certain employees of Bergdorf Goodman representing less than 1% of our total employees, none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.

Seasonality

Our business, like that of most retailers, is affected by seasonal fluctuations in customer demand, product offerings and working capital expenditures. For additional information on seasonality, see Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Factors Affecting Our Results—Seasonality.”
Intellectual Property

We own certain tradenames and service marks, including the “Neiman Marcus,” “Bergdorf Goodman” and "mytheresa" marks, that are important to our overall business strategy. These marks are valuable assets that consumers associate with luxury goods.
Regulation

The credit card operations that are conducted under our arrangements with Capital One are subject to numerous federal and state laws that impose disclosure and other requirements upon the origination, servicing and enforcement of credit accounts and limitations on the maximum amount of finance charges that may be charged by a credit provider. In addition to our proprietary credit cards, credit to our customers is also provided primarily through third parties. Any regulation or change in the regulation of credit arrangements that would materially limit the availability of credit to our customer base could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.

Our practices, as well as those of our competitors, are subject to review in the ordinary course of business by the Federal Trade Commission and are subject to numerous federal and state laws. Additionally, we are subject to certain customs, anti-corruption laws, truth-in-advertising and other laws, including consumer protection regulations that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise. We undertake to monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable state and federal regulations with respect to such practices.
