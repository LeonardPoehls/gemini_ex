Geographical Financial Information
 
JetPay Payment Services processes transactions for customers throughout the United States and in Canada. We also authorize transactions for a select number of international customers.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
JetPay Payment Services has a combined marketing and sales force. While we focus on ISVs (integrated software vendors), and more recently PayFacs, we also sell directly to merchant and processing customers, as well as indirectly through our ISO and VAR customers. Our direct sales force focuses on select verticals where we have a significant technology advantage, including web developers, internet retailers, recurring billers, ISVs, technology servicers, travel companies and others. JetPay Payment Services also recruits ISOs, VARs and PayFacs, especially where we can provide unique product or technology solutions. We also focus on the customers of our financial institution and association clients, which tend to be more card-present retailers, and have a strong presence in the government and utility segments. We also receive significant referral opportunities.

JetPay’s marketing efforts involve:
 

· | print advertising in trade and consumer publications;
--+------------------------------------------------------


· | Internet advertising, including viral and social network marketing campaigns;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | select radio advertising;
--+--------------------------


· | trade show and conference exhibits; and
--+----------------------------------------


· | bulletins featuring new products and product features.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

Independent Sales Organizations
 
Our Payment Services Segment has approximately 200 ISOs, VARs, ISVs, financial institutions, referral partners and agent customers who sell on its behalf to traditional retailers, specialty retailers, internet retailers, service companies, technology companies, government organizations, and others. Through these ISOs, VARs, ISVs, and financial institutions, there are more than 97,474 merchants on JetPay Payment Services’ payment processing system, including merchants for whom we provide processing-only services.
Competition
 
Competitors of JetPay Payment Services include financial institutions, subsidiaries of financial institutions, and well-established payment processing companies, including TSYS, Bank of America Merchant Services, Chase Paymentech (a subsidiary of Chase Bank), Elavon Inc. (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp), First Data Corporation, WoldPay and Global Payments, Inc., among others.
 
The payment processing industry provides merchants with credit, debit, gift and loyalty card and other payment processing services, along with related information services. The industry continues to grow as a result of wider merchant acceptance, increased consumer use of bankcards and advances in payment processing and telecommunications technology. We believe that the proliferation of bankcards has made the acceptance of bankcard payments a virtual necessity for many businesses, regardless of size, in order to remain competitive. This use of bankcards, enhanced technology initiatives, efficiencies derived from economies of scale and the availability of more sophisticated products and services to all market segments have led to a highly competitive and specialized industry.
 
The payment processing industry has approximately 3,000 ISOs; however, fewer than 15 of those companies actually process transactions directly to the card networks, which include generating the authorization, clearing the transaction, and settling the funds to the merchant. In addition, only approximately a dozen companies handle both the front-end and back-end functions. Front-end processors perform the authorization in real-time and back-end processors perform the clearing to the card issuers and settlement to merchants every day. JetPay’s processing systems handle both front-end and back-end processing, which gives us a competitive advantage over ISOs and other parties who must purchase these services from a company like JetPay.
 
The barrier to entry to produce a new payment processing system is high. The time and investment to develop and implement a processing system are very significant and once the system is functional it has an immediate cost that requires substantial transaction volume for the processor to recoup its investment.
 
Many companies in the merchant acquiring market see a large income rise during the holiday shopping period. Due to a large amount of recurring payment and summer-seasonal merchants in our portfolio, we do not see a large spike in income during this period. However, we do see a small income increase in February and March and the summer months as a result of some of our travel and other seasonal resort merchants having seasonal spikes.
 
Material Customers
 
JetPay Payment Services’ two largest customers represented 11.7% and 8.4% individually, or 20.1% combined of JetPay’s consolidated revenues of $76.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Loss of either of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of JetPay Payment Services and the Company.

JetPay HR & Payroll Services Business
 
Company Background and History
 
JetPay HR & Payroll Services began as a full-service payroll processor, providing payroll accounting, paychecks, and direct deposit primarily to customers in eastern Pennsylvania (the “Lehigh Valley”). In 1990, JetPay HR & Payroll Services added the services of collecting and filing payroll taxes with the development of Payroll Tax Filing Services, Inc. (“PTFS”). Over the last two years, JetPay HR & Payroll Services has transitioned into a full-service provider of HCM services, including time and attendance, HR services, and Affordable Care Act services. These new services accounted for 18.2% of JetPay HR & Payroll Services’ revenues in 2017. JetPay HR & Payroll Services has a scalable processing platform that can handle significant growth with modest incremental costs. It also has specific expertise in calculating, collecting and filing local taxes. JetPay HR & Payroll Services currently has approximately 5,420 customers and $17.3 million in revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, as well as an average of $42.5 million in client-held funds with respect to average monthly payroll tax filings.

Sales
 
JetPay HR & Payroll Services focuses its marketing efforts in the Lehigh Valley and Philadelphia suburbs and their surrounding counties and sells directly to its customers. JetPay HR & Payroll Services has also begun to market its payroll processing service nationally and increase its cross-selling efforts with the customers of JetPay Payment Services. A significant part of its sales success comes in the form of its large referral network, which includes current customers, accounting firms, law firms, financial institutions, insurance brokers, and others.
Competition
 
The payroll processing services industry is highly competitive, with services provided by outsourced providers like us, but also accounting firms and self-service options. Overall the industry operates in three sectors: (i) large national full-service payroll providers, (ii) online self-service providers, and (iii) numerous much smaller national, regional, local and on-line providers. Large national payroll service firms such as ADP, Paychex, Paylocity, PayCom, WorkDay, Ultimate Software, Ceridian, and Intuit have a combined revenue market share of approximately 50%. JetPay HR & Payroll Services competes within all three segments of the payroll processing industry.
 
Competition in the payroll processing industry has historically been based on service responsiveness, accuracy, quality, reputation, range of product offering and price. The payroll industry faces continually evolving tax, regulatory and technology environments, which for smaller competitors create increasingly complex tax compliance, technology, service, and platform development challenges that they may lack the technical and financial resources to overcome. More recently, the ability to provide integrated services including payroll, tax filing, HR services, time and attendance, and Affordable Care Act reporting has become more important to large employers. JetPay HR & Payroll Services believes it is well-positioned to gain payroll customers from those challenged providers. Additionally, it believes its competitive position is enhanced through its ability to offer payment processing services to payroll customers through JetPay Payment Services and thus offer an integrated services suite, which will provide its customers with efficient and convenient options.
 
Regulation
 
The United States financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation. Many regulators, including federal and other governmental agencies and self-regulatory organizations, as well as state and provincial securities commissions, insurance regulators and attorneys general, are empowered to conduct administrative proceedings and investigations that can result in censure, fine, the issuance of administrative orders, such as orders denying exemptions, cease-and-desist orders, prohibitions against engaging in some lines of business, suspension or termination of licenses or the suspension or expulsion of a dealer, broker-dealer, investment adviser or insurance distributor. The requirements imposed by regulators are designed to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect customers, policy holders and other third parties who deal with financial services firms and are not designed to protect our stockholders. Regulations and investigations may result in limitations on our activities.
 
Payment processing companies domiciled or operating in the United States are subject to extensive regulation and supervision by varying federal and state banking agencies. Many of these regulations are intended to protect parties other than stockholders, such as individuals whose information is being transmitted. Accordingly, examples of regulatory requirements to which we are subject, generally include the Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”), the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, the USA Patriot Act of 2001, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and various federal and state consumer protection and privacy laws. In addition, changes in current laws or regulations and future laws or regulations may substantially restrict the nature of our business. In addition, some states are interpreting their own statutes differently than federal law, which may create additional cost burden for compliance.

Competition
 
Our overall business strategy is to provide payment services to businesses and their employees, especially businesses who require internet processing or processing of recurring billings. Our JetPay Payment Services and JetPay HR & Payroll Services operations face significant competition as described above under the applicable “Competition” headings in this section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We may acquire additional organizations within these markets in the future, as well as companies that provide complementary or ancillary services. In identifying, evaluating and selecting these potential target businesses, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours. We may be subject to competition from several entities having a business objective similar to ours, including venture capital firms, leverage buyout firms and operating businesses looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target business. Many of these entities are well-established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Many of these competitors possess greater technical, human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors. This inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Further, the following may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses, including our obligation to seek stockholder approval of an acquisition under certain circumstances, which may delay the completion of a transaction.
 
Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully acquiring additional businesses. Our management believes, however, that our status as a public company and our existing access to the United States public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privately-held entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered and applied for the registration of U.S. trademarks, service marks, and domain names. Over time, we have assembled and continue to assemble a portfolio of trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and trade secrets covering our products and services. We believe our intellectual property has value in providing our services and marketing our products. It is our policy to protect and defend our trademark rights.
Employees
 
As of March 26, 2018, we had approximately 250 employees, of whom approximately 108 were employed in our Payment Services Segment, all of which were full-time; 131 were employed in our HR & Payroll Segment, 109 of whom were full-time and 22 of whom were part-time; and 11 were employed in our corporate accounting, finance, marketing, and investor relations, including four in executive management. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
Available Information
 
We provide internet access to our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports through our Investor Relations section at www.jetpay.com. The SEC maintains a website (www.sec.gov) where these filings also are available through the SEC’s EDGAR system. There is no charge for access to these filings through either our site or the SEC’s site, although users should understand that there may be costs associated with electronic access, such as usage charges from Internet access providers and telephone companies, which they may bear. The public also may read and copy materials filed by JetPay with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330.
