Item 1. Business
Organization History and Acquisition by HSBC
HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA"), incorporated under the laws of the State of Maryland in 1973 as Republic New York Corporation, was acquired through a series of transactions by HSBC Holdings plc ("HSBC" and, together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Group") and changed its name to "HSBC USA Inc." in 2000. HSBC USA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC. HSBC USA’s principal business is to act as a holding company for its subsidiaries. In this Form 10-K, HSBC USA and its subsidiaries are referred to as "HUSI," "we," "us" and "our."
HSBC North America Operations
HSBC North America is the holding company for HSBC Group's operations in the United States. The principal subsidiaries of HSBC North America at December 31, 2017 were HSBC USA, HSBC Markets (USA) Inc. ("HMUS"), a holding company for certain subsidiaries primarily associated with global banking and markets businesses, HSBC Finance Corporation ("HSBC Finance"), a holding company for the run-off consumer finance operations, and HSBC Technology & Services (USA) Inc. ("HTSU"), a provider of information technology and centralized operational and support services including human resources, tax, finance, compliance, legal, corporate affairs and other services shared among the subsidiaries of HSBC North America and the HSBC Group. HSBC USA's principal U.S. banking subsidiary is HSBC Bank USA, National Association (together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Bank USA"). Under the oversight of HSBC North America, HUSI works with its affiliates to maximize opportunities and efficiencies in HSBC Group's operations in the United States. These affiliates do so by providing each other with, among other things, alternative sources of liquidity to fund operations and expertise in specialized corporate functions and services through the pooling of resources within HTSU to provide shared, allocated support functions to all of HSBC North America's subsidiaries. In addition, clients of HSBC Bank USA and other affiliates are investors in debt issued by HSBC USA and/or HSBC Bank USA, providing significant sources of liquidity and capital to both entities. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. ("HSI"), a registered broker dealer and a subsidiary of HMUS, generally leads or participates as underwriter of all HUSI domestic issuances of term debt. While neither HSBC USA nor HSBC Bank USA has received advantaged pricing, the underwriting fees and commissions paid to HSI historically have benefited the HSBC Group.
HSBC USA Operations

HSBC USA Inc.


 | Corporate Center ("CC") business was created in 2017 to centralize certain activities and functions such as Balance Sheet Management ("BSM") and our legacy structured credit products in order to better reflect the way we manage our businesses.

HSBC Bank USA, HSBC USA's principal U.S. banking subsidiary, is a national banking association with its main office in Tysons (formerly known as McLean), Virginia, and its principal executive offices at 452 Fifth Avenue, New York, New York. Through HSBC Bank USA, we offer our customers a full range of commercial and consumer banking products and related financial services. Our customers include individuals, including high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals, small businesses, corporations, institutions and governments. HSBC Bank USA is also an international dealer in derivative instruments denominated in U.S. dollars and other currencies, focusing on structuring transactions to meet clients' needs. 
In 2005, HSBC USA incorporated a nationally chartered limited purpose bank subsidiary, HSBC Trust Company (Delaware), National Association ("HTCD"), the primary activities of which are providing personal trust services. The impact of HTCD's operations on HSBC USA's consolidated balance sheets and results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was not material.
We report financial information to our ultimate parent, HSBC, in accordance with HSBC Group accounting and reporting policies, which apply International Financial Reporting Standards ("IFRSs") as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board ("IASB") and endorsed by the European Union ("EU"). As a result, our segment results are prepared and presented using financial information prepared on the basis of HSBC Group's accounting and reporting policies ("Group Reporting Basis") as operating results are monitored and reviewed, trends are evaluated and decisions about allocating resources, such as employees, are primarily made on this basis. We continue, however, to monitor capital adequacy and report to regulatory agencies in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). For additional financial information relating to our business and operating segments as well as a summary of the significant differences between U.S. GAAP and Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results, see Note 22, "Business Segments," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
Retail Banking and Wealth Management Segment  Our RBWM segment provides a range of banking and wealth products and services through our branches and on-line channels to individuals and certain small businesses. These services include asset-driven services such as credit and lending, liability-driven services such as deposit taking and account services and fee or commission driven services such as advisory and brokerage. RBWM is focused on growing its wealth and banking business in key urban centers with strong international connectivity across the U.S. including New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Washington DC. RBWM focuses on two customer propositions: HSBC Premier and HSBC Advance. HSBC Premier, is a comprehensive banking and wealth management proposition for the internationally minded mass affluent client. HSBC Premier clients have access to a full suite of banking and wealth management solutions and also have access to priority services such as 24-hour telephone service and more favorable pricing based on the banking relationship. HSBC Premier clients also receive personalized support through dedicated relationship managers and are serviced through other alternative channels such as on-line banking and a dedicated contact center. HSBC Advance, RBWM's other main customer proposition, is a banking relationship designed to offer holistic financial services and banking products for emerging affluent clients in the initial stage of wealth accumulation or clients who look for more convenience and self-control with respect to their personal finances. In addition to everyday banking solutions, HSBC Advance customers have access to a range of lending and wealth products through HSBC's multi-channel platform, yet primarily through direct channels, including the contact center, secure internet banking and mobile. 
With our affiliates, HSI and HSBC Insurance Agency (USA) Inc., HSBC Premier and HSBC Advance provides access to a range of wealth management solutions. RBWM also offers a broad range of financial products and services to all of its retail banking customers, including residential mortgages, home equity lines of credit, credit cards, deposits and branch services.
Commercial Banking Segment  CMB's goal is to be the banking partner of choice for international businesses building on our rich heritage, international capabilities and customer relationships to enable global connectivity. CMB strives to execute this vision and strategy by focusing on key markets with high concentrations of international connectivity. Our CMB segment serves the markets through three client groups, notably Large Corporate, Middle Market and Business Banking. We also have a specialized Commercial Real Estate group which focuses on selective business opportunities in markets where we have strong portfolio expertise. This structure allows us to align our resources in order to efficiently deliver suitable products and services based on our clients' needs and abilities. Global Liquidity and Cash Management, Global Trade and Receivables Finance, Lending and Transaction Management, Investment Banking and Global Markets are key product groups that CMB partners with to deliver the global connections and related products and services required by customers. Whether it is through commercial centers, the retail branch network, or via HSBCnet, our online banking channel, CMB provides customers with the products and services needed to grow their businesses internationally and delivers those products and services through its relationship managers who operate within a robust, customer focused compliance and risk culture, and collaborate across HSBC to capture a larger percentage of a relationship. 
Global Banking and Markets Segment  Our GB&M business segment supports HSBC's global strategy by leveraging the HSBC Group's advantages and scale, strength in developed and emerging markets and product expertise in order to focus on delivering international products to U.S. clients and local products to international clients, with New York as the hub for the Americas business, including Canada and Latin America. GB&M provides tailored financial solutions to major government, corporate and institutional clients as well as private investors worldwide. GB&M clients are served by sector-focused teams that bring together relationship

managers and product specialists to develop financial solutions that meet individual client needs. With a focus on providing client connectivity between the emerging markets and developed markets, GB&M aims to develop a comprehensive understanding of each client's financial requirements with a long-term relationship management approach. In addition to GB&M clients, GB&M also provides financial solutions to RBWM, CMB and PB clients where those clients have needs that require the product set that GB&M has available.

Private Banking Segment  PB provides a broad range of banking and investment products and services to high net worth and ultra-high net worth individuals and families with a focus on multi-generational families, business executives and entrepreneurs who require sophisticated solutions to help meet their most complex needs domestically and abroad, with many clients sourced in collaboration with our other business lines. PB works with its clients to offer tailored, coordinated and innovative ways to manage and preserve wealth while optimizing returns. PB offers a wide range of products and services, including banking, liquidity management, investment services, custody, tailored lending, trust and fiduciary services, insurance, family wealth and philanthropy advisory services. PB also works to ensure that its clients have access to other products and services available throughout the HSBC Group, such as credit cards and investment banking, to deliver total solutions for their financial and wealth needs. Strategically, PB continues to reposition its focus, which includes the exiting of higher-risk markets and ongoing client segmentation. PB’s close collaboration with RBWM has resulted in its ability to enhance service to its target clients while ensuring that the financial needs of clients that no longer meet minimum PB requirements continue to be serviced through offerings by RBWM. In support of its focus on the U.S. domestic market and key overseas countries in Latin America, PB continues to onboard new talent and expand its investment product and wealth planning offerings, leveraging both Global Markets and Global Asset Management platforms, allowing it to provide a broad array of domestic and global investment options.
Corporate Center Segment We previously announced that we made the decision to implement changes to our internal management reporting for certain activities and functions and report them within a new CC segment beginning in January 2017. These activities and functions include BSM and our legacy structured credit products which historically were both reported in GB&M, as well as a portfolio of residential mortgage loans previously purchased from HSBC Finance, including certain loan servicing activities performed on behalf of HSBC Finance, which were historically reported in RBWM. In addition, we have reviewed central costs historically reported in the Other segment and have reallocated these costs to the global businesses where appropriate. Remaining residual costs are reported in the CC along with all other remaining items historically reported in the Other segment. As a result, beginning in the first quarter of 2017, we aligned our segment reporting with the changes made to our internal management reporting and are reporting these changes as part of the newly created CC segment for all periods presented.
BSM is included in the CC and is responsible for managing liquidity and funding under the supervision of our Asset and Liability Management Committee. BSM also manages our structural interest rate position within a limit structure. BSM reinvests excess liquidity into highly rated liquid assets. The majority of the liquidity is invested in interest bearing deposits with Federal Reserve banks and U.S. Government and other high quality securities. BSM is permitted to use derivatives as part of its mandate to manage interest rate risk. Derivative activity is predominantly comprised of the use of traditional interest rate swaps which are part of cash flow hedging relationships. Credit risk in BSM is predominantly limited to short-term exposure created by exposure to banks as well as high quality sovereigns or agencies which constitute the majority of BSM's liquidity portfolio. BSM does not and is not mandated to manage the structural credit risk of our balance sheet. BSM only manages interest rate risk.
Funding
We fund our operations using a diversified deposit base, supplemented by issuing short-term and long-term debt, borrowing under unsecured and secured financing facilities, issuing preferred equity, and, as necessary, receiving capital contributions from our parent, HSBC North America. Emphasis is placed on maintaining stable deposit balances. Numerous factors, both internal and external, may impact our access to, and the costs associated with, both retail and wholesale sources of funding. These factors may include our debt ratings, overall economic conditions, overall capital markets volatility, the counterparty credit limits of investors to the HSBC Group, the effectiveness of our compliance remediation efforts and our management of the credit risks inherent in our business and customer base.
In 2017, our primary source of funds continued to be deposits, augmented by issuances of commercial paper and term debt. We focus on deposits where clients have purchased multiple products from us, such as HSBC Premier for retail customers, as well as 
6


HSBC USA Inc.

operational deposits from commercial clients, as those balances will tend to be significantly more stable than other deposits. We issued a total of $5,158 million of long-term debt throughout 2017. We also repaid long-term debt of $8,953 million in 2017. As previously reported, as a result of the adoption of the final rules by the U.S. banking regulators implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (the "Basel Committee"), together with the impact of similar implementation by United Kingdom ("U.K.") banking regulators, we continue to review the composition of our capital structure. A detailed description of our sources and availability of funding are set forth in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" and "Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements, Credit Derivatives and Other Contractual Obligations" sections of Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A").
We use the cash generated by these funding sources to service our debt obligations, originate new loans, purchase investment securities and pay preferred dividends and, as available and appropriate, common dividends to our parent.
Employees and Customers
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,107 employees, which does not take into account employees of affiliates that provide services to us.
At December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1.4 million customers, some of which are customers of more than one of our businesses. Customers residing in the state of New York and California accounted for 33 percent and 34 percent, respectively, of our total outstanding commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans.
Regulation and Competition
Regulation  We are subject to, among other things, an extensive statutory and regulatory framework applicable to bank holding companies, financial holding companies and banks. U.S. regulation of banks, bank holding companies and financial holding companies is intended primarily for safety and soundness of banks, and the protection of the interests of depositors, the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole rather than the protection of security holders and creditors. Events since early 2008 affecting the financial services industry and, more generally, the financial markets and the economy have led to a significant number of initiatives regarding reform of the financial services industry and the regulation governing the industry. 
Bank Holding Company Supervision  As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulation under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended ("BHC Act"), and to inspection, examination and supervision by our primary regulator, the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"). We are also subject to the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
HSBC USA and its parent bank holding company qualified as financial holding companies pursuant to the amendments to the BHC Act effected by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 ("GLB Act"). Financial holding companies may engage in a broader range of activities than bank holding companies. Under regulations implemented by the FRB, if any financial holding company, or any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company, ceases to meet certain capital or management standards, the FRB may impose corrective capital and/or managerial requirements on the financial holding company and place limitations on its ability to conduct the broader financial activities permissible for financial holding companies. In addition, the FRB may require divestiture of the holding company's depository institutions or its affiliates engaged in broader financial activities in reliance on the GLB Act if the deficiencies persist. The regulations also provide that if any depository institution controlled by a financial holding company fails to maintain a satisfactory rating under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, as amended, the FRB must prohibit the financial holding company and its subsidiaries from engaging in any additional activities other than those permissible for bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies. As reflected in the agreement entered into with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") in 2012 (the "GLBA Agreement"), the OCC has determined that HSBC Bank USA is not in compliance with the requirements for a national bank and each depository institution affiliate of the national bank to be both well capitalized and well managed in order to own or control a "financial subsidiary." A "financial subsidiary" is a subsidiary of a bank that also may engage in broader activities than subsidiaries of non-qualified banks. As a result, HSBC USA and its parent bank holding company no longer meet the qualification requirements for financial holding company status, and may not engage in any new types of financial activities without the prior approval of the FRB, and HSBC Bank USA may not directly or indirectly acquire control of, or hold an interest in, any new financial subsidiary, nor commence a new activity in its existing financial subsidiary, unless it receives prior approval from the OCC. Unless all of our affiliate depositary institutions are in compliance with these requirements within the time periods specified in the GLBA Agreement, as they may be extended, HSBC USA could be required either to divest HSBC Bank USA or to divest or terminate any financial activities conducted in reliance on financial holding company status under the GLB Act. Similar consequences could result for financial subsidiaries of HSBC 
7


HSBC USA Inc.

Bank USA that engage in activities in reliance on expanded powers provided for in the GLB Act. The GLBA Agreement requires HSBC Bank USA to take all steps necessary to correct the circumstances and conditions resulting in HSBC Bank USA's noncompliance with the requirements referred to above. We continue to take steps to satisfy the requirements of the GLBA Agreement. 
We are generally prohibited under the BHC Act from acquiring, directly or indirectly, ownership or control of more than five percent of any class of voting shares of, or substantially all the assets of, or exercising control over, any U.S. bank, bank holding company or many other types of depository institutions and/or their holding companies without the prior approval of the FRB and, potentially, other U.S. banking regulatory agencies.
The GLB Act and the regulations issued thereunder contain a number of other provisions that affect our operations and those of our subsidiary banks, including regulations and restrictions on the activities we may conduct and the types of businesses and entities we may acquire. Furthermore, other provisions contain detailed requirements relating to the financial privacy of consumers. In addition, the so-called 'push-out' provisions of the GLB Act removed the blanket exemption from registration for securities and brokerage activities conducted in banks (including HSBC Bank USA) under the Exchange Act. Applicable regulations allow banks to continue to avoid registration as a broker or dealer only if they conduct securities activities that fall within a set of defined exceptions.
On August 3, 2017, the FRB issued a proposal to revise its supervisory rating system for bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including HSBC USA and HSBC North America. Under the proposal, covered bank holding companies would receive separate ratings from the FRB for (i) capital planning and positions, (ii) liquidity risk management and positions, and (iii) governance and controls. Each of these component areas would receive one of the following four ratings: (i) Satisfactory, (ii) Satisfactory Watch, (iii) Deficient -1, and (iv) Deficient -2. As proposed, a covered bank holding company would have to maintain a rating of “Satisfactory Watch” or better for each of the three components to be considered “well managed.”
Consumer Regulation  Our consumer lending businesses operate in a highly regulated environment. In addition to the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the "CFPB") and the other consumer-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act" or "Dodd-Frank") described below, these businesses are subject to laws relating to consumer protection including, without limitation, fair lending, fair debt collection practices, mortgage loan origination and servicing obligations, bankruptcy, military service member protections, use of credit reports, privacy matters, and disclosure of credit terms and correction of billing errors. Local, state and national regulatory and enforcement agencies continue efforts to address perceived problems within the mortgage lending and credit card industries through broad or targeted legislative or regulatory initiatives aimed at lenders' operations in consumer lending markets. There continues to be a significant amount of legislative and regulatory activity, nationally, locally and at the state level, designed to limit certain lending practices while mandating certain servicing procedures. Federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws, as well as the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act affect the ability of banks, including HSBC Bank USA, to collect outstanding balances.
Due to the turmoil in the mortgage lending markets in prior years, there has also been a significant amount of federal and state legislative and regulatory focus on this industry. Increased regulatory oversight over residential mortgage lenders has occurred, including through state and federal examinations and periodic inquiries from state Attorneys General for information. Several regulators, legislators and other governmental bodies have promoted particular views of appropriate or "model" loan modification programs, suitable loan products and foreclosure and loss mitigation practices. We have a repayment plan and a loan modification program for customers facing financial hardship who express the desire to remain in their homes. We evaluate the results of our customer assistance efforts and we continue to enhance and refine our programs based on performance and industry trends. In certain situations, we offer qualified customers relocation assistance to help avoid foreclosure. 
In 2011, HSBC Bank USA entered into a consent cease and desist order with the OCC (the "OCC Servicing Consent Order"), and our affiliate, HSBC Finance, and our parent, HSBC North America, entered into a similar consent order with the FRB (together with the OCC Servicing Consent Order, the "Servicing Consent Orders") following completion of a broad horizontal review of industry foreclosure practices. The OCC Servicing Consent Order required HSBC Bank USA to take prescribed actions to address the foreclosure practices noted in the joint examination and deficiencies described in the consent order. 
The Servicing Consent Orders required an independent review of foreclosures (the "Independent Foreclosure Review" or "IFR") pending or completed between 2009 and 2010 to determine if any borrower was financially injured as a result of an error in the foreclosure process. 
In January 2017, the OCC terminated the OCC Servicing Consent Order, together with the subsequent amendments thereto, after determining HSBC Bank USA had satisfied the requirements thereunder. In January 2018, the FRB terminated the related consent order against HSBC Finance and HSBC North America.
Foreign Exchange Consent Order In September 2017, HSBC and HSBC North America entered into a consent order with the FRB relating to historic deficiencies in their policies and procedures and internal controls for certain foreign exchange trading activities. HSBC paid a $175 million civil money penalty to the FRB. The order requires HSBC and HSBC North America to enhance their internal controls, audit functions and risk management compliance programs, but also acknowledges that HSBC has 
8


HSBC USA Inc.

conducted comprehensive remediation initiatives, including automating certain trading activities, and is committed to remediating the risks identified in the FRB's investigation.
Supervision of Bank Subsidiaries  Our subsidiary national banks, HSBC Bank USA and HTCD, are subject to regulation and examination primarily by the OCC. These subsidiary banks are subject to additional regulation and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), the FRB and the CFPB. HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are subject to banking laws and regulations that place various restrictions and requirements on their activities, investments, operations and administration, including the establishment and maintenance of branch offices, capital and reserve requirements, deposits and borrowings, investment and lending activities, payment of dividends, transactions with affiliates, overall compliance and risk management and numerous other matters.
Federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks. Dividends payable by HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are limited to the lesser of the amounts calculated under a "recent earnings" test and an "undivided profits" test. Under the recent earnings test, a dividend may not be paid if the total of all dividends declared by a bank in any calendar year is in excess of the current year's net income combined with the retained net income of the two preceding years, unless the national bank obtains the approval of the OCC. Under the undivided profits test, a dividend may not be paid in excess of a bank's undivided profits account. HSBC Bank USA is also required to maintain reserves in the form of vault cash and deposits with the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as maintain appropriate amounts of capital against its assets as discussed further in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are subject to significant restrictions imposed by federal law on extensions of credit to, and certain other "covered transactions" with HSBC USA or other affiliates. Covered transactions include loans and other extensions of credit, investments and asset purchases, derivatives and certain other transactions involving the transfer of value from, or taking the credit risk by, a subsidiary bank to an affiliate or for the benefit of an affiliate. Unless an exemption applies, or a specific waiver is granted by the FRB, covered transactions by a bank with a single affiliate are limited to 10 percent of the bank's capital and surplus, and all covered transactions with affiliates in the aggregate are limited to 20 percent of a bank's capital and surplus. Loans and extensions of credit to affiliates by a bank generally are to be secured in specified amounts with specific types of collateral. A bank's credit exposure to an affiliate as a result of derivative, securities borrowing/lending or repurchase transactions is also subject to these restrictions. A bank's transactions with its non-bank affiliates are also generally required to be on arm's length terms.
The types of activities in which the non-U.S. branches of HSBC Bank USA may engage are subject to various restrictions imposed by the FRB in addition to those generally applicable to HSBC Bank USA under OCC rules. These branches are also subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the countries in which they operate.
Under longstanding FRB policy, which Dodd-Frank codified as a statutory requirement, HSBC USA is expected to act as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support each such subsidiary bank in circumstances where it might not do so absent such policy.
Regulatory Capital and Liquidity Requirements  As a bank holding company, we are subject to regulatory capital requirements and guidelines imposed by the FRB, which are substantially similar to those imposed by the OCC and the FDIC on banks such as HSBC Bank USA and HTCD. A bank or bank holding company's failure to meet minimum capital requirements can result in certain mandatory actions and possibly additional discretionary actions by its regulators. Generally, bank holding company regulatory capital compliance is performed at a consolidated level within the United States at HSBC North America, our parent, and also separately for HSBC Bank USA. However, we do present HSBC USA's capital ratios below in "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in our MD&A, as well as, together with HSBC Bank USA's, in Note 23, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Our ultimate parent, HSBC, is also subject to regulatory capital requirements under U.K. law.
Basel III. In 2013, U.S. banking regulators issued a final rule implementing the Basel III capital framework in the United States (the "Basel III rule") which, for banking organizations such as HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, became effective in 2014 with certain provisions being phased in over time through the beginning of 2019. The Basel III rule established an integrated regulatory capital framework to improve the quality and quantity of regulatory capital. In addition to phasing in a complete replacement to the general risk-based capital rules for determining risk-weighted assets (the "Standardized Approach"), the Basel III rule builds on the advanced internal ratings approach for credit risk and advanced measurement approach for operational risk (taken together, the "Advanced Approaches") applicable to banking organizations having $250 billion or more in total consolidated assets or $10 billion or more of foreign exposures (the "Advanced Approaches thresholds"). As discussed further below, the intermediate holding companies ("IHCs") of non-U.S. banks like HSBC may opt out of the Advanced Approaches with the prior approval of the FRB.
The Basel III rule, among other changes, introduced (i) a new minimum common equity Tier 1 risk-based capital requirement; (ii) a new Standardized Approach for risk-weighted assets; (iii) a supplementary leverage ratio ("SLR") for banking organizations that meet the Advanced Approaches thresholds; and (iv) a capital conservation buffer applicable to all banking organizations and a countercyclical capital buffer requirement applicable to banking organizations that meet the Advanced Approaches thresholds. As 
9


HSBC USA Inc.

a result, to be categorized as "well capitalized" under the Basel III rule, a banking institution must have the ratios reflected in the table included in Note 23, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements," of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and must not be subject to a directive, order or written agreement to meet and maintain specific capital levels. The federal bank regulatory agencies may, however, set higher capital requirements for an individual bank or bank holding company when particular circumstances warrant. The FRB is considering a new measure to replace the capital conservation buffer with a "stress capital buffer," which would equal a bank holding company's projected decline in common equity Tier 1 under the supervisory severely adverse stress testing scenario, discussed further below, prior to any planned capital actions, and would be reset each year based on the bank holding company's stress testing results. We are reviewing these possible changes to the capital conservation buffer in anticipation of the formal rulemaking and their potential impact on our capital planning processes specifically and our operations and results generally. We currently target internal capital levels using an approach analogous to the stress capital buffer and, therefore, we do not expect the proposal to have a significant impact on our U.S. operations or change our capital planning processes. On September 27, 2017, the federal banking agencies jointly requested public comment on a proposal that would implement certain changes to the Basel III rule. The proposal would reduce risk weighting (from 150 percent to 130 percent) for high-volatility commercial real estate exposures under the Standardized Approach, while also making certain changes to the definition of such exposures and relabeling such exposures high-volatility acquisition, development or construction exposures. We continue to evaluate the potential effects of this proposal on our operations.
Under the Basel III rule, all banking organizations will continue to be subject to the U.S. regulators' existing minimum Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4 percent. Additionally, banking organizations that meet the Advanced Approaches thresholds, such as HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, are subject to the SLR. Full implementation and compliance with the SLR was required by January 1, 2018. For HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, the SLR regulatory minimum is 3 percent (calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to total leverage exposure, which includes balance sheet exposures plus certain off-balance sheet items). The SLR is generally consistent with the final Basel leverage framework, but also contains certain modifications, including to the methodology for averaging total leverage exposure. 
The FRB requires certain large non-U.S. banks with significant operations in the United States, such as HSBC, to establish a single IHC to hold all of their U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries. The HSBC Group operates in the United States through such an IHC structure (i.e., HSBC North America). As previously disclosed, in accordance with FRB rules, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA received regulatory approval to opt out of the Advanced Approaches and are calculating their risk-based and leverage capital requirements solely under the Standardized Approach. HSBC Bank USA submits an annual statement to the OCC to maintain this opt out. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, however, remain subject to the other capital requirements applicable to Advanced Approaches banking organizations such as: the SLR, the countercyclical capital buffer, stress testing requirements, enhanced risk management standards, enhanced governance and stress testing requirements for liquidity management, and other applicable prudential standards.
The Basel III rule requires banks to phase in requirements for more capital and a higher quality of capital over a period from 2014 to 2019. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA will be required to maintain minimum capital ratios (exclusive of any countercyclical capital buffer) as follows: 

 | Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio | | Tier 1 Capital Ratio | | Total Capital Ratio | Tier 1 Leverage Ratio | | Supplementary Leverage Ratio
Regulatory minimum ratio | 4.5 | % | | 6.0 | % | 8.0 | % | | 4.0 | % | 3.0 | %
Plus: Capital conservation buffer requirement | 2.5 | % | | 2.5 | % | 2.5 | % | | — | | — | 
Regulatory minimum ratio plus capital conservation buffer | 7.0 | % | | 8.5 | % | 10.5 | % | | 4.0 | % | 3.0 | %

Currently, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA hold capital in excess of these regulatory minimums.
In addition, and subject to discretion by the respective regulatory authorities, a countercyclical capital buffer of up to 2.5 percent, consisting of common equity Tier 1 capital, could also be required to be built up by banking organizations in periods of excess credit growth in the economy. The FRB, in consultation with the OCC and FDIC, has affirmed the current countercyclical capital buffer level of 0 percent and noted that any future modifications to the buffer would generally be subject to a 12-month phase-in period. 
In December 2017, the Basel Committee adopted a package of revisions to the Basel III framework that aim to increase consistency in risk-weighted asset calculations and improve the comparability of bank’s capital ratios (the “Basel IV Revisions”). The Basel IV Revisions include changes to the Standardized Approach and internal ratings-based approach to determining credit risk, revisions to the operational risk framework, a leverage ratio surcharge for global systemically important banks (“G-SIBs”), and an output floor. The revisions to the Standardized Approach include a more detailed risk-weighting approach in place of a flat risk weight for certain retail and corporate exposures. The revisions to the internal ratings-based approach will remove the option to use advanced models-based approaches for exposures to financial institutions and large corporates and for equity exposures. Where

the internal-models based approach is retained, minimum levels are applied on the probability of default and for other inputs. The Basel IV Revisions simplify the operational risk framework by replacing the four current approaches with a single Standardized Approach that determines a bank's operational risk requirement by combining a refined measure of gross income with a bank's own internal loss history over the prior 10 years. The Basel IV Revisions also introduce a leverage ratio buffer for each G-SIB to be set at 50 percent of its risk-based capital surcharge. Changes to the market risk capital framework adopted by the Basel Committee in January 2016 are also considered part of the Basel IV Revisions and are expected to increase market risk capital requirements for many banking organizations. The Basel IV Revisions are not directly applicable to any U.S. banking organization and must first be implemented by the federal banking agencies. The agencies are expected to act before the January 1, 2022 implementation deadline agreed by the Basel Committee, but it is unclear whether they will deviate significantly from the Basel IV Revisions in the direction of greater conservatism as they did with respect to the Basel III framework. The output floor limits the amount of capital benefit a bank can obtain from its use of internal models relative to using the Standardized Approach by requiring that total risk-weighted assets generated under the Advanced Approaches cannot fall below 72.5 percent of the risk-weighted assets calculated under the Standardized Approach. Accordingly, the output floor is not expected to be relevant to IHCs such as HSBC North America which have opted out of the Advanced Approaches and therefore currently calculate and report their total risk-weighted assets under the Standardized Approach only. 
As a result of the adoption of the final rules by the U.S. banking regulators implementing the Basel III regulatory capital and liquidity reforms from the Basel Committee, together with the impact of similar implementation by U.K. banking regulators and future implementation of the Basel IV Revisions, we continue to review the composition of our capital structure.
In 2015, the Financial Stability Board ("FSB") issued its final standards for total loss-absorbing capacity ("TLAC") requirements for G-SIBs. In 2016, the FRB adopted final rules implementing the FSB's TLAC standard in the United States. The rules require, among other things, the U.S. IHCs of non U.S. G-SIBs, including HSBC North America, to maintain minimum amounts of TLAC which would include minimum levels of Tier 1 capital and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility criteria, and a related TLAC buffer commencing January 1, 2019, without the benefit of a phase-in period. The TLAC rules also include 'clean holding company requirements' that impose limitations on the types of financial transactions that HSBC North America could engage in. The FSB's TLAC standard and the FRB's TLAC rules represent a significant expansion of the current regulatory capital framework. To support compliance when the TLAC rules become effective, HSBC North America will be required in future periods to issue additional long-term debt that is TLAC compliant and modify the terms of existing long-term debt in order for that debt to be TLAC compliant.
Capital Planning and Stress Testing. U.S. bank holding companies with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets, including HSBC North America, are required to comply with the FRB's capital plan rule and Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review ("CCAR") program, as well as the annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the FRB, and the semi-annual company-run stress tests as required under the Dodd-Frank Act (collectively, "DFAST"). As part of the CCAR process, the FRB undertakes a supervisory assessment of the capital adequacy of bank holding companies, including HSBC North America, based on a review of a comprehensive capital plan submitted by each participating bank holding company to the FRB that describes the company's planned capital actions during the nine quarter review period, as well as the results of stress tests conducted by both the company and the FRB under different hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, including a supervisory adverse scenario and severely adverse scenario provided by the FRB. The FRB can object to a capital plan for qualitative or quantitative reasons, in which case the company cannot make capital distributions (with the exception of those that may have already received a non-objection in the previous year) without specific FRB approval.
In evaluating a capital plan, the FRB considers a number of qualitative factors, which have become increasingly important in the CCAR process in recent years. The FRB's supervisory expectations for the capital planning and stress testing processes at large and complex bank holding companies, including HSBC North America, are heightened relative to smaller and less complex bank holding companies. In assessing capital planning and stress testing processes, the FRB considers whether the bank holding company has sound and effective governance to oversee these processes. The FRB's evaluation focuses on whether a bank holding company's capital planning and stress testing processes are supported by a strong risk management framework to identify, measure and assess material risks and to provide a strong foundation to capital planning. The FRB also evaluates a bank holding company's policy guidelines for capital planning and assessing capital adequacy and the comprehensiveness of its internal controls. A bank holding company's scenario design processes and approaches for estimating the impact of stress on its capital position are also comprehensively reviewed to ensure that projections reflect the impact of appropriately stressful conditions on its capital position. Significant deficiencies in a bank holding company's capital planning and stress testing processes may result in a qualitative objection by the FRB to its capital plan. In January 2017, the FRB announced that so-called “large and noncomplex” firms, which are firms with less than $250 billion in total consolidated assets and less than $75 billion in total nonbanking assets, are exempt from the CCAR qualitative assessment. HSBC North America does not currently fall into the category of “large and noncomplex” and, therefore, remains subject to the qualitative review in the 2018 CCAR cycle. 
From a quantitative perspective, the FRB considers whether under different hypothetical macroeconomic scenarios, including a severely adverse scenario, the company would be able to maintain throughout the nine quarter planning horizon, regulatory risk-based and leverage capital ratios that exceed the minimum requirements after taking into account the company's planned capital

distributions, such as dividends and stock repurchases. Failure to meet a minimum regulatory risk-based or leverage capital requirement on a projected stress basis is grounds for objection to a capital plan. 
HSBC North America participates in the CCAR and DFAST programs of the FRB and submitted its latest CCAR capital plan and annual company-run DFAST results in April 2017, and its latest mid-cycle DFAST results in October 2017. HSBC Bank USA is subject to the OCC's DFAST requirements, which require certain banks to conduct annual company-run stress tests, and submitted its latest annual DFAST results in April 2017. The company-run stress tests are forward looking exercises to assess the impact of hypothetical macroeconomic baseline, adverse and severely adverse scenarios provided by the FRB and the OCC for the annual exercise, and internally developed scenarios for both the annual and mid-cycle exercises, on the financial condition and capital adequacy of a bank holding company or bank over a nine quarter planning horizon. 
HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA are required to disclose the results of their annual DFAST under the FRB and OCC's severely adverse stress scenario and HSBC North America is required to disclose the results of its mid-cycle DFAST under its internally developed severely adverse stress scenario. In June 2017, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA publicly disclosed their most recent annual DFAST results and the FRB also publicly disclosed its own DFAST and CCAR results. In October 2017, HSBC North America publicly disclosed the results of its mid-cycle DFAST results.
In June 2017, the FRB informed HSBC North America, our parent company, that it did not object to HSBC North America's capital plan or the planned capital distributions included in its 2017 CCAR submission. The FRB's capital plan rule provides that a bank holding company must resubmit a new capital plan prior to the annual submission date if, among other things, there has been or will be a material change in its risk profile, financial condition, or corporate structure since its last capital plan submission. 
In December 2017, the FRB finalized changes to the CCAR program that will require certain IHCs of foreign banking organizations, including HSBC North America, to provide information about the effect of a hypothetical global market shock on trading and counterparty exposures. HSBC North America will be required to provide quarterly information about such effects, and such effects will also be incorporated into the FRB’s CCAR stress testing applicable to HSBC North America, potentially causing additional projected stress losses under such tests.
Liquidity Risk Management. As previously disclosed, the Basel Committee has adopted two required liquidity metrics: the liquidity coverage ratio ("LCR"), designed to be a short-term measure to ensure banks have sufficient High Quality Liquid Assets ("HQLA") to cover net stressed cash outflows over the next 30 days, and the net stable funding ratio ("NSFR"), which is a longer term measure with a 12-month time horizon to ensure a sustainable maturity structure of assets and liabilities. Under European Commission Delegated Regulation 2015/61, the Basel Committee based LCR became a minimum regulatory standard in 2015. The European calibration of the Basel Committee based NSFR is still pending.
In 2014, the FRB, the OCC and the FDIC issued final regulations to implement the LCR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking institutions, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. The U.S. LCR rule is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but is more stringent in several areas including the range of assets that qualify as HQLA and the assumed rate of outflows of certain kinds of funding. Under the U.S. rule, U.S. institutions, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA, have been required to maintain a minimum LCR of 100 percent since January 1, 2017, two years ahead of the Basel Committee's timeframe for compliance by January 1, 2019, and report LCR to U.S. regulators on a daily basis. The U.S. LCR rule does not address the U.S. NSFR requirement, which is currently in an international observation period. Based on the results of the observation period, the Basel Committee and U.S. banking regulators may make further changes to the NSFR. In April 2016, U.S. regulators issued for public comment a proposal to implement the NSFR in the United States, applicable to certain large banking organizations, including HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA. The U.S. NSFR proposal is generally consistent with the Basel Committee guidelines, but similar to the U.S. LCR rule, is more stringent in several areas including the required stable funding factors applied to certain assets such as mortgage-backed securities.
Enhanced prudential standard rules issued pursuant to Section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Act complement the LCR, capital planning, resolution planning, and stress testing requirements for U.S. bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations with total global consolidated assets of $50 billion or more ("Covered Companies"). The rules require Covered Companies, such as HSBC North America, to comply with various liquidity risk management standards and to maintain a liquidity buffer of unencumbered highly liquid assets based on the results of internal liquidity stress testing. Covered Companies are also required to meet heightened liquidity requirements, which include qualitative liquidity standards, cash flow projections, internal liquidity stress tests, and liquidity buffer requirements. HSBC North America has implemented the standard and it does not have a significant impact to our business model.
HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA have adjusted their liquidity profiles to support compliance with these rules. HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA may need to make further changes to their liquidity profiles to support compliance with any future final rules.
Non-U.S. Regulatory Capital Requirements. HSBC North America and HSBC USA also continue to support HSBC's implementation of the Basel III framework, as adopted by the U.K. Prudential Regulation Authority. We supply data regarding credit risk, operational risk and market risk to support HSBC's regulatory capital and risk-weighted asset calculations.

HSBC USA Inc.

General. Our capital resources are summarized under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" in MD&A. Capital amounts and ratios for HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA are summarized in Note 23, "Retained Earnings and Regulatory Capital Requirements" of the consolidated financial statements. From time to time, bank regulators propose amendments to or issue interpretations of risk-based or leverage capital guidelines. Such proposals or interpretations could, upon implementation, affect reported capital ratios and net risk-weighted assets.
Deposit Insurance  Deposits placed at HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are insured by the FDIC, subject to the limitations and conditions of applicable law and the FDIC's regulations. The standard deposit insurance amount is $250,000 per depositor for each account category. HSBC Bank USA and HTCD are subject to risk based assessments from the FDIC. Such assessments determine the deposit insurance costs paid by HSBC Bank USA and HTCD to the FDIC. While the assessments are generally payable quarterly, the FDIC also has the authority to impose special assessments to prevent the Deposit Insurance Fund from declining to an unacceptable level. 
FDIC Assessment The minimum reserve ratio for the Deposit Insurance Fund was increased under the Dodd-Frank Act from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent, with the target of 1.35 percent to be reached by 2020 and with the incremental cost charged to banks with more than $10 billion in assets. In order to achieve the 1.35 percent goal, the FDIC adopted a rule that imposes on banks with at least $10 billion in assets, including HSBC Bank USA, a temporary assessment surcharge of 4.5 cents per $100 of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. The FDIC expects this surcharge, which took effect in July 2016, to remain in place for approximately two years. The surcharge has increased deposit insurance costs for HSBC Bank USA. In addition, the FDIC has set the designated reserve ratio at two percent as a long-term goal.
Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering  The USA Patriot Act (the "Patriot Act") of 2001, contains significant record keeping and customer identity requirements, expands the government's powers to freeze or confiscate assets and increases the available penalties that may be assessed against financial institutions for violation of the requirements of the Patriot Act intended to detect and deter money laundering. The U.S. Treasury Secretary developed and implemented final regulations with regard to the anti-money laundering ("AML") compliance obligations of financial institutions (a term which includes insured U.S. depository institutions, U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks, U.S. broker-dealers and numerous other entities). The U.S. Treasury Secretary delegated certain authority to a bureau of the U.S. Treasury Department known as the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN").
Many of the AML compliance requirements of the Patriot Act, as implemented by FinCEN, are generally consistent with the anti-money laundering compliance obligations that applied to HSBC Bank USA under the Bank Secrecy Act ("BSA") and applicable FRB regulations before the Patriot Act was adopted. These include requirements to adopt and implement an AML program, report suspicious transactions and implement due diligence procedures for certain correspondent and private banking accounts. Certain other specific requirements under the Patriot Act involve compliance obligations. The Patriot Act and other recent events have also resulted in heightened scrutiny of the BSA and AML compliance programs by bank regulators.
In 2010, HSBC Bank USA entered into a consent cease and desist order with the OCC and our parent, HSBC North America, entered into a consent cease and desist order with the FRB. In 2012, HSBC Bank USA further entered into an enterprise-wide compliance consent order (each an "Order" and together, the "Orders"). These Orders required improvements to establish an effective compliance risk management program across our U.S. businesses, including risk management related to BSA and AML compliance. While these Orders remain open, HSBC Bank USA and HSBC North America believe that they have taken appropriate steps to bring themselves into compliance with the requirements of the Orders.
In 2012, HSBC, HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA entered into agreements with U.S. and U.K. government agencies regarding past inadequate compliance with AML/BSA and sanctions laws. Among those agreements, HSBC and HSBC Bank USA entered into a five-year deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice ("DOJ"), the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of West Virginia (the "AML DPA"), and HSBC consented to a cease and desist order and HSBC and HSBC North America consented to a civil money penalty order with the FRB. HSBC also entered into an agreement with the Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") regarding historical transactions involving parties subject to OFAC sanctions, as well as an undertaking with the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA") to comply with certain forward-looking AML and sanctions-related obligations. In addition, HSBC Bank USA entered into a civil money penalty order with FinCEN and a separate civil money penalty order with the OCC. 
Under these agreements, HSBC and HSBC Bank USA made payments totaling $1.921 billion to U.S. authorities, of which $1.381 billion was attributed to and paid by HSBC Bank USA and undertook various further obligations, including among others, to continue to cooperate fully with the DOJ in any and all investigations, not to commit any crime under U.S. federal law subsequent to the signing of the agreement, and to retain an independent compliance monitor (the "Monitor") to evaluate our progress in fully implementing our obligations and produce regular assessments of the effectiveness of HSBC Group's Compliance function. In December 2017, the AML DPA expired and the charges deferred by the AML DPA were dismissed. The Monitor will continue working in his capacity as a skilled person and independent consultant for a period of time at the FCA's and FRB's discretion. 
13


HSBC USA Inc.

In February 2018, the Monitor delivered his fourth annual follow-up review report based on various thematic and country reviews he had conducted over the course of 2017. In his report, the Monitor concluded that, in 2017, HSBC Group made significant progress in developing a reasonably effective and sustainable AML and sanctions compliance program and expressed confidence that HSBC Group can achieve its target end state within the next eighteen months if it is able to maintain the concerted effort and focus it has demonstrated in remediating and enhancing its program over the last five years. Nonetheless, the Monitor identified various challenges that HSBC Group faces in achieving this objective, noted deficiencies in HSBC Group’s financial crime compliance controls and areas of HSBC Group's program that require further work, and highlighted potential instances of financial crime and certain areas in which he believes that HSBC Group is not adequately managing financial crime risk. The Monitor identified potential AML and sanctions compliance issues that HSBC Group is reviewing further with the DOJ, FRB and/or FCA. See Note 27, "Litigation and Regulatory Matters," for additional discussion. 
Additionally, as discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, HSBC is the subject of other ongoing investigations and reviews by the DOJ.
Concurrent with entry into the AML DPA, HSBC Bank USA also entered into two consent orders with the OCC. The first, discussed above, required HSBC Bank USA to adopt an enterprise-wide compliance program. The second required HSBC Bank USA to correct the circumstances noted in the OCC's report and imposed restrictions on HSBC Bank USA acquiring control of, or holding an interest in, any new financial subsidiary, or commencing a new activity in its existing financial subsidiary, without the OCC's prior approval. 
These settlements with the U.S. and U.K. government agencies have led to private litigation and do not preclude further private litigation relating to, among other things, HSBC Group's compliance with applicable AML/BSA and sanctions laws or other regulatory or law enforcement action for AML/BSA or sanctions matters not covered by the various agreements. 
Cybersecurity Regulatory Proposals In October 2016, the FRB, FDIC, and OCC issued a joint advance notice of proposed rulemaking that would impose enhanced cyber risk management standards on banking organizations with $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets and certain of their service providers. The standards address five categories: (i) cyber risk governance; (ii) cyber risk management; (iii) internal dependency management; (iv) external dependency management; and (v) incident response, cyber resilience, and situational awareness. The agencies are also considering proposing more stringent "Sector Critical Standards" that would apply to systems "deemed critical to the financial sector." The advanced notice of proposed rulemaking leaves open the precise form the enhanced standards would take, and instead lays out possibilities ranging from policy guidance on best practices to specific regulations. We are monitoring future developments in this area and their potential impact on our operations.
Financial Regulatory Reform The Dodd-Frank Act, which was signed into law in 2010, is a sweeping overhaul of the U.S. financial regulatory system. The law is comprehensive and includes many provisions specifically relevant to our businesses and the businesses of our affiliates as follows, many of which have already been described above.
Oversight  In order to promote financial stability in the U.S. financial system, the Dodd-Frank Act created a framework for the enhanced prudential regulation and supervision of financial institutions that are deemed to be "systemically important" to the U.S. financial system, including U.S. bank holding companies with consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, such as HSBC North America. This framework is subject to the general oversight of the Financial Stability Oversight Council ("FSOC"), an interagency coordinating body that has authority, among other things, to recommend stricter regulatory and supervisory requirements for large bank holding companies and to designate bank and non-bank financial companies that pose a risk to financial stability. In turn, the FRB has authority, in consultation with the FSOC, to take certain actions, including to preclude mergers, restrict financial products offered, restrict, terminate or impose conditions on activities or require the sale or transfer of assets against any systemically important bank holding company with assets greater than $50 billion, such as HSBC North America, that is found to pose a grave threat to financial stability. The FSOC is supported by the Office of Financial Research ("OFR"), which develops standards for data reporting requirements for financial institutions. The cost of operating both the FSOC and OFR is paid for through an assessment on large bank holding companies, which began in 2012.
Increased Prudential Standards In addition to the increased capital, liquidity, stress testing and other enhanced prudential and structural requirements described above, large international banks, such as HSBC (generally with regard to its U.S. operations), and large insured depository institutions, such as HSBC Bank USA, are required to file resolution plans identifying, among other things, material subsidiaries and core business lines and describing what strategy would be followed to resolve the institution in the event of significant financial distress, including identifying how insured bank subsidiaries would be adequately protected from risk created by other affiliates. The failure to cure deficiencies in a resolution plan required by Dodd-Frank to be filed by HSBC would enable the FRB and the FDIC, acting jointly, to impose more stringent capital, leverage or liquidity requirements, or restrictions on growth, activities or operations and, if such failure persists, require the divestiture of assets or operations. Dodd-Frank also requires that single counterparty lending limits applicable to HSBC Bank USA take into account credit exposure arising from derivative transactions, securities borrowing and lending transactions and repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements with counterparties. 
14


HSBC USA Inc.

In March 2016 the FRB issued its re-proposal to limit credit exposures to single counterparties. The re-proposal would prohibit HSBC North America from having aggregate net credit exposure to a single counterparty in excess of 25 percent of Tier 1 capital. Our ultimate parent, HSBC, would be prohibited from having aggregate net credit exposure to a "Major Counterparty" in its combined U.S. operations (including HSBC North America) in excess of 15 percent of Tier 1 capital. Aggregate net credit exposure of HSBC's combined U.S. operations to any other counterparty would be limited to 25 percent of HSBC's Tier 1 capital. A "major counterparty" is any counterparty that is (i) a U.S. G-SIB; (ii) a foreign banking organization ("FBO"), that has the characteristics of a G-SIB under the Basel Committee's G-SIB methodology; (iii) an FBO with respect to which the FRB determines that the FBO would be a G-SIB or that the U.S. IHC of the FBO would be a G-SIB; or (iv) is a nonbank financial company supervised by the FRB. We continue to evaluate the potential effects of this re-proposal on our operations. 
Affiliate Transaction Limits Quantitative and qualitative limits on bank credit transactions with affiliates also include credit exposure related to repurchase agreements, derivatives and securities lending/borrowing transactions. This provision may limit the use of intercompany transactions between us and our affiliates, which may impact our current funding, hedging and overall internal risk management strategies.
Derivatives Regulation Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act imposes comprehensive regulation on the over-the-counter ("OTC") derivatives markets, including credit default, equity, foreign exchange and interest rate swaps. Implementation of Title VII is the responsibility of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") (for swaps based on non-securities underliers or broad-based security indices), the SEC (for swaps based on individual securities and narrow-based security indices, known as "security- based swaps") and, to a lesser extent, U.S. banking regulators (for certain rules applicable to banks). The CFTC has adopted final rules implementing many of the most significant provisions of Title VII applicable to swaps, most of which came into effect during 2013 and 2014. In particular, certain swap dealers, including HSBC Bank USA, have provisionally registered with the CFTC and become members of the National Futures Association, subjecting them to an extensive array of corporate governance requirements, business conduct standards, reporting requirements, mandatory clearing and trading of certain swaps and other regulatory standards affecting their derivatives businesses. These requirements have and continue to significantly increase the costs associated with HSBC Bank USA's derivatives businesses. 
In addition to these CFTC rules, as a provisionally registered swap dealer that is a national bank, HSBC Bank USA is subject to the final rules establishing margin requirements for non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps adopted in November 2015 by the OCC jointly with other U.S. banking regulators. The final margin rules require HSBC Bank USA to collect and post initial and variation margin for non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps entered into with other swap dealers and certain financial end users that exceed a minimum threshold of transactional activity. For non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps entered into with financial end users that do not meet the minimum transactional activity threshold, HSBC Bank USA is only required to collect and post variation margin (but not initial margin). The U.S. banking regulators' final rules do not impose margin requirements for non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps entered into with non-financial end users, certain treasury affiliates, certain sovereigns and multilateral development banks or qualifying hedging transactions with certain small depository institutions.
The final margin rules also limit the types of assets that are eligible to satisfy initial and variation margin requirements, require initial margin to be segregated at a third-party custodian, impose requirements on internal models used to calculate initial margin requirements and contain specific provisions for cross-border transactions and inter-affiliate transactions. The final margin rules follow a phased implementation schedule, with certain initial margin and variation margin requirements effective as of September 2016. Additional variation margin requirements came into effect in March 2017 and additional initial margin requirements are being phased in on an annual basis from September 2017 through September 2020, with the relevant compliance dates depending on the transactional volume of the parties and their affiliates. These final rules, as well as parallel margin rules from the CFTC, the SEC, and certain non-U.S. regulators will increase the costs and liquidity burden associated with trading non-cleared swaps and security-based swaps and may adversely affect our business in such products. In particular, the imposition of initial margin requirements on inter-affiliate transactions will significantly increase the cost of certain consolidated risk management activities and may adversely affect HSBC to a greater extent than some of our competitors.
Also, HSBC Bank USA engages in equity and credit derivatives businesses that are subject to the SEC's jurisdiction to regulate security-based swaps under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. In 2015 and 2016, the SEC finalized rules regarding registration, business conduct standards and trade acknowledgment and verification requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The registration requirements and other rules applicable to security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants will not come into effect until the SEC completes further security-based swap rulemakings. Certain HSBC affiliates, including HSBC Bank USA, may be required to register and become subject to these rules when the registration requirement becomes effective. In January 2015 and July 2016, the SEC also finalized rules regarding reporting and public dissemination requirements for security-based swap transaction data. The reporting requirements will not become effective until after the compliance date for security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap participant registration. Because HSBC Bank USA's equity and credit derivatives businesses are also subject to the CFTC's jurisdiction under Title VII, material differences between the final SEC rules and existing CFTC rules could materially increase our costs of compliance with Title VII by requiring the implementation of significant additional policies, procedures, documentation, systems and controls for those businesses.

HSBC USA Inc.

The "Volcker Rule" In 2013, U.S. regulators finalized the "Volcker Rule," which limits the ability of banking entities, such as HUSI, to sponsor or invest in certain private equity or hedge funds or to engage in certain types of proprietary trading. The conformance period for the Volcker Rule was extended until July 2015. The FRB further extended the conformance period to July 2016 for investments in and relationships with "covered funds" and "foreign funds," each as defined in the Volcker Rule, that were in place prior to 2014 ("legacy covered funds"). In July 2016, the FRB granted an additional one-year extension of the conformance period for legacy covered funds until July 2017. In February 2017, the FRB granted HSBC North America an additional transition period to conform investments in certain illiquid legacy covered funds under the Volcker Rule. On August 7, 2017, the OCC published a request for information on how the final regulations implementing the Volcker Rule could be revised to better accomplish the purposes of the statute. The comment period on the OCC notice closed on September 21, 2017. 
The Volcker Rule restricts proprietary trading as principal for a "trading account" in "financial instruments," each as defined in the Volcker Rule, subject to various exclusions and exemptions. Generally, securities, derivatives, futures and options on all such instruments are covered, while loans, currencies and commodities are not covered. In addition, there are exemptions for activities, among others, that constitute market making, underwriting, hedging, and trading of U.S. government, agency or municipal securities and certain foreign sovereign debt securities. Each of these exemptions, however, is generally subject to its own set of compliance requirements and conditions.
The Volcker Rule also restricts acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, or sponsoring or having certain relationships with, covered funds. Covered funds generally include entities that would be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act"), but for the exemptions provided in Section 3(c)(1) or Section 3(c)(7) of the 1940 Act, as well as certain commodity pools. The Volcker Rule includes exclusions and exemptions, among others, for certain limited investments in conjunction with asset management activities for customers, for loan securitizations, for asset-backed commercial paper conduits, and for underwriting and market making in covered funds. As with the proprietary trading restrictions, the exemptions are generally subject to a variety of compliance requirements and conditions. Any limited, yet permissible, investments in covered funds are required to be deducted from the Tier 1 capital of U.S. banking entities. Several activities engaged in by HUSI are subject to restrictions under the Volcker Rule.
The Volcker Rule also requires an extensive array of compliance policies, procedures and quantitative metrics reporting to ensure that activities remain within one or more of the exemptions described in the Volcker Rule. In connection with these requirements, we have built the appropriate compliance framework to ensure compliance by the relevant effective dates. HUSI has continued to ensure that relevant training is completed on a regular basis for all affected front office and control personnel, that it has conformance plans for those legacy covered funds to which the extension applies, and that it is in compliance with all material respects of the Volcker Rule.
The Volcker Rule also requires an annual attestation either by the Chief Executive Officer of the top-tier foreign banking organization or the senior management officer in the U.S. as to the implementation of a compliance program reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Volcker Rule. 
Consumer Regulation The Dodd-Frank Act created the CFPB, which has a broad range of powers to administer and enforce a new federal regulatory framework of consumer financial regulation, including the authority to regulate credit, savings, payment and other consumer financial products and services and providers of those products and services. The CFPB has the authority to issue regulations to prevent unfair, deceptive or abusive practices in connection with consumer financial products or services and to ensure features of any consumer financial products or services are fully, accurately and effectively disclosed to consumers. The CFPB also has authority to examine large banks, including HSBC Bank USA, and their affiliates for compliance with those regulations.
With respect to certain state laws governing the provision of consumer financial products by national banks such as HSBC Bank USA, the Dodd-Frank Act codified the current judicial standard of federal preemption with respect to national banks, but added procedural steps to be followed by the OCC when considering preemption determinations after July 2011. Furthermore, the Dodd-Frank Act removed the ability of subsidiaries or agents of a national bank to claim federal preemption of consumer financial laws, although the legislation did not purport to affect existing contracts. These limitations on federal preemption may elevate our costs of compliance, while increasing litigation expenses as a result of potential state Attorney General or plaintiff challenges and the risk of courts not giving deference to the OCC, as well as increasing complexity due to the lack of uniformity in state law. The extent to which the limitations on federal preemption will impact our businesses and those of our competitors remains uncertain. The Dodd-Frank Act contains many other consumer-related provisions, including provisions addressing mortgage reform.
The Dodd-Frank Act has and will continue to have a significant impact on the operations of many financial institutions in the United States, including HUSI and our affiliates. As the legislation calls for extensive regulations to be promulgated to interpret and implement the legislation, we are unable to determine precisely the impact that Dodd-Frank and related regulations will have on financial results at this time. Notwithstanding, the current Administration in the U.S. (the "Administration") has indicated it would like to see changes made to certain financial reform regulations, including Dodd-Frank, to replace certain elements with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation. The specifics of what might be changed are currently unclear, which has introduced some uncertainty about the regulatory framework that will apply to the financial services industry going forward.

Competition  The GLB Act eliminated many of the regulatory restrictions on providing financial services in the United States. The GLB Act allows for financial institutions and other providers of financial products to enter into combinations that permit a single organization to offer a complete line of financial products and services. In addition, the Volcker Rule places new restrictions on bank-affiliated financial companies' trading activities and private equity and hedge fund investments, which may provide a competitive advantage to financial companies that do not have U.S. banking operations and may impact liquidity in the products and activities in which we engage. Therefore, we face intense competition in all of the markets we serve, competing with banks and other financial institutions such as insurance companies, commercial finance providers, brokerage firms and investment companies. The financial services industry has experienced consolidation in recent years as financial institutions involved in a broad range of products and services have merged, been acquired or dispersed. This trend is expected to continue and has resulted in, among other things, greater concentrations of deposits and other resources. Competition is expected to continue to be intense given the multiple banks and other financial services companies which offer products and services in our markets, noting that we compete with different banks and financial services companies in different markets, given our global strategy.
