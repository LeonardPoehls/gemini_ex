--------+---------

Overview 
 Sitestar Corporation (formerly White Dove Systems, Inc., and then Interfoods Consolidated, Inc.) was incorporated in Nevada on December 17, 1992. On July 26, 1999, the Company restated its Articles of Incorporation to change the name of the Company to “Sitestar Corporation.” Unless the context otherwise requires, and when used in this Report, the “Company,” “Sitestar,” “we,” “our” or “us” refers to Sitestar Corporation and its subsidiaries.
 The Company operates through five reportable segments: Corporate, Internet Operations, HVAC Operations, Real Estate Operations, and Asset Management Operations. The management of the Company also continually reviews various investment opportunities, including in other lines of business.
 Corporate
 The corporate segment includes any revenue or expenses derived from corporate office operations as well as expenses related to public company reporting, the oversight of subsidiaries, and other items that affect the overall Company. 
Internet Operations
 The Company operates its internet operations through Sitestar.net, a wholly owned subsidiary that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, wholesale managed modem services, web hosting, and various ancillary services. Sitestar.net provides services to customers in the United States and Canada.
 HVAC Operations
 The Company operates its HVAC segment through HVAC Value Fund, LLC. HVAC Value Fund is focused on the acquisition and management of HVAC and plumbing companies in Arizona and throughout the Southwest United States. As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 14, 2016, the Company, along with JNJ Investments, LLC, an unaffiliated third party and member of HVAC Value Fund, LLC, organized and launched this subsidiary on June 13, 2016. Sitestar has a 100% voting interest in HVAC Value Fund and JNJ Investments has the ability to earn profit interests. Under the operating agreement, the Company has first claim to a portion of net income, with the remainder being allocated between the Company and JNJ Investments. JNJ Investments shall also be subject to a Loss Carryforward limitation in the event of a net loss.
 As of December 31, 2017, HVAC Value Fund had closed on six acquisitions for an aggregate purchase price of $2.02 million which includes estimated earn-outs of approximately $350,000. As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on June 14, 2016, and further described above, the purpose of HVAC Value Fund is to acquire HVAC and plumbing businesses. Accordingly, these six acquisitions were made in the ordinary course of business and consistent with the customs and practices (including with respect to nature, scope, magnitude, quantity, frequency, and contemplated purpose) of HVAC Value Fund, and, in turn, the Company.
 Real Estate Operations
 Sitestar created a wholly owned real estate subsidiary on July 10, 2017 named EDI Real Estate, LLC to hold Sitestar’s legacy portfolio of real estate. Through EDI Real Estate, LLC, Sitestar owns a real estate investment portfolio that includes ten residential properties, vacant land, and one commercial property. Our real estate portfolio under EDI Real Estate, LLC is primarily focused in the Roanoke and Lynchburg areas of Virginia. The portfolio includes single family homes that are currently rented and managed through a third-party property manager, as well as vacant properties being prepared or currently listed for sale. 
 As previously reported in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2017 and January 17, 2018, respectively, Sitestar created a wholly owned subsidiary named Mt Melrose, LLC, which currently is engaged in an acquisition of a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into on December 10, 2017 with a like-named seller, Mt. Melrose, LLC, a Kentucky limited liability company owned by Jeff Moore, also a Sitestar director. Unlike EDI Real Estate, LLC, which is a legacy business that we do not intend

to grow, Mt Melrose is a real estate business that the Company expects will grow significantly over time. Mt Melrose has its own management team, led by our Chairman, Jeffrey Moore. Mr. Moore has extensive experience acquiring and operating real estate in the Lexington, KY region where Mt Melrose is focused. The Mt Melrose management team will be responsible for growing this business.
 Asset Management Operations
 Sitestar created a wholly owned asset management subsidiary on October 10, 2016, named Willow Oak Asset Management, LLC (“Willow Oak”). The asset management segment did not produce revenue in 2016. Any expenses incurred in 2016 were allocated to the corporate segment. Starting January 1, 2017, all revenue earned and expenses incurred by this segment were allocated as such. 
 As previously reported in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on September 19, 2016, and December 30, 2016, respectively, the Company agreed to make a seed investment totaling $10 million through Willow Oak in Alluvial Fund, LP, a private investment partnership that was launched on January 1, 2017. Under a side letter agreement between Willow Oak, Alluvial Fund and the fund’s general partner, Willow Oak may not make a full withdrawal from its capital account prior to a date five years after the effective date of the side letter agreement. The Alluvial Fund focuses on investing in deeply mis-priced securities in the United States and abroad. Alluvial Fund focuses on small companies, thinly-traded issues and special situations, seeking to identify value that the market has yet to recognize.
 As previously reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 30, 2017, the Company, through Willow Oak, also committed to make a capital contribution to Huckleberry Real Estate Fund II, LLC, a private investment fund, in the aggregate amount of $750,000. Under the operating agreement included in the Form 8-K, the fund’s managing member shall have sole discretion regarding the amounts and timing of any distributions to the members of the fund.
 Willow Oak signed a fee share agreement on May 11, 2017, with Lizard Head, LLC, the general partner of Bridge Reid Fund I, LP, a private investment partnership (also doing business as “Ironwood Capital Allocation Partners” or “Ironwood Fund”). Under the agreement, Willow Oak became a special limited partner to Bridge Reid, providing fund advisory services to Bridge Reid in exchange for payments equal to 33% of the management fees accrued quarterly by the general partner and 33% of the incentive fees accrued annually, on investors who become limited partners after May 11, 2017. The Ironwood Fund utilizes a value investing methodology focused on: companies it believes will compound at a superior rate over the long term, special situations and companies it believes are valued by the market significantly below its estimate of their intrinsic value.
 Willow Oak signed a fee share agreement on June 13, 2017, with Coolidge Capital Management, LLC (“Coolidge”), whose sole member is Keith D. Smith, also a Sitestar director. Under the agreement, Willow Oak and Coolidge are the sole members of Bonhoeffer Capital Management LLC, the general partner to Bonhoeffer Fund, LP, a private investment partnership. Under their agreement, Willow Oak pays all start-up and operating expenses that are not partnership expenses under the limited partnership agreement. Willow Oak receives 50% of all performance and management fees earned by the general partner. The Bonhoeffer Fund utilizes a value-oriented approach to invest in undervalued businesses worldwide that are in a state of distress and/or transition, but also exhibit recurring revenue.

The residential broadband internet access market is dominated by cable and telecommunications companies. These companies offer internet connectivity through the use of cable modems, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) programs, and fiber. These competitors have extensive scale and significantly more resources than Sitestar. Competitors often offer incentives for customers to purchase internet access by offering discounts for bundled service offerings (i.e., phone, television, Internet). While we are a reseller of broadband services including DSL and fiber services, our profit margin is heavily influenced by these competitive forces. 
 There are currently laws and regulations directly applicable to access or commerce on the internet, covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, characteristics and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, information security, and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with Internet communications. We may be positively or negatively affected by the repeal, modification, or adoption of various laws and regulations. These changes may occur at the international, federal, state, and local levels, and may cover a wide range of issues.
 HVAC Operations
 HVAC Value Fund, LLC is an Arizona-based HVAC and plumbing company focused on repairs, replacements, and equipment maintenance. Our customer base consists of apartment communities, single family homes, condos, and property management companies, with a small portion of our work falling into the commercial category. We are focused on growing both organically and through acquisitions. Since inception of this subsidiary, we have acquired small to mid-sized HVAC and plumbing companies where the owners needed an exit strategy and where we expected to retain the existing customer and employee base.

 The Arizona and Southwest HVAC and plumbing services markets are highly fragmented, with the majority of companies run by technicians. HVAC Value Fund is both systems and customer-oriented with a goal of optimizing processes and maximizing margins.
 Real Estate Operations
 Sitestar owns a real estate investment portfolio that includes residential properties, vacant land, and one commercial property. Our real estate portfolio is primarily focused in the Roanoke and Lynchburg areas of Virginia.  
 The portfolio includes single family homes that are currently rented and managed through a third-party property manager, as well as vacant properties being prepared or currently listed for sale. We have examined each property on an individual basis to determine a strategy to maximize the net sale price. Where appropriate, we have and will reinvest resources into a property to increase its marketability and sale price. We have listed and sold properties both directly and through real estate agents. In 2016, we engaged a property manager to manage the rental properties that we own in Roanoke, Virginia.  
 State and municipal laws and regulations govern the real estate industry and do not vary significantly from one community to another. State laws, including the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, in addition to local ordinances, govern rental properties and also do not vary significantly throughout our real estate holding areas. 
 As previously reported in our Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December 11, 2017 and January 17, 2018, respectively, Sitestar created a wholly owned subsidiary named Mt Melrose, LLC, which currently is engaged in an acquisition of a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into on December 10, 2017 with a like-named seller, Mt.

Mr. Moore has extensive experience acquiring and operating real estate in the Lexington, KY region where Mt Melrose is focused. The Mt Melrose management team will be responsible for growing this business.

 During Willow Oak’s first year of activity, the subsidiary entered into three fee share agreements with multiple private investment partnerships and made an additional investment through another partnership arrangement.  Through Willow Oak, the Company continues to look for unique investment opportunities.
