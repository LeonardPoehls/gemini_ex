PSE's revenues and associated expenses are not generated evenly throughout the year, primarily due to seasonal weather patterns, varying wholesale prices for electricity and the amount of hydroelectric energy supplies available to PSE, which make quarter-to-quarter comparisons difficult. Weather conditions in PSE's service territory have an impact on customer energy usage and affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses. While both PSE's electric and natural gas sales are generally greatest during winter months, variations in energy usage by customers occur from season to season and also month to month within a season, primarily as result of weather conditions. PSE normally experiences its highest retail energy sales, and corresponding higher power costs, during the winter heating season in the first and fourth quarters of the year and its lowest sales and corresponding lower power costs in the third quarter of the year. While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms for electric and natural gas operations are expected to normalize the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. Under the decoupling mechanism, the Washington Commission allows PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers. For additional information, see Business, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 1 of this report and Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.

Available Information
The information required by Item 101(e) of Regulation S-K is incorporated herein by reference to the material under “Additional Information” in Part III Item 10, "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance".
Regulation and Rates
PSE is subject to the regulatory authority of: (i) the FERC with respect to the transmission of electricity, the sale of electricity at wholesale, accounting and certain other matters; and (ii) the Washington Commission as to retail rates, accounting, the issuance of securities and certain other matters.  PSE also must comply with mandatory electric system reliability standards developed by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC), the electric reliability organization certified by the FERC, whose standards are enforced by the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) in PSE’s operating territory.
Rate mechanisms include: (i) trackers that typically track specific costs during the previous twelve-month period and (ii) riders that project cost recovery during a forward looking twelve-month period. Both allow recovery of expenditures without the lengthy process of a full GRC. 
The following table shows PSE’s rate filings for its trackers and riders and whether or not they are included in decoupling rates:

Rate Filings | Electric | Natural Gas
Baseline rates | Yes | Yes 
Annual rate plan increase | Yes | Yes 
Expedited rate filing rider | Yes | Yes 
Merger credit | No | No 
Power cost only rates mechanism | No | N/A 
Federal incentive tracker | No | N/A 
Low income rates tracker | No | No 
Pipeline cost recovery mechanism tracker | N/A | No 
Prior year decoupling deferral tracker | No | No 
Property tax tracker | No | No 
Renewable energy credit tracker | No | N/A 
Residential exchange credits tracker | No | N/A 
Conservation costs rider | No | No 
PGA rider | N/A | No 

General Rate Case Filing 
On January 13, 2017, PSE filed its GRC with the Washington Commission, the settlement agreement was accepted by the Washington Commission on December 5, 2017 and the rates became effective December 19, 2017. For further details regarding the 2017 GRC filing, see Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.
Decoupling Filings
While fluctuations in weather conditions will continue to affect PSE's billed revenue and energy supply expenses from month to month, PSE's decoupling mechanisms assist in mitigating the impact of weather on operating revenue and net income. Since July 2013, the Washington Commission has allowed PSE to record a monthly adjustment to its electric and natural gas operating revenues related to electric transmission and distribution, natural gas operations and general administrative costs from residential, commercial and industrial customers. This monthly adjustment mitigates the effects of abnormal weather, conservation impacts and changes in usage patterns per customer. As a result, these electric and natural gas revenues are recovered on a per customer basis regardless of actual consumption levels. The energy supply costs, which are part of the power cost adjustment (PCA) and purchased gas adjustment (PGA) mechanisms, are not included in the decoupling mechanism. Total electric and natural gas revenue recorded under the decoupling mechanisms will be affected by customer growth and not actual consumption. Following each calendar year, PSE will recover from, or refund to, customers the difference between allowed decoupling revenue and the corresponding actual revenue during the following May to April time period. For further details regarding decoupling filings, see Note 3, "Regulation and Rates" to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.

Electric Rate Filings
Power Cost Adjustment Mechanism
PSE currently has a PCA mechanism that provides for the deferral of power costs that vary from the “power cost baseline” level of power costs. The “power cost baseline” is set in part, based on normalized assumptions about weather and hydrological conditions.  Excess power costs or savings are apportioned between PSE and its customers pursuant to the graduated scale set forth in the PCA mechanism and will trigger a surcharge or refund when the $30.0 million cumulative deferral trigger is reached. 
On August 7, 2015, the Washington Commission issued an order approving changes to the PCA mechanism. The settlement agreement took effect January 1, 2017 and will apply the following graduated scale:

 | Company's Share | Customers’ Share
Annual Power Cost Variability | Over | Under | Over | Under
Over or Under Collected by up to $17 million | 100% | 100% | —% | —% 
Over or Under Collected by between $17 million - $40 million | 35 | 50 | 65 | 50 
Over or Under Collected beyond $40 + million | 10 | 10 | 90 | 90 

Electric Conservation Rider
The electric conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual compared to forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year as well as actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates. 
Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff
The Federal Incentive Tracker Tariff passes through to customers the benefits associated with the wind-related treasury grants. The filing results in a credit back to customers for pass-back of treasury grant amortization and pass-through of interest and any related true-ups. The filing is adjusted annually for new Federal benefits, actual versus forecast interest and to true-up for actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates. Rates change annually on January 1.
Power Cost Only Rate Case
A power cost rate case is a limited-scope proceeding to reset power cost rates.  In addition to providing the opportunity to reset all power costs, the PCORC proceeding also provides for timely review of new resource acquisition costs and inclusion of such costs in rates at the time the new resource goes into service.  To achieve this objective, the Washington Commission is not required to but historically has used an expedited six-month PCORC decision timeline rather than the statutory 11-month timeline for a GRC.
Residential Exchange Benefit
The residential exchange program passes through the residential exchange program benefits that PSE receives from the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).  Rates change bi-annually on October 1.
Electric Property Tax Tracker Mechanism
The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker will be adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and true-up from the prior year. 
Natural Gas Rate Filings
Natural Gas Cost Recovery Mechanism 
The purpose of the CRM is to recover capital costs related to projects included in PSE's pipe replacement program plan on file with the Washington Commission with the intended effect of enhancing the safety of the natural gas distribution system. Rates change annually on November 1.
10

Purchased Gas Adjustment
PSE has a PGA mechanism that allows PSE to recover expected natural gas supply and transportation costs and defer, as a receivable or liability, any natural gas supply and transportation costs that exceed or fall short of this expected natural gas cost amount in PGA mechanism rates, including accrued interest. PSE is authorized by the Washington Commission to accrue carrying costs on PGA receivable and payable balances. A receivable or payable balance in the PGA mechanism reflects an under recovery or over recovery, respectively, of natural gas cost through the PGA mechanism. Rates change annually on November 1.
Natural Gas Property Tax Tracker Mechanism 
The purpose of the property tax tracker mechanism is to pass through the cost of all property taxes incurred by the Company. The mechanism was implemented in 2013 and removed property taxes from general rates and included those costs for recovery in an adjusting tariff rate. After the implementation, the mechanism acts as a tracker rate schedule and collects the total amount of property taxes assessed. The tracker is adjusted each year in May based on that year's assessed property taxes and adjustments to the rate from the prior year.
Natural Gas Conservation Rider
The natural gas conservation rider collects revenue to cover the costs incurred in providing services and programs for conservation. Rates change annually on May 1 to collect the annual budget that started the prior January and to true-up for actual versus forecast conservation expenditures from the prior year as well as actual load being different than the forecasted load set in rates. 
For additional information on electric and natural gas rates, see Management's Discussion and Analysis, "Regulation and Rates" included in Item 7 of this report.

Electric Supply
At December 31, 2017, PSE’s electric power resources, which include company-owned or controlled resources as well as those under long-term contract, had a total capacity of approximately 4,737 megawatts (MW).  PSE’s historical peak load of approximately 4,912 MW occurred on December 10, 2009.  In order to meet an extreme winter peak load, PSE may supplement its electric power resources with winter-peaking call options and other instruments. When it is more economical for PSE to purchase power than to operate its own generation facilities, PSE will purchase spot market energy when sufficient transmission capacity is available.
The following table shows PSE’s electric energy supply resources and energy production for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:

Columbia River Electric Energy Supply Contracts
During 2017, approximately 13.3% of PSE’s energy supply requirement was obtained through long-term contracts with three Washington Public Utility Districts (PUDs) that own and operate hydroelectric projects on the Columbia River (Mid-Columbia).  PSE agrees to pay a share of the annual debt service, operating and maintenance costs and other expenses associated with each project in proportion to its share of projected output.  PSE’s payments are not contingent upon the projects being operable.
As of December 31, 2017, PSE's portion of the power output of the PUDs’ projects as set forth below:

 | | | Company’s Annual Share(Approximate)
Project | ContractExpiration Year | LicenseExpiration Year | Percent ofOutput | | MW Capacity

_______________

1 | In March 2017, PSE entered a new PPA with Douglas County PUD for Wells Project output that begins upon expiration of the existing contract on August 31, 2018 and continues through September 30, 2028.

Other Electric Supply, Exchange and Transmission Contracts and Agreements
PSE purchases electric energy under long-term firm purchased power contracts with other utilities and marketers in the Western region.  PSE is generally not obligated to make payments under these contracts unless power is delivered.  PSE had seasonal energy and capacity exchange agreements with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) for 44 aMW of capacity which expired on July 1, 2017 with no provision to renew this agreement. PSE will procure more capacity from Mid-Columbia to recover for this loss of capacity, if needed. PSE also has an agreement with Pacific Gas & Electric Company for 300 MW of capacity which currently has no set expiration.
PSE began participating in the Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) operated by the California Independent System Operator on October 1, 2016. PSE has committed 600 MW of existing BPA transmission solely for the EIM market. Participation has resulted in reduced costs for PSE customers of approximately $10.0 million, enhanced system reliability, integration of variable energy resources, and geographic diversity of electricity demand and generation resources. The calculated benefits represent the cost savings of the EIM dispatch compared with a counter-factual dispatch without the EIM. Benefits can take the form of cost savings or profits or their combination. Benefits include greenhouse gas (GHG) revenue, transfer revenues and flexible ramping revenues.
PSE has entered into multiple various-term transmission contracts with other utilities to integrate electric generation and contracted resources into PSE’s system.  These transmission contracts require PSE to pay for transmission service based on the contracted MW level of demand, regardless of actual use. Other transmission agreements provide actual capacity ownership or capacity ownership rights.  PSE’s annual charges under these agreements are also based on contracted MW volumes.  Capacity on these agreements that is not committed to serve PSE’s load is available for sale to third parties.  PSE also purchases short-term transmission services from a variety of providers, including the BPA.
In 2017, PSE had 4,646 MW and 595 MW of total transmission demand contracted with the BPA and other utilities, respectively.  Additionally, PSE contracted with BPA for an additional 53 MW of transmission demand that went into effect from May to November of 2017. PSE’s remaining transmission capacity needs are met via PSE owned transmission assets.
Natural Gas Supply for Electric Customers
PSE purchases natural gas supplies for its power portfolio to meet demand for its combustion turbine generators. Supplies range from long-term to daily agreements, as the demand for the turbines varies depending on market heat rates.  Purchases are made from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada.  PSE also enters into financial hedges to manage the cost of natural gas.  PSE utilizes natural gas storage capacity and transportation that is dedicated to and paid for by the power portfolio to facilitate increased natural gas supply reliability and intra-day dispatch 
16

of PSE’s natural gas-fired generation resources.  During 2017, PSE purchased approximately 69.9% of its natural gas in British Columbia, 21.8% in Alberta and 8.3% in the United States.  
Integrated Resource Plans, Resource Acquisition and Development
PSE is required by Washington Commission regulations to file an electric and natural gas integrated resource plan (IRP) every two years.  The 2017 IRP was filed on November 14, 2017 and identified the following capacity shortfalls and surpluses:

 | 2018 | 2019 | 2020 | 2021 | 2022
Projected MW shortfall/(surplus) | (73) | (34) | (121) | (128) | 192 

The expected capacity needs reflect the mix of energy efficiency programs deemed cost effective in the 2017 IRP. PSE projects that beginning in 2022 its future energy needs will exceed current resources in its supply portfolio because of the retirement of Colstrip Units 1 and 2, approximately 307 MW of capacity.  Therefore, PSE’s IRP sets forth a multi-part strategy of implementing energy efficiency programs and pursuing additional renewable resources and additional capacity resources such as battery storage and generation plants that operate during peak loads.  If PSE cannot acquire needed energy supply resources at a reasonable cost, it may be required to purchase additional power in the wholesale market. These purchases are subject to the sharing bands of the PCA mechanism, at a cost that could, in the absence of regulatory relief, increase its expenses and reduce earnings and cash flows.

Natural Gas Supply for Natural Gas Customers
PSE purchases a portfolio of natural gas supplies ranging from long-term firm to daily from a diverse group of major and independent natural gas producers and marketers in the United States and Canada (British Columbia and Alberta).  PSE also enters into physical and financial hedges to manage volatility in the cost of natural gas.  All of PSE’s natural gas supply is ultimately transported through the facilities of Northwest Pipeline, LLC (NWP), the sole interstate pipeline delivering directly into PSE’s service territory.  Accordingly, delivery of natural gas supply to PSE’s natural gas system is dependent upon the reliable operations of NWP.
For base load, peak management and supply reliability purposes, PSE supplements its firm natural gas supply portfolio by purchasing natural gas in periods of lower demand, injecting it into underground storage facilities and withdrawing it during the peak winter heating season.  Underground storage facilities at Jackson Prairie in western Washington and at Clay Basin in Utah are used for this purpose.  Clay Basin withdrawals are used to supplement purchases from the U.S. Rocky Mountain supply region, while Jackson Prairie provides incremental peak-day resources utilizing firm storage redelivery transportation capacity.  Jackson Prairie is also used for daily balancing of load requirements on PSE’s natural gas system.  Peaking needs are also met by using PSE-owned natural gas held in PSE’s LNG peaking facility located within its distribution system in Gig Harbor, Washington; as well as interrupting service to customers on interruptible service rates, if necessary.
PSE expects to meet its firm peak-day requirements for residential, commercial and industrial markets through its firm natural gas purchase contracts, firm transportation capacity, firm storage capacity and other firm peaking resources.  PSE believes it will be able to acquire incremental firm natural gas supply and capacity to meet anticipated growth in the requirements of its firm customers for the foreseeable future.
During 2017, PSE purchased approximately 54.8% of its natural gas for its natural gas customers in British Columbia, 19.1% in Alberta and 26.1% in the United States.  PSE’s firm natural gas supply portfolio has adequate flexibility in its transportation arrangements to enable it to achieve savings when there are regional price differentials between natural gas supply basins.  The geographic mix of suppliers and daily, monthly and annual take requirements permit some degree of flexibility in managing natural gas supplies during periods of lower demand to minimize costs.  Natural gas is marketed outside of PSE’s service territory (off-system sales) to optimize resources when on-system customer demand requirements permit and market economics are favorable; the resulting economics of these transactions are reflected in PSE’s natural gas customer tariff rates through the PGA mechanism.
Natural Gas Storage Capacity
PSE holds storage capacity in the Jackson Prairie and Clay Basin underground natural gas storage facilities adjacent to NWP’s pipeline to serve PSE’s natural gas customers.  The Jackson Prairie facility is operated and one-third owned by PSE and is used primarily for intermediate peaking purposes due to its ability to deliver a large volume of natural gas in a short time period.  Combined with capacity contracted from NWP’s one-third stake in Jackson Prairie, PSE holds firm withdrawal capacity of 453,800 Dekatherm (Dth) per day, and over 9.8 million Dth of storage capacity at the Jackson Prairie facility. Of this total, PSE holds 397,100 Dth per day of the firm withdrawal capacity and over 9.2 million Dth of storage capacity designated to serve natural gas customers. The location of the Jackson Prairie facility in PSE’s market area increases supply reliability and provides significant pipeline demand cost savings by reducing the amount of annual pipeline capacity required to meet peak-day natural gas requirements.   
Of the remaining Jackson Prairie storage capacity, 56,700 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 640,600 Dth of storage capacity is currently designated to PSE's power portfolio, increasing natural gas supply reliability and facilitating intra-day dispatch of PSE's natural gas-fired generation resources. In addition, PSE has temporarily released approximately 6,100 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity and 178,500 of Dth of storage capacity to a third party, in exchange for temporary firm pipeline capacity on a constrained portion of NWP's system.
The Clay Basin storage facility is a supply area storage facility that provides operational flexibility and price protection.  PSE holds 12.9 million Dth of Clay Basin storage capacity and approximately 107,400 Dth per day of firm withdrawal capacity under two long-term contracts with remaining terms of two and three years and has rights to extend such agreements.  PSE has temporarily released a portion of its Clay Basin storage services to third parties, and its net storage capacity and maximum firm withdrawal capacity at Clay Basin is 8.9 million Dth and over 74,000 Dth per day, respectively.
LNG and Propane-Air Resources
LNG and propane-air resources provide firm natural gas supply on short notice for short periods of time.  Due to their typically high cost and slow cycle times, these resources are normally utilized as a last resort supply source in extreme peak-demand periods, typically during the coldest hours or days.
During 2014, PSE, working with NWP determined that the pipeline redelivery service to PSE from NWP’s Plymouth LNG facility could no longer be considered firm during peak conditions. As a result, PSE terminated the service agreement effective October 31, 2015 and removed the resource from its natural gas firm portfolio. In 2015, PSE and NWP negotiated a new contract for Plymouth LNG service for PSE’s generation fleet, which provides for LNG storage services of 241,700 Dth of PSE-owned 
20

natural gas at Plymouth, with a maximum daily deliverability of 70,500 Dth.  PSE will use the Plymouth contract as an alternate supply source for natural gas required to serve PSE’s generation fleet during peak periods on a daily or intra-day basis. In addition, PSE acquired 15,000 Dth/day of firm pipeline capacity from Plymouth for the generation fleet. The balance of the LNG capacity will be delivered using firm NWP pipeline transportation service previously acquired to serve PSE’s generation fleet.
PSE owns and operates the Swarr vaporized propane-air station located in Renton, Washington which includes storage capacity for approximately 1.5 million gallons of propane.  This vaporized propane-air injection facility delivers the thermal equivalent of 10,000 Dth of natural gas per day for up to 12 days directly into PSE’s distribution system; however, it is temporarily not in-service pending planned environmental, safety, efficiency and reliability upgrades.  PSE owns and operates an LNG peaking facility in Gig Harbor, Washington, with total capacity of 10,600 Dth, which is capable of delivering the equivalent of 2,500 Dth of natural gas per day. 
Tacoma LNG Facility
 Currently under construction at the Port of Tacoma, the Tacoma LNG facility is expected to be operational in 2019. On January 24, 2018, the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency’s determined a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement is necessary in order to rule on the air quality permit for the facility. As a result of requiring a Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement, the Company's construction schedule may be impacted depending on the Puget Sound Clean Air Agency's timing and decision on the air quality permit. If delayed, the construction schedule and costs may be adversely impacted. The Tacoma LNG facility will provide peak-shaving services to PSE’s natural gas customers, and will provide LNG as fuel to transportation customers, particularly in the marine market. Pursuant to the Washington Commission’s order, PSE will be allocated 43.0% of the capital and operating costs, consistent with the regulated portion of the Tacoma LNG facility and Puget LNG will be allocated the remaining 57.0% of the capital and operating costs. The portion of the Tacoma LNG facility allocated to PSE will be subject to regulation by the Washington Commission. 
Natural Gas Transportation Capacity
PSE currently holds firm transportation capacity on pipelines owned by NWP, Gas Transmission Northwest (GTN), Nova Gas Transmission (NOVA), Foothills Pipe Lines (Foothills) and Enbridge Westcoast Energy (Westcoast).  GTN, NOVA, and Foothills are all TransCanada companies.  PSE pays fixed monthly demand charges for the right, but not the obligation, to transport specified quantities of natural gas from receipt points to delivery points on such pipelines each day for the term or terms of the applicable agreements.
PSE holds approximately 542,900 Dth per day of capacity for its natural gas customers on NWP that provides firm year-round delivery to PSE’s service territory.  In addition, PSE holds approximately 447,100 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored at Jackson Prairie to natural gas customers.  PSE holds approximately 217,900 Dth per day of firm transportation capacity on NWP to supply natural gas to its electric generating facilities.  In addition, PSE holds over 34,200 Dth per day of seasonal firm capacity on NWP to provide for delivery of natural gas stored in Jackson Prairie for its electric generating facilities. PSE’s firm transportation capacity contracts with NWP have remaining terms ranging from 2 to 27 years.  However, PSE has either the unilateral right to extend the contracts under the contracts’ current terms or the right of first refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules.
PSE’s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on Westcoast’s pipeline is 135,800 Dth per day under various contracts, with remaining terms of two to six years.  PSE has other firm transportation capacity on Westcoast’s pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 88,400 Dth per day, with remaining terms of three to six years and an option for PSE to renew its rights under the Westcoast contract.  PSE has firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, each totaling approximately 79,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of three to six years and an option for PSE to renew its rights on the capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines.  PSE has other firm transportation capacity on NOVA and Foothills pipelines, which supplies the electric generating facilities, each totaling approximately 41,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of three to six years. PSE’s firm transportation capacity for its natural gas customers on the GTN pipeline, totaling over 77,000 Dth per day, with remaining terms of six years and PSE has a first right-of-refusal to extend such contracts under current FERC rules. PSE has other firm transportation capacity on GTN pipeline, which supplies the electric generating facilities, totaling 40,600 Dth per day, with remaining terms of three to six years.
Capacity Release
The FERC regulates the release of firm pipeline and storage capacity for facilities which fall under its jurisdiction.  Capacity releases allow shippers to temporarily or permanently relinquish unutilized capacity to recover all or a portion of the cost of such capacity.  The FERC allows capacity to be released through several methods including open bidding and pre-arrangement.  PSE has acquired some firm pipeline and storage service through capacity release provisions to serve its growing service territory and electric generation portfolio.  PSE also mitigates a portion of the demand charges related to unutilized storage and pipeline capacity 
21

through capacity release.  Capacity release benefits derived from the natural gas customer portfolio are passed on to PSE’s natural gas customers through the PGA mechanism.
Energy Efficiency
PSE is required under Washington state law to pursue all available conservation that is cost-effective, reliable and feasible. PSE offers programs designed to help new and existing residential, commercial and industrial customers use energy efficiently.  PSE uses a variety of mechanisms including cost-effective financial incentives, information and technical services to enable customers to make energy efficient choices with respect to building design, equipment and building systems, appliance purchases and operating practices. PSE recovers the actual costs of its electric and natural gas energy efficiency programs through rider mechanisms. However, the rider mechanisms do not provide assistance with gross margin erosion associated with reduced energy sales. To address this issue, PSE received approval in 2017 from the Washington Commission for continuation of electric and natural gas decoupling mechanisms, which mitigates gross margin erosion resulting from the Company's energy efficiency efforts.
Environment
PSE’s operations, including generation, transmission, distribution, service and storage facilities, are subject to environmental laws and regulations by federal, state and local authorities.  See below for the primary areas of environmental law that have the potential to most significantly impact PSE’s operations and costs.
Air and Climate Change Protection
PSE owns numerous thermal generation facilities, including natural gas plants and an ownership percentage of Colstrip.  All of these facilities are governed by the Clean Air Act (CAA), and all have CAA Title V operating permits, which must be renewed every five years.  This renewal process could result in additional costs to the plants. PSE continues to monitor the permit renewal process to determine the corresponding potential impact to the plants. These facilities also emit greenhouse gases (GHG), and thus are also subject to any current or future GHG or climate change legislation or regulation.  The Colstrip plant represents PSE’s most significant source of GHG emissions.
Species Protection
PSE owns hydroelectric plants, wind farms and numerous miles of above ground electric distribution and transmission lines which can be impacted by laws related to species protection.  A number of species of fish have been listed as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), which influences hydroelectric operations, and may affect PSE operations, potentially representing cost exposure and operational constraints.  Similarly, there are a number of avian and terrestrial species that have been listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA or are protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act or the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act.  Designations of protected species under these laws have the potential to influence operation of our wind farms and above ground transmission and distribution systems.
Remediation 
PSE and its predecessors are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites.  These include properties currently and formerly owned by PSE (or its predecessors), as well as third-party owned properties where hazardous substances were allegedly generated, transported or released.  The primary cleanup laws to which PSE is subject include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (federal) and, in Washington, the Model Toxics Control Act (state).  PSE is also subject to applicable remediation laws in the state of Montana for its ownership interest in Colstrip. These laws may hold liable any current or past owner or operator of a contaminated site, as well as any generator, transporter, arranger, or disposer of regulated substances.
Hazardous and Solid Waste and PCB Handling and Disposal
Related to certain operations, including power generation and transmission and distribution maintenance, PSE must handle and dispose of certain hazardous and solid wastes.  These actions are regulated by the Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (federal), the Toxic Substances Control Act (federal) and hazardous or dangerous waste regulations (state) that impose complex requirements on handling and disposing of regulated substances.
Water Protection
PSE facilities that discharge wastewater or storm water or store bulk petroleum products are governed by the Clean Water Act (federal and state) which includes the Oil Pollution Act amendments.  This includes most generation facilities (and all of those 
22

with water discharges and some with bulk fuel storage), and many other facilities and construction projects depending on drainage, facility or construction activities, and chemical, petroleum and material storage.
Mercury Emissions
Mercury control equipment has been installed at Colstrip and has operated at a level that meets the current Montana requirement.  Compliance, based on a rolling twelve-month average, was first confirmed in January 2011, and PSE continues to meet the requirement.
The EPA published the final Mercury and Air Toxics Standard (MATS) in February 2012. Generating units were given three years, until April 2015, to comply with MATS and could receive up to a 1-year extension from state permitting authorities if necessary for the installation of controls. Colstrip met the MATS limits for mercury and acid gases as of April 2017. 
Siting New Facilities
In siting new generation, transmission, distribution or other related facilities in Washington, PSE is subject to the State Environmental Policy Act, and may be subject to the federal National Environmental Policy Act, if there is a federal nexus, in addition to other possible local siting and zoning ordinances.  These requirements may potentially require mitigation of environmental impacts as well as other measures that can add significant cost to new facilities.
Recent and Future Environmental Law and Regulation
Recent and future environmental laws and regulations may be imposed at a federal, state or local level and may have a significant impact on the cost of PSE operations.  PSE monitors legislative and regulatory developments for environmental issues with the potential to alter the operation and cost of our generation plants, transmission and distribution system, and other assets.  Described below are the recent, pending and potential future environmental law and regulations with the most significant potential impacts to PSE’s operations and costs.
Climate Change and Greenhouse Gas Emissions
PSE recognizes the growing concern that increased atmospheric concentrations of GHG contribute to climate change.  PSE believes that climate change is an important issue that requires careful analysis and considered responses.  As climate policy continues to evolve at the state and federal levels, PSE remains involved in state, regional and federal policymaking activities. PSE will continue to monitor the development of any climate change or climate change related air emission reduction initiative at the state and western regional level.  PSE has considered the known impact of any future legislation or new government regulation on the cost of generation in its IRP process.
PSE's Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting
PSE is required to submit, on an annual basis, a report of its GHG emissions to the state of Washington including a report of emissions from all individual power plants emitting over 10,000 tons per year of GHGs and from certain natural gas distribution operations.  Emissions exceeding 25,000 tons per year of GHGs from these sources must also be reported to the environmental protection agency (EPA). Capital investments to monitor GHGs from the power plants and in the distribution system are not required at this time.  Since 2002, PSE has voluntarily undertaken an annual inventory of its GHG emissions associated with PSE’s total electric retail load served from a supply portfolio of owned and purchased resources.  
The most recent data indicate that PSE’s total GHG emissions (direct and indirect) from its electric supply portfolio in 2016 were 10.8 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents.  Approximately 43.0% of PSE’s total GHG emissions (approximately 4.6 million metric tons) are associated with PSE’s ownership and contractual interests in Colstrip. PSE’s overall emissions strategy demonstrates a concerted effort to manage customers’ needs with an appropriate balance of new renewable generation, existing generation owned and/or operated by PSE and significant energy efficiency efforts.
Federal Greenhouse Gas Rules
On August 3, 2015, the EPA announced a final rule regarding New Source Performance Standard (NSPS) for the control of carbon dioxide (CO2) from new power plants that burn fossil fuels under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act. The rule was published on October 23, 2015, and separates standards for new power plants fueled by natural gas and coal. New natural gas power plants can emit no more than 1,000 lbs. of CO2/megawatt hour (MWh) which is achievable with the latest combined cycle technology. New coal power plants can emit no more than 1,400 lbs. of CO2/MWh, which is less stringent than the draft rule. The standard for coal plants would not specifically require Carbon Dioxide Capture and Sequestration (CCS) but CCS was reaffirmed by the EPA as the “best system of emission reductions” (BSER). These 111(b) standards are implemented by the states, but states have limited flexibility to alter the standards set by the EPA.

 The EPA announced the final rule for 111(d), the Clean Power Plan rule, on August 3, 2015 and published it on October 23, 2015. On October 10, 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal this rule and will accept comments until April 26, 2018. As such, PSE is monitoring the situation and awaiting the final determination by the EPA. 
Washington Clean Air Rule
The Clean Air Rule (CAR) was adopted on September 15, 2016 in Washington State and attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from “covered entities” located within Washington State. Included under the new rule are large manufacturers, petroleum producers and natural gas utilities, including PSE. CAR sets a cap on emissions associated with covered entities, which decreases over time approximately 5.0% every three years. Entities must reduce their carbon emissions, or purchase emission reduction units (ERUs), as defined under the rule, from others. 
CAR covers natural gas distributors and subjects them to an emissions reduction pathway based on the indirect emissions of their customers. CAR regulates the emissions of natural gas utilities 1.2 million customers across the state, adding to the cost of natural gas for homes and businesses, which may increase costs to PSE customers. 
On September 27, 2016, PSE, along with Avista Corporation, Cascade Natural Gas Corporation and NW Natural, filed an action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington challenging CAR. On September 30, 2016, the four companies filed a similar challenge to CAR in Thurston County Superior Court. On December 15, 2017, the Thurston County Superior Court invalidated the CAR. A final court order is pending and in the meantime, the Washington State Department of Ecology, submitted a brief requesting severability, which would make the rule valid for industries with direct emissions. This would apply to the Company's electric utility thermal generation units but not to its natural gas utility. Appeals could be filed to the Thurston County Court of Appeals after the court's final order, including its ruling on severability.
Regional Haze Rule
On January 10, 2017, the EPA provided revisions to the Regional Haze Rule which were published in the Federal Register. Among other things, these revisions delayed new Regional Haze review from 2018 to 2021; however, the end date will remain 2028. Aspects of these revisions are currently being challenged by various entities nationwide and briefing has not yet been scheduled. In the meantime, the state of Montana has indicated plans to work on and submit a State Implementation Plan for the second planning period.
Coal Combustion Residuals
On April 17, 2015, the EPA published a final rule, effective October 19, 2015, that regulates Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR's) under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, Subtitle D. The EPA issued another rule, effective October 4, 2016, extending certain compliance deadlines under the CCR rule. The CCR rule is self-implementing at a federal level or can be taken over by a state. The rule addresses the risks from coal ash disposal, such as leaking of contaminants into ground water, blowing of contaminants into the air as dust, and the catastrophic failure of coal ash containment structures by establishing technical design, operation and maintenance, closure and post closure care requirements for CCR landfills and surface impoundments, and corrective action requirements for any related leakage. The rule also sets forth recordkeeping and reporting requirements, including posting specific information related to CCR surface impoundments and landfills to publicly-accessible websites.
The CCR rule requires significant changes to the Company's Colstrip operations and those changes were reviewed by the Company and the plant operator in the second quarter of 2015. PSE had previously recognized a legal obligation under the EPA rules to dispose of coal ash material at Colstrip in 2003. Due to the CCR rule, additional disposal costs were added to the Asset Retirement and Environmental Obligations (ARO).
PCB Handling and Disposal
In April 2010, the EPA issued an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking soliciting information on a broad range of questions concerning inventory, management, use, and disposal of polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) containing equipment.  The EPA is using this Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to seek data to better evaluate whether to initiate a rulemaking process geared toward a mandatory phase-out of all PCBs.
The rule was scheduled to be published in July 2015 but due to the number of comments received by the EPA, the rule has undergone multiple extensions and revisions. It was anticipated that the rule would be published in November 2017. However on January 30, 2017 the Trump Administration published the Executive Order on Reducing Regulation and Controlling Regulatory Costs directive which placed the rulemaking on indefinite hold. At this point, PSE cannot determine what impacts this rulemaking will have on its operations, if any, but will continue to work closely with the Utility Solid Waste Activities Group and the American Gas Association (AGA) to monitor developments.
