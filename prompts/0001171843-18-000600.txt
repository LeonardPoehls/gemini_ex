ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.
--------+----------

Introduction and Company Background
 
Crystal Rock Holdings, Inc., incorporated in Delaware in 1990, is engaged in the production, marketing and distribution of bottled water (the Crystal Rock® and Vermont Pure® brands) and the distribution of coffee including our Cool Beans® brand, ancillary products and other office refreshment products, and office products under the Crystal Rock Office® brand. We operate primarily as a distribution business to homes and offices, using our own trucks for distribution throughout New England, New York, and New Jersey.
 
Our distribution sales and services evolved from our initial business, sales of bottled water and cooler rentals. We bottle our water and also have it bottled for us. Our water products are primarily still, non-sparkling waters. We also have branded sparkling waters. In addition to water and related services, our other significant food and drink offerings have grown to include distribution of coffee and ancillary products, and other refreshment products including soft drinks and snacks. To a lesser extent, we distribute these products through third party distributors.
 
Water
 
Bottled water is a mainstream beverage and the centerpiece of many consumers’ healthy living lifestyles. Sales of bottled water accounted for 47% of our total sales in fiscal year 2017 and 43% in 2016. We believe that the development of the bottled water industry has for many years reflected public awareness of the potential contamination and unreliability of some municipal water supplies. Conversely, bottled water has periodically been the focus of publicity regarding concerns about the possibly adverse environmental effects of using plastic bottles, as well as the effect on the environment of water extraction and the production. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information.
Coffee
 
Coffee, a product that is counter seasonal to water, is the second leading product in the distribution channel, accounting for 18% of our total sales in fiscal year 2017 and 17% of our total sales in fiscal year 2016. We sell different brands and sizes of coffee products. We continue to promote our Cool Beans® brand coffee in an effort to increase profitability and create brand equity in the coffee category. Because coffee is a commodity, coffee sales are affected by volatility in the world commodity markets. An interruption in supply or a dramatic increase in pricing could have an adverse effect on our business.
 
A large proportion of our coffee sales are single-serve coffee products. These products have become more prevalent in the marketplace over the last decade, and changes in distribution play a significant role in the availability and profitability of these products.
 
Refreshment and Equipment Rental
 
Ancillary products, such as soft drinks and snacks, accounted for 14% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2017 and 15% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2016. Equipment rentals, primarily water coolers, made up 12% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2017 and 11% of our total revenues in fiscal year 2016.

Office Products
 
In fiscal 2011, we added office products to our product offerings. We grew the office product line in an effort to diversify our product sales to existing office customers. However, we determined that sales of some office products generated low margins for us, so beginning in late fiscal 2015, we emphasized growth efforts on our core water products. As a result, the contribution to total revenues from office products in fiscal 2017 decreased to 6% of total revenues in fiscal 2017 from 11% in fiscal 2016.
Other Revenue
 
Fees that are charged to offset energy costs for delivery and freight, raw materials, and bottling operations primarily make up the balance of our revenue. This comprised 3% of our total sales in fiscal years 2017 and 2016.
Water Sources, Treatment, and Bottling Operations
 
Water from local municipalities is the primary source for the Crystal Rock Waters® brand in three- and five-gallon bottles. In fiscal 2017, this accounted for 67% of our water bottled in these types of containers. Municipal water is purified through a number of processes beginning with filtration. Utilizing carbon and ion exchange filtration systems, we remove chlorine and other volatile compounds and dissolved solids. After the filtration process, impurities are removed by reverse osmosis and/or distillation. Prior to bottling, we add pharmaceutical grade minerals to the water, including calcium, potassium, and magnesium for taste. The water is ozonated (by injecting ozone into the water as an agent to inhibit the formation of bacteria) and bottled in a fully enclosed clean room with a high efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filtering system designed to prevent any airborne contaminants from entering the bottling area, in order to create a sanitary filling environment.
 
If for any reason the municipal sources for Crystal Rock® water were curtailed or eliminated, we could, though probably at greater expense, purchase water from other sources and have it shipped to our manufacturing facilities.
 
The main source of our natural spring water (primarily sold under the Vermont Pure® brand) is a spring owned by a third party in Stockbridge, Vermont that is subject to a 50-year water supply contract, approximately 32 years of which remain. We also obtain water, under a similar agreement with a third party, from a spring in Bennington, Vermont. These springs are approved by the State of Vermont as sources for natural spring water. The contractual terms for these springs provide spring water in excess of our current needs and within the apparent capacity of the springs, and accordingly we believe that we can readily meet our bulk water supply needs for the foreseeable future. Water from these springs accounted for 33% of our total water bottled in fiscal 2017.
 
Percolation through the earth's surface is nature's best filter of water. We believe that the age and extended percolation period of our natural spring water provides it with certain distinct attributes: a purer water, noteworthy mineral characteristics (including the fact that the water is sodium free and has a naturally balanced pH), and a light, refreshing taste.
 
An interruption in or contamination of any of our spring sites would materially affect our business. We believe that we could find adequate supplies of bulk spring water from other sources, but that we might suffer inventory shortages or inefficiencies, such as increased purchase or transportation costs, in obtaining such supplies.

We are highly dependent on the integrity of the sources and processes by which we derive our products. Natural occurrences beyond our control, such as drought, flood, earthquake or other geological changes, a change in the chemical or mineral content or purity of the water, or environmental pollution may affect the amount and quality of the water available from the springs or municipal sources that we use. There is a possibility that characteristics of the product could be changed either inadvertently or by tampering before consumption. Even if such an event were not attributable to us, the product’s reputation could be irreparably harmed. Consequently, we would experience economic hardship. Occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse impact on our business. We are also dependent on the continued functioning of our bottling processes. An interruption could result in an inability to meet market demand and/or negatively affect the cost to bottle the products.
 
We also bottle and distribute other brands of water for third parties. These sales account for 4% of our bottled water sales.
 
We have no material contractual commitments to the owners of our outside sources and bottling facilities other than for the products and services we receive.
 
We use outside trucking companies to transport bulk spring water from the source site to our bottling facilities.
 
Products
 
Water, Coffee, and Refreshment and Ancillary Equipment
 
We sell our Crystal Rock® and Vermont Pure® water brands in three- and five-gallon bottles to homes and offices throughout New England, New York, and New Jersey. In general, Crystal Rock® is distributed in southern New England and New York, while Vermont Pure® is primarily distributed throughout northern New England and secondarily in southern New England and New York. We rent and sell water coolers to customers to dispense bottled water. Our coolers are available in various consumer preferences such as cold, or hot and cold, dispensing units. In addition, we sell and rent units to commercial accounts that filter water from the existing source on site. We also rent and sell coffee brewing equipment and distribute a variety of coffee, tea and other hot beverage products and related supplies, as well as other consumable products used around the office. We own the Cool Beans® brand of coffee, which we distribute throughout our market area. In addition to Cool Beans®, we sell other brands of coffee, most notably, Baronet and Keurig Green Mountain.
 
Our extensive distribution system and large customer lists afford us the opportunity to introduce new products that may benefit our current customers or appeal to new customers. From time to time, we may capitalize on these opportunities by expanding our product lines or replacing existing products with new ones. In response to the increasingly competitive sales environment, we will consider distributing new products that we believe may enhance our sales and profitability.
 
Office Products Line 
 
We have been distributing office products under the Crystal Rock Office® brand since 2011. Recognizing the value inherent in our distribution system, we do not maintain large inventories of office products. Rather, we primarily purchase office products from large national vendors such as S. P. Richards that provide just-in-time delivery, with the result that the introduction of our office product line has not resulted, and is not expected to result, in a material outlay of resources to accommodate increased inventory. The broader range of office products compliments our product offerings to existing office customers who purchase our water and coffee products. Competition in the traditional office products markets has resulted in lower margins in this product line.

We believe that we have a well-established distribution system and that the Crystal Rock® family of brands is well known in the regions in which we operate, and we hope to leverage those advantages successfully. Nevertheless, price competition in the office product market can be robust, and there can be no assurance that our office products strategy will be successful. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information.
 
Marketing and Sales of Branded Products
 
Crystal Rock products are marketed and distributed under four house brands: Crystal Rock Waters®, Vermont Pure Natural Spring Water®, Cool Beans® Coffee and Crystal Rock Office®. Through this combination of brands – and resale of other manufactured brands – we provide a choice of high quality products and value-added services to homes and offices.
 
Both our water brands feature three- and five-gallon premium bottled water in addition to a small pack case offerings. Our coffee line includes over 70 varieties in many different types of packaging. Additionally, we also re-sell other coffee and tea selections.  Our office products line features over 40,000 products, including supplies, equipment, and furniture, targeted for small and medium-sized business.
 
Over the last several years, we have diversified our product offerings and focused our efforts on sales and marketing in order to increase sales across all of our product lines and enhance the value of our distribution system and customer base. Initially, we hired and trained an expanded sales force and incurred significant expenditures to build an IT infrastructure designed to enhance sales administration and run our business more efficiently. Late in 2013, we decided to shift the infrastructure platform that we had been constructing to one we had acquired during the year. For more information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” In 2014, we worked to stabilize our IT and e-commerce platforms while growing our office product sales revenues. Subsequently, during fiscal 2015, we experienced significant losses through the first three quarters, due in large part to lower than desired margins on office products, which led to a reduction in the number of full-time employees. In the latter part of fiscal 2015 and during fiscal 2016, we focused more heavily on strategic pricing taking into account the value provided with our quality products and integrated services. Our goal is to avoid competing based on price and focus on customers who want more regularly scheduled route deliveries. These changes have produced higher gross margins as a percentage of sales; however, sales decreases have impacted the gross margin dollars resulting in lower operating income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016.
 
We support our marketing and sales efforts through a number of channels, including e-commerce, direct mail, internet advertising, traditional advertising, social media, sales collateral, email marketing, digital/internet technologies, referrals and public relations.  We also sponsor local area sporting events, participate in trade shows, maintain high community visibility, and donate to many charitable organizations and events.
 
We market our home and office delivery service throughout most of New England, New York and parts of New Jersey.  A combination of telemarketers and sales personnel sell our products and services. We also maintain an internal marketing department that works closely with a professional marketing agency who together develop and manage our brands and market position. Our goal is to optimize our marketing and sales returns through efficient technology investments, personal customer interactions and maintaining consistent visibility.

Advertising and Promotion
 
We advertise our products through a digital, online strategy focused on promoting expanded product and services, and we look to collect customer data in order to engage and market customer relationships both on and offline. Through a combination of websites, social platforms and internet advertising, we are centralizing and transitioning our marketing efforts to offer and incentivize current and new customers through a larger online presence while providing customers a direct purchasing capability. We also promote our products through sales collateral, direct mail, various public relations and sponsorship opportunities. We endeavor to be highly visible in the communities that we serve. We have been a significant sponsor of a United Way giving campaign to support Live United through the Greater Waterbury Connecticut United Way, and we feature local giving options to support the United Way throughout our entire market area. We also support charities devoted to the treatment and cure of multiple sclerosis, and Peter and John Baker sit on a number of charitable boards.
Sales and Distribution
 
We sell and deliver products directly to our customers using our own employees and route delivery trucks.  Deliveries to customers are made on a regularly scheduled basis for water, coffee, and ancillary products. We accommodate our customers with next day delivery when they run out of those products and for office products.  We bottle our water at our facilities in Watertown, Connecticut, White River Junction, Vermont, and Halfmoon, New York and have water bottled for us in Buffalo and Endicott, New York.  We maintain numerous distribution locations throughout our market area.  From these locations, we also distribute dispensing equipment, a variety of coffee, tea and other refreshment products, and related supplies.  We receive office supplies, equipment, and furniture on a “just-in-time” basis from our vendors at our distribution locations. We ship between our production and distribution sites using both our own and contracted carriers.
Supplies
 
We currently source all of our raw materials from outside vendors. As one of the largest Home and Office distributors in the country, we are able to capitalize on volume to continue to reduce costs.
 
We rely on trucking to receive raw materials and to transport and deliver our finished products. Consequently, the fluctuating fuel prices significantly affect the cost of our products. We purchase our own fuel for our Home and Office delivery and use third parties for transportation of raw materials and finished goods between our warehouses. While volume purchases can help control erratic fuel pricing, market conditions ultimately determine the price. In the past, we have experienced substantial market fluctuation of fuel prices.  However, fuel prices have become more stable recently, and our regular customers pay a minimum monthly fuel charge. The risk remains that we may not be able to use fuel price adjustments to cover the cost of fuel increases in a volatile market for petroleum products, which could adversely affect our profitability.
 
Our principal coffee suppliers are Keurig Green Mountain and Baronet Coffee. Our principal bottle supplier is Parker Plastics.
 
No assurance can be given that we will be able to obtain the supplies we require on a timely basis or that we will be able to obtain them at prices that allow us to maintain the profit margins we have had in the past. We believe that we will be able to either renegotiate contracts with these suppliers when they expire or, alternatively, if we are unable to renegotiate contracts with our key suppliers, we believe that we could replace them. Any raw material disruption or price increase may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition and prospects. For instance, we could incur higher costs in renegotiating contracts with existing suppliers or replacing those suppliers, or we could experience temporary dislocations in our ability to deliver products to our customers, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.

Seasonality
 
Our business is seasonal. The period from June to September, when we have our highest water sales, represents the peak period for sales and revenues due to increased consumption of cold beverages during the summer months in our core Northeastern United States market. Conversely, coffee has a peak sales period from November to March. Sales of office products and supplies fluctuate during the year.
Competition
 
We believe that bottled water historically has been a regional business in the United States. The market includes several large regional brands owned by multi-national companies that operate throughout contiguous states. We also compete with smaller, locally-owned bottlers that operate in specific cities or market areas within single states.
 
With our Crystal Rock®, Vermont Pure® and Cool Beans® brands, we compete on the basis of pricing, customer service, quality of our products, attractive packaging, and brand recognition. We consider our trademarks, trade names and brand identities to be very important to our competitive position and defend our brands vigorously.
 
We feel that installation of filtration units in the home or commercial setting poses competition to our business. To address this, we have continued to develop our plumbed-in filtration business expanding it internally and through acquisitions and actively offering it as an alternative product to our bottled water.
 
Traditionally, the rental of water coolers for offices and homes has been a profitable business for us. As coolers have become cheaper and more readily available at retail outlets and with increased promotional pricing in the marketplace, our cooler rental revenue has declined. Although this rental revenue is profitable for us, it may continue to decline or become less profitable in the future as a result of retail competition.
 
Coffee product sales have dramatically shifted to sales of single serve packages. We face increased competition for sales of these products from retail stores and home delivery options from other food and beverage distributors, office products distributors and retail outlets. In addition, internet availability has increased, leading to sales declines for coffee products.
 
Machines to brew these single serve packages are different from traditional machines, and packages ideally need to be brewed in machines that accommodate the specific package. As a result, the popularity of a certain machine often dictates what products are successful in the marketplace. We have developed our own Cool Beans® pod in order to create brand equity in this category. Our success, both from a sales and profitability perspective, may be affected by our access to distribution rights for certain products and machines, our decisions concerning which equipment to invest in and our ability to develop brand awareness.

We believe that it has become increasingly important to our competitive advantage to decrease the impact of our business on the environment. We traditionally use five-gallon containers that are placed on coolers and are reused many times. To further “green” our business we generate solar electricity in our Watertown, Connecticut facility, use high efficiency lighting and vehicles and have instituted no-idling and other driving policies in all of our locations.
 
The office products business is highly competitive. Companies like Staples, Office Depot and W.B. Mason are larger and have greater capital resources than Crystal Rock and compete with us on price as well as level of service. Moreover, the evolution of modern business practices towards the “paperless office” could have the effect of reducing the available market for some office products. If the overall market for office products contracts, price competition can be expected to exert pressure on our margins for office products, with potential adverse effects on our earnings or cash flow, even if we are able to continue increasing revenues from this product line. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for more information.
 
Trademarks
 
We own the trade names of the principal water brands that we sell, Vermont Pure Natural Spring Water® and Crystal Rock®. We also own the Cool Beans® coffee brand, Crystal Rock Office® products brand and own or have rights to other trade names that currently are not a significant part of our business. Our trademarks as well as label designs are, in general, registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office.
Government Regulation
 
The Federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates bottled water as a “food.” Accordingly, our bottled water must meet FDA requirements of safety for human consumption, of processing and distribution under sanitary conditions and of production in accordance with the FDA “good manufacturing practices.” To assure the safety of bottled water, the FDA has established quality standards that address the substances that may be present in water which may be harmful to human health as well as substances that affect the smell, color and taste of water. These quality standards also require public notification whenever the microbiological, physical, chemical or radiological quality of bottled water falls below standard. The labels affixed to bottles and other packaging of the water is subject to FDA restrictions on health and nutritional claims for foods under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. In addition, all drinking water must meet Environmental Protection Agency standards established under the Safe Drinking Water Act for mineral and chemical concentration and drinking water quality and treatment that are enforced by the FDA.
 
We are subject to the food labeling regulations required by the Nutritional Labeling and Education Act of 1990. We believe we are in compliance with these regulations.
 
We are subject to periodic, unannounced inspections by the FDA. Upon inspection, we must be in compliance with all aspects of the quality standards and good manufacturing practices for bottled water, the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, and all other applicable regulations that are incorporated in the FDA quality standards. We believe that we meet the current regulations of the FDA, including the classification as spring water. All of our plants and distribution locations are registered with the FDA under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002. In December 2009, the FDA put into effect the Bottled Water Microbial Rule to monitor water sources for E. coli bacteria. We have been in compliance with the testing requirements for this rule prior to and since its inception.

We also must meet state regulations in a variety of areas to comply with purity, safety, and labeling standards. From time to time, our facilities and sources are inspected by various state departments and authorities.
 
Our product labels are subject to state regulation (in addition to federal requirements) in each state where the water products are sold. These regulations set standards for the information that must be provided and the basis on which any therapeutic claims for water may be made.
 
We use a comprehensive program of self-regulation and use third party auditors for testing and inspections to evaluate our compliance with federal and various state regulations.
 
In recent years, there has been legislative and executive action in state and local governments that has or would ban the use of bottled water in municipal buildings, enact local taxes on bottled water, and limit the sale by municipalities of water supplies to private companies for resale. Such regulation could adversely affect our business and financial results. For additional information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” below.
 
The laws that regulate our activities and properties are subject to change. As a result, there can be no assurance that additional or more stringent requirements will not be imposed on our operations in the future. Although we believe that our water supply, products and bottling facilities are in substantial compliance with all applicable governmental regulations, failure to comply with such laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Employees
 
As of January 10, 2018, we had 285 full-time employees and 9 part-time employees. None of the employees belongs to a labor union. We believe that we have good standing relationships with our employees.
