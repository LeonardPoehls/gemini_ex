Revlon is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the Company, "MacAndrews & Forbes"), a corporation wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman. 
The Company was founded over 85 years ago by Charles Revson, who revolutionized the cosmetics industry by introducing nail enamels matched to lipsticks in fashion colors. Today, the Company continues Revson's legacy by producing and marketing innovative products that address consumers' wants and needs for beauty and personal care products.
The Company operates in four reporting segments: the consumer division (“Consumer”); the professional division (“Professional”); Elizabeth Arden; and Other.

Our Business Strategy for Value Creation
Our strategy is based on three key pillars:
Strengthen Our Portfolio of Brands. The Company intends to continue to develop the leadership and aspiration for our flagship brands; Revlon, Elizabeth Arden and Almay. The Company is continuing to develop our product offerings across beauty segments with a focus on large and/or fast growing categories. We are leveraging our creativity, insights and agility to accelerate innovation to develop trend-relevant and first-of-its kind beauty solutions. We aim to delight our customers with high performing products, superior services and unique experiences that exceed their expectations. And we will continue to communicate our brands' heritage, expertise and purpose to create authentic, meaningful and lasting connections with consumers of all ages. 
Strategically Expand Consumer's Access to Our Brands. The Company is taking steps to ensure that consumers have real-time access to our brands wherever and however they shop for beauty. We are strengthening and diversifying our channels, especially direct to consumer. We are accelerating our development in high-growth channels, with a focus on specialty e-commerce and m-commerce. Our goal is to continue to win in traditional channels (including mass, drug, selective and department stores) and expand our combined reach into travel retail. The Company is taking actions to strengthen its position in the U.S., to ensure our growth base, and expand into untapped geographic regions, with a focus on growth in Asia.
Develop a Cost Structure That Fuels Investment in Our Brands. The Company aims to grow profitably, improve its operating performance and align its strategic investments behind the biggest growth opportunities and innovation that differentiates our brands. We continue to improve our category mix by shifting toward higher gross margin categories (e.g., skin care and fragrance) and we aim to reduce product returns, markdowns and inventory levels. Our objective is to optimize resource allocation.
Recent Transactions
The Elizabeth Arden Acquisition
On the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, the Company completed the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition for a total cash purchase price of $1,034.3 million, pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger (the "Merger Agreement") by and among Revlon, Products Corporation, RR Transaction Corp. ("Acquisition Sub," then a wholly-owned subsidiary of Products Corporation), and Elizabeth Arden. On the Acquisition Date, Elizabeth Arden merged (the “Merger”) with and into Acquisition Sub, with Elizabeth Arden surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Products Corporation. The Company anticipates achieving growth through opportunities presented by the combined company’s expanded sales channels and geographies, a broadened product portfolio and cost synergy opportunities. The results of operations of Elizabeth Arden are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date. For the net sales and segment profit related to Elizabeth Arden operations for the period from the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date through December 31, 2016, refer to the Elizabeth Arden segment disclosure in Note 19, "Segment Data and Related Information."
In December 2016, in connection with integrating the Elizabeth Arden and Revlon organizations, the Company determined to begin the process of implementing certain integration activities, including consolidating offices, eliminating certain duplicative activities and streamlining back-office support, (the “EA Integration Restructuring Program”). The EA Integration Restructuring Program is designed to reduce the Company’s selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses. As a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 350 positions worldwide and expects to recognize approximately $65 million to $75 million of total pre-tax restructuring and related charges (the “EA Integration Restructuring Charges”), consisting of: (i) approximately $40 million to $50 million of employee-related costs, including severance, retention and other contractual termination benefits; (ii) approximately $15 million of lease termination costs; and (iii) approximately $10 million of other related charges.
As a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, as well as other actions related to integrating the Elizabeth Arden organization into the Company’s business, the Company has identified annualized synergies and cost reductions of approximately $190 million. The approximately $190 million of expected annualized synergies and cost reductions are expected to be generated over a multi-year period, with approximately 90% expected to be achieved by the end of 2020. For 2016, the Company realized approximately $3 million of these annualized cost reductions, which primarily benefited the Elizabeth Arden segment results.
See Note 2, "Business Combinations," and Note 3, "Restructuring Charges - EA Integration Restructuring Program," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details on the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and the EA Integration Restructuring Program.

Cutex businesses ("Cutex International") from Coty Inc. (the "Cutex International Acquisition"), which primarily operate in Australia and the United Kingdom (the "U.K."), and related assets for total cash consideration of $29.1 million. Following the Company's October 2015 acquisition of the Cutex business and related assets in the U.S. (the "Cutex U.S. Acquisition"), combined with other Cutex businesses that the Company acquired in 1998, the Cutex International Acquisition completed the Company's global consolidation of the Cutex brand, enhancing and complementing the Company's existing portfolio of nail care products. The Cutex International results of operations are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the Cutex International Acquisition Date. See Note 2, "Business Combinations," to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10-K for further details related to the Cutex International Acquisition.
Debt-Related Transactions
In connection with and substantially concurrently with the closing of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into (i) a 7-year $1,800.0 million senior secured term loan facility (the “2016 Term Loan Facility” and such agreement being the “2016 Term Loan Agreement”); and (ii) a 5-year $400.0 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility,” with such agreement being the “2016 Revolving Credit Facility Agreement” and together with the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, the "2016 Credit Agreements" and with the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility together with the 2016 Term Loan Facility, being the “2016 Senior Credit Facilities”). As part of financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, in August 2016, Products Corporation also completed the issuance of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024 (the “6.25% Senior Notes” and the “6.25% Senior Notes Offering,” respectively), which funds were released from escrow on the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date. In connection with entering into the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, Products Corporation maintained on the 2016 Term Loan Facility its existing floating-to-fixed 2013 Interest Rate Swap (as hereinafter defined) based on a notional amount of $400 million that previously applied to Products Corporation’s Old Acquisition Term Loan (as defined below), which loan was refinanced in full in connection with Products Corporation's consummation of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 6.25% Senior Notes Offering. 
The proceeds of Products Corporation's 6.25% Senior Notes Offering and the 2016 Term Loan Facility, together with approximately $35.0 million of borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and approximately $126.7 million of cash on hand, were used: (A) to fund the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition including: (i) repurchasing the entire $350.0 million aggregate principal amount outstanding of Elizabeth Arden's then-existing Senior Notes (the "Elizabeth Arden Senior Notes"); (ii) repaying the entire $142.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden’s $300.0 million revolving credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); (iii) repaying the entire $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's second lien credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); and (iv) retiring the entire $55.0 million liquidation preference of all 50,000 shares of Elizabeth Arden's issued and outstanding preferred stock (which amount included a $5.0 million change of control premium); and (B) to completely refinance and repay all of the $651.4 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation’s then-existing 2011 term loan (the "2011 Term Loan") and all of the $658.6 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation’s 2013 term loan that was incurred in connection with completing the Colomer Acquisition (each of which facilities were terminated upon such repayment) (the "Old Acquisition Term Loan" and together with the 2011 Term Loan, the "Old Term Loan Agreement" and the "Old Term Loan Facility," respectively). The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with repaying the Old Term Loan Facility or the Elizabeth Arden indebtedness and preferred stock. 
In February 2016, Products Corporation prepaid $23.2 million of indebtedness, then outstanding under the Old Term Loan Facility, representing 50% of its 2015 “excess cash flow” as defined by, and as required under, the Old Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Old Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $11.5 million to $651.4 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $11.7 million that was applied to the Old Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments such loan on a ratable basis from $6.9 million prior to the prepayment to $6.8 million after giving effect to the prepayment.
See Part II, Item 7 - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources – Long-Term Debt Instruments” for further discussion of the above debt transactions.

The Company also utilizes specialty laboratories and manufacturers in its supply chain for the development of certain new products, such as fragrances and skin care.

The Company’s global sourcing strategy for materials and components from qualified vendors is also designed to ensure that the Company maintains a continuous supply of high quality raw materials and components.

Disruptions at this facility and/or at other Company or third party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured for its Consumer, Elizabeth Arden and Professional segments, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.”)
Distribution

The Company utilizes a dedicated sales force in those countries where the Company maintains operations, and also utilizes sales representatives and independent distributors to serve certain territories and retailers. (See Item 1A. “Risk Factors - The Company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales, and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce the Company's net sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows” and "Competition in the beauty industry could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.")
United States.

The Elizabeth Arden and Red Door trademarks are also licensed to a third party in which the Company has a minority interest for the operation of the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa beauty salons and spas through which Elizabeth Arden products are sold and which also enables the Company to leverage the unique Red Door Spa heritage to generate both organic and innovation-driven growth. As of December 31, 2016, 11 of such licenses were in effect for 21 categories of beauty- and fashion-related products and services. Pursuant to such licenses, the Company retains strict control over product design and development, product and service quality, advertising and the use of its trademarks. These licensing arrangements offer opportunities for the Company to generate revenues and cash flow through royalties and renewal fees, some of which are prepaid from time to time. 
In the Consumer segment, the Company’s retail merchandisers stock and maintain the Company's point-of-sale wall displays intended to ensure that high-selling SKUs are in stock and to ensure the optimal presentation of the Company's products in retailers. The Company’s products within its Professional segment are sold primarily through wholesale beauty supply distributors in the U.S. The Company's products within its Elizabeth Arden segment are sold through prestige retailers, the mass retail channel, perfumeries, boutiques, department and specialty stores, travel retailers and distributors, as well as direct sales to consumers via its Elizabeth Arden branded retail stores and e-commerce business. Elizabeth Arden products are also sold through the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa beauty salons and spas. 
Outside of the United States. Net sales outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 46% of the Company's 2016 net sales. The three countries outside the U.S. with the highest net sales were Spain, the U.K. and Canada, which together accounted for approximately 13% of the Company's 2016 net sales. The Company distributes its products within its Consumer segment through large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries. The Company’s products within its Professional segment are sold directly to hair and nail salons by the Company's direct sales force in countries where it has operations and through distributors in other countries outside the U.S. The Company's products

REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES

within the Elizabeth Arden segment are sold to perfumeries, boutiques, department and specialty stores, travel retailers and distributors.
At December 31, 2016, the Company actively sold its products through wholly-owned subsidiaries established in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and through a large number of independent distributors and licensees elsewhere around the world.
Customers 
The Company's principal customers for its Consumer segment include large volume retailers and chain drug stores, including such well-known retailers as Walmart, CVS and Target in the U.S., Shoppers DrugMart in Canada, A.S. Watson & Co. retail chains in Asia Pacific and Europe and Walgreens Boots Alliance in the U.S. and the U.K. Walmart and its affiliates worldwide accounted for approximately 17% of the Company's 2016 consolidated net sales. The Company's principal customers for its Professional segment include Beauty Systems Group, Salon Centric and Ulta Salon, Cosmetics & Fragrance, as well as individual hair and nail salons and other distributors to professional salons. The Company's principal customers for its Elizabeth Arden segment include prestige retailers, specialty stores and department stores such as Macy’s, Dillard’s, Ulta, Belk, Sephora, Bloomingdales and Nordstrom; U.S. mass retailers, including large volume and mid-tier retailers and chain drug stores, such as Walmart, Target, Kohl’s, Walgreens, CVS, and TJ Maxx and Marshalls; and international retailers, including prestige retailers, specialty stores, department stores, perfumeries and boutiques, such as Boots, Debenhams, Superdrug Stores, The Perfume Shop, Hudson’s Bay, Shoppers Drug Mart, Myer, Douglas and various travel retailers such as Nuance, Heinemann and World Duty Free. As is customary in the industry, none of the Company’s customers is under an obligation to continue purchasing products from the Company in the future.
The Company expects that Walmart and a small number of other customers will, in the aggregate, continue to account for a large portion of the Company's net sales. (See Item 1A. Risk Factors - "The Company depends on a limited number of customers for a large portion of its net sales, and the loss of one or more of these customers could reduce the Company's net sales and have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.”)
Competition
The Company's cosmetics, fragrance, skin care, hair and beauty care products business categories are highly competitive. The Company competes primarily by: 

• | developing quality products with innovative performance features, shades, finishes, components and packaging;


• | educating consumers and salon professionals about the benefits of the Company’s products;


• | anticipating and responding to changing consumer and salon professional demands in a timely manner, including the timing of new product introductions and line extensions;


• | offering attractively priced products relative to the product benefits provided;


• | maintaining favorable brand recognition;


• | generating competitive margins and inventory turns for its customers in both the Consumer and Professional segments by providing relevant products and executing effective pricing, incentive and promotional programs and marketing campaigns;


• | ensuring product availability through effective planning and replenishment collaboration with retailers and salons;


• | providing strong and effective advertising, marketing, promotion and merchandising support;


• | leveraging e-commerce and mobile commerce initiatives;


• | maintaining an effective sales force and distributor network; and


• | obtaining and retaining sufficient retail display and floor space, optimal in-store positioning and effective presentation of its products at retail and in salons.

The Company competes in selected product categories against numerous multi-national manufacturers in both the Consumer and Professional segments, as well as with expanding private label and store-owned brands in the Consumer segment. In addition to products sold in large volume retailers, distributors, wholesalers, professional salons and demonstrator-assisted retailers, the Company's products also compete with products sold in prestige and department stores, television shopping, door-to-door, specialty stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, the Internet/e-commerce, perfumeries and other distribution outlets. The Company's

Government Regulation
The Company is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") in the U.S., as well as various other federal, state, local and foreign regulatory authorities, including those in the European Union (the "EU"), Canada and other countries in which the Company operates. The Company’s Oxford, North Carolina manufacturing facility is registered with the FDA as a drug manufacturing establishment, permitting the manufacture of cosmetics and other beauty-care products that contain over-the-counter drug ingredients, such as sunscreens, anti-perspirant deodorants and anti-dandruff hair-care products. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, has not had, and is not anticipated to have, a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Regulations in the U.S., the EU, Canada and in other countries in which the Company operates that are designed to protect consumers or the environment have an increasing influence on the Company's product claims, ingredients and packaging. (See “Risk Factors - The Company’s products are subject to federal, state and international regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.”)

Item 1. Financial Statements
1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Revlon, Inc. ("Revlon" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") conducts its business exclusively through its direct wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation ("Products Corporation"), and its subsidiaries. Revlon is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the Company, "MacAndrews & Forbes"), a corporation wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman. The Company is a leading global beauty company with an iconic portfolio of brands. The Company develops, manufactures, markets, distributes and sells an extensive array of color cosmetics, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, fragrances, skin care, beauty tools, men’s grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants and other beauty care products across a variety of distribution channels. The Company is building a combined organization that is entrepreneurial, agile and boldly creative, with a passion for beauty. The Company has strategic brand builders developing a diverse portfolio of iconic brands that delight consumers around the world wherever and however they shop for beauty. The Company strives to be an ethical company that values inclusive leadership and is committed to sustainable and responsible growth. The Company operates in four reporting segments: the consumer division (“Consumer”); the professional division (“Professional”); Elizabeth Arden; and Other. The Company’s principal customers for its products in the Consumer segment include large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetics stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally. The Company's principal customers for its products in the Professional segment include hair and nail salons and distributors to professional salons in the U.S. and internationally. 
On September 7, 2016 (the "Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of Elizabeth Arden, Inc. ("Elizabeth Arden" and the “Elizabeth Arden Acquisition”). Elizabeth Arden is a global prestige beauty products company with an iconic portfolio of brands that are highly complementary to the Company's existing brand portfolio and are sold worldwide. The Company's principal customers for its products in the Elizabeth Arden segment include prestige retailers, the mass retail channel, perfumeries, boutiques, department and specialty stores, travel retailers and distributors, as well as direct sales to consumers via Elizabeth Arden branded retail stores and e-commerce business. Elizabeth Arden products are also sold through the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa beauty salons and spas. The operating results and purchase accounting for the Company's Elizabeth Arden Acquisition are presented in the Elizabeth Arden segment. Refer to Note 2, "Business Combinations," for further details related to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.
Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to the Company mean Revlon and its subsidiaries. Revlon as a public holding company, has no business operations of its own and owns, as its only material asset, all of the outstanding capital stock of Products Corporation. As such, its net income/(loss) has historically consisted predominantly of the net income/(loss) of Products Corporation, and in 2016, 2015 and 2014 included $9.4 million, $9.0 million and $9.8 million, respectively, in expenses incidental to being a public holding company. 
The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company's accounts after the elimination of all material intercompany balances and transactions. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
The preparation of the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements in the period they are determined to be necessary. Significant estimates made in the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include, but are not limited to, allowances for doubtful accounts, inventory valuation reserves, expected sales returns and allowances, trade support costs, certain assumptions related to the valuation of acquired intangible and long-lived assets and the recoverability of goodwill, intangible and long-lived assets, income taxes, including deferred tax valuation allowances and reserves for estimated tax liabilities, restructuring costs, certain estimates and assumptions used in the calculation of the net periodic benefit (income) costs and the projected benefit obligations for the Company’s pension and other post-retirement plans, including the expected long-term return on pension plan assets and the discount rate used to value the Company’s pension benefit obligations. 
Discontinued Operations Presentation
As a result of the Company's decision on December 30, 2013 to exit its direct manufacturing, warehousing and sales business operations in mainland China within the Consumer segment, the Company has reported the results of its former China operations

within (loss) income from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for all periods presented. See Note 4, "Discontinued Operations," for further discussion.
Cash and Cash Equivalents:
Cash equivalents are primarily investments in high-quality, short-term money market instruments with original maturities of three months or less and are carried at cost, which approximates fair value. Cash equivalents were $2.5 million and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accounts payable include $19.3 million and $19.5 million of outstanding checks not yet presented for payment at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Trade Receivables:
Trade receivables represent payments due to the Company for previously recognized net sales, reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts for balances which are estimated to be uncollectible at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business to its customers. Trade credit is extended based upon periodically updated evaluations of each customer's ability to perform its payment obligations. The Company does not normally require collateral or other security to support credit sales. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical experience and ongoing evaluations of the Company's receivables and evaluations of the risks of payment. The allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded against trade receivable balances when they are deemed uncollectible. Recoveries of trade receivables previously reserved are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income when received. At each of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company's three largest customers accounted for an aggregate of approximately 27% of the Company's outstanding trade receivables. 
Inventories:
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost is based on standard cost and production variances, which approximates actual cost on the first-in, first-out method. Cost components include direct materials, direct labor and direct overhead, as well as in-bound freight. The Company records adjustments to the value of inventory based upon its forecasted plans to sell products included in inventory, as well as planned product discontinuances. The physical condition (e.g., age and quality) of the inventories is also considered in establishing its valuation. These adjustments are estimates, which could vary significantly, either favorably or unfavorably, from the amounts that the Company may ultimately realize upon the disposition of inventories if future economic conditions, customer inventory levels, product discontinuances, sales return levels or competitive conditions differ from the Company's estimates and expectations. 
Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Assets:
Property, plant and equipment is recorded at cost and is depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets as follows: land improvements, 20 to 30 years; buildings and improvements, 5 to 50 years; machinery and equipment, 3 to 15 years; counters and trade fixtures, 3 to 5 years; office furniture and fixtures, 3 to 15 years; and capitalized software, 2 to 10 years. Leasehold improvements and building improvements are amortized over their estimated useful lives or the terms of the leases or remaining life of the original structure, respectively, whichever is shorter. Repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred, and expenditures for additions and improvements are capitalized. Counters and trade fixtures are amortized over their estimated useful life of the in-store counter and display related assets. The estimated useful life may be subject to change based upon declines in net sales and/or changes in merchandising programs. See Note 7, “Property, Plant and Equipment," for further discussion.
Included in other assets are permanent wall displays amounting to $64.1 million and $65.6 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which are amortized generally over a period of 1 to 3 years. In the event of product discontinuances, from time to time, the Company may accelerate the amortization of related permanent wall displays based on the estimated remaining useful life of the asset. Amortization expense for permanent wall displays was $47.8 million, $41.3 million and $42.5 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company capitalizes deferred financing costs related to the issuance of its revolving credit facilities, which costs were $6.0 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and amortizes such costs over the terms of the related debt instruments using the effective-interest method. 
Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, the Company estimates the undiscounted future cash flows (excluding interest) resulting from the use of the asset and its ultimate disposition. If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows (excluding interest) is less than the carrying value, the Company recognizes an impairment loss, measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset. There were no significant impairment charges to long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Goodwill:
Goodwill represents the excess purchase price for businesses acquired over the fair value of net assets acquired. Goodwill is not amortized, but rather is reviewed annually for impairment at the reporting unit level using October 1st carrying values, or when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the Company’s carrying amount may not be recovered.
For 2016, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment test performed during the fourth quarter using October 1, 2016 carrying values, the Company performed qualitative assessments to determine whether it would be necessary to perform the two-step process, as prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification ("ASC") 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, to assess the Company's goodwill for indicators of impairment. In performing the qualitative assessments, the Company determined that for the Revlon, Almay and Other and Professional reporting units, it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts. 
The Company determined it would utilize the two-step process to test the Global Color Brands ("GCB") and Other reporting units for impairment. In the first step of this test, the Company compared the fair values of the GCB and Other reporting units, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the carrying amounts of each reporting unit, including goodwill. The fair value of the GCB reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount and therefore no further impairment testing was performed and no impairment loss was indicated. The carrying amount of the Other reporting unit exceeded its fair value and the goodwill of the reporting unit was considered potentially impaired. The Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for its Other reporting unit to measure the amount of such unit's impairment loss. As a result of the annual impairment test for 2016, the Company recognized a $16.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the Other reporting unit.
For 2015, the Company utilized the two-step process in assessing whether goodwill was impaired for each of the Company's four reporting units. In the first step of this test, the Company compared the fair value of each of the Company's four reporting units, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the carrying amount of such reporting unit, including goodwill. Where the fair value of such reporting unit exceeded the carrying amount, no further impairment testing was required and no impairment loss was indicated. Where the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit was considered potentially impaired and the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of the impairment loss. As a result of the annual impairment test for 2015, the Company recognized a $9.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the Global Color Brands reporting unit.
For 2014, the Company performed qualitative assessments to determine whether it would be necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test and to assess the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets for indicators of impairment, and in each case determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of the Company's reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeded their carrying amounts for such reporting years. The Company did not record any impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of its annual impairment test. 
See Note 2, “Business Combinations,” and Note 8, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” for further discussion of the Company's goodwill and annual impairment test.
Intangible Assets, net:
Intangible Assets, net, include trade names and trademarks, customer relationships, patents and internally developed intellectual property ("IP") and acquired licenses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets, consisting of certain trade names, are not amortized, but rather are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter using October 1, 2016 carrying values, similar to goodwill, and the Company recognizes an impairment if the carrying amount of its intangible assets exceeds its fair value. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values. The Company writes off the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization for intangible assets in the year in which the asset becomes fully amortized. Finite-lived intangible assets are considered for impairment upon the occurrence of certain “triggering events” and the Company recognizes an impairment if the carrying amount of the long-lived asset group exceeds the Company's estimate of the asset group's undiscounted future cash flows. As a result of the annual impairment test (described above), the Company also recognized a $6.7 million non-cash intangible assets impairment charge in the fourth quarter of 2016 related to the Other reporting unit. There was no impairment of intangible assets in 2015 or 2014.
See Note 2, “Business Combinations,” and Note 8, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” for further discussion of the Company's intangible assets, including a summary of finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets.

Revenue Recognition and Sales Returns: 
The Company's policy is to recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable. The Company records revenue from the sale of its products when risk of loss and title to the products transfers to the customer. Net sales are comprised of gross revenues less expected product returns, trade discounts and customer allowances, which include costs associated with off-invoice mark-downs and other price reductions, as well as trade promotions and coupons. These incentive costs are recognized at the later of the date on which the Company recognizes the related revenue or the date on which the Company offers the incentive. 
The Company allows customers to return their unsold products if and when they meet certain Company-established criteria as set forth in the Company's trade terms. The Company regularly reviews and revises, when deemed necessary, its estimates of sales returns based primarily upon the historical rate of actual product returns, planned product discontinuances, new product launches and estimates of customer inventory and promotional sales. The Company records sales returns as a reduction to sales and cost of sales, and an increase to accrued liabilities and inventories. Returned products, which are recorded as inventories, are valued based upon the amount that the Company expects to realize upon their subsequent disposition. The physical condition and marketability of the returned products are the major factors considered by the Company in estimating their realizable value. 
Revenues derived from licensing arrangements, including any pre-payments, are recognized in the period in which they are earned, but not before the initial license term commences.
Cost of Sales: 
Cost of sales includes all of the costs to manufacture the Company's products. For products manufactured in the Company's own facilities, such costs include raw materials and supplies, direct labor and factory overhead. For products manufactured for the Company by third-party contractors, such cost represents the amounts invoiced by the contractors. Cost of sales also includes the cost of refurbishing products returned by customers that will be offered for resale and the cost of inventory write-downs associated with adjustments of held inventories to their net realizable value. These costs are reflected in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income when the product is sold and net sales revenues are recognized or, in the case of inventory write-downs, when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of inventories is in excess of their recoverable value. Additionally, cost of sales reflects the costs associated with any free products included as sales and promotional incentives. These incentive costs are recognized on the later of the date that the Company recognizes the related revenue or the date on which the Company offers the incentive.
Selling, General and Administrative Expenses: 
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses to advertise the Company's products, such as television advertising production costs and air-time costs, print advertising costs, digital marketing costs, promotional displays and consumer promotions. SG&A expenses also include the amortization of permanent wall displays and finite-lived intangible assets, depreciation of certain fixed assets, distribution costs (such as freight and handling), non-manufacturing overhead (principally personnel and related expenses), selling and trade educations fees, insurance and professional service fees.
Advertising:
Advertising within SG&A expenses includes television, print, digital marketing and other advertising production costs which are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. The costs of promotional displays are expensed in the period in which they are shipped to customers. Advertising expenses were $421.1 million, $368.7 million and $383.2 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and were included in SG&A expenses in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income. The Company also has various arrangements with customers pursuant to its trade terms to reimburse them for a portion of their advertising costs, which provide advertising benefits to the Company. Additionally, from time to time, the Company may pay fees to customers in order to expand or maintain shelf space for its products. The costs that the Company incurs for "cooperative" advertising programs, end cap placement, shelf placement costs, slotting fees and marketing development funds, if any, are expensed as incurred and are recorded as a reduction within net sales.
Distribution Costs:
Costs associated with product distribution, such as freight and handling costs, are recorded within SG&A expenses when incurred. Distribution costs were $98.4 million, $80.2 million and $84.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Income Taxes:
Income taxes are calculated using the asset and liability method. Under this method, the Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. The Company measures deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in 
F-11

REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The Company recognizes the effect of a change in income tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized.
The Company recognizes a tax position in its financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, based on the merits of such position. The Company recognizes liabilities for unrecognized tax positions in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on an estimate of whether and the extent to which additional taxes will be due. If payment of these amounts is ultimately not required, the reversal of the liabilities would result in additional tax benefits recognized in the period in which the Company determines that the liabilities are no longer required. If the estimate of tax liabilities is ultimately less than the final assessment, this will result in a further charge to expense. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.
Research and Development:
Research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred and included within SG&A expenses. The amounts charged in 2016, 2015 and 2014 for research and development expenditures were $37.0 million, $31.2 million and $31.6 million, respectively.
Foreign Currency Translation:
Assets and liabilities of foreign operations, whose functional currency is the local currency, are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the weighted average exchange rates prevailing during each period presented. Gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the results of operations. Gains and losses resulting from translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries and branches operating in non-hyperinflationary economies are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss until either the sale or upon the complete or substantially complete liquidation by the Company of its investment in a foreign entity. To the extent that foreign subsidiaries and branches operate in hyperinflationary economies, non-monetary assets and liabilities are translated at historical rates and translation adjustments are included in the Company's results of operations.
Basic and Diluted Earnings per Common Share and Classes of Stock:
Shares used in basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Shares used in diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect of unvested restricted shares under the stock plan using the treasury stock method. (See Note 20, "Basic and Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per Common Share").
Stock-Based Compensation: 
The Company recognizes stock-based compensation costs for its restricted stock, measured at the fair value of each award at the time of grant, as an expense over the period during which an employee is required to provide service. Upon the vesting of restricted stock, any resulting tax benefits are recognized in additional paid-in-capital. Any resulting tax deficiencies are recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive (loss) income as tax expense to the extent that the tax deficiency amount exceeds any existing additional paid-in-capital resulting from previously realized excess tax benefits from previous awards. The Company reflects such excess tax benefits as cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
Derivative Financial Instruments: 
The Company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations. The Company uses derivative financial instruments, including: (i) foreign currency forward exchange contracts (“FX Contracts”) intended for the purpose of managing foreign currency exchange risk by reducing the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s net cash flows; and (ii) interest rate hedging transactions intended for the purpose of managing interest rate risk associated with Products Corporation’s variable rate indebtedness.
Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts 
Products Corporation enters into FX Contracts primarily to hedge the anticipated net cash flows resulting from inventory purchases and intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company’s foreign and domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. The Company does not apply hedge accounting to its FX Contracts. The Company records FX Contracts in its consolidated balance sheet at fair value and immediately recognizes changes in fair value in earnings. Fair value of the Company’s FX Contracts is determined by using observable market transactions of spot and forward rates. See Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” for further discussion of the Company's FX Contracts.
Interest Rate Swap 
As a result of the Company completing several debt transactions in connection with the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the critical terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap (as hereinafter defined) no longer matched the terms of the underlying debt and the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was determined to no longer be highly effective. Accordingly, the Company discontinued hedge accounting

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

for the 2013 Interest Rate Swap during the third quarter of 2016. Following the de-designation of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, changes in the fair value of the Interest Rate Swap are accounted for as a component of other non-operating expenses. Accumulated deferred losses on the 2013 Interest Rate Swap of $4.9 million, or $3.0 million net of tax, at December 31, 2016 that were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into earnings over the remaining term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap.  See Note 13, “Financial Instruments,” for further discussion of the Company's 2013 Interest Rate Swap. Refer to Note 11, "Long-Term Debt," for further details related to financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and related debt restructuring transactions.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements 
 In November 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-17, "Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes," which requires deferred income tax assets and liabilities to be classified as noncurrent within a company's balance sheet. Under previous guidance, the Company was required to separate deferred income tax assets and liabilities into current and noncurrent amounts. Netting deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities by tax jurisdiction is still required under ASU 2015-17. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-17 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the Company's previously recorded deferred tax assets were adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU No. 2015-17. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-17 resulted in no adjustment to the Company’s results of operations and stockholders’ deficiency and had the following impact on the previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015 and the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for 2015 and 2014:

Consolidated Balance Sheet | Total as reported at 12/31/2015 | | Adjustment | | Total as adjusted at 12/31/2015
Deferred income taxes - current | $ | 58.0 | | | $ | (58.0 | ) | | $ | — | 
Deferred income taxes - noncurrent | 40.3 | | | 31.0 | | | 71.3 |

Decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities | (22.2 | ) | | (0.1 | ) | | (22.3 | )
Increase in other, net | 1.1 | | | 7.3 | | | 8.4 | 

In September 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-16, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Simplifying the Accounting for Measurement Period Adjustments," which eliminated the requirement for an acquirer in a business combination to account for measurement-period adjustments retrospectively. Instead, acquirers must recognize measurement-period adjustments during the period in which they determine such adjustments, including the effect on earnings of any amounts they would have recorded in previous periods if the accounting had been completed at the acquisition date. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-16 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.
In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-03, "Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs," which requires debt issuance costs to be presented in the financial statements as a deduction from the corresponding debt liability, consistent with the presentation of debt discounts. This guidance became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption permitted, and is applied retrospectively. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-03 beginning on January 1, 2016 and the Company's previously recorded other assets and long-term debt were adjusted to reflect the adoption of ASU No. 2015-03. The adoption of ASU No. 2015-03 resulted in no adjustment to the Company’s results of operations, cash flows and stockholders’ deficiency and had the following impact on the Company's previously reported Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2015:

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, "Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern," that explicitly requires management to assess an entity's ability to continue as a going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures if conditions give rise to substantial doubt. According to ASU No. 2014-15, substantial doubt exists if it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its obligations within one year after the financial statement's issuance date. The likelihood threshold of "probable," similar to its current use in U.S. GAAP for loss contingencies, is used to define substantial doubt. Disclosures are required under ASU No. 2014-15 if conditions give rise to substantial doubt, including whether and how management's plans will alleviate the substantial doubt. This guidance became effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, with early adoption prohibited. The Company adopted ASU No. 2014-15 beginning January 1, 2016 and the adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, “Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment,” which simplifies the annual goodwill impairment analysis test by eliminating Step 2 of the current two-step impairment test. Under this new guidance, an entity would continue to perform the first step of the annual impairment test by comparing the carrying amount of a reporting unit with its fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, the goodwill impairment charge would be equal to the amount of such difference. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2017-04 beginning as of January 1, 2020 and is in the process of assessing the impact that this new guidance is expected to have on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash,” which provides specific guidance on the presentation of changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents on the statement of cash flows. Under this new standard, the changes in restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents will be required to be disclosed in reconciling the opening and closing balances on the statement of cash flows. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2016-18 beginning as of January 1, 2018 and is in the process of assessing the impact that this new guidance is expected to have on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Classification of Certain Receipts and Cash Payments,” which aims to standardize how certain transactions are classified within the Statement of Cash Flows, including, among other issues, debt prepayment and extinguishment costs and contingent consideration payments made after a business combination. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2016-15 beginning as of January 1, 2018 and is in the process of assessing the impact that this new guidance is expected to have on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.
In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,” which simplifies certain aspects of accounting for share-based payment transactions, including transactions in which an employee uses shares to satisfy the employer’s minimum statutory income tax withholding obligation, forfeitures and income taxes when awards vest or are settled. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-09 beginning as of January 1, 2017 and expects that this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.
In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, "Leases (Topic 842)," which requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a liability on the balance sheet for all leases, with the exception of short-term leases. The lease liability will be equal to the present value of lease payments and the right-of-use asset will be based on the lease liability, subject to adjustment such as for initial direct costs. Leases will continue to be classified as either operating or finance leases in the income statement. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. The Company expects to adopt ASU No. 2016-02 beginning as of January 1, 2019 and is in the process of assessing the impact that this new guidance is expected to have on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.

In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, "Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory," which simplifies the subsequent measurement of inventories by requiring inventory to be measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, rather than at the lower of cost or market. Net realizable value is defined as the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. This guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted ASU No. 2015-11 beginning as of January 1, 2017 and expects that this new guidance will not have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and/or financial statement disclosures.
In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”. This new standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective. The underlying principle of this new standard is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Entities may adopt this new standard either retrospectively for all periods presented in the financial statements (i.e., the full retrospective method) or as a cumulative-effect adjustment as of the date of adoption (i.e., the modified retrospective method), without applying to comparative years’ financial statements.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Deferral of the Effective Date,” which allows for a deferral of the adoption date for ASU No. 2014-09 until January 1, 2018 and permits early adoption of ASU No. 2014-09, but not before the effective date of January 1, 2017. 
The Company plans to adopt ASU No. 2014-09 on January 1, 2018 and anticipates adopting this standard using the modified retrospective method. The Company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that ASU No. 2014-09 will have on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and financial statement disclosures. While the Company is continuing to assess all impacts of ASU No. 2014-09, it currently believes the most significant areas potentially impacted by this new standard relate to its accounting for customer incentives and cooperative advertising. The Company expects to complete its evaluation of the impact of adopting ASU No. 2014-09 in 2017 and will provide further updates in future periods.

Purchase Price Allocation
The Company accounted for the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition as a business combination during the third quarter of 2016 and, accordingly, the total consideration of $1,034.3 million has been preliminary recorded based on the respective estimated fair values of the net assets acquired on the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date with resulting goodwill, as follows: 

 | Amounts recognized at September 7, 2016(Provisional)(a) | | Measurement Period Adjustments | | Amounts recognized at September 7, 2016(Adjusted)

(a) As previously reported in Revlon's third quarter 2016 Form 10-Q.
(b) The Measurement Period Adjustments to inventories during the three months ended December 31, 2016 relate to: (i) further evaluations of the inventory components at the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, which resulted in a $16.6 million decrease in value of Elizabeth Arden's inventory on the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date; and (ii) a $2.6 million decrease in the step-up for the estimated fair value of Elizabeth Arden’s inventory, which was determined based upon the estimated selling price of the inventories less the remaining manufacturing and selling costs and normal profit margin on those manufacturing and selling efforts, based upon the adjusted acquisition date value. Following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the step-up in fair value will increase cost of sales over approximately seven months, as the acquired inventory is sold. For 2016, the Company recognized a $20.7 million charge within cost of sales related to this step-up.
(c) Deferred tax assets acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition primarily relate to approximately $107.3 million of tax loss carryforwards which the Company preliminarily estimates it will be able to realize in future periods, of which $0.5 million are foreign and $106.8 million are domestic (federal).
(d) The Measurement Period Adjustments to intangible assets during the three months ended December 31, 2016 relate to a change in the fair value of acquired customer relationships and license agreement intangible assets, which increased the fair value of acquired customer relationship intangible assets by $6.0 million and decreased the fair value of acquired license agreement intangible assets by $2.0 million due to the decrease in the estimated fair value of Elizabeth Arden's inventory, as discussed above.
(e) The Measurement Period Adjustments to other assets during the three months ended December 31, 2016 relate to a change in assumptions used to calculate the fair value of Elizabeth Arden’s minority investment in Elizabeth Arden Salon-Holdings, Inc., an unrelated party whose subsidiaries operate the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spas and the Mario Tricoci Hair Salons, which resulted in a decrease in the estimated fair value of the from $20.3 million to $16.2 million.
The fair values of the net assets acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition were based on management’s preliminary estimate of the respective fair values of Elizabeth Arden’s net assets. The estimated fair values of net assets and resulting goodwill are subject to the Company finalizing its analysis of the fair value of Elizabeth Arden’s assets and liabilities as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date and may be adjusted upon completion of such analysis. In addition, information unknown at the time of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition could result in adjustments to the respective fair values and resulting goodwill within the year following the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date.

REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

In determining the fair values of net assets acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and resulting goodwill, the Company considered, among other factors, the analyses of Elizabeth Arden's historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business, as well as the intended use of the acquired assets.
The estimated fair value of the accounts receivable acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition was determined to be $132.6 million. The gross amount due was $165.0 million and the Company estimates that approximately $32.4 million was uncollectible.
The estimated fair value of inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition was determined using the income approach, specifically, the net realizable value ("NRV") approach, which calculates the estimated selling price of such inventory in the ordinary course of business, less the reasonable costs of completion, disposal and holding. The estimated fair value of acquired property and equipment was determined using the cost approach.
The intangible assets acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition based on the estimate of the fair values of the identifiable intangible assets are as follows:

 | Amounts Recognized at September 7, 2016 | | Remaining Useful Life at the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date(in years)
Trademarks, indefinite-lived | $ | 142.0 | | | Indefinite
Trademarks, finite-lived | 15.0 | | | 15.0
Technology | 2.5 | | | 10.0
Customer relationships | 123.0 | | | 16.0
License agreements | 22.0 | | | 19.0
Distribution rights | 31.0 | | | 18.0
Favorable lease commitments | 1.3 | | | 3.0 
Total acquired intangible assets | $ | 336.8 | | | 

The estimate of the fair values of acquired indefinite-lived and finite-lived trade names and technology IP was determined using a risk-adjusted discounted cash flow approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method. The relief-from-royalty method requires identifying the hypothetical cash flows generated by an assumed royalty rate that a third party would pay to license the trade names and IP, and discounting them back to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date. The royalty rate used in such valuation was based on a consideration of market rates for similar categories of assets. The indefinite-lived trade names includes the Elizabeth Arden brand trade name. The finite-lived trade names includes, among others, owned heritage fragrance trade names such as Curve, Halston and Giorgio Beverly Hills and the Prevage skin care brand. 
The estimate of the fair value of the customer and distributor relationships and distribution rights acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition were determined using a risk-adjusted discounted cash flow model, specifically, the excess earnings method which considers the use of other assets in the generation of the projected cash flows of a specific asset to isolate the economic benefit generated by the customer and distribution relationships and distribution rights. The contribution of other assets, such as fixed assets, working capital, workforce and other intangible assets, to overall cash flows was estimated through contributory asset capital charges. Therefore, the value of the acquired customer relationship is the present value of the attributed post-tax cash flows, net of the return on fair value attributed to tangible and other intangible assets.
There are significant judgments inherent in a discounted cash flow approach, including, selecting appropriate discount rates, hypothetical royalty rates and contributory asset capital charges; estimating the amount and timing of estimated future cash flows; and identifying appropriate terminal growth rate assumptions. The discount rates used in the discounted cash flow analyses are intended to reflect the risk inherent in the projected future cash flows generated by the respective intangible assets.
The Company recorded a $60.2 million deferred tax liability related to the $336.8 million of acquired intangible assets outlined in the above table. This deferred tax liability represents the tax effect of the difference between the $336.8 million estimated assigned fair value of the intangible assets and the $148.6 million tax basis of such assets. The goodwill and intangibles acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition are not expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.

Goodwill of $221.7 million represents the excess of the purchase price paid by Products Corporation for the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired by Products Corporation in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition. Factors contributing to the purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include estimated annualized synergies and cost reductions, expanded category mix, channel diversification and a broader geographic footprint.

The Cutex International Acquisition
On May 31, 2016 (the "Cutex International Acquisition Date"), the Company completed the acquisition of Cutex International from Coty Inc. (the "Cutex International Acquisition") for total cash consideration of $29.1 million. Following the Company's October 2015 acquisition of the Cutex business and related assets in the U.S. from Cutex Brands, LLC (the “Cutex U.S. Acquisition” and together with the Cutex International Acquisition, the "Cutex Acquisitions"), combined with other Cutex businesses that the Company acquired in 1998, the Cutex International Acquisition completed the Company's global consolidation of the Cutex brand, enhancing and complementing the Company's existing portfolio of nail care products. Cutex International's results of operations are included in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements commencing on the Cutex International Acquisition Date. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented, as the impact of the Cutex International Acquisition on the Company’s consolidated financial results is not material. 
The Company accounted for the Cutex International Acquisition as a business combination in the second quarter of 2016. The table below summarizes the allocation of the total consideration of $29.1 million paid on the Cutex International Acquisition Date, as well as adjustments that have been made to the preliminary estimate of fair values during the third quarter of 2016:

(b) Purchased intangible assets include customer networks fair valued at $11.9 million and intellectual property fair valued at $0.8 million, which are amortized over useful lives of 15 and 10 years, respectively, and indefinite lived trade names fair valued at $4.5 million.
As part of the Cutex International Acquisition, the Company reacquired the Cutex trade name from Coty, under an assignment of a license agreement which had previously provided Coty with an exclusive right to manufacture, market and sell Cutex branded

products for an initial term and perpetual automatic 20-year renewals. Based on the terms and conditions of the existing license agreement and other factors, the Cutex trade name was assigned an indefinite-life and, therefore, will not be amortized.
In determining the estimated fair values of net assets acquired and resulting goodwill related to the Cutex International Acquisition, the Company considered, among other factors, the analysis of Cutex International's historical financial performance and an estimate of the future performance of the acquired business, as well as the intended use of the acquired assets. Factors contributing to the purchase price resulting in the recognition of goodwill include the anticipated benefits that the Company expects to achieve through the expansion of its nail product portfolio. Neither the intangible assets nor goodwill acquired in the Cutex International Acquisition are deductible for income tax purposes.
Acquisitions Completed in 2015
The Company completed the following acquisitions during 2015:

 | PurchaseConsideration | | Total Net Assets Acquired | | Purchased Intangible Assets | | Goodwill

On the CBB acquisition date, the Company used cash on hand to pay 70% of the total cash consideration, or $33.9 million, net of certain measurement period adjustments. The remaining $14.0 million of the total cash consideration was payable in equal installments over 4 years from the CBB acquisition date. The first installment was paid in April 2016 and the remaining installments have been recorded as a component of SG&A expenses ratably over the remaining 3-year installment period. Purchased intangible assets include customer networks valued at $7.0 million, distribution rights valued at $3.5 million and trade names valued at $1.6 million, with weighted average remaining useful lives at the CBB acquisition date of 14, 5 and 8 years, respectively. (See Note 8, “Goodwill and Intangible Assets, Net,” for discussion of the non-cash impairment charge recorded in 2016 in connection with CBB).

3. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES 
EA Integration Restructuring Program 
In December 2016, in connection with integrating the Elizabeth Arden and Revlon organizations, the Company determined to begin the process of implementing certain integration activities, including consolidating offices, eliminating certain duplicative activities and streamlining back-office support (the “EA Integration Restructuring Program”). The EA Integration Restructuring Program are designed to reduce the Company’s SG&A expenses. As a result of the EA Integration Restructuring Program, the Company expects to eliminate approximately 350 positions worldwide.
In connection with implementing the EA Integration Restructuring Program, the Company expects to recognize approximately $65 million to $75 million of total pre-tax restructuring charges (the “EA Integration Restructuring Charges”), consisting of: (i)

2015 Efficiency Program
In September 2015, the Company initiated certain restructuring actions to drive certain organizational efficiencies across the Company's Consumer and Professional segments (the "2015 Efficiency Program"). These actions, which commenced during 2015 and are planned to occur through 2017, are expected to reduce general and administrative expenses within the Consumer and Professional segments. Of the $1.3 million of restructuring and related charges recognized in 2016 for the 2015 Efficiency Program, $0.4 million related to the Consumer segment and $0.5 million related to the Professional segment, with the remaining charges included within unallocated corporate expenses. 
A summary of the restructuring and related charges incurred through December 31, 2016 in connection with the 2015 Efficiency Program is presented in the following table:

Cumulative goodwill impairment charges | $ | (9.7 | ) | | $ | — | | $ | — | | $ | (16.7 | ) | $ | (26.4 | )

(a) The goodwill acquired during 2015 relates to: (i) $19.5 million of goodwill acquired in the CBB Acquisition, which was assigned to the Company's Other segment; and (ii) $1.9 million of goodwill acquired in the Cutex U.S. Acquisition. See Note 2, "Business Combinations," for further discussion of the Cutex U.S. and CBB acquisitions.
(b) The goodwill acquired during 2016 relates to: (i) $221.7 million of goodwill acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; and (ii) $17.4 million of goodwill acquired in the Cutex Acquisitions. See Note 2, "Business Combinations," for further discussion of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition and Cutex International Acquisition.
For 2016, in assessing whether goodwill was impaired in connection with its annual impairment test performed during the fourth quarter of 2016 using October 1st, 2016 carrying values, the Company performed qualitative assessments to determine whether it would be necessary to perform the two-step process, as prescribed by ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, to assess the Company's indefinite-lived intangible assets for indicators of impairment. In performing the qualitative assessments, the Company considered the results of the step one test performed in 2015 and the financial performance of the Revlon, Almay and Other and Professional reporting units. Based upon such assessment, the Company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair values of these two reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts for 2016.
However, for 2016, the Company determined that it would utilize the two-step process to test the Global Color Brands and Other reporting units for impairment. In the first step of this test, the Company compared the fair values of the GCB and Other reporting units, determined based upon discounted estimated future cash flows, to the carrying amounts of each reporting unit, including goodwill. Where the fair value of such reporting unit exceeded the carrying amounts, no further impairment testing was required and no impairment loss was indicated, which was the result for the GCB step one test. The results of the step one test indicated that impairment indicators may have existed for the Company's Other reporting unit due to the termination of certain fragrance licenses that were not replaced, and accordingly, the Company performed step two of the goodwill impairment test for the Other reporting unit.
In the second step, the Company measured the potential impairment of its Other reporting unit by comparing the implied fair value of the Other reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of its goodwill at October 1, 2016. The implied fair value of the Other reporting unit's goodwill was determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination, where the estimated fair value of the Other reporting unit was allocated to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit (including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets) as if the Other reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the estimated fair value of the Other reporting unit was the purchase price paid. When the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of that reporting unit's goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized within operations. The Company determined the fair value of the Other reporting unit using discounted estimated future cash flows. The weighted average cost of capital used in testing the Other reporting unit for impairment was 23.0% with a perpetual growth rate of 2.0%. As a result of this annual impairment test, the Company recognized an aggregate $16.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the Other reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2016. Following the recognition of this non-cash goodwill impairment charge, the Other reporting unit had no remaining goodwill as of December 31, 2016.

For 2015, the Company utilized the two-step process in assessing whether goodwill was impaired for each of the Company's four reporting units. As a result of the annual impairment testing for 2015, the Company recognized a $9.7 million non-cash goodwill impairment charge related to the GCB reporting unit in the fourth quarter of 2015. 
The Company did not record any impairment of goodwill during the year ended December 31, 2014 as a result of its annual impairment testing.

Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $27.5 million, $22.4 million and $21.3 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The Company reviews finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable. This test compares the current carrying values of the intangible assets to the undiscounted pre-tax cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets. Based upon the results of the annual goodwill impairment testing for the Other reporting unit during 2016, the Company performed an impairment review of the finite-lived

intangible assets acquired as part of the 2015 CBB Acquisition. As a result of this review, the Company recognized during the fourth quarter of 2016 within the Other reporting unit $4.2 million, $2.0 million and $0.5 million of non-cash impairment charges as a result of the change in the fair value of customer relationships, distribution rights and trade names, respectively, in the aggregate amount of $6.7 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, no impairment was recognized related to the carrying value of any other finite- or indefinite-lived intangible assets. The Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to the carrying value of identifiable intangible assets in 2015 or 2014.

At December 31, 2015, the Company classified $30.0 million as the current portion of long-term debt, which was comprised of (a) a $23.2 million required “excess cash flow” prepayment (as defined under the Old Term Loan Agreement, as hereinafter defined) that was paid on February 29, 2016, and (b) the Company’s regularly scheduled $1.7 million quarterly principal amortization payments under the Old Term Loan Facility due in 2016.
The Company completed the following debt transactions during 2016 and 2015.
2016 Debt-Related Transactions
In connection with and substantially concurrently with closing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (together the "2016 Senior Credit Facilities"). Additionally, as part of financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, in August 2016 Products Corporation completed the issuance of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 6.25% Senior Notes (the “6.25% Senior Notes Offering”), which funds were released from escrow (the “Escrow Release”) on the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date. In connection with entering into the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, Products Corporation maintained on the 2016 Term Loan Facility its existing floating-to-fixed 2013 Interest Rate Swap (as hereinafter defined) based on a notional amount of $400 million that previously applied to Products Corporation’s Old Acquisition Term Loan, which loan was refinanced in full in connection with Products Corporation's consummation of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 6.25% Senior Notes Offering. The proceeds of Products Corporation's 6.25% Senior Notes Offering and the 2016 Term Loan Facility, together with approximately $35.0 million of borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and approximately $126.7 million of cash on hand, were used to: (A) fund the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, including: (i) repurchasing the entire $350.0 million aggregate principal amount then-outstanding of the Elizabeth Arden Old Senior Notes; (ii) repaying the entire $142.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden’s $300.0 million revolving credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); (iii) repaying the entire $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding as of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date under Elizabeth Arden's second lien credit facility (which facility was terminated upon such repayment); and (iv) retiring the entire $55.0 million liquidation preference of all 50,000 shares of Elizabeth Arden's issued and outstanding preferred stock, which amount included a $5.0 million change of control premium; and (B) to completely refinance and repay all of the $651.4 million

in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation’s then-existing 2011 Term Loan and all of the $658.6 million in aggregate principal balance outstanding under Products Corporation’s Old Acquisition Term Loan (each of which facilities were terminated upon such prepayment). The Company did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with repaying such facilities and preferred stock. See below for a summary description of the agreements governing the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and 6.25% Senior Notes.
Amended Term Loan Facility - Excess Cash Flow Payment
In February 2016, Products Corporation prepaid $23.2 million of indebtedness, then outstanding under its Old Term Loan Facility, representing 50% of its 2015 “excess cash flow” as defined by, and required under, Old Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Old Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount outstanding by $11.5 million to $651.4 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $11.7 million that was applied to the Old Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future annual amortization payments under such loan on a ratable basis from $6.9 million prior to the prepayment to $6.8 million after giving effect to the prepayment and through its maturity on October 8, 2019. The 2011 Term Loan and Old Acquisition Term Loan were completely refinanced and terminated in connection with financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.
2015 Debt Related Transaction
Old Term Loan Facility - Excess Cash Flow Payment
In March 2015, Products Corporation prepaid $24.6 million of indebtedness then outstanding under its Old Term Loan Facility, representing 50% of its 2014 “excess cash flow” as defined by, and as required under, the Old Term Loan Agreement. The prepayment was applied on a ratable basis between the principal amounts then outstanding under the 2011 Term Loan and the Old Acquisition Term Loan. The amount of the prepayment that was applied to the 2011 Term Loan reduced the principal amount then outstanding by $12.1 million to $662.9 million (as all amortization payments under the 2011 Term Loan had been paid). The $12.5 million that was applied to the Old Acquisition Term Loan reduced Products Corporation's future regularly scheduled quarterly amortization payments under the Old Acquisition Term Loan on a ratable basis from $1.8 million prior to the prepayment to $1.7 million after giving effect to the prepayment. The 2011 Term Loan and Old Acquisition Term Loan were completely refinanced and terminated in connection with financing the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition.
Long-Term Debt Agreements
(a) 2016 Term Loan Facility
Principal and Maturity: On the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, for which Citibank, N.A. acts as administrative and collateral agent and which has an initial aggregate principal amount of $1,800.0 million and matures on the earlier of: (x) the seventh anniversary of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date and (y) the 91st day prior to the maturity of Products Corporation’s 5.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the "5.75% Senior Notes”) if, on that date (and solely for so long as), (i) any of Products Corporation's 5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) Products Corporation’s available liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 5.75% Senior Notes by at least $200.0 million.  The loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility were borrowed at an original issue discount of 0.5% to their principal amount. The 2016 Term Loan Facility may be increased by an amount equal to the sum of (x) the greater of $450.0 million and 90% of Products Corporation’s pro forma consolidated EBITDA, plus (y) an unlimited amount to the extent that (1) the first lien leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of Products Corporation’s net senior secured funded debt that is not junior or subordinated to the liens of the Senior Facilities to EBITDA) is less than or equal to 3.5 to 1.0 (for debt secured pari passu with the 2016 Term Loan Facility) or (2) the secured leverage ratio (defined as the ratio of Products Corporation’s net senior secured funded debt to EBITDA) is less than or equal to 4.25 to 1.0 (for junior lien or unsecured debt), plus (z) up to an additional $400.0 million if the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has been repaid and terminated.
Guarantees and Security: Products Corporation and the restricted subsidiaries under the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which include Products Corporation’s domestic subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden and its domestic subsidiaries (collectively, the “Restricted Group”), are subject to the covenants under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement.  The 2016 Term Loan Facility is guaranteed by each of Products Corporation's existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to various exceptions), as well as by Revlon, on a limited recourse basis.  The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation held by Revlon and the equity of the Restricted Group held by Products Corporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to certain 
F-30

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions).  The obligors and guarantors under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility are identical.  The liens securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility on the accounts, inventory, equipment, chattel paper, documents, instruments, deposit accounts, real estate and investment property and general intangibles (other than intellectual property) related thereto (the “Revolving Facility Collateral”) rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.  The liens securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility on all other property, including capital stock, intellectual property and certain other intangible property (the “Term Loan Collateral”), rank first in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, while the liens thereon securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility.
Interest and Fees: Interest accrues on term loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility at a rate per annum of Adjusted LIBOR (which has a floor of 0.75%) plus a margin of 3.50% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 2.50%, at Products Corporation’s option, and is payable quarterly, at a minimum.  Products Corporation is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Term Loan Facility. 
Affirmative and Negative Covenants: The 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit the Restricted Group’s ability to: (i) incur additional debt; (ii) incur liens; (iii) sell, transfer or dispose of assets; (iv) make investments; (v) make dividends and distributions on, or repurchases of, equity; (vi) make prepayments of contractually subordinated or junior lien debt; (vii) enter into certain transactions with their affiliates; (viii) enter into sale-leaseback transactions; (ix) change their lines of business; (x) restrict dividends from their subsidiaries or restrict liens; (xi) change their fiscal year; and (xii) modify the terms of certain debt. The negative covenants are subject to various exceptions, including an “available amount basket” based on 50% of Products Corporation’s cumulative consolidated net income, plus a “starter” basket of $200.0 million, subject to Products Corporation’s compliance with a 5.0 to 1.0 ratio of Products Corporation’s net debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as defined in the 2016 Term Loan Agreement), except such compliance is not required when such baskets are used to make investments. While the 2016 Term Loan Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default, it does not contain any financial maintenance covenants.
Prepayments: The 2016 Term Loan Facility is subject to mandatory prepayments from: (i) the net proceeds from the issuance by Products Corporation or any of its restricted subsidiaries of certain additional debt; (ii) commencing with the excess cash flow calculation with respect to fiscal year ending December 31, 2017, 50% of excess cash flow, with step-downs to 25% and 0% upon achievement of certain first lien leverage ratios and reduced by voluntary prepayments of loans under the 2016 Term Loan Facility and revolving loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent commitments thereunder are permanently reduced; and (iii) asset sale proceeds of certain non-ordinary course asset sales or other dispositions of property that have not been reinvested to the extent in excess of certain minimum amounts. Products Corporation may voluntarily prepay the 2016 Term Loan Facility without premium or penalty unless Products Corporation prepays a term loan within six months after the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date in connection with a repricing transaction (in which case a 1.00% premium is payable).
During 2016, the Company incurred approximately $45.2 million of fees and expenses in connection with consummating the 2016 Term Loan Facility, of which $39.3 million were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2016 Term Loan Credit Facility using the effective interest method. The Company expensed the remaining $5.9 million of fees and expenses and wrote-off $10.9 million of unamortized debt discount and deferred financing costs related to the Old Term Loan Facility. These amounts, totaling $16.8 million, were recognized within loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
(b) 2016 Revolving Credit Facility
Principal and Maturity: On the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, Products Corporation entered into the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, for which Citibank, N.A. acts as administrative agent and collateral agent. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility has an initial maximum availability of $400.0 million (with a $100.0 million sublimit for letters of credit and up to $70.0 million available for swing line loans), which availability is subject to the amount of the borrowing base.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be increased by the greater of (x) $50.0 million and (y) the excess of the borrowing base over the amounts of then-effective commitments.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility permits certain non-U.S. subsidiaries to borrow in local currencies. The borrowing base calculation under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is based on the sum of: (i) 85% of eligible accounts receivable; (ii) the lesser of 85% of the net orderly liquidation value and a percentage of the value specified in respect of different types of eligible inventory; (iii) qualified restricted cash (capped at $75.0 million); and (iv) a temporary increase amount between August 15 and October 31 of each year, which are collectively subject to certain availability reserves set by the administrative agent. The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility matures on the earlier of: (x) the fifth anniversary of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date; and 
F-31

(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

(y) the 91st day prior to the maturity of Products Corporation’s 5.75% Senior Notes if, on that date (and solely for so long as), (i) any of Products Corporation’s 5.75% Senior Notes remain outstanding and (ii) Products Corporation’s available liquidity does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding 5.75% Senior Notes by at least $200.0 million.
Guarantees and Security: The Restricted Group under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement (which is the same as the Restricted Group under the 2016 Term Loan Agreement) is subject to the covenants under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Facility is guaranteed by each of Products Corporation's existing and future direct or indirect wholly-owned domestic restricted subsidiaries (subject to various exceptions), as well as by Revlon on a limited recourse basis.  The obligations of Revlon, Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility are secured by pledges of the equity of Products Corporation held by Revlon and the equity of Products Corporation’s restricted subsidiaries held by Products Corporation and each subsidiary guarantor (subject to certain exceptions, including equity of first-tier foreign subsidiaries in excess of 65% of the voting equity interests of such entity) and by substantially all tangible and intangible personal and real property of Products Corporation and the subsidiary guarantors (subject to certain exclusions).  The obligors and guarantors under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the 2016 Term Loan Facility are identical.  The liens on the 2016 Revolving Facility Collateral securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank first in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which rank second in priority on such collateral.  The liens on the Term Loan Collateral securing the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility rank second in priority to the liens thereon securing the 2016 Term Loan Facility, which rank first in priority on such collateral.
Interest and Fees: Under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, interest is payable quarterly and accrues on borrowings under such facility at a rate per annum equal to either: (i) the alternate base rate plus an applicable margin equal to 0.25%, 0.50% or 0.75%, depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time to time); or (ii) the Eurocurrency rate plus an applicable margin equal to 1.25%, 1.50% or 1.75%, depending on the average excess availability (based on the borrowing base as most recently reported by Products Corporation to the administrative agent from time to time), at Products Corporation’s option. The applicable margin decreases as average excess availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility increases.  Products Corporation is obligated to pay certain fees and expenses in connection with the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, including a commitment fee of 0.25% for any unused amounts. Loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility may be prepaid without premium or penalty.
Affirmative and Negative Covenants: The 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that are similar to those in the 2016 Term Loan Agreement, other than the “available amount basket” (as described above in the description of the 2016 Term Loan Facility); provided, however, under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement the Restricted Group will be able to incur unlimited additional junior secured debt and unsecured debt, make unlimited asset sales and dispositions, make unlimited investments and acquisitions, prepay junior debt and make unlimited restricted payments to the extent that certain “payment conditions” for asset-based credit facilities are satisfied.  The 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement contains certain customary representations, warranties and events of default. If Products Corporation’s “Liquidity Amount” (defined in the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement as the Borrowing Base less the sum of (x) the aggregate outstanding extensions of credit under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, and (y) any availability reserve in effect on such date) falls below the greater of $35.0 million and 10% of the maximum availability under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility (a “Liquidity Event Period”), then the Restricted Group will be required to maintain a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio (the ratio of Products Corporation’s EBITDA minus capital expenditures to cash interest expense for such period) of a minimum of 1.0 to 1.0 until the first date after 20 consecutive business days for which the Liquidity Amount is equal to or greater than such threshold. If Products Corporation is in default under the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio under the 2016 Revolving Credit Agreement, Products Corporation may cure such default by Products Corporation and/or Revlon issuing certain equity securities and Products Corporation receiving capital contributions from Revlon, with such cash being deemed to increase EBITDA for the purpose of calculating the applicable ratio. Products Corporation may exercise this cure right no more than two times in any four-quarter period, and no more than five times in total during the term of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.
Prepayments: Products Corporation must prepay borrowings under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility to the extent that outstanding loans and letters of credit exceed availability.  During a Liquidity Event Period, the administrative agent may apply amounts collected in controlled accounts for the repayment of loans under the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility.   The above descriptions of the terms of the 2016 Term Loan Agreement and the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility and the related security and collateral agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to such agreements, which are incorporated by reference as exhibits to this Form 10-K.
During 2016, the Company incurred approximately $5.7 million of fees and expenses in connection with consummating the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility, of which $5.6 million were capitalized as deferred financing costs and are being amortized over the remaining term of the 2016 Revolving Credit Facility using the effective interest method. The Company expensed the

remaining $0.1 million of fees and expenses, which were recognized within loss on early extinguishment of debt in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income for the year ended December 31, 2016.
(c) 6.25% Senior Notes
On August 4, 2016, Revlon Escrow Corporation (the “Escrow Issuer”), which on such date was a wholly owned subsidiary of Products Corporation, completed the 6.25% Senior Notes offering, pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the “Securities Act”), of $450.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.25% Senior Notes due 2024. The 6.25% Senior Notes are unsecured and were initially issued by the Escrow Issuer to the initial purchasers under an Indenture, dated as of August 4, 2016 (the “6.25% Senior Notes Indenture”), between the Escrow Issuer and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the “6.25% Senior Notes Trustee”). The 6.25% Senior Notes mature on August 1, 2024. Interest on the 6.25% Senior Notes accrues at 6.25% per annum, paid every six months through maturity on each February 1 and August 1, beginning on February 1, 2017. The proceeds from the 6.25% Senior Notes were released from escrow on the September 7, 2016 The Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date (the "Escrow Release"). On the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, the Escrow Issuer was merged with and into Products Corporation and in connection with the Escrow Release, Products Corporation and certain of its direct and indirect wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries, including Elizabeth Arden and certain of its subsidiaries (collectively, the “6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors”), and the 6.25% Senior Notes Trustee entered into a supplemental indenture (the “6.25% Senior Notes Supplemental Indenture”) to the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, pursuant to which Products Corporation assumed the obligations of the Escrow Issuer under the 6.25% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors jointly and severally, fully and unconditionally guaranteed the 6.25% Senior Notes on a senior unsecured basis (the "6.25% Senior Notes Guarantees").  The 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors are the same entities that are subsidiary guarantors under the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities.
In December 2016, Products Corporation consummated an offer to exchange the original 6.25% Senior Notes for $450 million of new 6.25% Senior Notes, which have substantially the same terms as the original 6.25% Senior Notes, except that they are registered under the Securities Act (such registered new notes being the “6.25% Senior Notes”).
Ranking: The 6.25% Senior Notes are Products Corporation’s senior, unsubordinated and unsecured obligations, ranking: (i) pari passu in right of payment with all of Products Corporation’s existing and future senior unsecured indebtedness; (ii) senior in right of payment to all of Products Corporation’s and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors’ future subordinated indebtedness; and (iii) effectively junior to all of Products Corporation’s and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors’ existing and future senior secured indebtedness, including, indebtedness under Products Corporation’s 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. The 6.25% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantees are: (i) structurally subordinated to all of the liabilities and preferred stock of any of the Company’s subsidiaries that do not guarantee the 6.25% Senior Notes; and (ii) pari passu in right of payment with liabilities of the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors other than expressly subordinated indebtedness. The 6.25% Senior Notes and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantees rank effectively junior to indebtedness and preferred stock of Products Corporation’s foreign and immaterial subsidiaries (the “6.25% Senior Notes Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries”), none of which guarantee the 6.25% Senior Notes.
Optional Redemption: Prior to August 1, 2019, Products Corporation may redeem the 6.25% Senior Notes at its option, at any time as a whole or from time to time in part, upon Products Corporation’s payment of an applicable make-whole premium based on the comparable treasury rate plus 50 basis points. Prior to August 1, 2019, up to 40% of the aggregate principal amount of 6.25% Senior Notes that have been issued may also be redeemed at Products Corporation’s option at any time as a whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to 106.250% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of redemption with the proceeds of certain equity offerings and capital contributions (so long as at least 60% of the 6.25% Senior Notes that have been issued thereafter remain outstanding). On and after August 1, 2019, Products Corporation may redeem the 6.25% Senior Notes at its option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued interest to (but not including) the date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on August 1 of the years indicated below:

Period | Optimal Redemption Premium Percentage
2019 | 104.688 | %
2020 | 103.125 | %
2021 | 101.563 | %
2022 and thereafter | 100.000 | %

(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

All redemptions (and notices thereof) may be subject to various conditions precedent, and redemption dates specified in such notices may be extended so that such conditions precedent may be fulfilled (to the extent redemption on such dates is otherwise permitted by the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture).
Change of Control: Upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the 6.25% Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the outstanding principal amount of the 6.25% Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to (but not including) the date of repurchase.
Certain Covenants: The 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture imposes certain limitations on Products Corporation’s and the 6.25% Senior Notes Guarantors’ ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to: (i) incur or guarantee additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock; (ii) pay dividends, make certain investments and make repayments on indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 6.25% Senior Notes and make other “restricted payments”; (iii) create liens on their assets to secure debt; (iv) enter into transactions with affiliates; (v) merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company; (vi) transfer and sell assets; and (vii) permit restrictions on the payment of dividends by Products Corporation's subsidiaries. 
These covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default. In addition, if during any period of time the 6.25% Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants regarding limitations on debt, limitations on restricted payments, limitation on guarantees by restricted subsidiaries, limitation on transactions with affiliates, certain provisions of the successor company covenant, limitation on asset sales and limitation on dividends from restricted subsidiaries.
During 2016, in connection with consummating the 6.25% Senior Notes Offering, the Company incurred approximately $11.3 million of fees and expenses, all of which were capitalized and are being amortized over the remaining term of the 6.25% Senior Notes using the effective interest method. 
(d) 5.75% Senior Notes
On February 8, 2013, Products Corporation completed its offering (the "2013 Senior Notes Refinancing"), pursuant to an exemption from registration under the Securities Act, of $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes. The 5.75% Senior Notes are unsecured and were issued to investors at par. The 5.75% Senior Notes mature on February 15, 2021. Interest on the 5.75% Senior Notes accrues at 5.75% per annum, paid every six months on February 15th and August 15th.
The 5.75% Senior Notes were issued pursuant to the 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture (the "5.75% Senior Notes Indenture" and together with the 6.25% Senior Notes Indenture, the "Senior Notes Indentures"), dated as of February 8, 2013 (the “5.75% Senior Notes Closing Date”), by and among Products Corporation, Products Corporation’s domestic subsidiaries (the “5.75% Senior Notes Guarantors”), which also currently guarantee Products Corporation’s 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 6.25% Senior Notes, and U.S. Bank National Association, as trustee (the "5.75% Senior Notes Trustee"). The 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantors issued guarantees (the “5.75% Senior Notes Guarantees”) of Products Corporation’s obligations under the 5.75% Senior Notes and the 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture on a joint and several, senior unsecured basis. 
In December 2013, Products Corporation consummated an offer to exchange the original 5.75% Senior Notes for $500 million of new 5.75% Senior Notes, which have substantially the same terms as the original 5.75% Senior Notes, except that they are registered under the Securities Act (such registered new notes being the “5.75% Senior Notes”).
Products Corporation used a portion of the $491.2 million of net proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes (net of underwriters' fees) to repay and redeem all of the $330.0 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of its 9.75% Senior Secured Notes, as well as to pay $8.6 million of accrued interest. Products Corporation incurred an aggregate of $19.4 million of fees for the applicable redemption and tender offer premiums, related fees and expenses in connection with redemption and repayment of the 9.75% Senior Secured Notes and other fees and expenses in connection with the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes. Products Corporation used a portion of the remaining proceeds from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes, together with existing cash, to pay approximately $113.0 million of principal on its 2011 Term Loan in conjunction with the February 2013 Term Loan Amendments. Products Corporation used the remaining balance available from the issuance of the 5.75% Senior Notes for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, debt reduction transactions, such as repaying a loan to Revlon at its maturity on October 8, 2013, which proceeds Revlon used to pay the liquidation preference of Revlon's then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock, in connection with its mandatory redemption on such date.

The 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantees were issued on a joint and several basis.
The 5.75% Senior Notes and the 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantees rank effectively junior to Products Corporation’s 2016 Senior Credit Facilities, which are secured, as well as indebtedness and preferred stock of Products Corporation’s foreign and immaterial subsidiaries (the “5.75% Senior Notes Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries” and together with the 6.25% Senior Notes Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries, the "Non-Guarantor Subsidiaries"), none of which guarantee the 5.75% Senior Notes. 
Optional Redemption
The 5.75% Senior Notes may be redeemed at Products Corporation's option, at any time as a whole, or from time to time in part, at the following redemption prices (expressed as percentages of principal amount), plus accrued interest to the date of redemption, if redeemed during the 12-month period beginning on February 15th of the years indicated below: 

Year | Percentage
2016 | 104.313 | %
2017 | 102.875 | %
2018 | 101.438 | %
2019 and thereafter | 100.000 | %

Change of Control
Upon the occurrence of specified change of control events, Products Corporation is required to make an offer to purchase all of the 5.75% Senior Notes at a purchase price of 101% of the outstanding principal amount of the 5.75% Senior Notes as of the date of any such repurchase, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. 
Certain Covenants
The 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture limits Products Corporation’s and the 5.75% Senior Notes Guarantors’ ability, and the ability of certain other subsidiaries, to: 

• | incur or guarantee additional indebtedness (“Limitation on Debt”);


• | pay dividends, make repayments on indebtedness that is subordinated in right of payment to the 5.75% Senior Notes and make other “restricted payments” (“Limitation on Restricted Payments”);


• | make certain investments;


• | create liens on their assets to secure debt;


• | enter into transactions with affiliates;


• | merge, consolidate or amalgamate with another company (“Successor Company”);


• | transfer and sell assets (“Limitation on Asset Sales”); and


• | permit restrictions on the payment of dividends by Products Corporation’s subsidiaries (“Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries”).

These covenants are subject to important qualifications and exceptions. The 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture also contains customary affirmative covenants and events of default. 
In addition, if during any period of time the 5.75% Senior Notes receive investment grade ratings from both Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s Investors Services, Inc. and no default or event of default has occurred and is continuing under the 5.75% Senior Notes Indenture, Products Corporation and its subsidiaries will not be subject to the covenants on Limitation on Debt, Limitation on Restricted Payments, Limitation on Asset Sales, Limitation on Dividends from Subsidiaries and certain provisions of the Successor Company covenant.

12. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Assets and liabilities are required to be categorized into three levels of fair value based upon the assumptions used to price the assets or liabilities. Level 1 provides the most reliable measure of fair value, whereas Level 3, if applicable, generally would require significant management judgment. The three levels for categorizing the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities are as follows:

• | Level 1: Fair valuing the asset or liability using observable inputs, such as quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;


• | Level 2: Fair valuing the asset or liability using inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the applicable asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, such as quoted prices for similar (as opposed to identical) assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; and

(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)


• | Level 3: Fair valuing the asset or liability using unobservable inputs that reflect the Company’s own assumptions regarding the applicable asset or liability.

As of December 31, 2016, the fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are required to be measured at fair value are categorized in the table below:

The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade receivables, notes receivable, accounts payable and short-term borrowings approximate their respective fair values.
13. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Products Corporation maintains standby and trade letters of credit for various corporate purposes under which Products Corporation is obligated, of which $10.4 million and $8.8 million (including amounts available under credit agreements in effect at that time) were maintained at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Included in these amounts are approximately $7.3 million and $7.5 million at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively, in standby letters of credit that support Products Corporation’s self-insurance programs. The estimated liability under such programs is accrued by Products Corporation.
Derivative Financial Instruments
The Company uses derivative financial instruments, primarily: (i) FX Contracts, intended for the purpose of managing foreign currency exchange risk by reducing the effects of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on the Company’s net cash flows; and (ii) interest rate hedging transactions, such as the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, intended for the purpose of managing interest rate risk associated with Products Corporation’s variable rate indebtedness. 
Foreign Currency Forward Exchange Contracts
The FX Contracts are entered into primarily to hedge the anticipated net cash flows resulting from inventory purchases and intercompany payments denominated in currencies other than the local currencies of the Company’s foreign and domestic operations and generally have maturities of less than one year. 
The U.S. Dollar notional amount of the FX Contracts outstanding at December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was $79.6 million and $76.3 million, respectively. 
Interest Rate Swap Transaction 
In November 2013, Products Corporation executed a forward-starting floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction that, at its inception, was based on a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under the Old Acquisition Term Loan over a period of three years (the "2013 Interest Rate Swap"). The 2013 Interest Rate Swap initially had a floor of 1.00% that in December 2016 was amended to 0.75%. In connection with entering into the 2016 Term Loan Facility, the 2013 Interest Swap was carried over to apply to a notional amount of $400 million in respect of indebtedness under such loan for the remaining balance of the term of such swap. The Company initially designated the 2013 Interest Rate Swap as a cash flow hedge of the variability of the forecasted three-month LIBOR interest rate payments initially related to the $400 million notional amount under the Old Acquisition Term Loan over the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap (and subsequently to the $400 million notional amount under the 2016 Term Loan Facility for the remaining balance of the term of such swap). Commencing in May 2015, Products Corporation receives from the counterparty a floating interest rate based on the higher of three-month U.S. Dollar LIBOR or the floor percentage in effect, while paying a fixed interest rate payment to the counterparty equal to 2.0709% (which, with respect to the 2016 Term Loan Facility, effectively fixes the interest rate on such notional amount at 5.5709% over the remaining balance of the three-year term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap). At December 31, 2016 the fair value of the 2013 Interest Rate 
F-38

REVLON, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

Swap was a liability of $4.7 million and the accumulated loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss was $3.0 million net of tax.
As a result of completely refinancing the Old Acquisition Term Loan with a portion of the proceeds from Product's Corporation's consummation of the 2016 Senior Credit Facilities and the 6.25% Senior Notes Offering in connection with consummating the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the critical terms of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap no longer match the terms of the underlying debt under the 2016 Term Loan Facility. At the refinancing date, which was the same as the September 7, 2016 Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date (the "De-designation Date"), the 2013 Interest Rate Swap was determined to no longer be highly effective and the Company discontinued hedge accounting for the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. Following the de-designation of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap, changes in fair value are accounted for as a component of other non-operating expenses. Accumulated deferred losses of $6.3 million, or $3.9 million net of tax, at the De-designation Date that were previously recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss will be amortized into earnings over the remaining term of the 2013 Interest Rate Swap through its maturity. At December 31, 2016, $4.9 million, or $3.0 million net of tax, remains as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the 2013 Interest Rate Swap. See "Quantitative Information – Derivative Financial Instruments" below). 
The Company expects that $2.3 million of the net of tax deferred net losses related to the 2013 Interest Rate Swap will be amortized into earnings over the next 12 months. 
Credit Risk
Exposure to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to the gross fair value of the derivative instruments in asset positions, which totaled $2.3 million and $2.0 million as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. The Company attempts to minimize exposure to credit risk by generally entering into derivative contracts with counterparties that have investment-grade credit ratings and are major financial institutions. The Company also periodically monitors any changes in the credit ratings of its counterparties. Given the current credit standing of the Company's counterparties to its derivative instruments, the Company believes that the risk of loss under these derivative instruments arising from any non-performance by any of the counterparties is remote.

14. PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS 
Savings Plan:
The Company offers a qualified defined contribution plan for its U.S.-based employees, the Revlon Employees' Savings, Investment and Profit Sharing Plan (as amended, the "Savings Plan"), which allows eligible participants to contribute up to 25%, and highly compensated participants to contribute up to 6%, of eligible compensation through payroll deductions, subject to certain annual dollar limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). The Company matches employee contributions at fifty cents for each dollar contributed up to the first 6% of eligible compensation. The Company made cash matching contributions to the Savings Plan of $2.6 million, $2.5 million and $2.4 million during each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company also offers a non-qualified defined contribution plan (the “Excess Savings Plan”) providing benefits for certain U.S. employees who are in excess of IRS limitations. These non-qualified defined contribution benefits are funded from the Company's general assets.
The Company’s qualified and non-qualified defined contribution savings plans for its U.S.-based employees contain a discretionary profit sharing component that enables the Company, should it elect to do so, to make discretionary profit sharing contributions. For 2016, the Company made discretionary profit sharing contributions to the Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan of $5.0 million (of which $3.9 million was paid in 2016 and $1.1 million was paid in January 2017), or 3% of eligible compensation, which was credited on a quarterly basis. For 2015, the Company made discretionary profit sharing contributions to the Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan of $4.8 million (of which $3.7 million was paid in 2015 and $1.1 million was paid in January 2016), or 3% of eligible compensation, which was credited on a quarterly basis. For 2014, the Company made discretionary profit sharing contributions to the Savings Plan and Excess Savings Plan of $4.0 million (of which $3.1 million was paid in 2014 and $0.9 million was paid in January 2015), or 3% of eligible compensation, which was credited on a quarterly basis.
Pension Benefits:
In 2009, Products Corporation’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan (the Revlon Employees’ Retirement Plan, which covered a substantial portion of the Company's employees in the U.S.) and its non-qualified pension plan (the Revlon Pension Equalization Plan) were amended to cease future benefit accruals under such plans after December 31, 2009. No additional benefits have accrued since December 31, 2009, other than interest credits on participant account balances under the cash balance program of the Company’s U.S. pension plans. Also, service credits for vesting and early retirement eligibility will continue to accrue in accordance with the terms of the respective plans. In 2010, the Company amended its Canadian defined benefit pension plan (the Affiliated Revlon Companies Employment Plan) to reduce future benefit accruals under such plan after December 31, 2010. 
F-40

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

Additionally, while the Company closed its U.K. defined pension plan to new entrants in 2002, then-existing participants continue to accrue pension benefits.
Effective December 31, 2012, Products Corporation merged two of its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans; therefore, as of December 31, 2012, Products Corporation sponsors two U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. The Company also has non-qualified pension plans that provide benefits for certain U.S. and non-U.S. employees, and for U.S. employees in excess of IRS limitations in the U.S. and in certain limited cases contractual benefits for certain former officers of the Company. These non-qualified plans are funded from the Company's general assets.
In the fourth quarter of 2015, the Company offered certain former employees who had vested benefits in the Revlon Employees’ Retirement Plan the option of receiving the present value of the participant’s pension benefit in a one-time cash lump sum payment, an annuity form of benefit or the ability to maintain their deferred vested status in the pension plan. Based upon the participants' acceptance of that offer, $53.4 million was paid from the plan's assets in December 2015, with a corresponding decrease in the plan's benefit obligation. As a result of such program, the Company recorded a $20.7 million charge as a result of the pension lump sum settlement in the fourth quarter of 2015. This charge was included in cost of sales and SG&A expenses.
Other Post-retirement Benefits:
The Company previously sponsored an unfunded retiree benefit plan, which provides death benefits payable to beneficiaries of a very limited number of former employees. Participation in this plan was limited to participants enrolled as of December 31, 1993. The Company also administers an unfunded medical insurance plan on behalf of Revlon Holdings, certain costs of which have been apportioned to Revlon Holdings under the transfer agreements among Revlon, Products Corporation and MacAndrews & Forbes. (See Note 22, “Related Party Transactions - Transfer Agreements”). 
The following table provides an aggregate reconciliation of the projected benefit obligations, plan assets, funded status and amounts recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements related to the Company's significant pension and other post-retirement benefit plans:

For 2016, the Company recognized net periodic benefit income of $0.6 million, compared to net periodic benefit cost of $18.8 million in 2015, primarily due to the pension lump sum settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 which was not repeated in 2016, as well as the Company's adoption of the alternative approach to calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other post-retirement benefits (the “full yield curve” approach) which was adopted by the Company at December 31, 2015. 
For 2015, the Company recognized net periodic benefit cost of $18.8 million, compared to net periodic benefit income of $5.4 million in 2014, primarily due to the pension lump sum settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 and higher amortization of actuarial losses. 
Net periodic benefit costs (income) are reflected in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements as follows:

Effective December 31, 2015, the Company adopted the “full yield curve” method as an alternative approach to calculating the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for the Company's pension and other post-retirement benefits. Under the "full yield curve" method, the discount rate assumption was built through the application of specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows for each of the Company's pension and other post-retirement plans. Prior to December 31, 2015, the Company estimated the service and interest cost components utilizing a single weighted average discount rate derived from the yield curve used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the period. The change does not affect the measurement of the Company's total projected benefit obligations, as the change in service and interest costs is exactly offset in the actuarial loss (gain) recognized for each year. The Company made this change to provide a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected benefit cash flows to the corresponding spot yield curve rates. The change to the "full yield curve" method was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate that is inseparable from a change in accounting principle, and accordingly, was accounted for prospectively.
In selecting its expected long-term rate of return on its pension plan assets, the Company considers a number of factors, including, without limitation, recent and historical performance of pension plan assets, the pension plan portfolios' asset allocations over a variety of time periods compared with third-party studies, the performance of the capital markets in recent years and other factors, as well as advice from various third parties, such as the pension plans' advisors, investment managers and actuaries. While the Company considered both the recent performance and the historical performance of pension plan assets, the Company’s assumptions are based primarily on its estimates of long-term, prospective rates of return. Using the aforementioned methodologies, the Company selected a 7.00% and 6.00% weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption during 2016 for the U.S. and International pension plans, respectively. Differences between actual and expected asset returns are recognized in the net periodic benefit cost over the remaining service period of the active participating employees.
The rate of future compensation increases is an assumption used by the actuarial consultants for pension accounting and is determined based on the Company’s current expectation for such increases. 
Investment Policy:
The Investment Committee for the Company's U.S. pension plans (the “Investment Committee”) has adopted (and revises from time to time) an investment policy for the Company's U.S. pension plans with the objective of realizing a long-term rate of return on pension plan assets that meets or exceeds, over time, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, weighed against a reasonable risk level. In connection with this objective, the Investment Committee retains a professional investment advisor who recommends investment managers that invest plan assets in the following asset classes: common and preferred stock, mutual funds, fixed income securities, common and collective funds, hedge funds, group annuity contracts and cash and other investments. The Company’s international plans follow a similar methodology in conjunction with local actuarial consultants and asset managers. 
 The investment policy adopted by the Investment Committee provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded securities, among other things. The investments are in domestic and international stocks, ranging from small to large capitalization stocks, debt securities ranging from domestic and international treasury issues, corporate debt securities, mortgages and asset-backed issues. Other investments may include cash and cash equivalents and hedge funds. The investment policy also allows for investments in private equity funds that are not covered in investments described above, provided that the Investment Committee approves any such investments prior to their selection. Also, global balanced strategies are utilized to provide for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded stocks and bonds in both domestic and international markets, as described above. In addition, the global balanced strategies can include commodities, provided that the Investment Committee approves any such investments prior to their selection.
The Investment Committee’s investment policy does not allow the use of derivatives for speculative purposes, but such policy does allow its investment managers to use derivatives for the purpose of reducing risk exposures or to replicate exposures of a particular asset class.

The Company’s U.S. and international pension plans have target asset allocation ranges which are intended to be flexible guidelines for allocating the plans’ assets among various classes of assets. These target ranges are reviewed periodically and considered for readjustment when an asset class weighting is outside of its target range (recognizing that these are flexible target ranges that may vary from time to time) with the objective of meeting or exceeding the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption, weighed against a reasonable risk level. The target ranges per asset class are as follows: 

 | Target Ranges

Asset Class: | | 
Common and preferred stock | 0% - 10% | — 
Mutual funds | 20% - 30% | —

The Company recognizes non-cash compensation expense related to restricted stock awards and restricted stock units under the Stock Plan using the straight-line method over the remaining service period. The Company recorded compensation expense related to restricted stock awards under the Stock Plan of $6.4 million, 5.1 million and $5.5 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during 2016 and 2015 was $6.5 million and $5.0 million, respectively. The deferred stock-based compensation related to restricted stock awards was $21.8 million at December 31, 2016 and will be amortized ratably to compensation expense over a weighted average remaining vesting period of 3.0 years. 
16. INCOME TAXES
The Company's income before income taxes and the applicable provision for income taxes are as follows: 

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes: | | | | | 
United States | $ | 4.2 | | | $ | 114.4 | | | $ | 137.1

 | (6.2 | ) | | 28.3 | | | 64.3 | 
Total provision for income taxes | $ | 25.5 | | | $ | 51.4 | | | $ | 77.8 

The Company classifies interest and penalties as a component of the provision for income taxes. The Company recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive (Loss) Income an expense of $0.3 million in 2016 and a benefit of $1.0 million and $0.9 million during 2015 and 2014, respectively, in accrued interest and penalties.
The Company has not provided for U.S. federal income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on $321.9 million of foreign subsidiaries' cumulative undistributed earnings as of December 31, 2016 because such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested overseas. If these foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S., or if the Company determines that such earnings will be remitted in a future period, additional tax provisions may be required. Due to the complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions

(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

that would have to be made, it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income tax provisions that may be required on account of these foreign undistributed earnings.
The actual tax on income before income taxes is reconciled to the applicable statutory federal income tax rate in the following table:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Computed income tax expense | $ | 3.0 | | | $ | 38.8 | | | $ | 41.1

Other | 4.3 | | | 0.2 | | | (0.8 | )
Total provision for income taxes | $ | 25.5 | | | $ | 51.4 | | | $ | 77.8

Deferred taxes are the result of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and income tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 and 2015 were comprised of the following:

 | December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015
Deferred tax assets: | | | 
Inventories | $ | 30.9 | | | $ | 7.3 
Net operating loss carryforwards - U.S. | 140.4 | | | 47.2 | 
Net operating loss carryforwards - foreign | 50.5 | | | 51.4 | 
Employee benefits | 91.7 | | | 96.7 | 
Sales related reserves | 23.9 | | | 25.8 | 
Foreign currency translation adjustment | 9.9 | | | 11.0 | 
Other | 89.4 | | | 52.7 | 
Total gross deferred tax assets | 436.7 | | | 292.1 | 
Less valuation allowance | (81.4 | ) | | (47.1 | )
Total deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance | 355.3 | | | 245.0 | 
Deferred tax liabilities: | | | 
Plant, equipment and other assets | (26.0 | ) | | (29.9 | )
Intangibles | (132.4 | ) | | (82.4 | )
Other | (57.6 | ) | | (63.2 | )
Total gross deferred tax liabilities | (216.0 | ) | | (175.5 | )
Net deferred tax assets | $ | 139.3 | | | $ | 69.5

In assessing the recoverability of its deferred tax assets, management regularly considers whether for some portion or all of the deferred tax assets it is more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized for these assets. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is generally dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences may become deductible. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management evaluates the available pertinent positive and negative evidence, such as the Company's history of earnings, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax assets and liabilities, projected earnings, and income and available tax planning strategies.

A valuation allowance has been provided for those deferred tax assets for which, in the opinion of the Company's management, it is more likely than not that a benefit will not be realized. At December 31, 2016, the deferred tax valuation allowance primarily represented amounts for foreign jurisdictions where, as of the end of 2016, the Company had a three-year cumulative loss, and for certain U.S. jurisdictions where the Company had tax loss carryforwards and other tax attributes which may expire prior to being utilized. The deferred tax valuation allowance increased by $34.3 million and decreased by $10.0 million during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance during 2016 was primarily associated with deferred taxes added as a result of the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the majority of which were established through purchase accounting. The decrease in the deferred tax valuation allowance during 2015 was primarily due to an $18.4 million reduction of the Company's valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets in the U.K., partially offset by additional valuation allowances on current period net operating losses incurred in certain jurisdictions. The UK valuation allowance reduction in 2015 was a result of the Company determining that it was more likely than not that a benefit would be received for U.K. deferred tax assets. This conclusion was reached after consideration of the available positive and negative evidence, with the most significant positive evidence being the recent history of earnings, improved earnings trends, expected taxable income in future periods, and no history of losses expiring unused. There was no significant negative evidence.
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has tax loss carryforwards of approximately $512.7 million, of which $215.6 million are foreign and $297.1 million are domestic (federal). The losses expire in future years as follows: 2017- $0.2 million; 2018- $4.8 million; 2019- $16.6 million; 2020 and beyond- $323.4 million; and unlimited- $167.7 million. The Company could receive the benefit of such tax loss carryforwards only to the extent it has taxable income during the carryforward periods in the applicable tax jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2016, there were no consolidated federal net operating losses available from the MacAndrews & Forbes Group (as hereinafter defined) from periods prior to the March 25, 2004 deconsolidation (as described below). The Company has acquired entities which had carryforward balances for tax losses, tax credits and other tax attributes at the time of the acquisition. U.S. Federal and certain state and foreign jurisdictions impose limitations on the amount of these tax losses, tax credits and other carryforward balances that may be utilized after an acquisition. The Company has evaluated the impact of these limitations, and has established a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that the Company expects will be realized.
The Company remains subject to examination of its income tax returns in various jurisdictions, including, without limitation:  Australia, Canada, South Africa, Spain and the U.S. (federal) for tax years ended December 31, 2012 and forward; and the U.K. for tax years ended December 31, 2013 and forward.
Elizabeth Arden remains subject to examination of its income tax returns in various jurisdictions, including, without limitation: the U.S. (federal) for the tax years ended June 30, 2010 and forward; and Switzerland for tax years ended June 30, 2014 and forward.
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $93.3 million and $65.0 million, respectively, including $10.6 million and $10.3 million, respectively, of accrued interest and penalties. Of the $93.3 million unrecognized tax benefits, $57.0 million would affect the Company's effective tax rate, if recognized, and the remaining $36.3 million would affect the Company's deferred tax accounts. A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the unrecognized tax benefits is provided in the following table:

Balance at January 1, 2015 | $ | 62.0
Increase based on tax positions taken in a prior year | 5.6 | 
Decrease based on tax positions taken in a prior year | (5.8 | ) 
Increase based on tax positions taken in the current year | 8.5 | 
Decrease resulting from the lapse of statutes of limitations | (5.3 | ) 
Balance at December 31, 2015 | 65.0 | 
Increase based on tax positions taken in a prior year | 25.9 | 
Decrease based on tax positions taken in a prior year | (1.3 | ) 
Increase based on tax positions taken in the current year | 9.3 | 
Decrease resulting from the lapse of statutes of limitations | (5.6 | ) 
Balance at December 31, 2016 | $ | 93.3

In addition, the Company believes that it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized tax benefits during 2017 will decrease by approximately $9.6 million due to the resolution of audits and the expiration of statutes of limitation.

As a result of the closing of the 2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions (as hereinafter defined in Note 22, “Related Party Transactions - Tax Sharing Agreements”), as of March 25, 2004, Revlon, Products Corporation and their U.S. subsidiaries were no longer included in the affiliated group of which MacAndrews & Forbes was the common parent (the “MacAndrews & Forbes Group”) for federal income tax purposes. Revlon Holdings (as hereinafter defined in Note 22, “Related Party Transactions - Transfer Agreements”), Revlon, Products Corporation and certain of its subsidiaries, and MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated entered into a tax sharing agreement (as subsequently amended and restated, the "MacAndrews & Forbes Tax Sharing Agreement"), for taxable periods beginning on or after January 1, 1992 through and including March 25, 2004, during which Revlon and Products Corporation or a subsidiary of Products Corporation was a member of the MacAndrews & Forbes Group. In these taxable periods, Revlon's and Products Corporation's federal taxable income and loss were included in such group's consolidated tax return filed by MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated. During such period, Revlon and Products Corporation were also included in certain state and local tax returns of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated or its subsidiaries. Revlon and Products Corporation remain liable under the MacAndrews & Forbes Tax Sharing Agreement for all such taxable periods through and including March 25, 2004 for amounts determined to be due as a result of a redetermination arising from an audit or otherwise, equal to the taxes that Revlon or Products Corporation would otherwise have had to pay if it were to have filed separate federal, state or local income tax returns for such periods.
Following the closing of the 2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions, Revlon became the parent of a new consolidated group for federal income tax purposes and Products Corporation's federal taxable income and loss are included in such group's consolidated tax returns. Accordingly, Revlon and Products Corporation entered into a tax sharing agreement (the "Revlon Tax Sharing Agreement") pursuant to which Products Corporation is required to pay to Revlon amounts equal to the taxes that Products Corporation would otherwise have had to pay if Products Corporation were to file separate federal, state or local income tax returns, limited to the amount, and payable only at such times, as Revlon will be required to make payments to the applicable taxing authorities.
There were no federal tax payments or payments in lieu of taxes from Revlon to Revlon Holdings pursuant to the MacAndrews & Forbes Tax Sharing Agreement in 2016 or 2015 with respect to periods covered by the MacAndrews & Forbes Tax Sharing Agreement, and the Company expects that there will not be any such payments in 2017. During 2016, there were no federal tax payments from Products Corporation to Revlon pursuant to the Revlon Tax Sharing Agreement with respect to 2016 or 2015. During 2015, there were no federal tax payments from Products Corporation to Revlon pursuant to the Revlon Tax Sharing Agreement with respect to 2015. The Company expects that there will be no federal tax payments from Products Corporation to Revlon pursuant to the Revlon Tax Sharing Agreement during 2017 with respect to 2016. 
Pursuant to the asset transfer agreement referred to in Note 22, “Related Party Transactions - Transfer Agreements,” Products Corporation assumed all tax liabilities of Revlon Holdings other than (i) certain income tax liabilities arising prior to January 1, 1992 to the extent such liabilities exceeded the reserves on Revlon Holdings' books as of January 1, 1992 or were not of the nature reserved for and (ii) other tax liabilities to the extent such liabilities are related to the business and assets retained by Revlon Holdings.

19. SEGMENT DATA AND RELATED INFORMATION 
Operating segments include components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker (the Company's “Chief Executive Officer”) in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing the Company's performance. As a result of the similarities in the procurement, manufacturing and distribution processes for the Company’s products, much of the information provided in the Consolidated Financial Statements, and provided in the segment table below, is similar to, or the same as, that reviewed on a regular basis by the Company's Chief Executive Officer. As of December 31, 2016, and since the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition Date, the Elizabeth Arden organization has continued to operate and be evaluated on a stand-alone basis. 
 At December 31, 2016, the Company’s operations are organized into the following reportable segments:

• | Consumer - The Company’s Consumer segment is comprised of products that are marketed, distributed and sold in large volume retailers, chain drug and food stores, chemist shops, hypermarkets, general merchandise stores, the Internet/e-commerce, television shopping, department stores, one-stop shopping beauty retailers, specialty cosmetic stores and perfumeries in the U.S. and internationally under brands such as Revlon, Almay, SinfulColors and Pure Ice in cosmetics; Revlon ColorSilk in women’s hair color; Revlon in beauty tools; and Mitchum in anti-perspirant deodorants. The Consumer segment also includes a skin care line under the Natural Honey brand and hair color line under the Llongueras brand (licensed from a third party), that are sold in large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in Spain. In October 2015 and in May 2016, the Company completed the Cutex U.S. Acquisition and the Cutex International Acquisition and the results of operations relating to the sales of Cutex nail care products are included within the Consumer segment.


• | Professional - The Company’s Professional segment markets, distributes and sells professional products primarily to hair and nail salons and professional salon distributors in the U.S. and internationally under brands such as Revlon Professional in hair color, hair care and hair treatments; CND in nail polishes and nail enhancements, including CND Shellac and CND Vinylux nail polishes; and American Crew in men’s grooming products. The Professional segment also includes a multi-cultural hair care line consisting of Creme of Nature hair care products, which are sold in both professional salons and in large volume retailers and other retailers, primarily in the U.S.


• | Elizabeth Arden - The Elizabeth Arden segment markets, distributes and sells fragrances, skin care and color cosmetics to prestige retailers, specialty stores, the mass retail channel, distributors, perfumeries, department stores, boutiques, travel retailers and other retailers in the U.S. and internationally, as well as direct sales to consumers via its Elizabeth Arden Red Door branded retail stores, Elizabeth Arden.com e-commerce business and Elizabeth Arden Red Door spa beauty salons and spas under brands such as Skin Illuminating, SUPERSTART, Prevage, Eight Hour Cream, Elizabeth Arden Ceramide and Visible Difference in the Elizabeth Arden skin care brands; Elizabeth Arden Red Door, Elizabeth Arden 5th Avenue, Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and UNTOLD in Elizabeth Arden fragrances; Juicy Couture, John Varvatos and Wildfox Couture in designer fragrances; and Curve, Elizabeth Taylor, Britney

Spears, Christina Aguilera, Halston, Ed Hardy, Geoffrey Beene, Alfred Sung, Giorgio Beverly Hills, Lucky Brand, PS Fine Cologne for Men, White Shoulders and Jennifer Aniston in heritage fragrances.

• | Other - The Other segment includes the operating results of the CBB business and related purchase accounting for the CBB Acquisition. CBB develops, markets and distributes fragrances and other beauty products under various celebrity, lifestyle and fashion brands licensed from third parties, principally through department stores and selective distribution in international territories. The results included within the Other segment are not material to the Company’s consolidated results of operations.

 The Company's management evaluates segment profit, which is defined as income from continuing operations before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation expense, gains/losses on foreign currency fluctuations, gains/losses on the early extinguishment of debt and miscellaneous expenses, for each of the Company's reportable segments. Segment profit also excludes unallocated corporate expenses and the impact of certain items that are not directly attributable to the reportable segments' underlying operating performance, which includes the impacts of: (i) restructuring and related charges; (ii) acquisition and integration costs; (iii) deferred compensation related to the accounting for the CBB Acquisition; (iv) costs of sales resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in acquisitions; (v) charges related to the Elizabeth Arden 2016 Business Transformation Program; (vi) costs of sales resulting from a fair value adjustment to inventory acquired in the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition; (vii) impairment charges; and (viii) pension lump sum settlement charges. Such items are shown below in the table reconciling segment profit to consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes. Unallocated corporate expenses primarily include general and administrative expenses related to the corporate organization. These expenses are recorded in unallocated corporate expenses, as these items are centrally directed and controlled and are not included in internal measures of segment operating performance. The Company does not have any material inter-segment sales. 
The accounting policies for each of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “Description of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.” The Company's assets and liabilities are managed centrally and are reported internally in the same manner as the Consolidated Financial Statements; thus, no additional information regarding assets and liabilities of the Company’s reportable segments is produced for the Company's Chief Executive Officer or included in these Consolidated Financial Statements.

As of December 31, 2016, after giving effect to the Elizabeth Arden Acquisition, the Company had operations established in 26 countries outside of the U.S. and its products are sold throughout the world. Generally, net sales by geographic area are presented by attributing revenues from external customers on the basis of where the products are sold. Walmart and its affiliates worldwide accounted for approximately 17%, 18% and 16% of the Company’s worldwide net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and such sales are primarily included within the net sales of the Consumer segment.

20. BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE 
Shares used in basic earnings per share are computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Shares used in diluted earnings per share include the dilutive effect of unvested restricted stock under the Company’s Stock Plan using the treasury stock method. At December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 there were no outstanding stock options under the Company's Stock Plan.

The Company is involved in various routine legal proceedings incidental to the ordinary course of its business. The Company believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. 
As previously disclosed, following the announcement of the execution of the Elizabeth Arden Merger Agreement, several putative shareholder class action lawsuits and a derivative lawsuit were filed challenging the Merger. In addition to the complaints filed on behalf of plaintiffs Parker, Christiansen, Ross and Stein, on July 25, 2016, a lawsuit (Hutson v. Elizabeth Arden, Inc., et al., Case No. CACE-16-013566) (referred to as the “Hutson complaint”) was filed in the Seventeenth Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida (the “Court”) against Elizabeth Arden, the members of the board of directors of Elizabeth Arden, Revlon, Products Corporation and Acquisition Sub. In general, the Hutson complaint alleges that: (i) the members of Elizabeth Arden’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties to Elizabeth Arden’s shareholders with respect to the Merger, by, among other things, approving the Merger pursuant to an unfair process and at an inadequate and unfair price; and (ii) Revlon, Products

(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

Corporation and Acquisition Sub aided and abetted the breaches of fiduciary duty by the members of Elizabeth Arden’s board. The plaintiff seeks relief similar to that sought in the Parker case.
By Order dated August 4, 2016, all five cases were consolidated by the Court into a Consolidated Amended Class Action. Thereafter, on August 11, 2016 a Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint was filed, seeking to enjoin defendants from consummating the Merger and/or from soliciting shareholder votes. To the extent that the Merger was consummated, the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint seeks to rescind the Merger or recover rescissory or other compensatory damages, along with costs and fees. The grounds for relief set forth in the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in large part track those grounds as asserted in the five individual complaints, as previously disclosed. Class counsel advised that post consummation of the Merger they were going to file a Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. The Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint (which superseded the Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint) was ultimately filed on or about January 26, 2017. Like the Consolidated Amended Class Action complaint, the grounds for relief set forth in the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint in large part track those grounds as asserted in the five individual complaints.
The Company believes the allegations contained in the Second Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against them. Additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the Elizabeth Arden Merger Agreement or the Merger may be filed in the future.
The Company believes that the outcome of all pending legal proceedings in the aggregate is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. However, in light of the uncertainties involved in legal proceedings generally, the ultimate outcome of a particular matter could be material to the Company’s operating results for a particular period depending on, among other things, the size of the loss or the nature of the liability imposed and the level of the Company’s income for that particular period.
22. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS 
As of December 31, 2016, MacAndrews & Forbes beneficially owned approximately 77% of Revlon's Class A Common Stock representing approximately 77% of Revlon’s outstanding shares of voting capital stock. As a result, MacAndrews & Forbes is able to elect Revlon’s entire Board of Directors and control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of Revlon's stockholders. MacAndrews & Forbes is wholly-owned by Ronald O. Perelman, Chairman of Revlon’s Board of Directors. 
Transfer Agreements
In June 1992, Revlon and Products Corporation entered into an asset transfer agreement with Revlon Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and formerly a Delaware corporation known as Revlon Holdings Inc. ("Revlon Holdings"), and which is an affiliate and an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes, and certain of Revlon Holdings’ wholly-owned subsidiaries. Revlon and Products Corporation also entered into a real property asset transfer agreement with Revlon Holdings. Pursuant to such agreements, in June 1992, Revlon Holdings transferred certain assets to Products Corporation and Products Corporation assumed all of the liabilities of Revlon Holdings, other than certain specifically excluded assets and liabilities (the liabilities excluded are referred to as the "Excluded Liabilities"). Certain consumer products lines sold in demonstrator-assisted retailers considered not integral to the Company's business and that historically had not been profitable and certain other assets and liabilities were retained by Revlon Holdings. Revlon Holdings agreed to indemnify Revlon and Products Corporation against losses arising from the Excluded Liabilities, and Revlon and Products Corporation agreed to indemnify Revlon Holdings against losses arising from the liabilities assumed by Products Corporation. The amounts reimbursed by Revlon Holdings to Products Corporation for the Excluded Liabilities was $0.5 million, $0.3 million and $0.2 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. A receivable balance of nil and $0.2 million from MacAndrews & Forbes was included within prepaid expenses and other in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets for transactions subject to the Transfer Agreements, at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Reimbursement Agreements
Revlon, Products Corporation and MacAndrews & Forbes Inc. (a wholly-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes) have entered into reimbursement agreements (the "Reimbursement Agreements") pursuant to which: (i) MacAndrews & Forbes is obligated to provide (directly or through its affiliates) certain professional and administrative services, including, without limitation, employees, to the Company, and to purchase services from third party providers, such as insurance, legal, accounting and air transportation services, on behalf of the Company, to the extent requested by Products Corporation; and (ii) Products Corporation is obligated to provide certain professional and administrative services, including, without limitation, employees, to MacAndrews

(except where otherwise noted, all tabular amounts in millions, except share and per share amounts)

& Forbes and to purchase services from third party providers, such as insurance, legal and accounting services, on behalf of MacAndrews & Forbes, to the extent requested by MacAndrews & Forbes, provided that in each case the performance of such services does not cause an unreasonable burden to MacAndrews & Forbes or Products Corporation, as the case may be.
The Company reimburses MacAndrews & Forbes for the allocable costs of the services that MacAndrews & Forbes purchases for or provides to the Company and for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that MacAndrews & Forbes incurs in connection with the provision of such services. MacAndrews & Forbes reimburses Products Corporation for the allocable costs of the services that Products Corporation purchases for or provides to MacAndrews & Forbes and for the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Products Corporation in connection with the purchase or provision of such services. Each of the Company, on the one hand, and MacAndrews & Forbes, on the other, has agreed to indemnify the other party for losses arising out of the services provided by it under the Reimbursement Agreements, other than losses resulting from its willful misconduct or gross negligence. 
The Reimbursement Agreements may be terminated by either party on 90 days' notice. The Company does not intend to request services under the Reimbursement Agreements unless their costs would be at least as favorable to the Company as could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties. 
The Company participates in MacAndrews & Forbes' directors and officers liability insurance program (the “D&O Insurance Program”), as well as its other insurance coverages, such as property damage, business interruption, liability and other coverages, which cover the Company, as well as MacAndrews & Forbes and its subsidiaries. The limits of coverage for certain of the policies are available on an aggregate basis for losses to any or all of the participating companies and their respective directors and officers. The Company reimburses MacAndrews & Forbes from time to time for their allocable portion of the premiums for such coverage or the Company pays the insurers directly, which premiums the Company believes are more favorable than the premiums that the Company would pay were it to secure stand-alone coverage. Any amounts paid by the Company directly to MacAndrews & Forbes in respect of premiums are included in the amounts paid under the Reimbursement Agreements. 
The net activity related to services purchased under the Reimbursement Agreements during each 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $1.5 million, $2.1 million and $3.8 million, respectively, which primarily included partial payments made by the Company to MacAndrews & Forbes during the first quarter of 2016, 2015 and 2014 for premiums related to the Company's allocable portion of the 5-year renewal of the D&O Insurance Program for the period from January 31, 2012 through January 31, 2017 (which insurance coverage was renewed in January 2017 through January 2020). As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, a payable balance of $0.2 million and a receivable balance of $0.1 million, respectively, from MacAndrews & Forbes was included in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet for transactions subject to the Reimbursement Agreements.
Tax Sharing Agreements 
As a result of a debt-for-equity exchange transaction completed in March 2004 (the “2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions”), as of March 25, 2004, Revlon, Products Corporation and their U.S. subsidiaries were no longer included in the MacAndrews & Forbes Group for U.S. federal income tax purposes. See Note 16, “Income Taxes,” for further discussion on these agreements and related transactions in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Registration Rights Agreement 
Prior to the consummation of Revlon's initial public equity offering in February 1996, Revlon and Revlon Worldwide Corporation (which subsequently merged into REV Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes (“REV Holdings”)), the then direct parent of Revlon entered into a registration rights agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement"). In February 2003, MacAndrews & Forbes executed a joinder agreement to the Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which REV Holdings, MacAndrews & Forbes and certain transferees of Revlon's Common Stock held by REV Holdings (the "Holders") had the right to require Revlon to register under the Securities Act all or part of the Class A Common Stock owned by such Holders, including, without limitation, the shares of Class A Common Stock purchased by MacAndrews & Forbes in connection with Revlon's 2003 $50.0 million equity rights offering and the shares of Class A Common Stock which were issued to REV Holdings upon its conversion of all 3,125,000 shares of its Class B Common Stock in October 2013 (a "Demand Registration"). In connection with closing the 2004 Revlon Exchange Transactions and pursuant to the 2004 Investment Agreement, MacAndrews & Forbes executed a joinder agreement that provided that MacAndrews & Forbes would also be a Holder under the Registration Rights Agreement and that all shares acquired by MacAndrews & Forbes pursuant to the 2004 Investment Agreement are deemed to be registrable securities under the Registration Rights Agreement. This included all of the shares of Class A Common Stock acquired by MacAndrews & Forbes in connection with Revlon’s March 2006 $110 million rights offering of shares of its Class A Common Stock and related private placement to MacAndrews & Forbes, and Revlon’s January 2007 $100 million rights offering of shares of its Class A Common Stock and related private placement to MacAndrews & Forbes. Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, in 2009 Revlon registered under the Securities Act all 9,336,905 shares of Class A Common Stock issued to MacAndrews & Forbes in the 2009 Exchange Offer, in which, among other things, Revlon issued to MacAndrews & Forbes shares of Class A Common Stock at a ratio of one share of Class A Common Stock for each $5.21

of outstanding principal amount of the then-outstanding Senior Subordinated Term Loan that MacAndrews & Forbes contributed to Revlon. 
Revlon may postpone giving effect to a Demand Registration for a period of up to 30 days if Revlon believes such registration might have a material adverse effect on any plan or proposal by Revlon with respect to any financing, acquisition, recapitalization, reorganization or other material transaction, or if Revlon is in possession of material non-public information that, if publicly disclosed, could result in a material disruption of a major corporate development or transaction then pending or in progress or could result in other material adverse consequences to Revlon. In addition, the Holders have the right to participate in registrations by Revlon of its Class A Common Stock (a "Piggyback Registration"). The Holders will pay all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with any Demand Registration. Revlon will pay any expenses incurred in connection with a Piggyback Registration, except for underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses attributable to the shares of Class A Common Stock sold by such Holders. 
Other
Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Delpani’s Transition and Separation Agreement and Release with Revlon and Products Corporation, dated March 1, 2016 (as amended on April 21, 2016), in April 2016, the Company (i) repurchased from Mr. Delpani 72,895 shares of Revlon Class A Common Stock (representing vested, formerly restricted shares that Revlon granted to Mr. Delpani) for an aggregate purchase price of $2.7 million, based on the $36.83 NYSE per share closing price of Revlon Class A Common Stock on April 20, 2016; and (ii) paid Mr. Delpani $1.6 million as consideration for canceling his 65,703 restricted shares of Revlon Class A Common Stock that were otherwise scheduled to vest on March 15, 2017. Mr. Delpani ceased employment with the Company on March 31, 2016 and ceased to serve as Director in June 2016.
Certain of Products Corporation’s debt obligations, including the 2016 Credit Agreements and Products Corporation's Senior Notes, have been, and may in the future be, supported by, among other things, guarantees from all of Products Corporation's domestic subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions) and, for the 2016 Credit Agreements, guarantees from Revlon. The obligations under such guarantees are secured by, among other things, all of the capital stock of Products Corporation and, its domestic subsidiaries (subject to certain limited exceptions) and 66% of the capital stock of Products Corporation's and its domestic subsidiaries' first-tier foreign subsidiaries. See Note 11, “Long Term Debt,” for a discussion of the terms of the 2016 Credit Agreements and Senior Notes.
During 2016 and 2015, the Company engaged several companies in which MacAndrews & Forbes had a controlling interest to provide the Company with various ordinary course business services. These services included processing approximately $40.9 million and $32.9 million of coupon redemptions for the Company's retail customers for 2016 and 2015, respectively, for which the Company paid fees of approximately $0.4 million in both 2016 and 2015, and other similar advertising, coupon redemption and raw material supply services, for which the Company paid fees aggregating to less than $0.1 million in both 2016 and 2015. The Company believes that its engagement of each of these affiliates was on arm's length terms, taking into account each firm's expertise in its respective field, and that the fees paid were at least as favorable as those available from unaffiliated parties.
