 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
  
 Gilla Inc. (the “Company”, the “Registrant” or “Gilla”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 28, 1995 under the name of Truco, Inc. The Company later changed its name to Web Tech, Inc., and then to Cynergy, Inc., Mercantile Factoring Credit Online Corp., Incitations, Inc., Osprey Gold Corp. and to its present name. The Company adopted the present name, Gilla Inc., on February 27, 2007. The Company’s registered address is 475 Fentress Blvd., Unit L, Daytona Beach, Florida 32114.
 BUSINESS OF ISSUER
  
 The current business of the Company consists of the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of generic and premium branded e-liquid (“E-liquid”), which is used in vaporizers, electronic cigarettes (“E-cigarettes”), and other vaping hardware and accessories. E-liquid is heated by an atomizer to deliver the sensation of smoking (“vaping” or “vaporizing”) and sometimes even mimic traditional smoking implements, such as cigarettes or cigars, in their use and/or appearance, without burning tobacco. When vaporized, some E-liquids release nicotine, while others merely release flavored vapor, which allows users to replicate the smoking experience, nicotine free.
  
 Gilla aims to be a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of E-liquid for the vapor industry. The Company provides consumers with choice and quality across categories and price points to deliver the most efficient and effective vaping solutions for nicotine. The Company has global sales across 25 countries and currently has top recognized brands in countries such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.
  
 Gilla’s proprietary product portfolio includes the following brands: Coil Glaze™, Siren, The Drip Factory, Craft Vapes™, Craft Clouds, Surf Sauce, Vinto Vape, VaporLiq, Vape Warriors, Vapor’s Dozen, Miss Pennysworth’s Elixirs, The Mad Alchemist™, Replicant, Enriched CBD and Crown E-liquid™. The Company currently owns and markets 15 brands which is comprised of over 125 proprietary flavors.
  
 Gilla has built a strong platform for growth through investing in or acquiring in brands and distribution to consumers. Over the past two years, the Company has developed and acquired manufacturing operations, premium E-liquid brands and a global distribution platform. The Company has also made changes to its operating model to improve agility and responsiveness to consumer demand.
  
 The Company is building depth in its E-liquid product portfolio to meet consumer tastes, while maintaining a high degree of standards across all of its operations.

 The Company’s Products
  
 The Company’s current products include generic and premium branded E-liquid, the liquid used in vaporizers, E-cigarettes, and other vaping hardware and accessories (the “Products”). A vaporizer, or E-cigarette, is an electronic inhaler meant to simulate and substitute traditional cigarettes. Generally, a heating element, such as an atomizer, vaporizes the E-liquid solution to deliver the sensation of smoking, without burning tobacco. E-liquid is available with or without nicotine.

 E-liquid is a solution of propylene glycol (an organic compound that facilitates the vapor effect that can be found in many pharmaceutical and cosmetic products such as moisturizers) (“PG”), vegetable glycerin (“VG”), flavoring and, if stipulated, a variable percentage of pharmaceutical grade nicotine. The Company offers over 500 base flavors of generic E-liquid and a portfolio of premium branded E-liquid mixtures which are available in nicotine strengths ranging from 0 mg/ml to 24 mg/ml with varying proportions of PG and VG. An E-liquid with a higher VG content will deliver a thicker cloud of vapor when vaporized. The Company’s premium E-liquid brands have been meticulously developed and manufactured to satisfy enhanced flavor palates and are only available in limited flavors and nicotine strengths. E-liquids are generally available in nicotine strengths of 0 mg/ml, 1.5mg/ml, 3 mg/ml, 6 mg/ml, 12 mg/ml, 18 mg/ml and 24 mg/ml.
  
 The Company focuses purely on the development of proprietary E-liquid Products. As such, the Company does not manufacture any vaping hardware such as vaporizer modules, E-cigarettes or other vaping accessories. Any hardware sold by the Company is manufactured and supplied to the Company by third parties. The Company’s E-liquid Products are generally compatible with any brand or type of vaping hardware which continue to evolve rapidly.
  
  Premium Brand Portfolio
  
 The Company’s diversified portfolio approach to manufacturing and distributing E-liquid Products provides customers with the flexibility to select from Gilla’s catalog of premium brands to directly cater to unique consumer opportunities that exist in the niche marketplaces in which the Company operates. This allows the Company to allocate resources to its highest growth opportunities on a global scale. Gilla’s portfolio of brands offer a range of price points and flavor profiles enabling the Company to capitalize on preference shifts across the price and palate spectrum. The breadth and depth that the Company aims to develop within its portfolio will provide resilience and enable the Company to continue to grow over time.
  
 
 Gilla’s proprietary product portfolio includes the following brands: Coil Glaze™, Siren, The Drip Factory, Craft Vapes™, Craft Clouds, Surf Sauce, Vinto Vape, VaporLiq, Vape Warriors, Vapor’s Dozen, Miss Pennysworth’s Elixirs, The Mad Alchemist™, Replicant, Enriched CBD and Crown E-liquid™. The Company currently owns and markets 15 brands which is comprised of over 125 proprietary flavors.
  
  Research and Development
  
 Innovation forms an important part of Gilla’s growth strategy, playing a key role in positioning its brands for continued growth at the forefront of the vapor industry. The Company’s in-house mixologists and vaping experts are continually developing new E-liquid flavors to cater to emerging vaping trends and changing consumer demands. The Company’s in-house marketing and design specialists develop and launch new attractive brands and product offerings from the Company’s growing catalog of proprietary flavor recipes. Innovative new packaging and marketing components are also critical to Gilla’s ongoing customer and consumer relations. Gilla’s in-house compliance specialists also provide the Company with a first mover advantage to quickly respond to and adapt to changing local regulations globally.
 Manufacturing, Distribution, Principal Markets & Marketing Methods
  
  Manufacturing and Distribution Platform
  
 The Company maintains and operates its own manufacturing and distribution platform, which operate from leased premises in the United States (Daytona Beach, FL), Canada (Toronto, ON), Slovakia (Nove Zamky) and Hungary (Budapest). Gilla’s international logistics and supply chain management platform was developed by replicating successful distribution and marketing models of bottling and beverage companies, such as Coca Cola and Diageo, with an ultimate focus on servicing global clients locally with strong store level marketing support.

 Gilla sells its Products through a number of market channels including vape shops, retail and wholesale distributors, convenience stores, and e-commerce websites. A shift from cig-a-like E-cigarettes to vaporizer modules in the industry has led to vape shops and other retailers allocating more shelf space to E-liquid brands to satisfy the demand for liquids to refill vaporizer tanks. This market shift was driven by the E-cigarette’s power and flavor limitations as well as the better performance, affordability and overall user experience of the vaporizer. As a result, it is expected that the U.S. E-liquid industry will grow to $2.8B by 2025.
  
 One of the Company’s key strengths is its geographic reach. The Company currently services 25 countries covering three continents. The Company is focused on developing its sales and global distribution network by introducing new product offerings, sales incentives and promotional programs and best-in-class customer service.
  
  Retail and Vape Shops
  
 Gilla has developed a deep understanding of the vapor industry from both the wholesale buyer and consumer perspective. The Company uses this knowledge to create new products, services and programs that will assist the Company in cultivating long-term partnerships with its customers. There are over 19,000 vape shops globally with approximately half in the U.S. alone. Vape shops educate consumers through their knowledgeable vaping experts who assist customers in choosing from a number of different E-liquid flavors and products. Vape shops typically carry an assortment of both generic and premium E-liquid products that are differentiated by price and flavor complexity as well as an assortment of vaping hardware.
  
 Gilla leverages strong store level marketing support of its E-liquid Products such as targeted sales programs, promotions, best-in-class point-of-sale marketing and other sales giveaways to both end consumers and vape shop personnel to attract and incentivize vape shops to carry the Products and further increase shelf space and sell through. The Company focuses on servicing these vape shops locally with industry-leading customer service and by partnering with recognized distribution partners in those jurisdictions. These initiatives have proven to be successful for Gilla as the Products are available in vape stores internationally having top recognized brands in multiple countries in Europe such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Denmark.
  
 Gaining access to new vape shops and retail outlets is a distributor-driven business. As such, Gilla partners with leading local distributors which have access to retail networks and have existing infrastructure to distribute the Products. In certain jurisdictions across the EU, the Company has exclusive distribution partners of its Products who are required to maintain and grow sales by a pre-determined amount to maintain exclusivity. Assisting these distributors with Gilla’s store level marketing has proven to enhance sell-through and awareness.
  
  E-commerce
  
 The Company also distributes its Products through its websites and other online sales platforms. The Company believes that its online strategy will continue to evolve while expanding on various forms of social media as a key element in its marketing strategy and in further establishing and growing the Company’s E-liquid product portfolio.
 Gilla’s Business Model
  
 Gilla aims to be a global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of E-liquid for the vapor industry. The Company has grown through investments in manufacturing, E-liquid brands, distribution and acquisitions to both broaden Gilla’s portfolio depth and geographical footprint. The Company’s business model targets the high growth E-liquid industry to generate high margin returns on premium E-liquid brands to drive returns for its shareholders, while creating value for its customers and consumers.

  Employees
  
 As at the date of this Annual Report, the Company has eight (8) key individuals engaged as consultants and twenty-one (21) full-time employees. Collectively, these consultants and employees oversee day-to-day operations of the Company supporting management, administrative, bookkeeping, accounting, manufacturing, logistics, sales, marketing, and digital media functions of the Company. The Company also retains reputable external legal advisors and consultants with extensive knowledge of local laws and regulations. These legal advisors and consultants work in jurisdictions that the Company operates. The Company has no unionized employees.
  
 Being in the growth-stage, the Company intends to increase (or decrease) its number of employees as appropriate to achieve the Company’s objectives. The Company intends to focus on identifying, attracting and retaining talented, highly motivated, customer-focused, team-orientated employees to support its growth.
  
  Competition
  
 The market for the Company’s Products is very competitive and subject to rapid change and regulatory requirements. Generally, the E-liquid niche of the vapor industry is extremely competitive with low barriers to entry, however, recent regulatory requirements in the United States and the European Union have created regulatory hurdles and approvals for new entrants to those markets.
  
 The Company faces intense competition from direct and indirect competitors, including “big tobacco”, “big pharma”, and other known and established or yet to be formed E-liquid or vaping companies or brands, each of whom pose a competitive threat to the Company and its future business prospects. The Company expects competition to intensify in the future. Certain of these businesses are either currently competing with the Company or are focusing significant resources on providing products that will compete with the Company’s E-liquid Product offerings in the future.
  
 The Company’s principal competitors can be classified into three main categories: (i) E-liquid and vaping companies, (ii) tobacco companies, and (iii) pharmaceutical companies. The Company competes primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, service, marketing, advertising and price. The Company is subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of the business. The competitive environment and the Company’s competitive position can be significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, erosion of consumer confidence, competitors’ introduction of low-priced products or innovative products, cigarette or E-cigarette excise taxes, higher absolute prices and larger gaps between price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate products or ability to market products in certain jurisdictions.
  
 Traditional tobacco companies, including Reynolds American Inc., Altria Group Inc., Phillip Morris International Inc., British American Tobacco PLC and Imperial Tobacco Group PLC are expanding into various E-cigarette and vaping markets throughout the world. Each of these companies have launched their own E-cigarette offerings in markets where the Company currently sells its Products. Because of their well-established sales and distribution channels, marketing expertise and significant resources, “big tobacco” may be better positioned than small competitors, such as the Company, to capture a larger share of the vaping market. The Company also faces competition from smaller tobacco companies that are much larger, well capitalized, and more established than the Company.
  
 The Company faces direct competition from independent pure play E-cigarette and vaping companies, including Vapor Corp., Vapor Group, Inc., Electronic Cigarettes International Group Ltd., Vapor Hub International Inc. and other private companies that currently own, distribute and market competing products. The Company also faces indirect competition from the traditional tobacco companies offering cigarettes, nicotine replacement therapies (“NRT”) and smokeless tobacco products. It is likely that these companies will enter the market as the E-liquid and vapor industry grows. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully against any of these traditional tobacco players and smaller competitors, some of whom have greater resources, capital, industry experience, market penetration or developed distribution networks.

  Intellectual Property
  
 The Company seeks to protect its intellectual property using a combination of trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights and contractual provisions. Trademarks are expected to form an integral part of the Company’s brand marketing. The Company conducts intellectual property surveillance of direct and indirect competition as well as potential threats that would become the Company’s competition. This surveillance addresses direct and indirect competitors as well as threats that could be market followers or intellectual property barriers for future development.
 Trademarks
  
 The Company owns trademarks on certain of its brands including: Coil Glaze™, Craft Vapes™, The Mad Alchemist™ and Crown E-liquid™. The Company plans to continue to expand its portfolio of brand names and its proprietary trademarks worldwide as the business grows.
 Patents
  
 The Company does not own any domestic or foreign patents relating to its Products or vaporizers.
  
  Trade Secrets
  
 Certain aspects of the business, which management considers extremely valuable to the Company’s success and market leadership, have been retained as “in house” trade secrets in an effort to avoid public disclosure through the patent process. The decision to protect these intellectual property or proprietary information is primarily driven by the low profitability of being able to detect or establish infringement of such intellectual property.
 Contractual Restrictions
  
 The Company seeks to avoid disclosure of its intellectual property and proprietary information by requiring all employees as a condition of employment to enter into non-disclosure, confidentially and intellectual property assignment agreements. In addition, the Company will also generally enter into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with consultants, manufacturers’ representatives, distributors, suppliers and others to attempt to limit access to, use and disclosure of the Company’s proprietary information.
 Government Regulations
  
 Government authorities in the United States, the European Union, Canada and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing and export and import of electronic products for the vaporization and administration of inhaled doses of nicotine including E-liquid, E-cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and pipes, as well as cartridges of nicotine solutions and related vapor products. The Company must comply with these regulations, as applicable, in the jurisdictions where it offers and sells its Products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The following is a summary of the key regulatory matters generally affecting the E-liquid and vaping products marketplace in the United States, the European Union and Canada. This summary does not purport to be a comprehensive overview of all applicable laws and regulations that may impact the Company’s business.
 United States
  
 The United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) is permitted to regulate E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products as “tobacco products” under the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act of 2009 (the “Tobacco Control Act”), based on the December 2010 U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit’s decision in Sottera, Inc. v. Food & Drug Administration, 627 F.3d 891 (D.C. Cir. 2010). Furthermore, the FDA is not permitted to regulate E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products as “drugs” or “devices” or a “combination product” under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act unless marketed for therapeutic purposes.
   
9


 
 
 
 Since the Company does not market its Products for therapeutic purposes, the Company’s Products that contain nicotine are subject to being classified as “tobacco products” under the Tobacco Control Act. Although the FDA is prohibited from issuing regulations banning all cigarettes or all smokeless tobacco products, or requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero, the Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA broad authority to impose restrictions over the design, manufacture, distribution, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco. Furthermore, the FDA may be required to issue future regulations regarding the promotion and marketing of tobacco products sold or distributed over the internet, by mail order or through other non-face-to-face transactions in order to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors.
  
 The Tobacco Control Act also requires an establishment of a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee to provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to the safety, dependence or health issues related to tobacco products. The Tobacco Control Act could result in a decrease in tobacco product sales in the United States, including the sales of the Products.
  
 The FDA had previously indicated that it intended to regulate E-cigarettes under the Tobacco Control Act through the issuance of “Deeming Regulations” that would include E-liquid, E-cigarettes, and other vaping products (collectively, “Deemed Tobacco Products”) under the Tobacco Control Act and subject to the FDA’s jurisdiction.
  
 On May 10, 2016, the FDA issued the “Deeming Regulations” (the “Deeming Regulations”) which came into effect August 8, 2016. The Deeming Regulations amended the definition of “tobacco products” to include E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products. Deemed Tobacco Products include, but are not limited to, E-liquids, atomizers, batteries, cartomizers, clearomisers, tank systems, flavors, bottles that contain E-liquids and programmable software. Beginning August 8, 2016, Deemed Tobacco Products became subject to all FDA regulations applicable to cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, and other tobacco products which require:
  
   ●
 a prohibition on sales to those younger than 18 years of age and requirements for verification by means of photographic identification;

   ●
 health and addictiveness warnings on product packages and in advertisements;

   ●
 a ban on vending machine sales unless the vending machines are located in a facility where the retailer ensures that individuals under 18 years of age are prohibited from entering at any time;

   ●
 registration with, and reporting of product and ingredient listings to, the FDA;

   ●
 no marketing of new tobacco products prior to FDA review;

   ●
 no direct and implied claims of reduced risk such as "light", "low" and "mild" descriptions unless FDA confirms (a) that scientific evidence supports the claim and (b) that marketing the product will benefit public health;

   ●
 payment of user fees;

   ●
 ban on free samples; and

   ●
 childproof packaging.

 
 In addition, the Deeming Regulations requires any Deemed Tobacco Product that was not commercially marketed as of the “grandfathering” date of February 15, 2007, to obtain premarket approval before it can be marketed in the United States. Premarket approval could take any of the following three pathways: (1) submission of a premarket tobacco product application (“PMTA”) and receipt of a marketing authorization order; (2) submission of a substantial equivalence (“SE”) report and receipt of an SE order; or (3) submission of a request for an exemption from SE requirements (“SE Exemption”) and receipt of an SE exemption determination. The Company cannot predict if its Products, all of which would be considered “non-grandfathered”, will receive the required premarket approval from the FDA if the Company were to undertake obtaining premarket approval though any of the available pathways.
  
 Since there were virtually no E-liquid, E-cigarette or other vaping products on the market as of February 15, 2007, there is no way to utilize the less onerous SE or SE Exemption pathways that traditional tobacco companies can utilize. In order to obtain premarket approval, practically all E-liquid, E-cigarettes or other vaping products would have to follow the PMTA pathway which would cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per application. Furthermore, the Deeming Regulations also effectively froze the U.S. market on August 8, 2016 since any new E-liquid, E-cigarette or other vaping product would be required to obtain an FDA marketing authorization though one of the aforementioned pathways. Deemed Tobacco Products that were on the market prior to August 8, 2016 were provided with a two-year grace period where such products can continue to market until the August 8, 2018 PMTA submission deadline. Upon submission of a PMTA, products would then be given an additional twelve months of market access pending the FDA’s review. Without obtaining marketing authorization by the FDA prior to August 8, 2019, such products would be required to be removed from the market until such authorization could be obtained.

 State and local governments currently legislate and regulate tobacco products, including what is considered a tobacco product, how tobacco taxes are calculated and collected, to whom tobacco products can be sold and by whom, in addition to where tobacco products, specifically cigarettes may be smoked and where they may not. Certain municipalities have enacted local ordinances which preclude the use of E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products where traditional tobacco burning cigarettes cannot be used and certain states have proposed legislation that would categorize vaping products as tobacco products, equivalent to their tobacco burning counterparts. If these bills become laws, vaping products may lose their appeal as an alternative to traditional cigarettes, which may have the effect of reducing the demand for the Products.
  
 The Company may be required to discontinue, prohibit or suspend sales of its Products in states that require us to obtain a retail tobacco license. If the Company is unable to obtain certain licenses, approvals or permits and if the Company is not able to obtain the necessary licenses, approvals or permits for financial reasons or otherwise and/or any such license, approval or permit is determined to be overly burdensome to the Company then the Company may be required to cease sales and distribution of its Products to those states, which would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
  
 As a result of FDA import alert 66-41 (which allows the detention of unapproved drugs promoted in the U.S.), U.S. Customs has from time to time temporarily and in some instances indefinitely detained certain products. If the FDA modifies the import alert from its current form which allows U.S. Customs discretion to release the products, to a mandatory and definitive hold the Company may no longer be able to ensure a supply of raw materials or saleable product, which will have material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
  
 At present, neither the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act (which prohibits the use of the U.S. Postal Service to mail most tobacco products and which amends the Jenkins Act, which would require individuals and businesses that make interstate sales of cigarettes or smokeless tobacco to comply with state tax laws) nor the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act (which governs how cigarettes can be advertised and marketed) apply to E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products. The application of either or both of these federal laws to the Company’s Products would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
  
 The tobacco industry expects significant regulatory developments to take place over the next few years, driven principally by the World Health Organization’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (“FCTC”). The FCTC is the first international public health treaty on tobacco, and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. Regulatory initiatives that have been proposed, introduced or enacted include:
  
   ●
 the levying of substantial and increasing tax and duty charges;

   ●
 restrictions or bans on advertising, marketing and sponsorship;

   ●
 the display of larger health warnings, graphic health warnings and other labeling requirements;

   ●
 restrictions on packaging design, including the use of colors and generic packaging;

   ●
 restrictions or bans on the display of tobacco product packaging at the point of sale, and restrictions or bans on cigarette vending machines;

   ●
 requirements regarding testing, disclosure and performance standards for tar, nicotine, carbon monoxide and other smoke constituent levels;

   ●
 requirements regarding testing, disclosure and use of tobacco product ingredients;

   ●
 increased restrictions on smoking in public and work places and, in some instances, in private places and outdoors;

   ●
 elimination of duty free allowances for travelers; and

   ●
 encouraging litigation against tobacco companies.

 If E-liquid, E-cigarettes or other vaping products are subject to one or more significant regulatory initiatives enacted under the FCTC, the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.
  
  European Union
  
 On April 3, 2014, the European Union issued the “New Tobacco Product Directive” and is intended to regulate “tobacco products”, including cigarettes, roll-your-own tobacco, cigars and smokeless tobacco, and “electronic cigarettes and herbal products for smoking”, including E-liquid, E-cigarettes, refill containers, liquid holding tanks and E-liquid bottles sold directly to consumers. The New Tobacco Product Directive became effective May 20, 2016.
  
 The New Tobacco Product Directive introduces a number of new regulatory requirements for E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products, which includes the following: (i) restricts the amount of nicotine that E-cigarettes and E-liquid can contain; (ii) requires E-liquid, E-cigarettes and refill containers to be sold in child and tamper-proof packaging and nicotine liquids to contain only “ingredients of high purity”; (iii) provides that E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products must deliver nicotine doses at “consistent levels under normal conditions of use” and come with health warnings, instructions for their use, information on “addictiveness and toxicity”, an ingredients list, and information on nicotine content; (iv) significantly restricts the advertising and promotion of E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products; and (v) requires E-cigarette, E-liquid and other vaping product manufacturers and importers to notify EU Member States before placing new products on the market and to report annually such to Member States (including on their sales volumes, types of users and their “preferences”). Failure to make annual reports to Member State Competent Authorities or to properly notify prior to a substantive change to an existing product or introduction of a new product could result in the Company’s inability to market or sell its Products and cause material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
  
 The New Tobacco Product Directive requires Member States to transpose into law New Tobacco Product Directive provisions by May 20, 2016. An “EU directive” requires Member States to achieve particular results. However, it does not dictate the means by which they do so. Its effect depends on how Member States transpose the New Tobacco Product Directive into their national laws. Member States may decide, for example, to introduce further rules affecting E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products (for example, age restrictions) provided that these are compatible with the principles of free movement of goods in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The Tobacco Product Directive also includes provisions that allow Member States to ban specific E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products or specific types of E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products in certain circumstances if there are grounds to believe that they could present a serious risk to human health. If at least three Member States impose a ban and it is found to be duly justified, the European Commission could implement an European Union wide ban. Similarly, the New Tobacco Product Directive provides that Member States may prohibit a certain category of tobacco, flavouring or related products on grounds relating to a specific situation in that Member State for public health purposes. Such measures must be notified to the European Commission to determine whether they are justified.
  
 There are also other national laws in Member States regulating E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products. It is not clear what impact the new Tobacco Product Directive will have on these laws.
  
  Canada
  
 Health Canada has advised that electronic smoking products (i.e., electronic products for the vaporization and administration of inhaled doses of nicotine including electronic cigarettes, cigars, cigarillos and pipes, as well as cartridges of nicotine solutions and related products) fall within the scope of the Food and Drugs Act. All of these products require market authorization prior to being imported, advertised or sold in Canada. Market authorization is granted by Health Canada following successful review of scientific evidence demonstrating safety, quality and efficacy with respect to the intended purpose of the health product. To date, no electronic smoking product has been authorized for sale by Health Canada.
  
 In the absence of evidence establishing otherwise, an electronic smoking product delivering nicotine is regulated as a “new drug” under Division 8, Part C of the Food and Drug Regulations. In addition, the delivery system within an electronic smoking kit that contains nicotine must meet the requirements of the Medical Devices Regulations. Appropriate establishment licences issued by Health Canada are also needed prior to importing, and manufacturing electronic cigarettes. Products that are found to pose a risk to health and/or are in violation of the Food and Drugs Act and related regulations may be subject to compliance and enforcement actions in accordance with the Health Products and Food Branch Inspectorate’s Compliance and Enforcement Policy (POL-0001). According to Health Canada regulations, it is not permissible to import, advertise or sell electronic smoking products without the appropriate authorizations, and persons that violate these regulations are subject to repercussions from Health Canada, including but not limited to, seizure of the products.

 Since no scientific evidence demonstrating safety, quality and efficacy with respect to the intended purpose of E-liquid, E-cigarettes or other vaping products has been submitted to Health Canada to date, there is the possibility that in the future Health Canada may modify or retract the current prohibitions currently in place. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be in total compliance, remain competitive, or financially able to meet future requirements and regulations imposed by Health Canada.
  
 To date, Health Canada has not imposed any restrictions on E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products that do not contain nicotine. E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products that do not make any health claim and do not contain nicotine may be legally be sold in Canada. Thus, vendors can openly sell nicotine-free E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products. However, there are vape shops operating throughout Canada selling E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products containing nicotine without any implications from Health Canada. E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products are subject to standard product regulations in Canada, including the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act and the Consumer Packaging and Labelling Act.
  
 At present, neither the Tobacco Act (which regulates the manufacture, sale, labelling and promotion of tobacco products) nor the Tobacco Products Labelling Regulations (Cigarettes and Little Cigars) (which governs how cigarettes can be advertised and marketed) apply to E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products. The application of these federal laws to E-liquid, E-cigarettes and other vaping products would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.
  
  BACKGROUND AND HISTORY OF THE ISSUER
  
 The Company is the resulting entity of a reverse merger on November 21, 2012 of a company engaged in the sale and distribution of E-cigarettes and vaporizers. Prior to the reverse merger, the Company was a mineral-property development company. On November 21, 2012, the reverse merger was completed and the principal business of the Company was that of the sale and distribution E-cigarettes. The current business of the Company consists of the manufacturing, marketing and distribution of generic and premium branded E-liquid, which is used in vaporizers, E-cigarettes, and other vaping hardware and accessories.
  
 The Company has focused building a strong platform for growth though investing in brands and distribution to consumers. Over the past two years, the Company has developed and acquired manufacturing operations, premium E-liquid brands and a global distribution platform.
  
  Acquisition of E-liquid Manufacturing Business
  
 On July 1, 2015, the Company closed the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of E Vapor Labs Inc. (“E Vapor Labs”), a Florida based E-liquid manufacturer. Pursuant to a share purchase agreement, dated June 25, 2015, the Company acquired E Vapor Labs for a total purchase price of $1,125,000 payable to the vendors of E Vapor Labs on the following basis: (i) $225,000 in cash on closing; and (ii) $900,000 in promissory notes issued on closing. The promissory notes were issued in three equal tranches of $300,000 due four (4), nine (9) and eighteen (18) months respectfully from closing. The promissory notes were all unsecured, non-interest bearing, and on each respective maturity date for each of the three tranches of promissory notes issued, at the option of the vendors, up to one-third of each tranche of the promissory notes could be repaid in Common Shares of the Company, calculated using the five day weighted average closing market price prior to the maturity of the promissory notes. The promissory notes were all subject to adjustments as outlined in the share purchase agreement.
  
 The acquisition of E Vapor Labs provided the Company with its own E-liquid manufacturing platform located in the United States. The scalability of this manufacturing facility provided the Company with an opportunity to continue to manufacture and distribute private-label products for E Vapor Labs’ existing clientele while at the same time providing the Company with the required infrastructure to aggressively pursue a consolidation strategy of the highly-fragmented E-liquid industry to build the Company’s global E-liquid portfolio and manufacture such Products in house.
