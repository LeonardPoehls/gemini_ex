 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
  
  Corporate History
  
 We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 5, 2007. Effective June 15, 2011, we completed a merger with our subsidiary, Titan Iron Ore Corp., a Nevada corporation, which was incorporated solely to effect a change in our name to “Titan Iron Ore Corp.”
  
 As of December 31, 2013, Titan Iron Ore Corp. was a mineral exploration company. Due to our inability to raise capital to further develop mining claims and pursue mineral exploration, we decided to exit the mining business and look for other opportunities.
  
 On February 3, 2014, we completed a merger with iHookup Social, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“iHookup”) pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”) dated January 31, 2014. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we incorporated a new subsidiary called iHookup Operations Corp, a Delaware corporation, which merged with and into iHookup, causing the subsidiary’s separate existence to cease and iHookup to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. iHookup’s stockholders exchanged all of their twelve million (12,000,000) shares of outstanding common stock for fifty million (50,000,000) shares of the Company’s newly designated Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of common stock entitles its holder to one vote on each matter submitted to the stockholders.  The holders of preferred stock are entitled to cast votes equal to the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of common stock into which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder are convertible. The total aggregate issued shares of Series A Preferred Stock at any given time regardless of their number shall be convertible into the number of shares of common stock which equals nine (9) times the total number of shares of common stock which are issued and outstanding at the time of any conversion, at the option of the preferred holders or until the closing of a Qualified Financing (i.e. the sale and issuance of our equity securities that results in gross proceeds in excess of $2,500,000) at one time or in the same round. As a result of the transaction, the former Friendable stockholders received a controlling interest in the Company due to the voting rights of the Series A Preferred Stock being connected to their super-majority conversion rights.
  
 On April 29, 2014, FINRA approved a 20 for 1 reverse stock split whereby 937,459,274 shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding, were exchanged for 46,872,964 shares of the Company’s common stock.
  
 On March 19, 2015, FINRA approved a 100 for 1 reverse stock split whereby 2,355,489,991, shares of the Company’s common stock then issued and outstanding, were exchanged for 23,554,923 shares of the Company’s common stock.
  
 On October 26, 2015, the Company issued a press release announcing that FINRA had approved a change to our trading symbol for our common stock which is quoted on the OTC Pink marketplace. Effective October 27, 2015 our trading symbol was changed from “HKUP” to “FDBL”. This change was made in conjunction with the Company’s filing of a Certificate of Amendment on September 28, 2015 to its Articles of Incorporation changing the name of the Company from “iHookup Social, Inc.” to “Friendable, Inc.” The company had previously announced a re-branding our app from "iHookup Social" to "Friendable". As a result, the Company desired to change its name to match the rebranding so as to be more specific to the Company’s core values and its products/services, creating a more recognizable brand that creates less confusion.
  
  Who We Are
  

 The Company is a mobile-social technology company focused on connecting and engaging users through two distinct applications that expand beyond today’s limitations: Friendable and Fan Pass.
 
 The Company’s first product is the Friendable app, a mobile social application for mobile devices where users can create one-on-one or group-style meet-ups for food, drinks, live music, or any other occasion. Since its inception in 2013, Friendable has generated more than 1 million downloads, 700,000 registered users, and 580,000 user profiles, and has been featured in popular music videos such as the 2016 hit “Ain’t Your Mama” by singer Jennifer Lopez (over 390 million views on YouTube). We seek to expand the application’s current user base while continuously updating functionalities to best enhance the user experience.
 
 In 2017, the Company intends to release Fan Pass, a live streaming video application where fans can watch exclusive back-stage and uncensored video content from their favorite performing artists and celebrities. The Company is currently establishing partnerships with prominent artists including Austin Mahone, Meghan Trainor, Fetty Wap, and more. Through these celebrity partnerships, the Company believes Fan Pass will convert immense, built-in fan bases into the application’s initial viewership base, making quick and large scalability a real option.

  Mobile Applications
  
  Introduction
  
 
  The Friendable Mobile Application:
  
  Friendable is a "friends-first" approach to making new connections. Unlike platforms like Facebook and Instagram where users post what they did in the past, Friendable is focused on living in the present and looking forward to the future:
 
   ■
 Friendable is a mobile application where users can create meet-up events that can be shared to one person or multiple individuals.

   ■
 Users can select which type of event they would like to create or attend, separated by categories like “Food,” “Movies,” and more.

   ■
 Users with similar interests and locations will be matched together, and will then be able to chat with one another to coordinate a meet-up time and place.

   ■
 Users can look up current events and send gifts to other users.

   ■
 Users can friend other users to meet-up again, creating a social network of goers and adventurers.

 
 As of April 2017, Friendable has been downloaded over 1 million times across iOS and Android.
 
  “Everything Starts with Friendship.”
 
 Management believes that its Friendable app brand, feature set and over all appeal to a broad base of social user demographics will assist in the company's goal of building millions of registered users across the US and worldwide. The company's number one focus and growth metric is registered users, with users equating to valuation drivers in the current market sector of Friendable. As critical mass continues to build in terms of registered users, management believes millions of users may attract other social media giants to Friendable for potential M&A discussions, it should be noted that users have been the basis for M&A activity by such companies that have deep monetization engines that can benefit from the acquisition of users in a specific demographic.

   ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

 Friendable is a “location specific” Social platform, as well as a discovery application that facilitates communication between two or more users on a one to one meeting or “group style” event based meet ups for concerts, sporting events, coffee, movies, night out etc. The Friendable app utilizes the intelligence of GPS and location specific recommendations to provide opportunities to make new connections for the purpose of socializing, networking, dating or simply expanding existing social circles.

Brand Positioning & Demographic
-------------------------------
● | Young 
● | Energetic 
● | Adventurous 
● | Casual & Friendly


 

 The app is currently available on the Apple iOS platform and in iTunes stores world-wide where Friendable offers a free version and a paid version of the app. The app is also available on the Android platform and in the Google Play Store for a FREE download. The applications also offer a “virtual currency” component, allowing users to purchase “in application” coin packs that activate virtual gifts and various additional service-based options. Friendable has recently announced a completely FREE model to assist with its user acquisition strategy as well as to test engagement/usage metrics as the company scales its user base; the FREE option is subject to change based on the company’s marketing strategies going forward.
  
  The Fan Pass Live Application (Development Project)
 
 Fan Pass will be an online, mobile-based, video application that the Company believes will empower artists, musicians, athletes, and celebrities to deliver live, exclusive video content to their fan bases. It will be available on both iOS and Android operating systems, and fans will be able to view content on the personal channels of their favorite stars. To access these Fan Pass channels, viewers will pay a small monthly subscription fee; additionally, fans have the option of subscribing to an individual channel for a smaller fee. Examples of content may include:

   ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued
 
■ Backstage access before, during or after an event ■ Recording studio sessions ■ Behind-the-scenes looks on music video, film, or photoshoot sets ■ On-set makeup or wardrobe trailers ■ Special interviews or one-on-one video sessions with celebrities ■ Daily looks into the lives of celebrities, artists, and stars ■ …and more VIP exclusive content In addition, fans will be able to chat with other fans before, during, and after the live stream; view older, archived live videos; and subscribe to an individual broadcast instead of a channel. We believe that, especially for a large event like a music festival or concert, the option for fans to briefly purchase a broadcast or view an older broadcast increases the likelihood of added subscriptions. For artists, Fan Pass will offer several levels of revenue-sharing with them and their agencies. Each artist will be asked to market their Fan Pass channel to their social followers and fans, ultimately generating subscription revenue for the Company. The revenue-sharing ecosystem is designed to help celebrities monetize their fans and followers at fairer rates compared to other video streaming applications; Fan Pass will be able to be used in conjunction with other video applications to bolster their income. Lastly, Fan Pass will offer video production and recording services for artists if they do not want to record their own streams.

  “Empowering artists everywhere to deliver live, exclusive video content.”
  
  Marketing
  
 We market our applications utilizing a variety of online and offline marketing activities.
  
 The Company believes various marketing initiatives will combine celebrity driven outreach to social media followers and fans, specialized content, digital marketing, and live event marketing to optimize market reach.
 
  Fan Pass Celebrity Marketing: Celebrity partners will utilize social media, music videos, live events and existing fan marketing to market Fan Pass Live and Friendable app.
 
  Friendable Event Marketing: The Friendable, Inc. marketing / business development team will market the application at live events around music video releases, concerts, private events, promotional events, and other festivities. In addition, video and photography crews will take pictures and videos at events for public relations and social media.
 
  Digital Marketing: The Company will utilize digital marketing avenues such as: celebrity direct-to-fan; digital ad campaigns on social media and search engines; search engine optimization; and other digital marketing initiatives that will utilize celebrity and user generated content for maximum market reach.
 
 Friendable, Inc. has ambitious plans to launch a strategic marketing plan following the company’s ability to achieve a minimum of $3 million in funding. The Company intends to utilize online and offline avenues to reach its target markets and position its applications atop the marketplace.
 
 The Company will utilize online marketing channels such as Google and social media marketing, display advertising, and online publications. The Company will continually track cost of user acquisition, the lifetime value of each customer, and ROI of all marketing expenditures to reduce expenses and increase overall profit margins.
 
 The Company will also utilize offline marketing tactics. While older generations may still exude a level of reluctance to forming friendships online, Millennials in particular are much more comfortable and likely to seek out new friendships online. Thus, marketing efforts will include the creation of a promotions team that will generate visibility for Friendable and Fan Pass by promoting the brand at venues and events that are popular spots for Millennials to socialize. These places will include fairs, bars, pubs, popular restaurants, concerts, and college campuses. And many of these locations will also benefit Fan Pass through cross-promotional opportunities.

   ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued

 In addition, partnerships with musicians, artists, athletes, and other celebrities will be incredibly important for generating increased visibility and growing the Fan Pass viewership by tapping into the celebrity’s built-in audience base and thereby gaining viewers virally. Celebrities will also be able to market the app on their personal social media accounts.
 
 The creation of a business development team that will curate the Company’s internal and external growth goals, and traditional forms of advertising such as television and radio are also key avenues for Friendable and Fan Pass. The goal of using these channels is to create a platform for the long-term success and brand awareness of both social media applications. A matrix of the Company’s planned marketing channels is listed below:
  
 
  Marketing Initiatives
 

  Direct Marketing
 
  Strategic Partnerships
  Strategic partnerships will be important for both Friendable and Fan Pass. Friendable may seek to partner with particular event venues and locales to host sponsored Friendable events that will encourage use of the application and subsequently bring business to the hosts. Examples include a bar potentially hosting a special Friendable happy hour event or a theater venue holding a special screening for app users.
 
 In the end, however, strategic partnerships will prove to be even more essential for the Fan Pass brand. Fan Pass aims to partner with artists, musicians, actors, and other content creators to create exclusive content and tap into their audience bases. To do so, Fan Pass must accurately convey to each target partner the benefits of partnering with the Company. The primary benefits of partnering with Fan Pass include larger and additional amounts of revenue gained through using the app versus using competitors’ apps. Currently, notable celebrity partners to the Company have included Jennifer Lopez, Usher, Britney Spears, Austin Mahone, Fetty Wap, and more. These celebrities will also help market the Fan Pass application through social media, live events, promotions, and other occasions.
 
 In addition, the Company will partner with fellow businesses – including talent agencies and big name brands - to cross-promote each other’s products or services. The Company will inform potential business partners of the mutual benefits of sponsoring Fan Pass, from product placement at live events, radio and print participation, web site placement, co-branded merchant giveaways, and access to a specific target demographic through Fan Pass’s celebrities. Current business partners include notable talent agencies.
 
  Business Development Team
  To better form partnerships with other companies and celebrities, Friendable and Fan Pass intends to employ an experienced business development team that focuses entirely on promotion and getting potential partners onboard. The business development team’s responsibilities include attending meetings between potential partners and creating a viable presentation that accurately and efficiently promotes the brand and value proposition. The team will also oversee the effective curation of marketing and advertising initiatives, all with the goal of implementing initiatives that are capable of delivering the maximum impact possible.

   ITEM 1. BUSINESS - continued
  Events and Promotions Team
  Friendable and Fan Pass will host special events and promotions with the goal of increasing brand awareness and creatively presenting their many features and functions available via both platforms to the public. The Company will be able to showcase its overall mission and vision. An important step is for promoters to be sent out to wherever people are hanging out using both apps including bars, clubs, sports games, festivals, fairs, concerts, and college campuses among other possibilities. These events will include giveaways and may even feature celebrities attending. The Company will record video and take photos of their presence at these events to be used as future promotional tools.
Digital Marketing
 
  E-mail Lists
  The Company will also secure a comprehensive database of user contact information and general preferences during the application registration process. Utilizing this extensive database, Fan Pass and Friendable will be able implement a series of direct-email initiatives that will continue to engage current users, capture new customers, and drive the Company’s brand further.
 Pay Per Click (PPC)
  The Company’s market penetration strategy will include the use of paid traffic in the form of digital advertising. Digital advertising is a highly effective marketing technique, and will help the Company reach potential users, business partners, and other opportunities for its platform.
 
   ■
 Friendable will advertise on Google using Google AdWords and banner advertisements on third party websites, bidding to gain higher ad placement at the top of search engine results pages.


   ■
 Initially, the Company will study the search engine marketing terms of its competitors.


   ■
 Friendable will then take the successful terms and use them for its own advertising.


 As the Company learns more about its users and the life-time-value of each type of user, the Company will expand its search engine marketing to a larger selection of keywords. These keywords will include relevant phases such as “friendship apps,” “looking for friends,” “where to find friends,” and more. With regards to Fan Pass, key phrases could be, “live video,” “live streaming application,” and “live video streaming.”
 
  Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
  The Company will utilize resources towards implementing an aggressive Search Engine Optimization (SEO) strategy.
 
   ■
 Friendable will optimize the search engine rankings for keywords related to the Friendable and Fan Pass applications.

   ■
 The Company will also focus on accumulating inbound links, instituting a blog, and establishing a social media presence with the goal of achieving a higher organic Google, Bing, and Yahoo search ranking.

   ■
 The organic ranking earned by the Friendable website will bring authority to the Company as a leading, established industry leader and the company responsible for the go-to apps that men and women will use in order to find friends and events around them, and that gives them the option to simultaneously stream and produce live video content.

 
 The Company will be strategic in the search engine keywords it optimizes for and will specifically focus on keywords that have low ranking difficulty and have high purchase intent.

  Social Media Marketing
  Social media is one of the most affordable and personal marketing outlets available to mobile applications. Friendable will use social media outlets such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to gain access to potential customers. The Company will utilize these platforms to post updates, news about upcoming events, and more.
 
  Social Media Advertisements: Friendable will utilize Facebook and Instagram as a hub to introduce the Company’s brand to potential users. The Company will advertise on Facebook and Instagram on a Cost Per Install (CPI) basis. These ads will take potential users directly to the Friendable and Fan Pass app-store storefront or website.
 
  Influencer Marketing: Friendable will engage with social media influencers – such as models, artists, actors, athletes and more - to promote to designated audience bases. Influencers on social media outlets like Instagram have large followings that can be easily marketed to. Friendable will work in tandem with important influencers that will broaden the Company’s market reach.
 
  Social Media and Blog Posts: Posts on Friendable’s social media outlets or through the blog posts of partners will engage followers and new audiences.
 
  Branding
  The Fan Pass application will serve as a natural marketing tool, in the same manner as the Friendable application. Fan Pass will launch an application that will feature an engaging UI design that is both visually appealing and functional, and also capable of establishing strong brand identity.
 
   ■
 Through the application, viewers can easily watch live or recorded videos, chat with other viewers, search for their favorite celebrity’s channel, and connect with other friends.

   ■
 The app’s logo, color scheme, and font will be atheistically pleasing.

   ■
 Navigation between each of the app’s functionalities will be seamless and quick.

   ■
 Videos will be uploaded efficiently and with high quality.

 
 Through these avenues, Fan Pass will create an easy-to-use live-streaming application that will generate consistent user interaction, and Friendable will continue to develop as a mobile-social platform.
 
  Retargeting
  Retargeting works by tracking online users who visit the Company website and continue to advertise to them through banner ads on external websites and search engines via Google AdWords and Analytics. The cost of behavioral retargeting is typically a fraction of traditional banner advertising. Assuming a conservative $5 cost per mille (CPM), Fan Pass and Friendable will show up to 10 impressions per retargeted user. This means that the Company will spend 5 cents per customer in behavioral retargeting costs, which is an affordable and effective marketing strategy.
Print and Media
 
  Radio & Podcasts
  Friendable and Fan Pass will potentially consider purchasing radio and podcast ads during broadcast hours and at stations that best target the desired audience.
 
   ■
 Rather than advertising across all radio and podcast stations, costs can be minimized by advertising specifically at stations that target the youthful Millennial demographic and that consistently play musical content that is produced by artists that the Company has partnerships with.


   ■
 Radio and podcast commercial production can be done cost-effectively, and provides flexibility to tailor the message to the right customer segment.


   ■
 Radio also offers the opportunity to work closely with the appropriate stations to use unique promotions to build awareness and drive user acquisition.


  Commercials
  Utilizing targeted commercials that are geared specifically to be distributed online via successful channels and influencers provide Friendable with a powerful tool.
 
   ■
 These commercials can be shared amongst friends if they like the content.


   ■
 By focusing more on producing online commercials, the Company can better target consumers and not worry about network censorship, and can have more creative content such as slightly more offensive and humorous commercial campaigns. This is particularly oriented towards Fan Pass and it’s behind-the-scenes capabilities.


   ■
 Commercials will feature Friendable and Fan Pass partnered celebrities, and other people that have used the applications.

 Print media & Other Publications
  Friendable and Fan Pass will place ads in notable magazines that are popular with Millennials to promote its brand. The Company will also purchase ad space in sections of major US newspapers and relevant publications. Also, the Company will partner with online publications to increase mentions of the app throughout the blogosphere and written content space.
 Revenue
  
 The Friendable application generates revenue through advertisements on the application and sponsorships. Revenue will vary depending on the client in question.
 
 The Company believes the Fan Pass application will generate revenue through five avenues:
 
   ■
 advertising revenue from both live and archived videos

   ■
 a monthly fee for all Fan Pass channels

   ■
 an annual subscription fee for all Fan Pass channels

   ■
 a one-time fee for an individual broadcast

   ■
 Sales of merchandise, including t-shirts, hats, and more

 
 The company's revenue model is to incorporate and derive revenue from subscription fees, in-app purchases (upgrades/coins purchased by users, using the app) as well as advertising/sponsorship, product placement and event based opportunities as user population density, overall user growth and active user sessions grow to support active page views that typically translate to various revenue streams.
 Market Opportunity
  
  Market Overview: Fan Pass
 
  As the need for video streaming grows, so too, the Company believes, does the market opportunity for platforms like Fan Pass. Fan Pass will be a video streaming application that offers exclusive behind-the-scenes video access to celebrities. Consumers will pay a subscription fee to see videos of their favorite musicians at concerts, get a glimpse of their daily lives, or even interact with them. Viewings will include a look inside celebrity tour busses, rooms, private jets, and recording studio sessions, as well exclusive first interviews and back stage entry. Fan Pass aims to increase its market share and build viewership by allowing celebrities to monetize their respective fan-bases through exclusive video features.

  Intellectual Property
  
 We intend, in due course, subject to legal advice, to apply for trademark, copyright and/or patent protection in the United States and other jurisdictions. We regard our intellectual property, including our software and trademark, as valuable assets and intend to vigorously defend them against infringement. 
  
 While there can be no assurance that registered trademarks and copyrights will protect our proprietary information, we intend to file for protection and assert our intellectual property rights against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights can result in a substantial cost to, and diversion of effort by, our Company, management believes that the protection of our intellectual property rights is an important part of our operating strategy.
  
  Development Update
  
 We had several releases approved by Apple in 2016 for each of the companies IOS applications.  In addition, we developed and launched a new version of our Friendable application for Android devices on Google Play! These applications are heavily connected to a cloud based server application. The overall server architecture and infrastructure was upgraded and the underlying code was heavily optimized and updated as well. Here is a summary of the development features that were accomplished in 2016:
  
   1.
 Developed semi-automated production and development environments for the friendable server code in order to manage new code pushes and auto scaling servers. This allows the Company to easily test new features in a development environment, and then push successful code to all of our production servers at the push of a button.

 
   2.
 Heavily optimized server code in an effort to handle large traffic spikes generated by celebrity marketing campaigns. After a small hiccup on the first celebrity event, the optimized code was successfully able to handle the much larger server loads associated with the other celebrity events without any issues.

 
   3.
 Several updates were completed throughout the year to all of our applications, making the them compatible with the latest IOS and Android operating system releases, bettering the user experience, and fixing bugs.

 
   4.
 In 2016, the Company designed and began development of its brand new application – Fan Pass Live.

 
 Fan Pass Live Feature Set (currently in development):
  
 1. Broadcasting
  Description
  A broadcaster can utilize the app to create a live video stream that their subscribers can
  access. A user will be granted broadcast privileges by Friendable through a backend
  admin system. Once a user is given broadcast privileges they will receive a notification
  through the mobile app, and the broadcast UI features will be enabled. The Friendable
  admin team can grant or remove broadcasting privileges for any user at any time.
  
 2. Child Broadcasters

  Child Broadcasters are a special subclass of broadcaster with limited broadcasting
  privileges. A user can be designated as a child broadcaster of another full-privilege
