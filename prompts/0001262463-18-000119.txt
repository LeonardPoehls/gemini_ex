ITEM 1. BUSINESS OVERVIEW
DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS
 
The Radiant Creations Group, Inc., formerly known as Nova Mining Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated in Nevada on December 29, 2005. From inception, the Company's principal business activity was the acquisition and exploration of mineral resources. On June 20, 2013, following a change of control and subsequent acquisition of an exclusive license agreement, certain assets and processes to innovative technologies in skin protection and enhancement, which consist of various proprietary products including an anti-aging and revitalizing skin cream generally under the "Radiant Creations" label, the Company changed its principal business to the development and marketing of unique and proprietary scientific technologies and cosmetic and over-the-counter personal enhancement products and devices.
CURRENT MARKETING PLAN
 
Radiant Creations manages and deploys marketing campaigns as its means for generating revenues. The campaign process depends on outside services and in-house staff, which collectively contribute to its success:
 
Customer Service: Customer Service is a necessary part of every product-merchandising firm, but particularly when you work in Direct Response where “buyer’s remorse” may occur more frequently. Radiant Creations contracts top of the line Customer Service that is based out of the US and made up of highly trained individuals, saving sales that might otherwise result in returns or dissatisfied customers. The familiarity of our Customer Service Staff with our complete inventory is vital to the integrity of Radiant Creations, as it appeases almost every customer inquiry. Customer Service staff is trained specifically to ensure customer satisfaction, and utilizes the services of an overflow center to ensure that calls are handled in a prompt manner.
 
Call Centers: Radiant Creations’ Call Center services are provided by third party contractors that provide live response buyer verification services on internet campaigns. The program however, is not driven by front-end profits as in similar business models through a variety of upsell programs; instead, our Call Center services are established to monitor and endorse long-term growth and reduce incidence of fraud or consumer dissatisfaction.
 
Fulfillment: Our Fulfillment services provide real time tracking capability, which allows Radiant Creations to fulfill most orders within 24 hours. As such, we are able to guarantee timely, accurate shipments at great rates. Regardless of quantity, time frame, or weight Radiant Creations will process orders efficiently. The knowledgeable Fulfillment Center Staff works from early in the morning to late at night every day making sure each and every order ships timely and successfully.
 
MARKETING STRATEGY

Radiant's product marketing plan is based on a 4-part strategy for year 2016. Our strategy is designed to maximize cash inflow from the existing revenues while increasing growth through engaging additional marketing affiliate partners, acquiring additional investment capital infusion and new product development.
 The steps are as follows:
 1. Current Trial Sale Marketing Program: Our current trial sale marketing program is an on-line continuity model that requires an initial high level of investment capital inflow in order to achieve an extremely high level of gross revenue outflow upon reaching the 3rd billing cycle.
 Our customers receive the product on the first trial order at a competitive trial price (the shipping costs). Radiant engages a professional marketing company that acquires the customers at a flat rate acquisition fee, per customer. If the customer chooses to keep the initial product then they are charged the remaining full price of continuing on a monthly basis until the customer chooses to cancel the subscription offer.
 The explosive profitability comes into play when the customer is repeatedly retained. The longer one can retain the customer the more profitable the sale becomes as a result of the "one time" (initial) customer acquisition cost. Industry averages for a customer retained longer than three billing cycles is considered an extremely good customer. Additional factors that keep customer retention levels high include good Company/Customer communications, timely customer service response time for customers inquiring about the products and most importantly, an effective product with impressive packaging, which Radiant has achieved.
 2. Ad Exchange Marking Group: Management initially engaged Ad Exchange Group (Ad Exchange) as they presented an easy program entry concept including a secondary partnership with an ancillary wrinkle removing eye serum product. The majority of on-line trial sale marketing campaigns are sold in two-part steps. In our program, Revivasol is Step 1 and the wrinkle removing eye serum product is Step 2. Currently, Radiant's Eye Serum product to be paired with Revivasol is under development and is expected to be completed by mid-summer. Working with Ad Exchange Group, we were able to partner with the ancillary product that allowed us to put Revivasol into the hands of the consumer and create a strong reoccurring revenue stream for Radiant Creations.
 Using Ad Exchange Group, Radiant is currently running approximately 300 new customer sales per week (traffic). Company sales with Ad Exchange Group began in early February, 2016.
 Thereafter, this model based on one Radiant product (Revivasol) will continue to grow organically for six months before plateauing at a level of above $150,000 gross revenue per month or $450,000 gross revenue per quarter. Although confident in our ability to expand the Revivasol revenue stream using the Ad Exchange Group platform Management prefers to diversify its risk by engaging a secondary marking company and expanding its affiliate marketing strategy.
 3. Jumbleberry Marketing Group: In order to diversify the Company marketing risk and further expand our affiliate marketing revenue stream, Management has undertaken a strategic partnership with Jumbleberry Marking Group. Jumleberry offers a successful trial sale marketing platform similar to that of Ad Exchange Group which requires Radiant to utilize a two-step product marketing model. Therefore, Radiant has engaged its manufacture AIG Technologies to formulate a fresh and unique wrinkle removing eye serum.
 Jumbleberry has been in the online marking industry for several years and has built a strong affiliate marking system that allows customers like Radiant to reach numbers as high as 5,000 new customers per week. With the completion of our step-2 product by early to mid-summer, 2016, Radiant will begin running new customer traffic through the Jumbleberry's platform in addition to existing traffic we continue to run with Ad Exchange Group. Management intends to initially run an additional 700 new sales per week increasing to 900-1200 new sales thereafter. These new sales numbers will produce substantial revenue gross in future quarters through the Jumleberry platform alone.
 4. Additional Ad-on Products: With the completion of the Company's 2-step products and engaging the Jumbleberry marketing program Management intends to add two additional ancillary products to both the Ad Exchange Group and the Jumbleberry marketing platforms. The products will include Revivasol SPF-15 and Revivasol Spot Remover. Minimal set-up costs are required for both affiliate marketers as these products will be added onto the existing website sales pages with no additional customer acquisition costs incurred. The products will not be sold as part of the trial sale but as a one-time purchase for customers that desire these products as an up-sell item. Management anticipates these additional sales will produce substantial gross revenue per quarter with a extremely high profit margins as a result of not requiring additional customer acquisition costs or marketing expenses other than website up-grades.
