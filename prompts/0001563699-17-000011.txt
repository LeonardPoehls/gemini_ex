ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Covisint was incorporated in April 2008 in the State of Michigan. Our predecessor, Covisint LLC, was founded in February 2000 by a consortium of automotive manufacturers, led by General Motors Corporation (“General Motors” or “GM”), Ford Motor Company, Chrysler, Nissan, Renault and Peugeot to streamline collaboration with their global network of parts suppliers. The consortium made a significant investment in the development of a robust, highly secure cloud-based multiparty business-to-business (“B2B”) exchange. This effort resulted in a Software as a Service (“SaaS”) application called the Auto Supply Portal ("Automotive B2B Exchange") which went live in 2003. 
In March 2004, Compuware Corporation (“Compuware”) purchased substantially all of the assets of Covisint LLC including its name and technology. In January 2013, Compuware contributed the Covisint business assets to Covisint (“January 2013 Contribution”) in preparation for our initial public offering, which was completed in October 2013 (“IPO”). On October 31, 2014, Compuware completed its distribution of 31,384,920 shares of Covisint common stock to Compuware shareholders (“October 2014 Distribution”). Our principal corporate offices are located in Southfield, Michigan. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “COVS.”
Overview
The Automotive B2B Exchange required the development and integration of three cloud-based technologies - identity management, data integration and exchange services, and portal services. This innovative solution enabled any member of the consortium to securely access the applications and information they needed, anytime, and anywhere to get their job done efficiently and effectively.
In the decade that followed the launch of the Automotive B2B Exchange, Covisint leveraged these technologies (collectively the "Covisint Cloud Platform" or "Platform") to help customers across several industries transform their businesses by enabling trusted information sharing and secure interactions between people, systems and things. Our Platform was used to build several innovative solutions, two of the most notable being General Motors' OnStarTM ("OnStar"), the world's largest Internet of Things ("IoT") connected car solution to date, and Hyundai's Blue LinkTM ("Blue Link") connected car solution in North America.
In fiscal 2015, Covisint opened our Platform to third-party developers and customers, by:

(a) | exposing the capabilities within the Platform via application programming interfaces ("APIs"),


(b) | making the Platform infrastructure-agnostic to satisfy performance, data residency and regulatory requirements, and


(c) | automating the build and deploy activities to facilitate rapid deployment and upgrade of the Platform.

Market Opportunities
We believe there is a large and rapidly growing available market for our Platform, principally in two horizontal use cases: Identity and Access Management ("IAM") and IoT.
Identity and Access Management is a well-defined and fast-growing market, with three main use cases:

1. | Business to Enterprise ("B2E") / Workforce,


2. | Business to Consumer ("B2C") / Consumer Identity and Access Management, and


3. | Business to Business (B2B).

Historically, enterprises have tried to address these cases using on-premise software that is installed, configured and managed within their data center. However, with the increasing reliability and stability of the public cloud, along with the continuing deconstruction of the enterprise, many Chief Information Officers ("CIOs") and Chief Information Security Officers ("CISOs") are realizing that cloud-based Identity-as-a-Service ("IDaaS") offers superior outcomes at lower cost. The Covisint Cloud Platform 
2

can serve all three IAM use cases, however we principally focus on the B2B use case as this is the most advanced and valuable use case for the digital enterprise, and one where we remain highly differentiated relative to our competitors.
IoT is a nascent market, but it is developing due to its significant value. Cisco Systems, Inc. ("Cisco") predicts there will be 50 billion connected things – six for every person on the planet – by 2020, and McKinsey & Co. predicts IoT will have more than $11 trillion in economic impact by 2025.
IoT has two main use cases:

1. | Connected Products – connecting manufacturers with their fielded products, and


2. | Connected Processes – connecting the assets of owner/operators together to improve process outcomes.

The Covisint Cloud Platform offers a unique set of tightly integrated capabilities that are required to meet the needs of both IoT use cases, and includes:

• | Identity services – identity provisioning, authentication, authorization, for people, systems and things,


• | IoT services – definition, management and visualization of the IoT digital ecosystem, and


• | Messaging services – secure connectivity and complex information exchange.

A third substantial market opportunity for Covisint is the automotive industry, as it is the midst of a significant, disruptive transformation driven by the onset of autonomous vehicles, electrification, new ownership and usage models (e.g., Mobility-as-a-Service), and ubiquitous high-bandwidth and low-latency communications. The Covisint Cloud Platform is critical to realizing these opportunities, principally in two areas:

• | Next Generation Connected Vehicles. Dedicated Short Range Communication ("DSRC") and 5G will enable constant communications between vehicles and the world around them - humans, other cars, and infrastructure, both public and private. McKinsey & Co. estimates there will be more than $750 million in value created from car-data enabled services and $1.4 billion from shared mobility services by 2030. This value will be created by sharing information and enabling secure interactions with the ecosystem of stakeholders around a connected vehicle including the owner/operator, the vehicle designer, component suppliers, auto dealers - for both servicing and sales, as well as third-party service providers like insurance carriers offering usage-based insurance, or parking service providers, and vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure offerings. 


• | Supply-Chain Transformation. Covisint first transformed the automotive supply chain with our B2B Exchange, and we continue to see customer demand for Supplier Collaboration solutions, particularly in China. We also continue to offer and operate our Electronic Data Interchange ("EDI") offerings, which includes GM's entire supply chain. Going forward, we see demand in our installed base for both our identity and IoT capabilities, including real-time visibility and insight into the supply chain, Factory of the Future initiatives, as well as improved visibility between Auto original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and their dealership networks. 

We believe the markets and use cases our Platform serves are still very dynamic and evolving. As such, we will continue to invest in sales and marketing, select technology and go-to-market partnerships, and continued innovation in our core technologies to extend our leadership position in the marketplace.
The Company operates in a single reportable segment.
Our Offering
The capabilities in our Platform are delivered via the Cloud as a Platform as a Service ("PaaS"). It has supported production-critical applications for over 14 years, and offers unparalleled levels of security, scalability and reliability. We package and market the Covisint Cloud Platform as three different offerings, aligned with our market opportunities and target buyers, namely:

1. | The Covisint Identity Platform,


2. | The Covisint IoT Platform, and


3. | The Covisint Connected Vehicle Platform.

In fiscal 2018, our roadmap is focused on extending and enhancing our technology leadership including, but not limited to, the following areas:
3


• | Advanced Authentication – More options for native integration with leading third-party Multi-Factor Authentication vendors, improved risk-based authentication algorithms, and protocol compliance updates


• | Governance, Reporting & Compliance – Integration with third-party Security Incident and Event Management and User and Entity Behavioral Analysis tools, as well as graph-based visualization of permissions management, and improved native event reporting


• | Modern, Responsive & Mobile-friendly User Interfaces – Unified IAM/IoT interfaces, policy framework & templates, and user-driven control


• | Digital Ecosystem Definition and Management – Ecosystem modeler, unified stream management & processing, asset mapping & visualization services, and advanced simulation tools


• | Security & Control for Connected Assets – Improved support for x.509 certificates, token management, and endpoint security integration


• | Data Integration – Data streaming and access control, bi-directional API orchestration, prebuilt connectors to third-party systems, and real-time stream transformations to address data privacy & security requirements


• | Automotive Accelerators and Developer Tools – Vehicle command mapping & protocol translation, solution templates, and service catalog integration

Our Differentiation
The Covisint Platform offers a complete and tightly integrated set of technologies for one purpose - to enable trusted information sharing and secure interactions across people, systems and things, which is what creates economic value for our customers. We offer these capabilities via the public cloud, and exposed via APIs, to enable developers to create custom solutions to transform their businesses. The combination of our functional capabilities and delivery model is collectively what gives our large enterprise, independent software vendors ("ISVs") and systems integrators ("SIs") customers a substantial strategic advantage, enabling digital transformation faster and more cost-effectively, and ultimately enabling them to compete more effectively in connected economy.
Our Growth Strategies
Elements of our growth strategy include:

• | Upsell and cross-sell our installed base. We have a demonstrated track record of expansion in our existing accounts. We will leverage our current footprint to identify and serve adjacent use bases in identity, IoT, and supply chain transformation. 


• | Penetrate new Auto OEMs. All Auto manufacturers have similar challenges and opportunities, and we believe our demonstrated success with the Automotive B2B Exchange and connected vehicle solutions at General Motors and Hyundai will help us penetrate new accounts for next-generation connected vehicle monetization and supply chain transformation. 


• | Expand into Manufacturing. IoT holds substantial value creation potential for manufacturers – first by enhancing the value of the product, and in many cases subsequently transforming the business model from a capital asset sale to services. We believe that our Platform is turnkey to the success of these initiatives. 


• | Grow our partner ecosystem. We are actively developing strategic alliances with three types of partners: 


(a) | Systems Integrators. Recognizing the transformational potential of IoT, most leading systems integrators have developed IoT practices, which need an IoT platform upon which to build their solutions. We have a healthy and growing relationship with Tech Mahindra, and we intend to develop other such relationships with SIs where they leverage our Platform to deliver complex. high-value IoT solutions to their enterprise customers. 


(b) | Independent Software Vendors. Many emerging ISVs, both horizontal and vertical, recognize the need to integrate with the cloud-based identify and IoT services we provide to either extend or enrich their offerings. We intend to actively pursue these opportunities in the coming fiscal year. 


(c) | Technology partners. Expanding our technology partnerships and alliances in order to integrate with adjacent technologies, both existing and new, is key to customer success. We believe that our multi-protocol, technology-agnostic approach and our differentiating focus of digital ecosystems give us a strong advantage to integrate our Platform with technologies from other vendors, paving the way for lower integration costs and higher staying power with our customers, and potentially joint, revenue-enhancing offerings with such vendors.

• | Developer Enablement. Ensuring that software developers can easily use the capabilities in our Platform to rapidly prototype and demonstrate value is key to our mutual success. In fiscal year 2017, we were recognized as a winner of the Sogeti Hackathon in part for these reasons, and we will continue to invest in this area. 

Customers
Our customers include large, globally distributed organizations and mid-sized organizations with complex external business relationships, as well as the participants in their business relationships. While we have over 2,000 customers, approximately 150 of these customers represented 91%, 90%, and 92% of our total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our core Platform customers include organizations in the automotive, energy, travel, life sciences, consumer goods and national and regional insurance industries. Our remaining customers include a variety of organizations that pay us a relatively nominal fee to either connect to one of our core Platform customers or use one of our industry-specific solutions.
The automotive industry accounted for 54%, 54%, and 45% of our total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. The healthcare industry accounted for 12%, 19%, and 32% of our total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Revenue from outside of the U.S. accounted for 11%, 9%, and 6% of our total revenue for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We intend to continue expanding our business into additional vertical markets and geographies and expect our revenue to diversify accordingly.
We have a significant strategic partnership with Cisco. Following entry into our Software License and Hosting Services Agreement (“Cisco Contract”) with Cisco in November 2013, we worked with Cisco to integrate our Platform with Cisco applications to build the Cisco Service Exchange Platform™ ("SXP"). We receive significant subscription revenue directly from Cisco relating to the use and development of the Platform as part of the Cisco SXP Contract. Moreover, in January and April 2015, we enabled Cisco to enter into the prime contracts (collectively, the “GM Contracts”) with various divisions of General Motors, with Cisco as prime contractor and Covisint as subcontractor, to provide most of the service that we historically provided to GM (collectively, the “Prior GM Contracts”). Under the GM Contracts, we receive annual service fees in advance. With Cisco’s involvement, we were able to extend the terms of each contract through April 2020 and eliminate GM’s ability to terminate these agreements for convenience. Notwithstanding these contractual changes, we remain actively engaged in further expanding our deep relationship with GM.
For the year ended March 31, 2017, Cisco accounted for 42% of our total revenue, of which 29% of total revenue is related to the transfer of the GM Contracts and the augmentation of the SXP platform. Our standalone business with General Motors, which is primarily services, accounted for 2% of our total revenue in the year ended March 31, 2017. Losing all or a significant portion of our business with General Motors or Cisco could have a material impact on our business, liquidity and results of operations. See “Risk Factors - We derive a significant percentage of our total revenue from our largest customer, Cisco, as well as our ten largest customers” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Services
We provide implementation and consulting services to our customers. Recently, we moved from delivering service based solutions through our own resources to creating a network of certified service partners who are able to create and deploy solutions on our Platform. However, in certain circumstances, we continue to perform implementation services, which typically consist of user migration, content migration, solution deployment, configuration, and training to support customer-specific workflows. Our services engagements typically occur in phases and can vary from a few weeks to several months depending on the scope and complexity of the solution. Our customers may choose to do much of this work in-house, through a third party or with Covisint. We currently subcontract, and expect to continue to subcontract, portions of our consulting engagements to our third-party implementation partners. We support our customers and partners as they independently implement solutions using APIs and our developer portal.
Sales and Marketing
We sell our Platform through both direct sales and our channel partners. Our direct sales team includes field sales and solution engineering personnel. We will continue to invest in attracting and retaining skilled professionals with knowledge and relationships in our target industries, use cases and technologies, in order to achieve our corporate objectives.
Our marketing and lead generation activities consist primarily of high-touch account-based sales and marketing activities, as well as participation in key industry, analyst and technology events. We principally target line of business decision makers, as well as senior business and IT executives seeking to drive digital business transformation. We are also developing specific marketing programs and campaigns targeted at developers.
Customer Support
Our customer support services are available 24x7x365 globally and include live-agent telephonic support as well as web-based and self-help options. Our customer support team is staffed by highly skilled and experienced personnel who receive extensive 
5

training on the deployment and maintenance of our services and on the operation of our data centers. A standard deployment includes level-two support. Customers may contract for optional level-one support services to augment our standard support offering, which entitles them to single point of contact, issue resolution and escalation services and more stringent service level agreements (“SLAs”).
Technology and Operations
Covisint’s Platform is designed to support mission-critical business processes of large organizations. It is (a) highly scalable and designed to process millions of transactions, manage terabytes of data and provide access for millions of users every day, and (b) enterprise-grade, continuously available across the globe and addresses our customers’ most demanding uptime requirements.
Our Platform is written in Java and is optimized for scalability and performance. To expand the value of our Platform, we have created a software development kit, including a broad set of APIs that enable our strategic partners and customers to use our PaaS to develop custom applications and integrations. Our solutions often combine proprietary and open source technologies. Open source technology reduces the overall cost to our customers and allows us to bring innovations and enhancements to market in a more expedient and efficient manner.
For our existing customers, we operate both multi-instance and multi-tenant architectures depending on their need for dedicated applications and databases. Our new customers are onboarded on the multi-tenant public cloud instance of our PaaS.
We work with CenturyLink, Inc. and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) for hosting. We currently utilize facilities located in Chicago, Illinois; Southfield, Michigan; Allen, Texas; Northern Virginia; Tokyo, Japan; Frankfurt, Germany; and Shanghai, China. This allows us to ensure reliability, redundancy and performance for all our customer solutions. We are increasingly utilizing AWS' Infrastructure as a Service (“IaaS”) to optimize our costs and provide flexibility and geographic coverage for our customers. 
Research and Development
Technology leadership is key to our continued success. As such, we will continue to invest in engineering, product management and technical marketing to extend our technology differentiation in IoT, identity and in support of automotive application of these technologies in the coming year. Because our Platform is cloud-based, we are able to deliver new innovation faster to market than our on-premise software competitors, and react quickly to evolving customer needs.
Our Competition
We sell our Platform in an extremely competitive environment characterized by rapid technological change, new and emerging use cases around Connected Car, IoT and Cloud Identity, shifting customer needs and continued market entrants. We believe that the key competitive factors in our market include: 

• | Security – it is imperative that all aspects of security are managed from securing what can connect, to providing encryption services for the data in motion and at rest, to what systems and devices can access what data.


• | Scalability – the ability to scale to massive ecosystems, to ecosystems of ecosystems that can have millions of connected identities, to exchange millions of messages an hour, and to consume massive amounts of bandwidth and storage is significantly important for our Platform to provide.


• | Functional Completeness – multi-vendor solutions are difficult, time consuming and costly to implement and support. We believe purpose-built platforms for IoT and Identity offer superior value to a technology toolkit approach. 


• | Implementation Speed – speed to value is paramount, particularly with proof of concepts, in order to allow businesses to demonstrate their business ideas and secure funding.


• | Openness of the Platform – interoperability and easy integration with adjacent technologies, particularly existing enterprise systems is essential to customer value.


• | Privacy & Regulatory Compliance – governmental regulations on privacy and data handling will continue to increase, as will their customers' demands that their information be handled properly and kept private.


• | Infrastructure Reliability – providing an enterprise-class platform requires providing enterprise-grade service level agreements that are acceptable for mission critical systems.


• | Price – price competitiveness will continue to be an important factor in buying decisions particularly as computing and storage costs continue to decline with Infrastructure-as-a-Service vendors.

6

We expect that the overall market for enterprise cloud platforms and solutions to remain highly competitive. We believe our competition principally follows two approaches:

• | Build their own. We continue to see end customers attempting to develop and maintain proprietary solutions, despite the significant complexity and advanced technology required for successful identity and IoT solutions. This approach typically requires substantial investment and time to develop a viable initial solution. 


• | Buy/license and integrate. We have seen customers attempt to create a solution by integrating solutions from multiple technology providers either themselves, or using large systems integrators. Vendors of competitive point technologies include: 


◦ | Microsoft Azure, IBM BlueMix, AWS IoT, Salesforce IoT Cloud, and PTC Thingworx for IoT, and


◦ | Microsoft Azure ADFS, Okta Platform and SailPoint for cloud identity, and


◦ | SiriusXM, Harman and MNOs/SIs (e.g., Verizon, Vodafone) for Connected car solution enablement.

We believe we offer a superior alternative by offering a complete set of integrated technologies for IoT and identity solutions in the cloud. We continuously update our Platform with new and innovative technology as well as improved security which offers faster time to value and enhanced return on investment to our customers.
Intellectual Property
We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights, as well as contractual restrictions. We manage ownership of and access to our proprietary technology by requiring the execution of confidentiality and invention assignment agreements by our employees, contractors and consultants, and confidentiality agreements with third parties. We also rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, trademark, trade dress and domain name protections to maintain our intellectual property rights, including the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States.
We hold a patent in the U.S. on our core technology in the context of an industry-wide B2B exchange. This patent will expire in 2028.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which our solutions are distributed. In addition, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete and harm our operating results. See “Risk Factors - We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and efforts to protect them may be costly and may substantially harm our business” in Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Employees
As of March 31, 2017, we had 297 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Facilities
We maintain our principal offices at 26533 Evergreen Road, Suite 500, Southfield, Michigan, which is leased under an 11-year lease of 33,786 square feet of space. We have also entered into standalone operating lease agreements for office space in Shanghai, China; Frankfurt, Germany; London, England; and San Francisco, California. Pursuant to third-party hosting agreements, we also have access to facilities in Chicago, Illinois and Tokyo, Japan.
We believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our current requirements and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available as needed to accommodate expansion of our operations.
Backlog
We consider our backlog balance to be future years of contractually committed arrangements, of which only the billed amounts are included in deferred revenue. As of March 31, 2017 and 2016, our backlog balance was $113.2 million and $125.4 million, respectively, of which $16.7 million and $19.5 million, respectively, was billed and included in deferred revenue. Of the March 31, 2017 backlog, approximately $60.1 million is not expected to be recognized in fiscal 2018.
