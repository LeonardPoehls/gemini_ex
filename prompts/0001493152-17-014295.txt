IoT’s application in healthcare, such as telemedicine, medication administration, clinical surgery and workflow management, inpatient care, etc., helps with compilation services related to diagnosis, treatment, care and rehabilitation. They improve communication between patients and healthcare workers, reducing medication errors and providing better coordinated care.
 
The Market Opportunity
 
Blockchain and the Internet of Things are technologies that affect the future. UBI Company took the lead in entering this market. First, using IBSH technology in the big health industry, will help position the company in this field. The standard of this market access is hard and the cost is high. The UBI team is optimistic about the future.
 
Blockchain technology can play a role in many fields. Blockcchain transactions are theoretically real-time. The block-based distributed accounting technology, combined with its artificial intelligence and internet of things technologies, makes it possible for countless of smart technologies to connect to internet for greater security, allowing technicians to return to the point at which the problem occurred. One of potential applications of this technology is the creation of registers based on blockchain of IoT devices, and the use of artificial intelligence programs to perform automated intelligent diagnostics and more advanced functions, which can ultimately lead engineers and technicians to virtualize clock backwards. At the same time, blockchain technology can reduce audit costs; reduce distrust of central node, so that flow of financial assets is more transparent and convenient. In fact, current blockchain technology is indeed application of digital electronic payments to “block chain +” transition extension from financial sector gradually to IoT and other non-financial areas which will trigger more and greater industrial restructuring and revolution.

Target Market
 
At present, food and drug safety is a major challenge for human beings. Counterfeit food and drug products are very common in the Chinese market. These problems are derived from nature problems and human factors. The laws and regulations are not perfect and complete and law enforcement is not seriously implemented in many occasions. The occurrence of poison capsule events, vaccine cases, ginkgo leaf, licorice tablets and other major drug cases, seriously affecting people’s physical and mental health. Therefore, the safety of food and medicine is closely linked to the vital interests of hundreds of millions of people. So UBI’s market for food and drug safety goals is accurate and huge.
 
Sources of Income and Pricing
 
We plan to build a platform and a number of products that will generate revenues and generate profits by delivering services and effective products to potential targets customers. The price will be determined by demand and market pricing. After initial publicity, the company’s products and services may have an impact on the health care industry. As we look to the future, emerging technologies will trigger new trends in the security, law enforcement, privacy, food and drug safety aspects of the healthcare industry.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
In the future marketing of UBI platform and products, we will mainly go through the Internet of Things to do online and offline store marketing. Marketing will also be promoted through cross-border e-commerce platforms. Conference marketing and professional channel marketing will be utilized. Our products and designs consider the overall needs of the population and will be tailor-made for some clients. We are currently paying attention to the development, formation and needs of “one belt, one road” markets.
 
Management believes Chinese consumers are more likely to consider buying a product if they see it mentioned on a social-media site and more likely to purchase a product or service if a friend or acquaintance recommends it on a social-media site by word of mouth.
 
Chinese consumers rely heavily upon peer-to-peer recommendations over general mass advertising. In general, the Chinese populace is skeptical of information from news sources and advertising and rely more on word-of-mouth from friends, family, and key opinion leaders, many of whom share information on social media.
 
Manufacturing
 
The Company does not now engage in any manufacturing but may engage in manufacturing of products to be sold on the Company’s website in the future.
Government Regulation
 
We are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the State of Delaware, where we are incorporated, the United States and the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) that involve matters central to our business, including laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, data security, data retention, consumer protection, advertising, electronic commerce, intellectual property, manufacturing, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, and economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions.
