ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

OVERVIEW
We are a global provider of trading services and solutions, specializing in over-the-counter, or OTC, and exchange-traded markets. Our retail, institutional and futures segments service customers in more than 180 countries worldwide, and we conduct business from our offices in Bedminster, New Jersey; Jersey City, New Jersey; London, England; Cornwall, England; Chicago, Illinois; Powell, Ohio; Tokyo, Japan; Sydney, Australia; Beijing, China; Shanghai, China; Pembroke, Bermuda; Hong Kong, Dubai, U.A.E. and Singapore.
We offer our customers access to a diverse range of over 12,500 financial products, including spot foreign exchange, or forex, and precious metals trading, as well as “contracts for difference”, or CFDs, which are investment products with returns linked to the performance of underlying assets. We offer CFDs on currencies, commodities, indices, individual equities, bonds and interest rate products. We also support trading of exchange-traded futures and options on futures on more than 30 global exchanges. In the United Kingdom, we offer spread bets, which are investment products similar to CFDs, but that offer more favorable tax treatment for residents of that country.
We have invested considerable resources since our inception to develop our proprietary trading platforms to provide our customers with advanced price discovery, trade execution and order management functions, while improving our ability to acquire and service our customers efficiently, as well as manage market and credit risk associated with our customer’s trading activity. Today our customers can trade through web-based, downloadable and mobile trading platforms and have access to innovative trading tools to assist them with research and analysis, automated trading and account management.
We operate our business in three segments. Through our retail segment, we provide our retail customers around the world with access to a diverse range of global financial markets, including spot forex, precious metals, spread bets and CFDs on commodities, indices, individual equities and interest rate products, as well OTC options on forex. Our institutional segment provides agency execution services and electronic access to spot and forward foreign exchange and precious metals markets via our Electronic Communications Network (ECN), GTX. Our futures segment offers execution and risk management services for exchange-traded futures and futures options on major U.S. and European futures and options exchanges. Each of our operating segments is discussed in more detail below. For financial information regarding our segments, please see Note 21 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
As a global provider of online trading services, our results of operations are impacted by a number of external factors, including market volatility, competition, the regulatory environment in the various jurisdictions and markets in which we operate and the financial condition of the retail and institutional customers to whom we provide our services. These factors are not the only 
4

factors that impacted our results of operations for the most recent fiscal period, and additional or other factors may impact, or have different degrees of impact, on our results of operations in future periods. 
The following table sets forth the key financial data and operating metrics for our business:

Growth Strategies
We intend to grow our business and increase our profitability principally by employing the following growth strategies:


• | Continue to enhance our proprietary trading platforms and innovative trading tools in our retail, institutional and futures segments in order to attract customers and increase our market share;


• | Strategically expand our operations and customer base through business acquisitions, investments and partnerships, such as our purchase of the entire issued and outstanding share capital of City Index (Holdings) Limited ("City Index"), subsequently renamed as Gain Capital Holdings Ltd, a global online trading firm specializing in CFDs, forex and spread betting, which we completed on April 1, 2015;


• | Expand our product offerings in order to facilitate clients' trading of our wide range of financial products and to generate more revenue per customer; and


• | Identify and enter high-growth markets in order to expand our presence globally in markets where we believe there are large revenue opportunities.

Our Retail Segment
Our retail segment represented 80.3% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We conduct our retail business primarily through our FOREX.com and City Index brands. As of December 31, 2016, we had 144,946 funded retail accounts.
We provide our retail customers around the world with access to a diverse range of 12,500 global financial markets, including spot forex and precious metals trading, as well as “contracts for difference”, or CFDs, which are investment products with returns linked to the performance of underlying assets. We offer CFDs on currencies, commodities, indices, individual equities, bonds and interest rate products. In the United Kingdom, we offer spread bets, which are investment products similar to CFDs, but that offer more favorable tax treatment to residents of that country. We offer these products under the diverse regulatory environments in which we operate. For example, because of U.S. regulations, neither we, nor our subsidiaries, offer CFDs or spread bets in the United States or to U.S. residents. 
We seek to attract and support our customers through direct and indirect channels. Our primary direct channels for our retail segment are our Internet websites, FOREX.com and Cityindex.com, which are available in multiple languages, including English, Chinese, Japanese, German and Arabic. Our indirect channel includes our relationships with introducing brokers, who solicit customers on our behalf, and white label partners, who offer our trading services to their customers under their own brand. Total retail trading volume sourced through direct and indirect channels was 56% and 44%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. 
Our retail segment also includes Trade Facts, Ltd., or Trade Facts (formerly known as Galvan Research & Trading, Ltd.), which we acquired in 2014. Trade Facts, along with its subsidiary, Faraday Research LLP, provides individual investors with professional advice and trading recommendations across a wide range of markets, including forex, individual equities, equity indices and other market sectors.
We generate revenue in our retail segment in two ways: (1) trading revenue from our market making activities for OTC products, earned principally from the bid/offer spread we offer our customers and any net gains and losses generated through changes in the market value of the currencies and other products held in our net exposure and (2) fees, including financing charges for positions held overnight, commissions on equity CFD trades and advisory services, and other account related fees. 
In 2016, we generated approximately 82.0% of our retail segment trading volume from customers outside the United States. For a discussion of the risks associated with our retail segment operations outside the United States, please see "Item 1A. Risk Factors."
The following are the key components of our retail business:
Innovative trading tools
We have made significant investment in the development and support of our award-winning proprietary trading technology in order to provide our customers with an enhanced customer experience and multiple ways to trade and manage their accounts, tailored to their level of experience and preferred mode of access. In addition, we also selectively offer third party trading tools 
6

that we believe complement our proprietary offerings. We believe that our proprietary trading technology has and will continue to provide us with a significant competitive advantage because we have the ability to adapt quickly to our customers’ changing needs, rapidly incorporate new products and features and offer our customers multiple ways to engage with us.
Competitive pricing and fast, accurate trade execution
For our OTC business, we have leveraged our extensive experience in the global OTC markets to develop highly automated processes, which allow us to deliver tight bid/offer spreads generally reflective of currently available pricing in the markets we offer and to execute our customers’ trades quickly and efficiently.
In this regard, we have longstanding relationships with a large number of institutional liquidity providers, as well as access to multiple liquidity venues, which we believe allow us to offer our customers superior liquidity and more competitive pricing with tighter bid/offer spreads than many of our competitors. In addition, we have developed a proprietary pricing engine that electronically aggregates quotes from our liquidity sources based on the midpoint price between the available “best bid” and “best offer.” This proprietary technology enables us to update our prices, on average three times a second for each market we offer, helping to ensure that our prices accurately reflect current market price levels. Our proprietary technology also enables us to provide our customers with high-speed trade execution. In 2016, we handled over 13 million trade requests through FOREX.com's proprietary platform and executed 99.9% of trades in less than one second, with an average execution speed of 0.05 seconds. We have established a set of standards we use to measure execution quality for FOREX.com, and we publish execution statistics on a monthly basis. The FOREX.com execution scorecard, which is available on our website, demonstrates our ability to provide fast, accurate trade executions, as well as our commitment to transparency in our business. We believe we are the only firm in our industry to voluntarily publish a monthly execution scorecard with the level of detail that we provide.
Automated customer onboarding and account management
We have developed proprietary technology to automate or otherwise facilitate operational functions that are core to our business and that we believe are important to our ability to deliver a superior customer experience. This includes a highly automated account opening and customer verification process, fast online account funding and withdrawals with a wide variety of automated payment methods, and on-demand delivery of customer information, such as account statements and other account-related reporting. We also offer account opening and funding functions on our mobile trading applications in order to provide a superior experience to the large number of customers who trade primarily through their mobile devices. Given the highly regulated and global nature of our business, these processes are customized to each regulatory jurisdiction in which we operate, and are further tailored to customer needs and preferences in specific countries in order to make it easier for clients in these countries to open accounts with us and then to fund and trade in those accounts. As a result, we have experienced a strong success at acquiring clients from countries in the world where we do not have a local office.
Sophisticated risk management
Because we are exposed to market and credit risk in connection with our retail trading activities, developing and maintaining robust risk management capabilities is a high priority.
We allow our customers to trade notional amounts greater than the funds they have on deposit with us through the use of leverage, making management of credit risk a key focus for us. The maximum leverage available to retail traders is generally set by the regulator in each jurisdiction. We manage customer credit risk through a combination of providing trading tools that allow our customers to avoid taking on excessive risk and automated processes that close customer positions in accordance with our policies, in the event that the funds in customers' accounts are not sufficient to hold their positions. For example, our customer trading platforms provide a real-time margin monitoring tool to enable customers to know when they are approaching their margin limits. If a customer’s equity falls below the amount required to support one or more positions, we will automatically liquidate positions to bring the customer’s account into margin compliance.
In addition, we actively monitor and assesses various market factors, including volatility and liquidity, and takes steps to address identified risks, such as proactively adjusting required customer margin (both initial and maintenance). For example, on January 15, 2015, the Swiss National Bank, or SNB, unexpectedly announced that it would move interest rates to -0.75% and abandon the 1.20 floor for EUR/CHF that it had previously maintained. The announcement led to unprecedented volatility in the Swiss franc, which negatively impacted many market participants. However, as part of our ordinary course risk management process, we had identified significant risk relating to EUR/CHF products and had increased client margin requirements to 5% well in advance, which mitigated the risk of negative client equity in the event the price floor was abandoned. 

7

When a retail customer executes a trade with us, the trade may be naturally hedged against an offsetting trade from another customer, hedged through an offsetting trade with one of our liquidity providers or may become part of our net exposure portfolio. For naturally hedged trades, we receive the entire bid/offer spread we offer our customers on the two offsetting transactions. For trades hedged with our liquidity providers, we earn the difference between the retail bid/offer spread we offer our customers and the wholesale bid/offer spread we receive from our liquidity providers. Customer trades in our net exposure portfolio are managed pursuant to our risk-management policies and procedures, including risk limits established by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors, and we receive the net gains or losses generated through the management of our net exposure.
Our risk management policies and procedures have been developed to enable us to effectively manage our exposure to market risk, particularly in connection with the management of our net exposure. Our net exposure is evaluated each second and is continuously rebalanced throughout the trading day, thereby minimizing the risk we will be adversely affected by changes in the market prices of the products we hold. This real-time rebalancing of our portfolio enables us to curtail risk and to be profitable in both up and down market scenarios.
Our risk management policies and procedures are established and reviewed regularly by the Risk Committee of our Board of Directors. Our risk-management team monitors risk exposure continuously and updates senior management both informally over the course of the trading day and formally through real-time, intraday and end-of-day reporting. We do not actively initiate proprietary market positions in anticipation of future movements in the relative prices of the products we offer.
Customers
Our retail customers consist primarily of self-directed traders, who execute trades on their own behalf. A small percentage of our customers have engaged an intermediary to make trading decisions on their behalf.
Our typical self-directed customer is generally comfortable making trading decisions and is specifically interested in trading leveraged products, which generally have a higher risk/reward profile. For the year ended December 31, 2016, self-directed customers represented approximately 99.0% of our retail trading volume.
The intermediaries engaged by our managed account customers, which we refer to as authorized traders, include professional money managers, which trade a significant amount of aggregated customer funds, and individuals that trade for a small number of customer accounts. For the year ended December 31, 2016, managed account customers collectively represented approximately 1.0% of our retail trading volume.
Sales and Marketing
In connection with our retail business, we look to acquire new customers as cost-efficiently as possible, primarily through online marketing efforts such as advertising on third-party websites, search engine marketing and email marketing. Our experienced in-house marketing team creates highly targeted online campaigns tailored to experienced traders, as well as marketing programs and materials designed to support and educate novice traders. We use sophisticated tracking and measurement techniques to monitor the results of individual campaigns and continually work to optimize our overall marketing results.
One of our principal lead-generation tools is to offer prospective customers access to free registered practice trading accounts for a 30-day trial period. From a prospective customer’s point of view, we believe the registered practice trading account serves two important functions. First, it allows the prospective customer to evaluate our trading platform, tools and services. Second, for less experienced traders, it serves as an educational tool, providing the prospective customers with the opportunity to try trading in a risk-free environment, without committing any capital. During this trial period, our customer service team is available to assist and educate the prospective customers.
We also actively forge partnerships with introducing brokers in order to expand our customer base. We work with a variety of different types of introducing brokers, ranging from small, specialized firms that specifically identify and solicit customers interested in forex and CFD trading, to larger, more established financial services firms. Introducing brokers direct customers to us in return for either a commission on each referred customer’s trading volume or a share of net revenue generated by each referred customer’s trading activity.
Competition
The market for our retail services is rapidly evolving and highly competitive. Our competitors vary by region in terms of regulatory status, breadth of product offering, size and geographic scope of operations. Our main competitors during 2016 can be categorized as follows:
8


• | Regulated Forex Firms such as OANDA Corporation and Forex Capital Markets LLC. Like us, these firms have also expanded globally over the past several years, and we considered them to be a competitors in the United States during 2016, as well as in several of our key international markets. In February 2017, Forex Capital Markets LLC was required to cease offering its services in the United States by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and we acquired substantially all of the company's U.S.-domiciled customers. For more information, please see Note 23 to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 


• | Global Multi-Asset Trading Firms, including firms such as Interactive Brokers, IG Group Holdings plc and CMC Group. These firms generally offer a broad set of asset classes and earn a significant percentage of their revenue from CFDs, forex and other exchange-traded products. 

Our Institutional Segment
Through our institutional segment, we provide agency execution services and electronic access to spot and forward foreign exchange and precious metals markets via our ECN, GTX. We also offer high touch services through a team of institutional sales and trading employees. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our institutional segment represented 7.0% of our net revenue. 
In contrast to our retail segment, in our institutional segment, we primarily act as agent between the principals to the transactions that are executed, do not assume any market or credit risk and earn commissions or commission equivalents (markup/markdown). Our institutional segment also facilitates client orders through riskless principal trades.
Electronic Execution Services
Through our GTX platform, we provide deep liquidity in spot and forward foreign exchange and precious metals to buy-side and sell-side firms, including banks, brokers, hedge funds, Commodity Trading Advisors and asset managers. GTX’s unique centrally-cleared prime brokerage model supports true peer-to-peer trading capabilities, meaning every GTX client has an opportunity to add market liquidity to the venue by posting real-time bids and offers, as well as trade on the bid and offers of other participants. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net revenue from our ECN business represented 68% of the net revenue of our institutional segment.
Our GTX Direct offering, a component of our ECN business, allows experienced traders who meet certain qualifications, but do not have a credit line with a prime broker, access to the liquidity of the GTX platform. Through GTX Direct, our clients deposit collateral with us and we make trades through the GTX trading platform on our clients’ behalf, earning a commission for each trade.
GTX is powered by software and intellectual property that we first licensed on a exclusive basis in 2010. After undertaking significant development and enhancement efforts, we acquired full ownership of the software and intellectual property in July 2014.
Institutional Sales and Trading
Our institutional sales and trading business serves a broad range of participants across several asset classes, allowing clients to interact with the market based on their specific needs and preferences. As a result, we are able to attract a base of clients with diverse investment styles and strategies. Our institutional sales and trading business includes our agency voice brokers who assist clients with complex liquidity sourcing and trade executions, as well as our swap execution facility, or SEF, which provides an electronic venue for trading FX non-deliverable forwards.
Nearly all of our revenue from institutional sales and trading consists of commissions derived from transaction execution services for institutional clients, conducted on an agency basis, as well as commission-equivalents generated on riskless principal transactions. Over the past several years we have built up this business primarily through a focus on client service and an expansion of our sales and trading team. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net revenue from our institutional sales and trading business represented 32% of the net revenue of our institutional segment.
Sales and Marketing
We have a direct sales team that is dedicated to building relationships with potential institutional customers and expanding our institutional business. Since its inception in 2010, our institutional business has quickly expanded to include customers 
9

throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. 
Competition
In general, competition for business with institutional clients is based on a variety of factors, including technology, execution quality, client relationships, client service, cost and reputation.
GTX competes with other firms offering electronic trading platforms, such as Nex Group, formerly ICAP, through its EBS offering; Thomson Reuters; Currenex, owned by State Street Bank; Hotspot, a subsidiary of CBOE Holdings, Inc.; Integral Development Corp.; and others. 
Our Futures Segment
Our futures segment offers execution and related services for exchange-traded futures and futures options on major U.S. and European exchanges. We offer futures services through our regulated FCM, GAIN Capital Group, LLC ("GCGL"). In 2014, we expanded our futures business by acquiring a majority interest in Global Asset Advisors, LLC ("GAA"), a Chicago-based futures brokerage firm that markets to and services clients through Daniels Trading, an online futures brokerage targeting retail and professional traders. At the same time, we also acquired a majority interest in Top Third Ag Marketing, LLC ("TT"), which uses options-based hedging strategies to help clients manage the risks of agricultural production.
Revenue in our futures segment is primarily generated through commissions earned on futures and futures options trades. Our futures segment represented 11.5% of our net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Advanced Trading Platform
As with our retail segment, our futures segment seeks to provide customers with an enhanced customer experience through our proprietary trading platform. We have invested in high-speed connectivity to over 30 global electronic exchanges to deliver streaming quotes and high-speed executions. Our GAIN Trader platform (previously known as OEC Trader) is an easy-to-use electronic trading platform that offers users access to a full suite of trading tools. These include charting tools, custom alerts and indicators that allow customers to trade and monitor activity through a single charting window, as well as automated trading and risk management tools. Our futures segment also provides Trade Desk Manager, a broker version of our GAIN Trader platform that is designed to provide brokers with information and tools to manage their customers' accounts. We also license a white label version of our GAIN Trader platform to select third parties. 
Risk Management
In our futures segment, we are exposed to the risk that if an adverse market move related to a client’s position occurs and we are unable to collect a margin call in a timely manner, in such a case the client account may incur a loss, resulting in a debit balance. If a client account were to incur a loss resulting in a debit balance and we were unable to collect the debit balance from our client, we would incur a bad debt expense, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In recognition of this risk, we monitor all client accounts in near real time and have employed multiple risk mitigation measures to help ensure that our client accounts are properly margined at all times.
Sales and Marketing
As with our other segments, we seek to acquire customers as cost-efficiently as possible. Sales leads are generated through seminars, online advertising and other media. 
Our futures segment customers are sourced directly through dedicated sales staff at GCGL, GAA and TT. These sales teams focus on a variety of sectors and provide differentiated services to our customers. 
Additionally, our futures segment is introduced to customers indirectly through a network of introducing brokers.
Competition
Our futures segment competes for both wholesale introducing business and direct client business. At the wholesale level, we attract partners who are interested in white labeling our proprietary software. In this regard, our primary competitors are the limited number of FCMs that own and operate proprietary technology, including R.J. O'Brien, Rosenthal Collins Group, Interactive Brokers and ADM Investor Services. 
10

With the acquisition of GAA and Top Third, we also have a sizable and growing direct client business in our futures segment. This business is primarily focused on individual retail speculators and agricultural clients seeking to hedge commodity price exposure. The majority of our competitors in the commodity hedging space are small, privately held firms like Allendale, Advance Trading and Roach Ag Marketing, although we compete with larger firms, such as Interactive Brokers, with respect to individual retail speculators. 
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, trade secret and unfair competition laws in the United States and other jurisdictions to protect our proprietary technology, intellectual property rights and our brands (e.g., FOREX.com, GAIN Capital, City Index and GTX). We also enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants, and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We rigorously control access to our proprietary technology. Currently, we do not have any pending or issued patents.
We use a variety of service marks that have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including: GAIN Capital (registered service mark), FOREX.com GAIN Capital Group (registered service mark), Forex Insider (registered service mark), ForexTrader (registered service mark), FOREX.com (registered service mark), It’s Your World. Trade It. (registered service mark), GAIN Capital Futures (registered service mark), GAIN Futures, OEC (registered service mark). We also have registered trademarks covering our City Index brand name and logo in a variety of jurisdictions, including the United Kingdom, European Union and China, and have pending applications in a number of other jurisdictions, including Australia, Malaysia and Singapore.
Regulation
Overview
Our business and industry are highly regulated. Our operating subsidiaries are regulated in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States, the United Kingdom (through which we have accessed regulatory passport rights to operate in a number of European Economic Area jurisdictions), Japan, Australia, Hong Kong, Canada, Singapore and the Cayman Islands. Government regulators and self-regulatory organizations oversee the conduct of our business in many ways, and several perform regular examinations to monitor our compliance with applicable statutes, regulations and rules. These statutes, regulations and rules cover all aspects of our business, including:

• | sales and marketing activities, including our interaction with, and solicitation of, customers;


• | trading practices, including the types of products and services we may offer;


• | the methods by which customers can fund accounts with us;


• | treatment of customer assets, including custody, control, safekeeping and, in certain countries, segregation of our customer funds and securities;


• | maintaining specified minimum amounts of capital and limiting withdrawals of funds from our regulated operating subsidiaries;


• | continuing education requirements for our employees;


• | anti-money laundering practices;


• | recordkeeping and reporting; and


• | supervision regarding the conduct of directors, officers and employees.

In some jurisdictions in which we offer our products and services, we are not subject to regulation as a result of the nature of the market or the manner in which we conduct our business. We consult with legal counsel in jurisdictions in which we operate on a regular basis as to whether we have the required authorizations, licenses or approvals or whether we may conduct our business cross-border with residents in that jurisdiction without obtaining local regulatory authorization, approval or consent. To the extent that we wish to serve customers in a jurisdiction in which we determine licensing or registration is required, we may also elect to direct such customers to a licensed white label or other partner, rather than pursuing licensing or registration ourselves.
Though we conduct our business in a manner which we believe complies with applicable local law, regulators may assert authority over activities that they deem to take place within the jurisdiction they regulate, and new laws, rules or regulations may be enacted that change the regulatory landscape and result in new, or clarify preexisting, registration or licensing requirements.
11

The primary responsibility for ensuring that we maintain compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements is vested in our legal and compliance departments. In addition, our legal and compliance departments are responsible for our ongoing training and education programs, supervision of our personnel required to be licensed by one or more of our regulators, review of sales, marketing and other communications and other related functions. In addition, all of our sales employees are licensed pursuant to applicable regulation.
U.S. Regulation
In the United States, the CFTC and the NFA regulate our forex and futures trading activities. Historically, the principal legislation covering our U.S. forex business was the Commodity Exchange Act, which provides for federal regulation of all commodities and futures trading activities and requires all futures and commodity options to be traded on organized exchanges. In recent years, as in the case of other companies in the financial services industry, our forex business has been subject to increasing regulatory oversight. Specifically, in 2008, Congress passed the CFTC Reauthorization Act, which amended the Commodity Exchange Act to grant the CFTC express authority to regulate the retail forex industry. On October 18, 2010, the CFTC adopted a series of rules which regulate various aspects of our business, including:

• | creating “retail foreign exchange dealers,” or RFEDs, a new regulated category of forex brokers focused on retail investors that are permitted to act as counterparty to retail forex transactions;


• | imposing an initial minimum security deposit amount of 2.0% of the notional value for retail forex transactions in “major currency” pairs and 5.0% of the notional value for all other retail forex transactions;


• | providing that introducing brokers, money managers and fund managers must either (i) register with the CFTC and become members of the NFA or apply for an exemption from registration and (ii) meet the minimum net capital requirements applicable to futures and commodity options introducing brokers or enter into a guarantee agreement with a CFTC-regulated forex dealer member and permitting only one such guarantee agreement per introducing broker;


• | requiring that a risk disclosure statement be provided to every retail forex customer, including disclosure of the number of profitable and unprofitable non-discretionary accounts maintained by the forex broker during the four most recent calendar quarters;


• | prohibiting RFEDs, FCMs and introducing brokers from including statements in sales and marketing materials that would appear to convey to potential retail forex customers that there is a guaranty against loss, and requiring that FCMs, RFEDs and introducing brokers provide retail forex customers with enhanced written disclosure statements that, among other things, inform customers of the risk of loss; and


• | requiring RFEDs to maintain net capital of at least $20.0 million, plus 5.0% of the RFED’s retail customer obligations in excess of $10.0 million. In addition, in the event an RFED’s net capital position falls below 110.0% of the minimum net capital requirement, the RFED would be subject to additional reporting requirements.

Our exchange-traded futures business, which is carried on by our subsidiary GCGL, is subject to the CFTC Net Capital Rule (Regulation 1.17). Our OTC foreign exchange business, also carried on by our subsidiary GCGL under the Forex.com brand, is subject to the CFTC Net Capital Rule (Regulation 5.7). Under applicable provisions of these regulations, GCGL is required to maintain adjusted net capital of the greater of $1.0 million or 8% of Customer and Non-Customer Maintenance Margin or $20.0 million plus 5% of all liabilities owed to retail customers exceeding $10.0 million, plus 10% of all liabilities owed to eligible contract participant counterparties acting as a dealer that are not an affiliate. In addition, Gain Capital Group, LLC is subject to Regulation 1.17(c)(5) which requires the company to reduce net capital by various haircut charges including, but not limited to haircut for uncovered foreign currency balances, haircut for securities, as well as charges for under margined commodity futures and commodity options accounts. At December 31, 2016, GCGL maintained $19.5 million more than the required minimum regulatory capital for a total of 1.7 times the required capital.
In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act. A number of significant provisions contained in the law affect, or will affect once implementing regulations are adopted by the appropriate federal agencies, our business. Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act includes:

• | rules that, beginning in October 2010, require us to ensure that our customers residing in the United States have accounts open only with our NFA-member operating entity, GCGL;


• | amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act that, beginning on July 15, 2011, required essentially all retail transactions in any commodity other than foreign currency to be executed on an exchange, rather than OTC;


• | a requirement that federal banking regulators adopt new rules regarding the conduct and operation of retail forex businesses by banks; and

12


• | a requirement that the SEC adopt rules regarding the conduct and operation of retail forex businesses by broker-dealers.

The Dodd-Frank Act also provides for additional regulation of swaps and security-based swaps, including some types of foreign exchange and metals derivatives in which we engage. The Dodd-Frank Act requires the registration of swap dealers with the CFTC and imposes significant regulatory requirements on swap dealers and swap execution facilities. Effective February 27, 2013, GAIN GTX, LLC, became provisionally registered with the CFTC and NFA as a swap dealer. Effective June 2016, GTX SEF, LLC became permanently registered with the CFTC as a swap execution facility, replacing the temporary registration previously granted in April 2014. Certain of our other subsidiaries may be required to register, or may register voluntarily, as swap dealers and/or swap execution facilities.
Swap dealers and swap execution facilities are subject to a comprehensive regulatory regime with new obligations for the swaps activities for which they are registered, including adherence to risk management policies, supervisory procedures, trade record and real time reporting requirements, as well as proposed rules for new minimum capital requirements. GAIN GTX, LLC and GTX SEF, LLC have faced, and may continue to face, increased costs due to the registration and regulatory requirements listed above, as may any other of our subsidiaries that register as a swap dealer and/or swap execution facility. In particular, the CFTC has proposed rules that would require a swap-dealer to maintain regulatory capital of at least $20 million. Compliance with this or other swap-related regulatory capital requirements may require us to devote more capital to our GTX business or otherwise restructure our operations, such as by combining our GTX business with other regulated subsidiaries that must also satisfy regulatory capital requirements. The increased costs associated with compliance, and the changes that will be required in our OTC and clearing businesses, may adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial condition.
U.S. Patriot Act and Anti-Money Laundering
Like other companies in the financial services industry, we are subject to a variety of statutory and regulatory requirements concerning our relationships with customers and the review and monitoring of their transactions. Specifically, we are subject to the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001, or the Patriot Act, which requires that we maintain a comprehensive anti-money laundering, or AML, program, a customer identification program, or CIP, designate an AML compliance officer, provide specified employee training and conduct an annual independent audit of our AML program. Consistent with the Patriot Act, our CIP includes both documentary and non-documentary review and analysis of potential customers. Under our CIP, we review each prospective customer’s identity internally and also contract with third-party firms that perform extensive background checks on each prospective customer, including through review of the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets and Control, Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons lists. These procedures and tools, coupled with our periodic training, assist us in complying with the Patriot Act, as well as the CFTC’s and NFA’s applicable AML and CIP requirements.
United Kingdom Regulation
GAIN Capital-Forex.com U.K. Ltd. ("GCUK1"), GAIN Capital UK Ltd. ("GCUK2") and Trade Facts, which we collectively refer to as the U.K. Entities, are all registered in the U.K. and are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority in respect of their activities. The U.K. Entities are required to comply with relevant U.K. and E.U. legislation. In addition they must comply with the rules and guidance contained in the FCA Handbook of Rules and Guidance, or FCA Handbook. 
GCUK1, is regulated by the FCA, as a full scope €730k IFPRU Investment Firm. GCUK1 is required to maintain the greater of approximately $1.0 million (€730,000) or the Financial Resources Requirement, which is calculated as the sum of the firm’s operational, credit, counterparty, concentration, market and forex risk. At December 31, 2016, GCUK1 maintained $23.5 million more than the minimum required regulatory capital for a total of 4.7 times the required capital. Following the successful integration of City Index in the UK, GCUK1 no longer has any clients and is no longer trading. It is currently in the process of deregistering its license with FCA. Until that time, GCUK1 will maintain its regulatory capital in line with applicable requirements. 
GCUK2, is regulated by the FCA as a full scope €730k IFPRU Investment Firm. GCUK2 is required to maintain the greater of approximately $1.0 million (€730,000) or the Financial Resources Requirement, which is calculated as the sum of the firm’s operational, credit, counterparty, concentration, market and forex risk. At December 31, 2016, GCUK2 maintained $87.5 million more than the minimum required regulatory capital for a total of 2.2 times the required capital.
13

Gain Capital Payments Ltd is regulated in the U.K by the FCA as an Authorized Payments Institution and is authorized to carry out payment services under the Payment Services Regulations 2009. The minimum regulatory capital required is defined as the greater of either (i) approximately $0.1 million (€125,000) or (ii) requirements determined by the ‘overhead scalar approach’. At December 31, 2016, Gain Capital Payments Limited maintained the minimum required regulatory capital.
Effective on January 1, 2016, the FCA required regulated firms to add a capital conservation buffer and a countercyclical capital buffer in line with the requirements set out in Capital Requirements Directive, or CRD IV, Article 160 Transitional Provisions for Capital Buffers. These rules require all firms to maintain an additional capital buffer on top of the otherwise applicable minimum capital requirements. The amount of buffer, which is expressed as a percentage of the firm’s common equity tier 1 capital against the total risk exposure amount, will be phased in during a transitional period from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2018. During that period, the minimum common equity tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio requirement will increase from 5.125% to 5.75% in 2017 then to 7.0% in 2019. GCUK2 maintains a CET1 ratio significantly above the minimum requirement and, given the nature of our U.K. regulated firms' activities, the effect of the countercyclical buffer is expected to be negligible.
Trade Facts is regulated by the FCA as a BIPRU Limited License Firm. Trade Facts is required to maintain a base financial resources requirement of approximately $0.1 million (€0.05 million) and a capital requirement of the higher of either credit risk plus market risk or fixed overhead requirement. At December 31, 2016, Trade Facts maintained $3.1 million more than the minimum required regulatory capital for a total of 7.2 times the required capital.
Client Money Rules
GCUK1 and GCUK2 are subject to the FCA’s client money rules by virtue of being authorized by the FCA to hold client money. Under these rules, we are required to: 

• | maintain adequate segregation of client funds;


• | maintain adequate records in order to be able to meet future obligations when we hold client assets as collateral and be able to identify details of those assets to clients;


• | comply with custody rules when holding financial instruments (as defined by MiFID I) or other investments belonging to a client in the course of our business, including the safeguarding of those investments and holding all dividends and fees (e.g., stock lending fees) in accordance with the client money rules;


• | have adequate organizational arrangements in place to minimize the risk that client money may be paid for the account of a client whose money has not yet been received by us;


• | undertake daily internal and external client money reconciliations; and


• | appoint an individual who is responsible for Client Asset Sourcebook, or CASS, oversight.

Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions
As in the U.S., we are subject to statutory and regulatory requirements concerning our relationships with customers and the review and monitoring of their transactions. Specifically, the U.K. Entities are subject to ongoing customer due diligence, or CDD, obligations under the Money Laundering Regulations 2007, or MLR, and the FCA Handbook. 
The prescribed CDD measures require the U.K. Entities to (i) verify customer identity and understand the nature and purpose of the proposed relationship on the basis of documents, data or information obtained from a reliable and independent source and (ii) review and monitor their customer’s transactions and activities. The U.K. Entities are required to determine the extent of CDD measures required for each customer on a risk sensitive basis depending on the type of customer, business relationship, product or transaction and we must be able to demonstrate that such measures are appropriate in view of the risks of money laundering and terrorist financing. Our procedures are based on the Joint Money Laundering Group’s Guidance for the UK Financial Sector, which provides guidance to firms for the determination of appropriate CDD measures. 
The FCA requires the U.K. Entities to have systems and controls in place to enable them to identify, assess, monitor and manage money laundering risk. Accordingly, we have the requisite systems and controls in place which are comprehensive and proportionate to the nature, scale and complexity of our activities. We provide appropriate training to our employees in relation to money laundering and retain documentation of our risk management policies and risk profile in relation to money laundering. As required, we provide regular reports to our Money Laundering Reporting Officer, or MLRO, on the operation and effectiveness of these systems and controls, including details of our regular assessments of the adequacy of these systems and controls to ensure their compliance with FCA requirements.
14

Our systems and controls also include CDD and other measures to identify where customers and others with whom we transact may be subject to financial sanctions, including those initiated or adopted by the UK Treasury or the EU. 
EMIR
The E.U. European Market Infrastructure Regulation (Regulation (EU) 648/2012), or EMIR, imposes requirements on entities that enter into any form of derivative contract, including foreign exchange derivatives, and applies directly to firms in the E.U. and indirectly to non-E.U. firms that trade with E.U. firms. Accordingly, the U.K. Entities need to:

• | report all derivative contracts and their lifecycle events (concluded, modified and terminated) to which we are a party to a trade repository either by ourselves or through a third party;


• | keep all records relating to concluding of derivative contracts and any subsequent modification for 5 years;


• | comply with the risk management requirements for OTC bilateral derivatives, including portfolio reconciliation, portfolio compression, record keeping, dispute resolution and margining (these requirements began to be phased in starting in September 2016); and


• | clear through central counterparties all OTC derivatives which will be subject to the mandatory clearing obligation.

Appropriateness assessments
Where firms offer “execution only” services for certain financial instruments which are deemed “complex”, E.U. Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (Directive 2004/39/EC), or MiFID I, requires firms to assess the appropriateness of those investments for retail clients. For this assessment, we are required to collect information about our existing and potential clients’ knowledge and experience with regard to specific products and services, including: 

• | the types of services, transactions and financial instruments with which the retail client is familiar;


• | the nature, volume, and frequency of the retail client’s transactions in financial instruments and the period over which they have been carried out; and


• | the level of education, and profession or relevant former profession of the retail client or potential retail client.

We are required to offer to a retail client or transact for them only those products that are deemed appropriate for their knowledge, experience and other circumstances. If the retail client demands a product that has been assessed as inappropriate for the retail client’s circumstances by us, we may offer that product to the client but we are required to give the retail client a warning that the product is inappropriate to its circumstances. We are not required to undertake this analysis for professional clients as we are entitled to assume that a professional client has the necessary knowledge and experience in order to understand the risks involved in relation to the particular products or services for which he has been classified as a professional client. 
MiFID II
MiFID I applied in the UK from November 2007 but has been recast into a new directive, the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II (Directive 2014/65/EU), or MiFID II, and a new regulation, the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (Regulation 600/2014), or MiFIR. The changes implemented by MiFID II and MiFIR were set to take effect from January 3, 2017, but the implementation has been delayed until January 3, 2018. 
MiFID II will: 

• | expand the number of financial instruments for which firms are required to carry out an appropriateness assessment before providing an execution only service to retail clients;


• | extend the pre- and post-trade transparency regime to derivatives traded on regulated markets, multi-lateral trading facilities, or MTFs, and organized trading facilities, or OTFs;


• | expand transaction reporting to those financial instruments traded on MTFs, OTFs, and those financial instruments where the underlying instrument is traded on a Trading Venue; and


• | give E.U. Member State regulators the new power to ban or restrict the marketing, distribution or sale of a financial instrument or types of financial practice where there is a threat to investor protection, the orderly functioning and integrity of markets or to financial stability. The European Banking Authority and the European Securities and Markets Authority have similar powers to impose a ban on an EU-wide basis or in relation to a particular E.U. Member State.

Packaged Retail and Insurance-based Investment Products (PRIIPs) 
Regulation 1286/486 on key information documents for packaged retail and insurance-based investment products, or the PRIIPs Regulation, will apply in the UK from January 1, 2018, reflecting a delay from the original implementation date of December 31, 2016. From the implementation date, the U.K. Entities will need to comply with the new regime set out in the PRIIPs Regulation in relation to PRIIPS that they manufacture, advise on or sell to retail clients. The FCA regards derivatives (including options, futures, and contracts for differences) as falling within the definition of a PRIIP. The new regime will require us to provide retail clients with a standardized key information document, or KID, in good time before any transaction in derivatives is concluded or for transactions concluded by distance communications, after the transaction has taken place, but only if it is not possible to provide the KID in advance and the client consents. 
FCA Consultation Paper CP16/40
In December 2016, the FCA issued a consultation paper, referred to as CP16/40, that includes a number of proposed changes to the regulatory requirements relating to companies, such as GCUK2, that offer CFDs and spread bets. These proposed requirements include enhanced risk disclosures, a ban on offering account bonuses or similar promotional incentives to clients, mandatory margin close-out levels for retail clients and limitations on the leverage that may be offered to clients, with the limitations varying based on whether the clients are classified as experienced or inexperienced using criteria identified by the FCA. The comment period for CP16/40 expires in March 2017 and we cannot currently predict which, if any, of the proposed changes will be implemented.
Other International Regulation
We have provided below a brief description of the key aspects of the regulations governing our operations in the jurisdictions outside of the U.S. and the United Kingdom in which we have registered with, or obtained a license from, the local regulator, as well as material regulatory developments affecting our business in other jurisdictions important to our business, including developments that have presented risks or uncertainties for our operations.
