Item 1. Business
General
Radisys Corporation (NASDAQ: RSYS), the services acceleration company, helps communications and content providers, and their strategic partners, create new revenue streams and drive cost out of their services delivery infrastructure. Radisys’ hyperscale software defined infrastructure, service aware traffic distribution platforms, real-time media processing engines and wireless access technologies enable its customers to maximize, virtualize and monetize their networks. Our products and services fall within two operating segments: Software-Systems and Hardware Solutions.

• | Software-Systems products are targeted at delivering differentiated solutions for service providers, specifically within telecommunications, to enable their deployment of next generation networks and technologies. Software-Systems products include the following three product families:


◦ | FlowEngine products target the communication service provider traffic management market and are a family of products designed to rapidly classify millions of data flows and then distribute these flows to thousands of Virtualized Network Functions ("VNFs"). FlowEngine offloads the processing for packet classification and distribution, improving virtualized function utilization and making the overall Network Functions Virtualization ("NFV") architecture more efficient. A FlowEngine system consists of FlowEngine software running on a Traffic Distribution Engine ("TDE") platform. FlowEngine Software enables communication service providers to efficiently transition towards containerization, NFV and software-defined networking ("SDN") architectures allowing increased service agility and quicker time to revenue for new service offerings. FlowEngine accomplishes this by integrating a targeted subset of firewalls, edge routing, data center switching, and load balancing functionality, coupled with standards-based SDN protocols, enabling our customers to significantly reduce the investment necessary to efficiently process data flows in virtualized communications environments. 


◦ | MediaEngine products are designed into the IP Multimedia Subsystem ("IMS") core of telecom networks, providing the necessary media processing capabilities required for a broad range of applications including Voice over Long-Term Evolution ("VoLTE"), Voice over WiFi (“VoWifi”), Web Real-Time Communication ("WebRTC"), multimedia conferencing, as well as the media interworking including transcoding, transrating and media quality treatment that are required to achieve interoperability between legacy and new generation devices using disparate audio and video communication devices and applications. Our MediaEngine OneMRF strategy helps service providers consolidate their real-time IP media processing into a vendor and application agnostic platform, which drives cost out of their service delivery platform and enables accelerated deployment and introduction of new services. We sell a turnkey high-density system, the MediaEngine MPX-12000, as well as a virtualized software-only vMRF for customers who require media processing in an NFV architecture or lower-density processing platforms. In 2016, we also introduced variants of those systems, the TRF-12000 and vTRF, optimized for transcoding and media interworking for new, high-complexity audio and video codecs like the Enhanced Voice Services ("EVS") codec that provides service providers improved spectrum efficiency, greater radio tower coverage, and, for their customers, an enhanced user experience. As service providers consolidate network capacity from older (3G and 2G) architectures onto new LTE architectures, they will deploy IMS and VoLTE applications. Our MediaEngine provides the essential media processing capability that enables service providers to deliver audio, video or other multimedia services over their all-IP networks. 


◦ | CellEngine software, which includes our TOTALeNodeB LTE and Femtotality 3G software products, provides the communication linkage between wireless end user devices and mobile core networks through small cell base stations that mobile service providers are deploying to optimize wireless network spectrum utilization and coverage.


◦ | Also included in our Software-Solutions segments is our Custom Development Solutions ("CDS") organization that consists of telecommunications experts who are available to assist our customers as they develop their own unique telecommunications products and applications as well as accelerating specific features developed across our Software-Systems product families. Our strategy is to enable the efficient and cost-effective adoption of our Software-Systems products as well as enabling service providers to migrate to next-generation software-defined network deployments.

• | Hardware Solutions leverages our hardware design experience, coupled with our manufacturing, supply chain, integration and service capabilities, to enable continued differentiation from our competition. This segment includes both our recently launched, open-standards based DCEngine product family as well as our legacy embedded products portfolio, which over time will continue to trend down as service providers move away from proprietary architectures and onto open-standards solutions such as DCEngine.


◦ | DCEngine products transform service provider central offices and datacenters into SDN-enabled virtualized data centers. DCEngine provides a multi-rack level network functions virtualization ("NFVi") and container-based infrastructure for hosting thousands of VNFs and applications under open software-defined networking ("SDN") control. DCEngine utilizes the principles of highly efficient open compute platform ("OCP") architectures, delivering rack-scale compute, storage, and networking resources based on open Commercial off the shelf ("COTS") technology and integrates fully supported open source software. Radisys has built flexibility into DCEngine to address telecommunication central office demands for seismic, power, emissions and Network Equipment Building Systems ("NEBS"), which are above and beyond the traditional data center requirements. Service providers use DCEngine to provide pools of compute and storage resources that they can quickly scale to meet their evolving service requirements while improving agility in their service delivery. 


◦ | Legacy embedded products includes our ATCA, computer-on-module express (COM Express) and rack mount servers. These products are predominantly hardware-based and include both our internal designs as well as increasingly leveraged third party hardware. Our products enable the control and movement of data in both 3G and LTE telecom networks and provide the hardware enablement for applications such as Deep Packet Inspection ("DPI"), policy management and intelligent gateways (security, femto and LTE gateways). Additionally, our products enable image processing capabilities for healthcare markets and enable cost-effective and energy-efficient computing capabilities dedicated for industrial deployments.

Unless required by context, or as otherwise indicated, “we,” “us,” “our” and similar terms, as well as references to the “Company” and “Radisys” refer to Radisys Corporation and include all of our consolidated subsidiaries. 
Market Drivers
Our Software-Systems products uniquely position us to capitalize on the ongoing and upcoming global deployments of 4G Long Term Evolution ("LTE") mobile and 5G networks as well as the continued migration of service providers to embrace the efficiencies of the enterprise data center. Increasingly, service providers need to monetize the services that will be delivered to their end customers, while also virtualizing their core network infrastructures by embracing open-standards hardware and best in class open source and proprietary software. Further, as computer hardware becomes increasingly commoditized and carriers respond by moving away from purpose-built network elements to a virtualized architecture, the demand for devices that ensure the efficient and cost-effective flow of ever increasing amounts of data is expected to grow significantly. Specifically, demand for data and video traffic continues to expand exponentially as a result of increasing usage of smart phones, tablets and other wireless devices. In this evolving market, success demands a deep expertise in deploying fully integrated custom wireless and cloud applications. The key market drivers that we view as fundamental to our future success include the following:

• | Virtualizing the Core Network. Service providers are continually looking to increase average revenue per user, while reducing infrastructure costs and accelerating the deployment of new and exciting revenue-generating services. Communication service providers are turning to SDN, NFV and containers to more efficiently manage these services, but intensive data plane solutions require very high processing performance on the underlying COTS servers, which does not scale to the forecasted increase in data traffic. Our open DCEngine rack-scale systems are based on high-density COTS server and storage subsystems, and are designed to host thousands of VNFs in a telecom data center environment. Our family of FlowEngine TDE Systems perform flow classification and then make intelligent flow distribution decisions, thereby leaving more processing power on the COTS servers for the NFV and container-based applications. This results in a more efficient architecture, which reduces both capital and operating expenditures for service providers. 


• | Open Hardware and Open Source Software. The majority of today’s telecommunication networking equipment, including routers, switches, gateways, and session controllers, have been provided by industry suppliers based on 

 4

proprietary hardware architectures with proprietary software functions. While this approach often delivers high performance, the downside is a network composed of disparate hardware and software components that are expensive to integrate, manage and support, while also limiting new service time to market and innovations. Network service providers are now beginning to embrace the recent trends underway in large Enterprise-class data center design, where data center operators are building next-generation data centers based on open COTS hardware components, powered by both differentiated as well as open source software. Our DCEngine product is inspired by the Open Compute Project (OCP), which started as a specification for rack-scale open COTS hardware platforms for data center environments and optimized for telecom central office environmental and power requirements. Similarly, Radisys professional services is extending our software integration expertise to increasingly integrate and support open source software. Radisys professional services is also working closely with the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) on Central Office Re-Architected as a Data Center (CORD) reference designs, with a mission to deliver pragmatic SDN and NFV solutions based on open source networking software running on open COTS hardware for rapidly innovating and deploying residential, enterprise, and 5G mobile services.

• | Monetizing VoLTE and Video. Service providers are continuing to deploy revenue-generating applications for next generation LTE networks such as VoLTE, VoWiFi, WebRTC, Multimedia Conferencing, Mobile Value Added Services, Voice over IP ("VoIP") and Video over IP Communications. This growing variety of services and access technologies also introduces new high-definition audio and video codecs into the network, driving a need for transcoding audio streams encoded using different codec standards, or trans-rating video streams to connect an HD large screen video terminal to a mobile device with a smaller screen or slower network connection. In next generation IMS architectures, it is the Media Resource Function ("MRF") that performs the intensive audio and video media packet processing, providing the underlying foundation that enables delivery of these customer applications. We also recently introduced our Transcoding Resource Function (“TRF”) products to augment the high scale signaling capabilities of edge devices like Session Border Controllers ("SBCs") and Media Gateways ("MGWs") to help service providers preserve their investments and maximize signaling capacity by deploying the TRF which is optimized to high scale media interworking for today’s and tomorrow’s codecs that demand ever increasing processing power. Our vMRF and vTRF products are designed to provide media processing as a virtualized network function in an NFV architecture, while the Media Engine MPX-12000 and TRF-12000 are advanced multimedia resource functions for IMS networks that provides the scalable IP media processing required for high-capacity VoLTE, HD video and multimedia application and transcoding and media interworking. 


• | Maximizing spectrum utilization. Wireless spectrum is a limited resource over which data is transferred. Wireless network providers require continual technology advancements to allow increasing amounts of data to be transferred over the same band of wireless spectrum. The deployment of small cells, the emergence of heterogeneous networks ("HetNets") and the leap towards LTE-Advanced promises to further enhance spectrum utilization. The ability to take advantage of the possible spectrum available, such as FDD, TDD and non-continuous bands, is increasingly important for service providers as they seek to deliver increased capacity and performance to their subscribers. These trends are making networks more efficient, increasing capacity and coverage, and enabling service providers to more readily monetize mobile broadband usage. We have also seen a pivot towards the highly scalable centralized RAN architecture and its evolution towards virtual RAN. 

In contrast to the many factors driving growth in the markets in which our Software-Systems and DCEngine products are sold, the legacy embedded hardware markets, specifically in telecom where our Hardware Solutions products are sold, have come under significant pressure over the last several years. The industry has experienced increased hardware commoditization that, along with SDN and NFV trends and the improved capability of a data center like topology, has permanently altered the landscape for embedded telecom equipment manufacturers. This has resulted in the continued contraction of the overall market for these technologies. In this environment, it is necessary to narrow our focus and investment to strategic partnerships with key customers that value the quality, technology and extended support we provide. 
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to help communication services providers, and their strategic partners, create new revenue streams and drive cost out of their services delivery infrastructure. Specifically, by embracing open-standards hardware and software solutions, leveraging our portfolio of software intellectual property, and finally our deep expertise of telecom networks, we aim to become a new class of telecom equipment manufacturer. Where prior telecom equipment manufacturers aimed to lock service providers in to their proprietary architectures, we aim to provide best-in-class solutions, some of which will be open-standards-based, as well as becoming the integrator of choice to help these service providers migrate their existing networks to SDN, NFV and open-standards solutions. Where traditionally our customers have been large equipment manufacturers who have leveraged our products in their broader solutions, increasingly service providers are looking to decompose these 
 5

proprietary solutions from our traditional customers in order to both reduce the infrastructure costs of their networks while simultaneously gaining greater access to new disruptive technology. As a result, we expect to increasingly derive a greater proportion of our revenue directly from service providers rather than the traditional equipment manufacturer market into which we have historically sold.
Our top priorities across our strategic product families include:

• | Accelerating new service introduction in scalable SDN-enabled networks while significantly reducing network complexity and required investment with our suite of FlowEngine products. The explosion of video, broadband mobile devices and the Internet of Things has led to millions of data flows traversing the packet network that service providers are increasingly aiming to monetize. The service-aware FlowEngine intelligently distributes data flows to the VNF resources applicable to each session’s processing requirements, such as ad-insertion/removal applications, parental control applications, video optimization, network inspection capabilities, encryption-decryption offloading and policy enforcement applications all at line-rate speeds. Targeted specifically for communications and content providers that want more control and flexibility in their network, FlowEngine integrates with multiple open source SDN controllers through OpenFlow, OpenDaylight ("ODL") and ForCES for investment protection. We are working directly with a number of forward looking communication service providers and partners to accelerate service delivery, including our recent inclusion within the ONF as a contributing partner to integrate the open source based ONOS ("Open Network Operating System") SDN controller and orchestration fabric with our flow engine solution. 


• | Enabling media processing in the next-generation networks with our suite of the MediaEngine products, including the MPX-12000, TRF-12000, vMRF and vTRF, that furnish the media processing capabilities necessary for our customers' VoLTE and VoWiFi deployments, while at the same time maintaining our market position in legacy audio conferencing applications. This includes enabling our OneMRF strategy via the development of a rich ecosystem of independent software vendors and key channels to market via system integrators and OEM relationships with leading network equipment suppliers. To address the growing transcoding opportunities to interconnect newer IP services using the newest audio and video codecs, with legacy 3G and fixed line services using established codecs, Radisys now offers our MediaEngine Transcoding Resource Function (TRF) products, including our vTRF software transcoding solution for NFV or smaller deployments, as well as our hardware-based TRF-12000 with industry leading densities and economics.


• | Enabling the migration of central offices and edge infrastructure into virtualized data centers via our open-standards DCEngine systems. DCEngine is a high-density compute, network and storage based rack solution leveraging the OCP design principles. DCEngine is delivered as pre-integrated, ready-to-deploy frames and Pods that are higher density and lower cost, delivering hyperscale NFVi ready platforms enabling faster time to market for new services. DCEngine meets telecom next-generation central office and data center specifications for power, seismic, emissions and NEBS. We expect to sell this product directly to service providers and over time will also provide a pull-through opportunity for our Software-Systems products. 

In addition to our strategic products portfolio, our professional services organization enables service providers to rapidly deploy new technologies in their networks. Importantly, via our involvement in ONF and their CORD initiatives, we have been named an official systems integrator to help service providers deploy initial proof-of-concepts that ultimately have the opportunity to displace the entire existing central office infrastructure across telecom with open standards-based hardware and software solutions. While initial engagements may or may not include the sales of our strategic products, as a systems integrator we will gain direct access to Tier 1 service providers that we expect will further accelerate our strategy to sell our entire strategic product portfolio to these service providers over time.
We believe we are positioned to address the needs of our customers by:

• | Providing the technology that our customers require to meet the needs of continually evolving mobile, fixed and cable networks and the move to software-defined virtualized networks. Our FlowEngine, MediaEngine, and CellEngine product families leverage our unique technology and capabilities in traffic management, media processing, and protocol signaling that provide performance differentiation from our competition and thus enable customers to focus on their own differentiation and value-added applications.
