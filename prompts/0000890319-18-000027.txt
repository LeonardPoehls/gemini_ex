Item 1. BUSINESS.
The following discussion of our business contains various "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations or beliefs concerning future events and performance. We caution that although forward-looking statements reflect our good faith beliefs and reasonable judgment based upon current information, these statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, including those risks, uncertainties, and factors detailed from time to time in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and in particular those set forth under "Risk Factors" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The forward-looking statements included in this report are made as of the date hereof or the date specified herein. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update these forward-looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
The Company
Taubman Centers, Inc. (TCO or the Company) is a Michigan corporation (incorporated in 1973) that operates as a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust (REIT). The Taubman Realty Group Limited Partnership (the Operating Partnership or TRG) is a majority-owned partnership subsidiary of TCO that owns direct or indirect interests in all of our real estate properties. In this report, the terms "we", "us", and "our" refer to TCO, the Operating Partnership, and/or the Operating Partnership's subsidiaries as the context may require.
We own, lease, acquire, dispose of, develop, expand, and manage shopping centers and interests therein. Our owned portfolio of operating centers as of December 31, 2017 consisted of 24 urban and suburban shopping centers operating in 11 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, South Korea, and China. The Consolidated Businesses consist of shopping centers and entities that are controlled by ownership or contractual agreements, The Taubman Company LLC (Manager), and Taubman Properties Asia LLC and its subsidiaries (Taubman Asia). Shopping centers owned through joint ventures that are not controlled by us but over which we have significant influence (Unconsolidated Joint Ventures) are accounted for under the equity method. See "Item 2. Properties" for information regarding the centers.
Taubman Asia, which is the platform for our operations in China and South Korea, as well as any developments in Asia, is headquartered in Hong Kong.
We operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In order to satisfy the provisions of the Code applicable to REITs, we must distribute to our shareowners at least 90% of our REIT taxable income prior to net capital gains and meet certain other requirements. The Operating Partnership's partnership agreement provides that the Operating Partnership will distribute, at a minimum, sufficient amounts to its partners such that our pro rata share will enable us to pay shareowner dividends (including capital gains dividends that may be required upon the Operating Partnership's sale of an asset) that will satisfy the REIT provisions of the Code.
The U.S. Congress recently passed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that made significant changes to both corporate and individual tax rates and the resulting calculation of taxes, as well as international tax rules for U.S. domestic corporations. As a REIT, this legislation should minimally change the taxes we pay. However, it could impact the way in which our dividends are taxed on the holders of our stock.
We have one reportable segment, which owns, develops, and manages shopping centers. We have aggregated our shopping centers into this one reportable segment, as the shopping centers share similar economic characteristics and other similarities. See "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our consolidated financial statements for more information.

Business of the Company
We are engaged in the ownership, leasing, acquisition, disposition, development, expansion, and management of shopping centers and interests therein. We owned interests in 24 operating centers as of December 31, 2017. In the following discussion, the term "GLA" refers to gross retail space, including anchors and mall tenant areas, and the term "Mall GLA" refers to gross retail space, excluding anchors. The term "anchor" refers to a department store or other large retail store. The term "mall tenants" refers to stores (other than anchors) that lease space in shopping centers, including temporary tenants and specialty retailers.
As of December 31, 2017, the centers:

• | are strategically located in major metropolitan areas, many in communities that are among the most affluent in the U.S. or Asia, including Denver, Detroit, Honolulu, Kansas City, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, New York City, Orlando, Salt Lake City, San Francisco, San Juan, Sarasota, St. Louis, Tampa, Washington, D.C., Hanam (South Korea), Xi'an (China), and Zhengzhou (China);


• | range in size between 236,000 and 1.7 million square feet of GLA and between 186,000 and 1.0 million square feet of Mall GLA, with an average of 1.0 million and 0.5 million square feet, respectively. The smallest center has approximately 60 stores, and the largest has over 275 stores with an average of 150 stores per shopping center.


• | have approximately 3,300 stores operated by their mall tenants under approximately 1,700 trade names;


• | have 57 anchors, operating under 17 trade names;


• | lease approximately 90% of Mall GLA to national chains (U.S. centers only), including subsidiaries or divisions of Forever 21 (Forever 21 and XXI Forever), The Gap (Gap, Gap Kids, Baby Gap, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Athleta, and others), H&M, and Limited Brands (Bath & Body Works/White Barn Candle, Pink, Victoria's Secret, and others); and


• | are among the highest quality centers in the U.S. public regional mall industry as measured by our high portfolio average of mall tenants' sales per square foot. In 2017, our mall tenants at comparable centers reported average sales per square foot of $810.

The most important factor affecting the revenues generated by the centers is leasing to mall tenants (including temporary tenants and specialty retailers), which represents approximately 90% of revenues. Anchors account for less than 10% of revenues because many own their stores and, in general, those that lease their stores do so at rates substantially lower than those in effect for mall tenants.
Our portfolio is concentrated in highly productive shopping centers. Of our 24 owned centers, 21 have annualized rent rolls at December 31, 2017 of over $10 million. We believe that this level of productivity is indicative of the centers' strong competitive positions and is, in significant part, attributable to our business strategy and philosophy. We believe that our high-quality shopping centers are the least susceptible to direct competition because (among other reasons) anchors and specialty retail stores do not find it economically attractive to open additional stores in the immediate vicinity of an existing location for fear of competing with themselves. We also believe that our centers' success can be attributed in part to their other characteristics, such as being well-designed with effective layouts, natural light, good physical condition, strong retail programming, state-of-the-art technology infrastructure, and other amenities. Many of our shopping centers are also strategically located in high-quality markets, with convenient access to customers, including significant tourist traffic.

Business Strategy and Philosophy
We believe that the shopping center business is not simply a real estate development business, but rather an operating business in which a retailing approach to the ongoing management and leasing of the centers is essential. Thus we:

• | offer retailers a location where they can maximize their profitability. We believe leading retailers and emerging concepts choose to showcase their brand in the best markets and highest quality assets;


• | offer a large, diverse selection of retail stores and dining in each center to give customers a broad selection of consumer goods, food, and entertainment and a variety of price ranges;


• | endeavor to increase overall mall tenants' sales by leasing space to a constantly changing mix of tenants, thereby increasing rents over time;


• | seek to anticipate trends in our industry and emphasize ongoing introductions of new concepts into our centers. Due in part to this strategy, a number of successful retail trade names have opened their first mall stores in our centers. In addition, we have brought to the centers "new to the market" retailers and other retailers that previously served customers through online presences. We believe that the execution of this leasing strategy is an important element in building and maintaining customer loyalty and increasing mall productivity; and


• | provide innovative initiatives, including those that utilize technology and the Internet, to increase revenues, enhance the shopping experience, personalize our relationship with shoppers, build customer loyalty, and increase mall tenant sales, with the following as examples:


• | we are continuing to invest in other synergistic digital capabilities and are a developer of the "Smart Mall" concept. Of the 24 shopping centers in our portfolio, 20 are considered to be "Smart Malls." This technology includes a new fiber optic network throughout the centers, free shopper Wi-Fi, navigation and directory technology, advanced energy management, high-speed networking options for our tenants, new digital, mobile shopper engagement, and advanced shopper analytics.,


• | our Taubman website program connects shoppers to each of our individual center brands through the Internet;


• | we have a robust email program reaching our most loyal customers weekly and our social media sites offer retailers and customers an immediate geo-targeted communication vehicle;


• | we have pioneered an indoor navigation technology that has the potential to significantly change a shopper's experience and connect them to retailers in new ways. Since its pilot in 2014, we have rolled out the indoor navigation technology at 15 shopping centers in our portfolio;


• | we have begun installing "smart parking" systems at some of our shopping centers, providing customers real-time information about parking availability, most convenient spots, and directions to their parked cars; and


• | we were one of the first mall companies to implement a third-party loyalty program that directly and automatically connects shopper credit card activity within the shopping center to rewards earned in order to drive repeat shopper visits.

Our leasing strategy involves assembling a diverse and unique mix of mall tenants in each of the centers in order to attract customers, thereby generating higher sales by mall tenants. High sales by mall tenants make the centers attractive to prospective renewal and new tenants, thereby increasing the rental rates that current and prospective tenants are willing to pay. We have implemented an active leasing strategy to increase the centers' productivity and to set minimum rents at higher levels. Elements of this strategy include renegotiating existing leases and leasing space to prospective tenants that would enhance a center's retail mix.
The shopping centers compete for retail consumer spending through diverse, in-depth presentations of predominantly fashion merchandise in an environment intended to facilitate customer shopping. Many of our centers include stores that target high-end customers, and such stores may also attract other retailers to come to the center. Each center is always individually merchandised in light of the demographics of its potential customers within convenient driving distance. When necessary, we consider rebranding existing shopping centers in order to maximize customer loyalty, maintain and increase mall tenant sales, and achieve greater profitability.

Recent Trends in Retail
The U.S. shopping center industry is currently facing a number of challenges. Across the industry, department store sales have weakened and store closures have increased, with mature mall tenants and anchors rationalizing square footage. Mall tenant sales have been in an extended period of flattened growth. While there has been some stabilization of the retail landscape recently, the current retail headwinds have the potential to be prolonged and ultimately may still result in lost rent and increased unscheduled terminations. 
The impact of e-commerce on shopping center retail has been steadily increasing. There have been secular changes in shopper behavior affecting how, where, and what consumers shop for. Technology has intervened in the direct relationship between shoppers and the mall by enabling them to research, compare, and purchase products online easily, challenging our unique position as the main shopping portal within a trade area.
 While challenging traditional retail in the shorter-term, e-commerce is also making high quality brick-and-mortar assets more valuable, as retailers focus their real estate investments on the strongest assets. Successful retailers understand that a combination of both physical and digital channels best meet their customer needs. Physical locations are an important distribution channel that reduce order fulfillment and customer acquisition costs, while improving website traffic and brand recognition. Physical locations also allow for tenants to most successfully express their full brand statement, creating emotional connections to customers. We strive to position our assets to be desirable platforms for omni-channel retailers, believing technology improves the customer experience and will continue to do so, from the front of the house, logistics, efficiency, pricing, customer acquisition, customer knowledge and service. 
Over time we believe high-quality mall portfolios such as ours will continue to gain market share of mall tenant sales and rents. We expect to achieve this because brick-and-mortar remains the heart of omni-channel retailing. Our high-quality portfolio of shopping centers complements retailers' strategies by positioning their brands among high-end, productive retailers in the best markets. We believe the current environment of consolidation of shopping centers will cause high-quality portfolios such as ours to become more valuable, solidifying our position in our current markets, and ultimately leading to greater market share. As an upscale, niche player in our industry, most of our assets have a unique value proposition in their respective markets - nearly 80% of our malls are number one or two in their markets. They remain critical brick-and-mortar locations for retail brands and important destinations for shoppers. This is a strength of our assets that represents a key advantage against our larger competitors in our industry.
Apparel retailers, traditionally a dominant category for malls, have been facing particularly challenging times of late. While it is prudent to continuously adjust the use of space in order to broaden the mall experience, we believe that dramatic reallocation of in-line space to other tenants across the board for the sake of reducing exposure to apparel is neither economically sustainable nor strategically necessary. However, we expect that additional dining, entertainment, grocery, fitness, events and other new uses over time will encourage more shopping destination trips and strengthen our malls as social hubs in their communities.
Throughout the industry, traditional department stores have been experiencing declining sales and market shares. As a result, some department stores have been pursuing strategies of consolidation and/or closure of under-performing locations. Given the overall quality of our real estate, however, many of our department stores have been performing comparatively well. As a result, we do not expect that we will have as many opportunities as others in our industry to reacquire and re-purpose anchor locations, with department stores often being reluctant to exit our malls. However, in the event of anchor closures, we generally expect re-purposing of anchors to add value strategically and be accretive financially.

Potential For Growth
Our principal objective is to enhance shareowner value. We seek to maximize the financial results of our core assets, while also pursuing a growth strategy that includes redevelopment of existing centers as well as a new center development program. As our current development pipeline is now largely complete in the U.S., our emphasis will now be on strengthening and growing our core assets, in addition to stabilizing our newest projects and executing our redevelopments. We continue to invest for the future and are creating value in our centers that is intended to lead to sustained growth for our shareowners. Our internally generated funds and distributions from operating centers and other investing activities (including strategic dispositions), augmented by use of our existing revolving lines of credit and unsecured term loans, provide resources to maintain our current operations and assets, pay dividends, and fund a portion of our major capital investments. Generally, our need to access the capital markets is limited to refinancing debt obligations at or near maturity and, funding major capital investments. From time to time, we also may access the equity markets or sell interests in shopping centers to raise additional funds or refinance existing obligations on a strategic basis, including using excess proceeds therefrom.
Internal Growth
As noted in "Business Strategy and Philosophy" above in detail, our core business strategy is to maintain a portfolio of properties that deliver above-market profitable growth by providing targeted retailers with the best opportunity to do business in each market and targeted shoppers with the best local shopping experience for their needs.
We continue to expect that over time a significant portion of our future growth will come from our existing core portfolio and business. We have always had and will continue to have a culture of intensively managing our assets and maximizing the rents from mall tenants as this is a key growth driver going forward.
An element of our internal growth over time is the strategic expansion and redevelopment of existing properties to update and enhance their market positions by adding, replacing, re-tenanting, or otherwise re-merchandising the use of anchor space, increasing mall tenant space, or rebranding centers. Most of the centers have been designed to accommodate expansions. Expansion projects can be as significant as new shopping center construction in terms of scope and cost, requiring governmental and existing anchor store approvals, design and engineering activities, including rerouting utilities, providing additional parking areas or decking, acquiring additional land, and relocating anchors and mall tenants (all of which must take place with minimum disruption to existing tenants and customers).
A comprehensive renovation is underway at Beverly Center and is scheduled to be completed by the 2018 holiday season. Additionally, we have an ongoing redevelopment project at The Mall at Green Hills that will add approximately 170,000 square feet of incremental GLA that we expect to be completed in 2019. 
We also look to monetize our common areas through robust specialty leasing and sponsorship programs. About 8% of our 2017 comparable center Net Operating Income (NOI) was generated from such programs. In the past five years, comparable center NOI from leasing and sponsorship programs has ranged from 8% to 11%. Examples found in our centers include destination holiday experiences, customer service programs, sponsored children's play areas, and turnkey attractions. In addition, we monetize our common areas through static and digital media that comes in a variety of formats.
External Growth
We pursue various areas of external growth, including traditional center development in the U.S., new opportunities in Asia, and acquisitions. We opened one new center in 2017 and three new centers in 2016: one in Hawaii, one in South Korea, and two in China. We continue to evaluate various development and acquisition possibilities for additional new centers. 
Development of New U.S. Centers
We have developed 14 U.S. properties since 1998, or an average of about one every 18 months. Over the past three years, we have opened two new U.S. centers:

• | International Market Place opened in Waikiki, Honolulu, Hawaii in August 2016. We have a 93.5% interest in the 0.3 million square foot center, which is subject to a participating ground lease.


• | The Mall of San Juan opened in San Juan, Puerto Rico in March 2015. We have a 95% ownership interest in the 0.6 million square foot center.

Given the over saturation of suburban retail in the U.S., almost no new supply of suburban malls is expected in the foreseeable future. Current trends suggest that any future new supply of malls will likely be limited and in the format of mixed-use or destination projects. We do expect expansions of high-quality malls will continue as lower quality centers atrophy. In the next five years, in addition to the redevelopment of Beverly Center and The Mall at Green Hills expansion, we will pro-actively pursue the re-purposing of anchors where appropriate. We do not anticipate significant new ground-up developments.
While we will continue to evaluate potential future U.S. development projects using criteria, including financial criteria for rates of return, similar to those employed in the past, no assurances can be given that the adherence to these criteria will produce comparable or projected results in the future. In addition, the costs of shopping center development opportunities that are explored but ultimately abandoned will, to some extent, diminish the overall return on development projects taken as a whole. See "MD&A – Liquidity and Capital Resources – Capital Spending" for further discussion of our development activities.
In 2015, we made a decision not to move forward with an enclosed mall that was intended to be part of the Miami Worldcenter mixed-use, urban development in Miami, Florida. As a result of this decision, an impairment charge of $11.8 million was recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015, which represents previously capitalized costs related to the pre-development of the enclosed mall plan. 
Miami Worldcenter's master developer, Miami Worldcenter Associates, is pursuing a high street retail plan as a part of their master development of the site. We have agreed with Miami Worldcenter Associates on terms for a co-leasing services agreement with The Forbes Company for the retail portion of the street level project, with an option to purchase the retail component at a favorable price once it opens.
Asia
We are pursuing a development strategy in Asia to:

• | provide additional growth through exposure to countries that have more rapidly growing gross domestic products (GDPs);


• | utilize our expertise, including leasing/retailer relationships, design/development expertise, and operational/marketing skills; and


• | take advantage of a generational opportunity, as the demand for high-quality retail is early to mid-cycle, there is significant deal flow, and it diversifies longer-term growth investment opportunities.

Taubman Asia is responsible for our operations and development in the Asia-Pacific region, focusing on China and South Korea. We have pursued a strategy of seeking strategic partners to jointly develop high quality malls in our areas of focus. Taubman Asia is engaged in projects that leverage our strong retail planning, design, and operational capabilities with our strategic partners being responsible for acquiring and entitling the land and leading construction. 
We currently have two joint ventures with Wangfujing Group Co., Ltd (Wangfujing), one of China's largest department store chains. The first joint venture owns an interest in and manages an approximately 1.0 million square foot shopping center, CityOn.Xi'an, which opened in April 2016 and is located at Xi'an Saigao City Plaza, a large-scale mixed-use development in Xi'an, China. We have an effective 50% ownership interest in the center. The second joint venture with Wangfujing owns an interest in and manages an approximately 1.0 million square foot shopping center, CityOn.Zhengzhou, which opened in March 2017 and is located in Zhengzhou, China. We beneficially own a 49% interest in the center.
We also have a joint venture with Shinsegae Group, one of South Korea's largest retailers, that owns and manages an approximately 1.7 million square foot shopping center, Starfield Hanam, in Hanam, South Korea. The center opened in September 2016. We have partnered with a major institution in Asia for a 49% ownership interest in Starfield Hanam. The institutional partner owns 14.7% of the center, bringing our effective ownership to 34.3%.
As part of our Asia strategy, we look to mitigate our operating costs through third-party service contracts when possible. We previously provided leasing and management services for IFC Mall in Yeouido, Seoul, South Korea, although these services ended in 2017 in connection with a change in ownership of the mall. We also currently provide leasing and management services for the retail portion of Studio City, a cinematically-themed integrated entertainment, retail and gaming resort developed by Melco Crown Entertainment Limited in the Cotai region of Macau, China.
 7

We envision that the Asia business will be a smaller but complementary and important part of the overall business. We have built three high-quality shopping centers and a fully integrated development and management platform with strategic, local partners. Our goal is to create a platform that finances itself by bringing in new capital partners, and potentially adding additional operating partners where appropriate, to create a less capital-intensive business that can grow the asset base with improved returns on equity.
We also attempt to manage risks and financial returns for our Asia developments through actively managing and limiting pre-construction costs, ensuring there is adequate anchor and tenant interest in the project prior to construction, and pursuing initial projects that are already fully entitled with partners having appropriate expertise in land acquisition and local regulatory issues. Developments in China and South Korea are subject to income taxes and taxes upon repatriation of earnings that also must be planned for and managed.
See "MD&A - Results of Operations - Taubman Asia" for further details regarding our activities in Asia.
Strategic Acquisitions
We expect attractive opportunities to acquire existing centers, or interests in existing centers, from other companies may be scarce and expensive. However, we continue to look for assets in both the U.S. and Asia where we can add significant value or that would be strategic to the rest of our portfolio. Our objective is to acquire existing centers only when they are compatible with the quality of our portfolio, or can be redeveloped to that level. We also may acquire additional interests in centers currently in our portfolio.
In March 2016, a joint venture we formed with The Macerich Company acquired Country Club Plaza, a mixed-use retail and office property in Kansas City, Missouri, from Highwood Properties for $660 million ($330 million at TRG’s beneficial share) in cash, excluding transaction costs. This purchase is consistent with our strategy to own high quality, dominant assets in great markets. See "MD&A - Results of Operations - Acquisition - Country Club Plaza" for additional information regarding the acquisition.
Rental Rates
As leases have expired in the centers, we have generally been able to rent the available space, either to the existing tenant or a new tenant, at rental rates that are higher than those of the expired leases. Generally, center revenues have increased as older leases rolled over or were terminated early and replaced with new leases negotiated at current rental rates that were usually higher than the average rates for existing leases. In periods of increasing sales, rents on new leases will generally tend to rise. In periods of slower growth or declining sales, rents on new leases will generally grow more slowly or will decline for the opposite reason, as tenants' expectations of future growth become less optimistic. Where appropriate, we are occasionally making decisions as we re-tenant space to use some shorter leases in order to maintain occupancy, merchandising, and preserve cash flow when possible. See "Risk Factors" for further information.
The following table contains certain information regarding average mall tenant minimum rent per square foot of our Consolidated Businesses and Unconsolidated Joint Ventures at the comparable centers (centers that had been owned and open for the current and preceding year, excluding centers impacted by significant redevelopment activity, as well as The Mall of San Juan due to the impact of Hurricane Maria). Comparable center statistics for 2017 and 2016 exclude Beverly Center, CityOn.Xi'an, CityOn.Zhengzhou, Country Club Plaza, International Market Place, The Mall of San Juan, and Starfield Hanam. Average rent per square foot statistics reflect the contractual rental terms of the leases currently in effect and include the impact of rental concessions.

Lease Expirations
The following table shows scheduled lease expirations for mall tenants based on information available as of December 31, 2017 for the next ten years for all owned centers in operation at that date.

(1) | Excludes rents from temporary in-line tenants and centers not open and operating at December 31, 2017.


(2) | In addition to tenants with spaces 10,000 square feet or less, includes tenants with spaces over 10,000 square feet and value and outlet center anchors. Excludes rents from mall anchors and temporary in-line tenants. 


(3) | Weighted average of the annualized contractual rent per square foot as of the end of the reporting period.


(4) | Excludes leases that expire in 2018 for which renewal leases or leases with replacement tenants have been executed as of December 31, 2017.

We believe that the information in the table is not necessarily indicative of what will occur in the future, principally because of early lease terminations at the centers. The average remaining term of the leases that were terminated during the 2012 to 2017 period was less than one year. The average term of leases signed was approximately seven and six years during 2017 and 2016, respectively.
In addition, mall tenants at the centers may seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws, which could result in the termination of such tenants' leases and thus cause a reduction in cash flow. In 2017, tenants representing 3.1% of leases filed for bankruptcy during the year compared to 0.8% in 2016. This statistic has ranged from 0.3% to 3.1% of leases per year over the last five years. The annual provision for losses on accounts receivable represents 1.8% of total revenues in 2017 and has ranged from 0.1% to 1.8% over the last five years. However, many bankruptcies do not ultimately impact our occupancy, historically less than half of bankrupt tenants actually close.

Occupancy
Occupancy and leased space statistics include temporary in-line tenants (TILs) and value and outlet center anchors (Arizona Mills, Dolphin Mall, Great Lakes Crossing Outlets, and Taubman Prestige Outlets Chesterfield).

Major Tenants
No single retail company represents 5% or more of our Mall GLA or revenues. The combined operations of Forever 21 accounted for about 4% of Mall GLA as of December 31, 2017 and less than 3% of 2017 minimum rent. No other single retail company accounted for more than 4% of Mall GLA as of December 31, 2017 or 4% of 2017 minimum rent.

Competition
There are numerous shopping facilities that compete with our properties in attracting retailers to lease space. We compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities. We also compete with online retailers as they draw sales away from our tenants, which impacts rental rates. See "Risk Factors" for further details of our competitive business.
Seasonality
The shopping center industry in the U.S. is seasonal in nature, with mall tenant sales highest in the fourth quarter due to the Christmas season, and with lesser, though still significant, sales fluctuations associated with the Easter holiday and back-to-school period. See "MD&A – Seasonality" for further discussion.
Environmental Matters
See "Risk Factors" regarding discussion of environmental matters.
Financial Information about Geographic Areas 
We have not had material consolidated revenues attributable to foreign countries in the last three years or material consolidated long-lived assets located in a country other than the United States, as our investments in Asia are unconsolidated joint ventures and are accounted for under the equity method.

We have engaged the Manager to provide real estate management, acquisition, development, leasing, and administrative services required by us and our properties in the U.S. Taubman Asia Management Limited (TAM) and certain other affiliates provide similar services for third parties in China and South Korea as well as Taubman Asia.
As of December 31, 2017, the Manager, TAM, and certain other affiliates had 468 full-time employees. See "Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Severance Policies and Restructuring Charge" to our consolidated financial statements for information on our recent restructuring.
