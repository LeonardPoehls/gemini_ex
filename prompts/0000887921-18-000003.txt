The Company’s global sourcing strategy for materials and components from qualified vendors is also designed to ensure that the Company maintains a continuous supply of high quality raw materials and components. The Company believes that alternate sources of raw materials and components exist and does not anticipate any significant shortages of, or difficulty in obtaining, such materials. (See Item 1A. "Risk Factors - The Company depends on its Oxford, North Carolina facility for production of a substantial portion of its products within the Consumer segment. Disruptions at this facility and/or at other Company or third-party facilities at which the Company's products are manufactured for its Consumer, Elizabeth Arden and Professional segments, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.")

The Elizabeth Arden and Red Door trademarks are also licensed to a third party in which the Company has a minority interest for the operation of the Elizabeth Arden Red Door Spa beauty salons and spas through which Elizabeth Arden products are sold and which also enables the Company to leverage the unique Red Door Spa heritage to generate both organic and innovation-driven growth. As of December 31, 2017, 10 of such licenses were in effect for 18 categories of beauty- and fashion-related products and services. Pursuant to such licenses, the Company retains strict control over product design and development, product and service quality, advertising and the use of its trademarks. These licensing arrangements offer opportunities for the Company to generate revenues and cash flow through royalties and renewal fees, some of which are prepaid from time-to-time.
In the Consumer segment, the Company’s retail merchandisers maintain the Company's point-of-sale wall displays intended to ensure that high-selling SKUs are in stock and to ensure the optimal presentation of the Company's products in retailers.
