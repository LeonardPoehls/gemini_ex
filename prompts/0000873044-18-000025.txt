General
Radisys Corporation (NASDAQ: RSYS), a global leader in open telecom solutions, enables service providers to drive disruption with new open architecture business models. Radisys’ innovative disaggregated and virtualized enabling technology solutions leverage open reference architectures and standards, combined with open software and hardware to power business transformation for the telecom industry, while its world-class services organization delivers systems integration expertise necessary to solve communications and content providers’ complex deployment challenges. We operate in two primary segments, Software-Systems and Hardware Solutions.

• | Software-Systems products and services are targeted at delivering differentiated solutions for service providers to enable their deployment of next generation networks and technologies. This segment is comprised of the following differentiated offerings, all of which are aimed at enabling service providers to more rapidly adopt new technologies while driving down the costs of their network infrastructure.


◦ | MediaEngine products are designed into IP Communications Networks, including the IP Multimedia Subsystem ("IMS") core of telecom networks, providing the necessary media processing capabilities required for a broad range of applications including Voice over Long-Term Evolution ("VoLTE"), Voice over WiFi (“VoWifi”), cloud communication platform as a service ("CPaaS"), Web Real-Time Communication ("WebRTC"), multimedia conferencing, as well as the transcoding required to achieve interoperability between legacy and new generation devices using disparate audio and video codecs. Evolution of the traditional media function to an all-IP virtual network function is critical for modernization of real time voice and video services. Our MediaEngine OneMRF strategy helps service providers consolidate their real-time IP media processing into a vendor and application agnostic platform, which drives cost out of their service delivery platform and enables accelerated deployment and introduction of new services. We sell virtualized, software-only vMRF for customers who require media processing in an Intel architecture and Network Functions Virtualization ("NFV") platforms. Our MediaEngine provides the essential media processing capability that enables service providers to deliver audio, video and other multimedia services over their all-IP networks.


◦ | MobilityEngine (previously disclosed as CellEngine) portfolio provides solutions for 4G, LTE-Advanced and emerging 5G standards for Radio Access Network (RAN) use cases including Centralized, Virtualized and Mobile (or Multi Access as it is now known) Edge Compute ("MEC"). Cloud or Centralized Radio Access Network (C-RAN) disaggregates the RAN baseband unit (BBU) from traditional eNodeB enabling it to run on common generic compute platforms, making network decisions more efficient compared to traditional cellular networks. MEC is based on open platforms and software that allows virtualized applications to be deployed closest to the network edge to meet the requirements of ultra-low latency, real time network access and context needed for 5G, streaming video and massive IoT applications. Our MobilityEngine portfolio helps Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs), Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) and Certified Systems Professionals build networks for these capabilities with accelerated time to market, reduced risk and lowered Total Cost of Ownership. One of the significant network re-evolutions is the 3GPP standards defines a vertical split for Central Unit ("CU") - Distributed Unit ("DU") as well as horizontal split for Control Plane - User Plane ("CUPS"). Our MobilityEngine software helps support these various options for flexible, scalable and programmable network deployment paradigms. 


◦ | FlowEngine products target the communication service provider traffic management market and is a family of products designed to rapidly classify millions of data flows and then distribute these flows to thousands of Virtualized Network Functions ("VNF"). FlowEngine offloads the processing for packet classification and distribution, improving virtualized function utilization and making the overall NFV architecture more efficient. A FlowEngine system consists of FlowEngine software running on a Traffic Distribution Engine ("TDE") platform. FlowEngine Software enables communication service providers to efficiently transition towards NFV and software-defined networking ("SDN") architectures allowing increased service agility and quicker time to revenue for new service offerings. FlowEngine accomplishes this by integrating a targeted subset of edge routing, data center switching, and load balancing functionality, coupled with standards based SDN protocols, enabling our customers to significantly reduce the investment necessary to efficiently process data flows in virtualized communications environments.

◦ | Also included in this segment is our Professional Services organization that is staffed with telecommunications experts who are available to assist our customers as they develop their own unique telecommunications products and applications as well as accelerating specific features developed across our Software-Systems product families. Our strategy is to enable the efficient and cost-effective adoption of our Software-Systems products as well as enabling service providers to accelerate the adoption of open-standards based solutions as part of their next generation networks aimed at significantly reducing the total cost of ownership of their network infrastructure.


• | Hardware Solutions leverages our hardware design expertise, coupled with our manufacturing, supply chain, integration and service capabilities, to enable differentiation from our competition. While the Software-Systems business will be our core strategic focus moving forward, we continue to support existing customers that value the products we deliver within our Hardware Solutions segment. Our products include the following two primary product families:


◦ | DCEngine products include open-based rack-scale systems, utilizing Open Compute Project accepted specifications, which enable service providers to migrate their existing infrastructure to embrace the efficiencies and scale of data center environments. This product suite brings the economies of the data center and the agility of the cloud to service provider infrastructure, allowing them to accelerate the transformation to cloud based compute, storage and networking fabrics utilizing the best of commodity components, open source hardware specifications and software coupled with world class service and support. The DCEngine platform enables service providers to drive innovation and the rapid scalable delivery of virtualized network functions at the network edge, enabling new services such as storage backup, video on demand and parental controls. 


◦ | Embedded products which includes our ATCA, computer-on-module express (COM Express) and rack mount servers. These products are predominantly hardware-based and include both our internal designs as well as increasingly leveraging third party hardware which incorporates our management software and services capabilities. Our products enable the control and movement of data in both 3G and LTE telecom networks and provide the hardware enablement for network elements applications such as Deep Packet Inspection ("DPI"), policy management and intelligent gateways (security, femto and LTE gateways). Additionally, our products enable image processing capabilities for healthcare markets and enable cost-effective and energy-efficient computing capabilities dedicated for industrial deployments. Our professional service organization of systems architects, hardware designers, and network experts accelerates our customers' time to market on these revenue generating assets. 

While we will retain the ability to support our long-standing customer’s service needs given the extended nature of telecom deployments, substantially all of the products within our Hardware Solutions' portfolio have trended to end-of-life without future generation designs. Given the increased commoditization of hardware across our industry, coupled with our increased strategic focus in our Software-Systems product line, many customers had expected last time orders fulfilled over the course of 2017. As a result, going forward we expect to have a substantially smaller set of customers and corresponding revenues across these product lines in future periods.

Market Drivers
Our Software-Systems products uniquely position us to capitalize on the ongoing and upcoming global deployments of 4G Long Term Evolution ("LTE") mobile and 5G networks. Increasingly, service providers need to monetize the services that will be delivered to their end customers, while also virtualizing their core network infrastructures by embracing open-standards hardware and best in class open source and proprietary software. Further, as hardware becomes increasingly commoditized and service providers respond by moving away from purpose-built network elements to a virtualized architecture, the demand for devices that ensure the efficient and cost-effective flow of ever increasing amounts of data is expected to grow significantly. Specifically, demand for data and video traffic continues to expand exponentially as a result of increasing usage of smart phones, tablets and other wireless devices. In this evolving market, success demands a deep expertise in deploying fully integrated custom wireless and cloud applications. The key market drivers that we view as fundamental to our future success include the following:
 4


• | Virtualization and Disaggregation of Telecom Networks. Service providers are continually looking to increase average revenue per user, while reducing infrastructure costs and accelerating the deployment of new and exciting revenue-generating services. In order to accelerate these initiatives, communication service providers are turning to SDN, NFV and containers to more efficiently manage these services, while simultaneously reducing infrastructure costs. 


• | Open Platforms, Open API’s and Open Integration. The majority of today’s telecommunication networking equipment, including routers, switches, gateways, and session border controllers, have been provided by industry suppliers based on proprietary hardware architectures with proprietary software functions. While this approach often delivers high performance, the downside is a network composed of disparate hardware and software components that are expensive to integrate, manage and support, while also limiting new service time to market and innovations. Network service providers are now beginning to embrace the recent trends underway in large Enterprise-class data center design, where data center operators are building next-generation data centers based on open Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware components, powered by both differentiated as well as open source software. Our professional services organization is increasingly focused on extending its software integration expertise to integrate and support open source software. By leveraging our services expertise we are also working closely with the Open Networking Foundation (ONF) on Central Office Re-Architected as a Data Center (CORD) reference designs, with a mission to deliver pragmatic SDN and NFV solutions based on open source networking software running on open COTS hardware for rapidly innovating and deploying residential, enterprise, and 5G mobile services. We have also worked closely with various open-standards bodies to define and develop open API’s to create new approaches to building and deploying telecom network infrastructure. 


• | 5G and Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC). 5G and MEC will usher in a revolution of next generation network infrastructure with services demanding lower latency, better capacity and higher speeds. The 5G network infrastructure market is expected to grow aggressively, with a predicted $28 billion in annual spend by the end of 2025, driving service providers to seek out not only technically disruptive solutions to meet 5G application demand, but commercially disruptive as well. To assist service providers in meeting these technical and commercial requirements, we bring together industry-leading small cell and RAN software and telecom expertise, combined with our commitment leading open-standards organizations such as the Open Networking Foundation, xRAN Foundation and the Telecom Infra Project, to deliver MobilityEngine designed specifically to enable mobile service providers to reduce significantly capital and operating expenditures as they roll out their 5G networks.


• | Monetizing VoLTE and Video. Service providers are continuing to deploy revenue-generating applications for next generation LTE networks such as VoLTE, VoWiFi, WebRTC, Multimedia Conferencing, Mobile Value Added Services, Voice over IP ("VoIP") and Video over IP Communications. This growing variety of services and access technologies also introduces new high-definition audio and video codecs into the network, driving a need for transcoding audio streams encoded using different codec standards, or trans-rating video streams to connect an HD large screen video terminal to a mobile device with a smaller screen or slower network connection. In next generation IMS architectures, it is the Media Resource Function ("MRF") that performs the intensive audio and video media packet processing, providing the underlying foundation that enables delivery of these customer applications. We also recently introduced our Transcoding Resource Function (“TRF”) products to augment the high scale signaling capabilities of edge devices like Session Border Controllers ("SBCs") and Media Gateways ("MGWs") to help service providers preserve their investments and maximize signaling capacity by deploying the TRF which is optimized to high scale media interworking for today’s and tomorrow’s codecs that demand ever increasing processing power. Our vMRF and vTRF products are designed to provide media processing as a virtualized network function in an NFV architecture, while the Media Engine MPX-12000 and TRF-12000 are advanced multimedia resource functions for IMS networks that provides the scalable IP media processing required for high-capacity VoLTE, HD video and multimedia application and transcoding and media interworking. 

In contrast to the many factors driving growth in our target markets, the legacy embedded hardware markets, specifically in telecom where our Hardware Solutions products are sold, have come under significant pressure over the last several years. The industry has experienced increased hardware commoditization that, along with SDN and NFV trends and the improved capability of a data center like topology, has permanently altered the landscape for embedded telecom equipment manufacturers. This has resulted in the continued contraction of the overall market for these technologies. In this environment, it is necessary to narrow our focus and investment to strategic partnerships with key customers that value the quality, technology and extended support we provide while also transitioning away from hardware-centric offerings to software-centric solutions which leverage both our intellectual property as well as our services capabilities.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to help communication services providers, and their strategic partners, create new revenue streams and drive cost out of their services delivery infrastructure. Specifically, by embracing open-standards hardware and software solutions, leveraging our portfolio of software intellectual property, and finally deploying our deep expertise of telecom networks, we aim to become a new class of telecom equipment manufacturer. Where prior telecom equipment manufacturers aimed to lock service providers into their proprietary architectures, we aim to provide best-in-class solutions, some of which will be open-standards-based, as well as becoming the integrator of choice to help these service providers migrate their existing networks to SDN, NFV and open-standards solutions. Where traditionally our customers have been large equipment manufacturers who have leveraged our products in their broader solutions, increasingly service providers are looking to decompose these proprietary solutions from our traditional customers in order to both reduce the infrastructure costs of their networks while simultaneously gaining greater access to new disruptive technology. As a result, we now expect our revenues to be derived from both channel relationships via traditional equipment manufacturers as well as direct business from service providers leveraging our software products and services capabilities. 
Our top priorities across our strategic product families include:

• | Enabling media processing in next-generation communication networks with our suite of the MediaEngine products, virtual / NFV software media server and NFV-acceleration using hardware assist including a combination of GPUs, DSPs, and Intel architecture CPUs, that furnish the media processing capabilities necessary for our customers' VoLTE, VoWiFi, and Over the Top (OTT) deployments, while at the same time maintaining our market position application domains including conferencing, RCS, public safety, and others. This is enabled by our OneMRF strategy via the development of a rich ecosystem of independent software vendors and key channels to market via system integrators and OEM relationships with leading network equipment suppliers. To address the growing transcoding opportunities to interconnect newer IP services using the newest audio and video codecs, with legacy 3G and fixed line services using established codecs, we now offer our MediaEngine Transcoding Resource Function (TRF) products with industry leading densities and associated ROI for service providers.


• | Providing software building blocks for five key areas of 4G LTE-Advance Pro and 5G wireless networks deployment use cases namely (1) Multi Access Edge Compute (MEC) for video optimization, low latency applications and local content delivery; (2) enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) for extreme capacity and high data rates; (3) mission critical applications like remote surgery that need ultra low-latency with ultra-reliable security and ultra-resilient connectivity; (4) Massive IoT via NB IoT and CAT M1 for deep coverage, ultra-low energy and ultra-low complexity; and (5) Citizen Broadband Radio Service (CBRS) band supporting Neutral Host Networks for hetnet topologies with small cell connectivity. Additionally, our professional services capabilities will enable our customers to further customize development, integrate, validate and test the solutions for their deployments.


• | In addition to our strategic products portfolio, our professional services organization enables service providers to rapidly deploy new technologies in their networks. While initial engagements may or may not include the sales of our strategic products, as a systems integrator we will gain direct access to Tier 1 service providers that we expect will further accelerate our strategy to sell our entire strategic product portfolio to these service providers over time.


• | Accelerating new service introduction in scalable SDN-enabled networks while significantly reducing network complexity and required investment with our suite of FlowEngine products. The explosion of video, broadband mobile devices and the Internet of Things has led to millions of data flows traversing the packet network that service providers are increasingly aiming to monetize. The service-aware FlowEngine intelligently distributes data flows to the VNF resources applicable to each session’s processing requirements, such as ad-insertion/removal applications, parental control applications, video optimization, network inspection capabilities, encryption-decryption offloading and policy enforcement applications all at line-rate speeds. Targeted specifically for communications and content providers that want more control and flexibility in their network, FlowEngine integrates with multiple open source SDN controllers through OpenFlow, OpenDaylight ("ODL") and ForCES for investment protection. We are working directly with a number of forward looking communication service providers and partners to accelerate service delivery, including our recent inclusion within the ONF as a contributing partner to integrate the open source based ONOS ("Open Network Operating System") SDN controller and orchestration fabric with our flow engine solution.
