ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
T-BAMM is a company that intends to be an on-line store specializing in T-Shirts for the entire family, manufactured from Bamboo. The Company’s target market are consumers who are looking for eco-friendly and environmentally sustainable products. We intend to identify and distinguish ourselves by positioning our proposed product at very competitive pricing, targeting a broad base of consumers.
 
The Company has begun to implement its business model. A logo and website has been developed; we have sourced our bamboo t-shirt manufacturer and we have launched our website www.tbamm.com. We have also registered our website domain; www.tbamm.com. T-BAMM has as of date of this Form 10-K has not generated any revenues we expect to have sales by the third quarter of 2017. 
 
Our independent registered public accountant has issued an audit opinion which includes statement expressing substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Accordingly, there will be illiquidity of any future trading market until the Company begins to generate revenues.
 
The Company intends to focus on the selling of Bamboo T-Shirts via our proposed on-line store. We intend to sell products comprised of a minimum of 80% natural bamboo viscose. The Company has decided to focus on products with bamboo as the main fiber because of its popularity as a green fibre. According to Wikipedia bamboo is one of the fastest-growing plants on Earth and environmentally friendly and sustainable, with reported growth rates of 98 inches in 24 hours. However, the growth rate depends on local soil and climate condition, as well as species (1,600 species exist in the world), and a more typical rate is 1.2 to 3.9 inches per day. As a raw material bamboo is one of the most renewable, biodegradable, and fastest-growing resources on the planet. It uses space and water efficiently, has amazing carbon sequestering abilities and it does not need replanting. As a resource, its environment benefits are unquestionable. The Company has targeted the growing trend of consumers who are looking for products that environmentally friendly and renewable.
 
There is the likelihood that we may never be able to market bamboo t-shirt product that the Company would need to successfully complete and implement its plan of operation. If our company is not capable of building a market for its product, all funds that we spend on development will be lost.

Industry Analysis/Competition
 
Market Analysis 
 
As bamboo fabric is a relative brand new market there are no official sales figures. What we can do is look at patterns of and predictions for organic cotton, currently the main clothing target for ethical buyers. It is important to note that bamboo clothing has a higher performance than organic cotton. According to Bamboo Clothing; the ‘ethically produced’ clothing market, principally organic cotton, grows at a 30% per annum. Growth in the retail clothing sector is general maintained at 1-2%. A plethora of major brands and retail houses are beginning to recognize this growth area. These companies include Disney, Mothercare, Nike, Marks and Spencer. An ethical product that also enjoys multiple high-performance characteristic would expect to be a top future performer by any standard. This is bamboo.
 
According to Bamboo Clothing, bamboo has a unique combination of selling points. Bamboo fabric is durable, breathable, which is useful but not exceptions. Its incredible softness and natural luster are exceptional, similar to fine cashmere. Other qualities of bamboo according to Wikipedia in studies comparing it to cotton and polyester it is found that; bamboo is extremely resilient and durable as a fiber; it is found to have a higher breaking tenacity; better moisture wicking properties and better moisture absorption. In superseding these other fibers in these various areas, supporters of bamboo fiber products and goods tout it a more Eco-friendly than cotton and polyester.
 
According to 2012 U.S. Organic Industry Survey Overview Organic Trade Association, over a 9-year period the organic non-food segment grew 400% from $439 million to $2.2 billion, while the equivalent overall non-food market grew by 33%. The Outlook for the “natural segment” in (non-food) natural products industry worldwide is expected to average double-digit annual growth through 2016.
 
Competition 
 
The Bamboo T-Shirt market is primarily a niche market dominated by small to medium companies. However there is a growing trend in this market and some of the larger outlets are beginning to carry bamboo fabric products. These companies include; Cariloha Bamboo, Natural Clothing Company, Rapanui Clothing Company, Tasc Performance, Bamboo Village and Bamboo clothing is also sold through Amazon.com.
 
The primary competitive edge of Fruit On Fire, Inc. will be the taste of our blend fruit and spice based proposed hot sauce product. There is the likelihood that we may never be able to market our niche hot sauce product that the Company would need to successfully complete and implement its plan of operation. If our company is not capable of building a market for its product, all funds that we spend on development will be lost.
 
Patent and Trademarks
