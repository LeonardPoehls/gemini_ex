Harbor, Ocean Towing and Bunkering Services. In the harbor towing trade, harbor tugs operate alongside oceangoing vessels to escort vessels to their berth, assist in docking and undocking, and escort them back out to sea. As of December 31, 2017, Ocean Services’ U.S.-flag harbor tugs were operating in various ports including three in Port Everglades, Florida, one in Port Miami, Florida, five in the Port of Tampa, Florida, two in Port Canaveral, Florida, six in Port Arthur, Texas, three in Mobile, Alabama and three in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Ocean Services also provides bunkering (fueling) services to ships operating in the Caribbean Sea, more specifically in St. Eustatius and vessels calling in the Bahamas. Bunkering activities typically include one tug and one ocean liquid tank barge mooring alongside a docked or anchored vessel and transferring fuel oil. The Company operates four foreign-flag harbor tugs in Freeport, Grand Bahama supporting terminal and bunkering operations and leases out four foreign-flag harbor tugs and five U.S.-flag ocean liquid tank barges to a bunkering operator in St. Eustatius. Offshore towing activities include the long haul towing of ocean barges, dead ships and other large floating equipment requiring auxiliary power.
As of December 31, 2017, Ocean Services had two U.S.-flag harbor tugs under construction scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 2018.

PCTC, Liner and Short-Sea Transportation. In the PCTC, liner and short-sea transportation trade, PCTCs, RORO barges, deck barges, small RORO and container vessels and specialized rail ferries provide unit freight and general cargo transportation services. These services include transporting shipping containers, rail cars, project cargoes, automobiles and U.S. military vehicles. PCTCs generally handle cargo moving to and from the United States and international destinations, including Europe, the Middle East and western Pacific ports (including ports in Guam, Japan and South Korea). Liner and short-sea transportation vessels are engaged in services to and from ports in the Southeastern United States, the Caribbean (including Puerto Rico), the Bahamas and Mexico. Equipment operated in the Puerto Rico liner trade is through Ocean Services’ 55% noncontrolling interest in Trailer Bridge, Inc. (“Trailer Bridge”). The rail ferry equipment operates between Alabama and Mexico through Ocean Services’ 50% noncontrolling interest in Golfo de Mexico Rail-Ferry Holdings LLC (“Golfo de Mexico”).

As of December 31, 2017, Ocean Services had two vessels undergoing dry-dockings and improvements scheduled to be placed in the liner and short-sea transportation service during the first quarter of 2018.
Dry Bulk Transportation. Ocean Services owns and operates two U.S.-flag dry bulk carriers of approximately 37,000 dwt each, pursuant to contracts of affreightment and voyage charters. These vessels service the coal, petroleum coke, finished fertilizer and phosphate rock trades within the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and U.S. East Coast ports.
Customers and Contractual Arrangements
The primary customers for petroleum and chemical transportation services are multinational oil companies, refining companies, major gasoline retailers, oil trading companies and large industrial consumers of crude, petroleum and chemicals. Services are generally contracted on the basis of short-term or long-term time charters, bareboat charters, voyage charters and contracts of affreightment or other transportation agreements tailored to the shipper's requirements.
The primary customers for harbor, ocean towing and bunkering services are vessel owners and charterers, which are typically industrial companies, trading houses and shipping companies and pools. Services are contracted using prevailing port tariff terms on a per-use basis.
The primary customers for PCTC services are automobile shippers and in certain circumstances automobile manufacturers or auto dealerships directly, and the U.S. Government. Services to these customers are generally contracted on the basis of short or long-term time charter or on a liner basis. Services for the U.S. Government are generally contracted on a voyage charter or liner basis in accordance with a master services agreement.
The primary customers for liner and short-sea transportation (unit freight) services are individuals and businesses shipping goods and parcels between ports in the Southeastern United States, the Caribbean (including Puerto Rico), the Bahamas and Mexico. Unit freight services are generally contracted on a per unit basis for the specified cargo and destination, typically in accordance with a publicly available tariff rate or based on a negotiated rate when moving larger volume over an extended period.
5

The primary customers for dry bulk transportation services are regional power utilities requiring waterborne coal and petroleum coke transportation and large fertilizer producers moving Florida sourced products into the lower Mississippi River. Dry bulk services are generally contracted under multi-year contracts of affreightment and voyage charters.
Ocean Services also provides technical ship management services to ship owners.
In 2017, no single customer of Ocean Services accounted for 10% or more of consolidated operating revenues. The ten largest customers of Ocean Services accounted for approximately 63% of its operating revenues in 2017. The loss of one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on Ocean Services’ results of operations.
Under a time charter, Ocean Services provides a vessel to a customer and is responsible for all operating expenses, typically excluding fuel and port charges. Under a bareboat charter, Ocean Services provides a vessel to a customer and the customer assumes responsibility for all operating expenses and risks of operation. Vessel charters may range from several days to several years. Contracts of affreightment are contracts for cargoes that are committed on a multi-voyage basis for various periods of time, with minimum and maximum cargo tonnages specified over the period at a fixed or escalating rate per ton. Voyage charters are contracts to carry cargoes on a single voyage basis regardless of time to complete.
Competitive Conditions
Each of the markets in which Ocean Services operates is highly competitive including the U.S. “Jones Act” coastwise market, even though participation in the trade is not open to foreign-based competition. The most important competitive factors are pricing, vessel age, vessel type and vessel availability to fit customer requirements and delivery schedule.
The primary direct competitors for Jones Act petroleum and chemical transportation services are other operators of Jones Act petroleum and chemical carriers, operators of refined product and crude pipelines, railroads and foreign-flag vessels delivering foreign sourced petroleum and chemicals to U.S. ports.
The primary direct competitors for Jones Act harbor, ocean towing and bunkering are other operators of Jones Act U.S.-flagged harbor tugs and bunkering barges.
The primary direct competitors for PCTC services are other operators of PCTCs, U.S.-flag cargo vessels eligible for the MSP subsidy and other vessels controlled by the U.S. government via the Military Sealift Command including the ready reserve fleet.
The primary direct competitors for liner and short-sea transportation are other operators of cargo vessels trading between ports in the Southeastern United States, the Caribbean (including Puerto Rico), the Bahamas and Mexico.
The rail ferry services primarily competes with railroad operators offering overland connections between Central and Southeastern Mexico and the United States.
The primary direct competitors for Jones Act dry bulk transportation are other operators of Jones Act dry bulk carriers and railroad operators.
Risks of Foreign Operations
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 20%, 21% and 15%, respectively, of Ocean Services’ operating revenues were derived from its foreign operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Ocean Services’ equity in earnings (losses) of 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, derived from its foreign operations were not material. For the year ended December 31, 2015, $22.2 million of Ocean Services’ equity in losses of 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, were derived from its foreign operations.
Foreign operations are subject to inherent risks, which, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on Ocean Services’ financial position and its results of operations. See the risk factor entitled “Risks from Ocean Transportation & Logistics Services’ international operations” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Inland Transportation & Logistics Services 
Business
Inland Transportation & Logistics Services (“Inland Services”) markets and operates domestic river transportation equipment, and owns fleeting and high-speed multi-modal terminal locations adjacent to and along the U.S. Inland waterways, at this time primarily in the St. Louis and Memphis areas. Inland Services operates under the SCF name. SCF’s barges are primarily used for moving agricultural and industrial commodities and containers on the U.S. Inland Waterways, the Mississippi River, Illinois River, Tennessee River, Ohio River and their tributaries and the Gulf Intracoastal Waterways. Internationally, Inland Services also owns inland river liquid tank barges that operate on the Magdalena River in Colombia. These barges primarily transport petroleum products. Inland Services also has a 50% interest in dry-cargo barge operations on the Parana-Paraguay River Waterways in Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay primarily transporting agricultural and industrial commodities. Inland Services contributed 30%, 38% and 44% of consolidated operating revenues during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
For a discussion of risk and economic factors that may impact Inland Services’ financial position and its results of operations, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Inland Transportation & Logistics Services Services” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”

______________________

(1) | Towboats and harbor boats have been upgraded and maintained to meet or exceed current industry standards.

Inland river barges are unmanned and are moved by towboats. The combination of a towboat and barges is commonly referred to as a “tow.”

Inland Services’ dry-cargo barge fleet consists of hopper barges, which are (i) covered for the transport of products such as grain and grain by-products, fertilizer and steel or (ii) “open tops” primarily used for the transport of commodities that are not sensitive to water such as coal, aggregate scrap and containers. Each dry-cargo barge in the Inland Services’ fleet is capable of transporting approximately 1,500 to 2,000 tons (1,350 to 1,800 metric tons) of cargo depending on water depth (draft), river conditions and hull depth of the barge. Adverse river conditions, such as high water resulting from excessive rainfall or low water caused by drought, can impact operations by limiting the speed at which tows travel, the number of barges included in tows, as well as the quantity of cargo that is loaded in the barges.
A typical dry-cargo grain voyage begins by shifting a clean, empty barge from a fleeting location to a loading facility. The barge is then moved from the loading location and assembled into a tow before proceeding to its discharge destination. After unloading, it is shifted to a fleeting area for cleaning, and service if needed, and then placed again in a tow to move to a load facility. In some instances after discharge of grain, barges pick up cargo and move them north to the grain originating areas of the river system instead of moving empty.
Inland Services’ fleet of inland river liquid tank barges transports petroleum products on long-term voyage affreightment contracts on the Magdalena River in Colombia.
As of December 31, 2017, Inland Services had construction in progress for rail improvements at its Mississippi River Terminal and the refurbishment of three harbor boats.
Markets
Inland Services operates equipment in three principal geographic regions. The table below sets forth equipment by geographic market as of December 31 for the indicated years. Inland Services sometimes participates in joint venture arrangements in certain geographic locations in order to enhance marketing capabilities and facilitate operations in foreign markets allowing for the expansion of its operations while diversifying risks and reducing capital outlays associated with such expansion.

U.S. Inland Waterways. Inland Services transports various commodities on the U.S. Inland Waterways in dry-cargo barges, primarily grain and grain by-products, fertilizer, steel products and other dry bulk commodities. Grain cargoes primarily move south and originate in the Midwest, typically St. Louis and north, but can originate as far south as Arkansas and Louisiana. South of Baton Rouge the Mississippi River is deeper and can accommodate ocean going vessels. Industrial cargo such as steel coils and specialty ore typically move north. Generally, Inland Services attempts to coordinate the logistical match-up of northbound and southbound movements of cargo to minimize repositioning costs and optimize loaded time of barges. In addition to its barge and towboat activities, Inland Services owns and operates high-speed multi-modal terminal facilities for both dry and liquid commodities and barge fleeting locations in various areas of the Inland Waterway System.

Magdalena River. Inland Services primarily transports petroleum products outbound from central Colombia to the Caribbean Sea for export or distribution.
Parana-Paraguay Waterway. Inland Services, through its 50% noncontrolling interest in SCFCo Holdings LLC (“SCFCo”), transports various commodities on the Parana-Paraguay Waterway in dry-cargo barges, primarily grains, iron ore, and other dry bulk commodities. In addition to its primary barge and towboat business, SCFCo has an investment in a transshipment terminal at the Port of Ibicuy, Argentina.
Seasonality
The volume of grain transported from the Midwest to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, which is primarily for export, is greatest during the harvest season from mid-August through late November. The harvest season is particularly significant to Inland Services because pricing for hauling freight tends to peak during these months in response to higher demand for equipment. Severity of winter weather can also impact operations and contribute to volatility in revenue and expense. Harsh winters typically force the upper Mississippi River to close and restrict barge traffic from mid-December to mid-March. Ice can also hinder the navigation of barge traffic on the mid-Mississippi River, the Illinois River, and the upper reaches of the Ohio River.
The Magdalena River basin has two rainy and two dry seasons annually. The lowest river levels occur from mid-December to mid-February, which can cause difficult navigational conditions within the mid and upper river regions and thereby lower utilization of Inland Services’ barges in this region during that period.
On the Parana-Paraguay Waterway, water levels are typically lower during December and January, which can make navigation difficult on the northern portion of the river. During this time period, barge traffic is primarily focused on transporting grains from Paraguay to Argentina.
Customers and Contractual Arrangements
The principal customers for Inland Services are major grain exporters and farm cooperatives, importers and distributors of industrial materials, agricultural companies, fertilizer companies, trading companies, oil companies and industrial companies. In 2017, no single customer of Inland Services accounted for 10% or more of consolidated operating revenues. The ten largest customers of Inland Services accounted for approximately 57% of its operating revenues in 2017. The loss of one or more of its customers could have a material adverse effect on Inland Services’ results of operations.
Inland Services’ pooled dry-cargo barges are typically employed on a voyage basis at agreed rates for tons moved and with users having specified days for loading and discharging the cargo. In the trade, this is referred to as a contract of affreightment. If the user exceeds the specified number of days for loading and discharging the barges, it pays demurrage (revenue to compensate for tying up the assets longer than typical for a transit). For longer term contracts of affreightment, base rates may be adjusted in response to changes in fuel prices and operating expenses. Some term contracts provide for the transport of a minimum number of tons of cargo or specific transportation requirements for a particular customer. In the past, Inland Services has leased out some barges (“bareboat chartered”) to competitors or other operators with all expenses for the lessee’s account. Such leases would be at a fixed rate per day and the duration has varied from short periods necessary for the lessee to perform a voyage to extended periods. Inland Services’ inland river liquid tank barges and specialty barges are operated under term contracts ranging from one to five years.
Inland Services’ tank farm, dry bulk and container handling facilities are marketed under contractual rates and terms driven by throughput volume.
Inland Services' fleeting operations charge a day rate for holding barges in fleeting areas. Harbor boats (usually 800-1,200 HP) pick up and drop off barges and assist in assembling tows that are moving up and down river on line haul towboats, typically 6,000-10,000 HP. The service is for an agreed upon hourly charge. The harbor boats also perform shifting services, which include moving barges to and from the dock for loading and unloading. Typically these service are priced based on a fee per shift. Inland fleeting operations also include cleaning and minor repairs on barges.
 Inland Services’ machine shop and repairs of towboats and barges are charged either on an hourly basis or a fixed fee basis depending on the scope and nature of work.
Competitive Conditions
Inland Services’ main direct competitors are other barge lines. Inland Services believes that 68% of the domestic dry-cargo hopper barge fleet is controlled by five companies. Railroads also compete for traffic that might otherwise move on the U.S. Inland Waterways.
10

Although there is a pool of “investor owned” barges which add capacity to the inland fleet, in the view of Inland Services they cannot compete as a full logistics service provider of barge transport. Barriers to entry include complexity of operations, the difficulty of accumulating a sufficiently large asset base to cycle assets efficiently, the start-up challenge of hiring required expertise given the general lack of qualified personnel to oversee the complex logistics of exchanging assets between fleets and long haul tows and executing timely placement for loading and discharging. Inland Services benefits from not only these factors, but also from long-term arrangements with key customers and SCF’s reputation for service.
Inland Services believes the primary barriers to effective competitive entry into the Magdalena River and Parana-Paraguay Waterways markets are similar to those that make it difficult to start new operations in the U.S. In addition, there are local flag requirements for equipment and local content requirements for operation. The primary competitive factors among established operators are price, availability, reliability and suitability of equipment for the various cargoes moved.
Risks of Foreign Operations
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 6%, 3% and 1%, respectively, of Inland Services’ operating revenues were derived from its foreign operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, $8.4 million, $17.1 million and $32.5 million, respectively, of Inland Services’ equity in losses from 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, were derived from its foreign operations.
Foreign operations are subject to inherent risks, which, if they were to occur, could have a material adverse effect on Inland Services’ financial position and its results of operations. See the risk factor entitled “Risks from the Company’s international operations” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

Risks of Foreign Operations
For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 13%, 11% and 12%, respectively, of Witt O’Brien’s operating revenues were derived from its foreign operations. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, $0.2 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of Witt O’Brien’s equity in earnings from 50% or less owned companies, net of tax, were derived from its foreign operations.
Foreign operations are subject to inherent risks, which, if they materialize, could have a material adverse effect on Witt O’Brien’s financial position and its results of operations. See the risk factor entitled “Risks from the Company’s international operations” in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Other
The Company has other activities that primarily include:
Lending and leasing activities. Lending and leasing activities primarily involve the secured financing of various types of equipment that require scheduled lease payments or periodic principal and interest payments.
Noncontrolling investments in various other businesses. These investments primarily include sales, storage, and maintenance support for general aviation in Asia and an agricultural commodity trading and logistics business that is primarily focused on the global origination, and trading and merchandising of sugar, pairing producers and buyers and arranging for the transportation and logistics of the product.
Government Regulation
The Company’s ownership, operation, construction and staffing of vessels is subject to significant regulation under various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations, including international conventions and ship registry laws of the nations under which the Company’s vessels are flagged.
Regulatory Matters
Domestically registered vessels are subject to the jurisdiction of the United States Coast Guard (“USCG”), the National Transportation Safety Board (“NTSB”), the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the U.S. Maritime Administration, as well as in certain instances, applicable state and local laws.
Ocean Services and Inland Services are subject to regulation under the Jones Act and related U.S. cabotage laws, which restrict ownership and operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade (i.e., trade between points in the United States), including the transportation of cargo. Subject to limited exceptions, the Jones Act requires that vessels engaged in U.S. coastwise trade be built in the United States, registered under the U.S.-flag, manned by predominantly U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S. citizens within the meaning of the Jones Act. Violation of the Jones Act could prohibit operation of vessels in the U.S. coastwise trade during the period of such non-compliance, result in material fines and subject the Company’s vessels to seizure and forfeiture.
Ocean Services and Inland Services operate vessels that are registered in the United States and others registered in a number of foreign jurisdictions. Vessels are subject to the laws of the applicable jurisdiction as to ownership, registration, manning, environmental protection and safety. In addition, the Company’s vessels are subject to the requirements of a number of international conventions that are applicable to vessels depending on their jurisdiction of registration. Among the more significant of these conventions are: (i) the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (“MARPOL”); (ii) the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974 and 1978 Protocols (“SOLAS”); and (iii) the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers (“STCW”).
The Maritime Labour Convention, 2006 (the “MLC”) establishes comprehensive minimum requirements for working conditions of seafarers including, among other things, conditions of employment, hours of work and rest, grievance and complaints procedures, accommodations, recreational facilities, food and catering, health protection, medical care, welfare, and social security protection. The MLC also provides a definition of seafarer that includes all persons engaged in work on a vessel in addition to the vessel’s crew. Under this MLC definition, the Company may be responsible for proving that customer and contractor personnel aboard its vessels have contracts of employment that comply with the MLC requirements. The Company could also be responsible for salaries and/or benefits of third parties that may board one of the Company’s vessels. The MLC requires certain vessels that engage in international trade to maintain a valid Maritime Labour Certificate issued by their flag administration. Although the United States is not a party to the MLC, U.S.-flag vessels operating internationally must comply with the MLC when visiting a port in a country that is a party to the MLC. The Company has developed and implemented a fleetwide action plan to comply with the MLC to the extent applicable to its vessels.
The hull and machinery of every commercial vessel must be classed by an international classification society authorized by its country of registry, as well as being subject to survey and inspection by shipping regulatory bodies. The international 
12

classification society certifies that a vessel is safe and seaworthy in accordance with the applicable rules and regulations of the country of registry of the vessel and the United Nations Safety of Life at Sea Convention. All of Ocean Services’ vessels are subject to the periodic inspection, survey, dry-docking and maintenance requirements of the USCG and/or the American Bureau of Shipping (“ABS”) and other marine classification societies.
Under the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, the Company’s U.S.-flagged vessels will be subject to requisitioning by the U.S. Government under certain terms and conditions during a national emergency, as described further under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The Company is required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to its vessels. The Company’s failure to maintain these authorizations could adversely impact its operations.
In addition to the USCG, the EPA, the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Office of Pipeline Safety and certain individual states regulate vessels, facilities and pipelines in accordance with the requirements of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA 90”) or under analogous state law. There is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies, which increases the Company’s compliance costs and risk of non-compliance.
Although the Company faces some risk when responding to third-party oil spills, a responder engaged in emergency and crisis activities has immunity from liability under federal law and all U.S. coastal state laws for any spills arising from its response efforts, except in the event of death or personal injury or as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. As a result of the Deepwater Horizon incident in 2010, the responder industry has sought to expand the responder immunity provisions enacted in OPA 90.
Environmental Compliance
The Company is subject to federal, state, local and international environmental and safety law, regulations and conventions, including those related to the discharge of oil and pollutants into waters regulated thereunder. Violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties, fines, injunctions or other sanctions.
The Company does not expect that it will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future that would be material to its financial position or operations to comply with environmental laws and regulations; however, because such laws and regulations frequently change and may impose increasingly strict requirements, the Company cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations.
OPA 90 establishes a regulatory and liability regime for the protection of the environment from oil spills. OPA 90 applies to owners and operators of facilities operating near navigable waters of the United States and owners, operators and bareboat charterers of vessels operating in U.S. waters, which include the navigable waters of the United States and the 200-mile Exclusive Economic Zone around the United States (“EEZ”). For purposes of its liability limits and financial responsibility and response planning requirements, OPA 90 differentiates between tank vessels (such as the Company’s petroleum and chemical carriers and liquid tank barges) and “other vessels” (such as the Company’s tugs and dry-cargo barges).
Under OPA 90, owners and operators of regulated facilities and owners and operators or bareboat charterers of vessels are “responsible parties” and may be jointly, severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills or threatened spills up to certain limits of liability (except if the limits are exceeded as discussed below). Damages are defined broadly to include: (i) injury to natural resources and the costs of remediation thereof; (ii) injury to, or economic losses resulting from the destruction of, real and personal property; (iii) net loss by the United States government, a state or political subdivision thereof, of taxes, royalties, rents, fees and profits; (iv) lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage; (v) net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response, such as protection from fire or other hazards or taking additional safety precautions; and (vi) loss of subsistence use of available natural resources.
OPA 90 limits liability for responsible parties for nontank vessels to the greater of $1,100 per gross ton or $939,800 and for tank vessels to the greater of $3,500 per gross ton or $25,845,600. These liability limits do not apply (a) if an incident is caused by the responsible party’s violation of federal safety, construction or operating regulations or by the responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct, (b) if the responsible party fails to report the incident or to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with oil removal activities as required by a responsible official or (c) if the responsible party fails to comply with an order issued under OPA 90.
The OPA 90 regulations also implement the financial responsibility requirements of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability for discharges of hazardous substances, similar to OPA 90, and provides compensation for cleanup, removal and natural resource damages. Liability per vessel under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million, unless the incident is caused by gross negligence, willful misconduct, or a violation of certain regulations, in which case liability is unlimited.
13

Under the Nontank Vessel Response Plan Final Rule, owners and operators of nontank vessels are required to prepare Nontank Vessel Response Plans (“NTVRPs”). The Company expects its pollution liability insurance to cover any cost of spill removal subject to coverage deductibles and limitations, including a cap of $1.0 billion. The Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected if it incurs spill liability under circumstances in which the insurance carrier fails or refuses to provide coverage or the loss exceeds the Company’s coverage limitations.
MARPOL is the main international convention covering prevention of pollution of the marine environment by vessels from operational or accidental discharges. It is implemented in the United States pursuant to the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships.
Since the 1990s, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”) has been aggressively enforcing U.S. criminal laws against vessel owners, operators, managers, crewmembers, shoreside personnel, and corporate officers related to violations of MARPOL. Violations have frequently related to pollution prevention devices, such as the oily-water separator, and include falsifying records, obstructing justice, and making false statements. In certain cases, responsible shipboard officers and shoreside officials have been sentenced to prison. In addition, the DOJ has required most defendants to implement a comprehensive environmental compliance plan (“ECP”) or risk losing the ability to trade in U.S. waters. If the Company is subjected to a DOJ prosecution, it could face significant criminal penalties as well as costs associated with the implementation of an ECP.
The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) prohibits the discharge of “pollutants” into the navigable waters of the United States. The CWA also prohibits the discharge of oil or hazardous substances, into navigable waters of the United States and the EEZ around the United States and imposes civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges, thereby creating exposures in addition to those arising under OPA 90 and CERCLA.
The CWA also established the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”) permitting program, which governs discharges of pollutants into navigable waters of the United States. Pursuant to the NPDES program, the EPA has issued Vessel General Permits covering discharges incidental to normal vessel operations. The current Vessel General Permit (the “2013 VGP”), which became effective in December 2013, applies to U.S.-flag and foreign-flag commercial vessels that are at least 79 feet in length and operate within the three-mile territorial sea of the United States. The 2013 VGP requires vessel owners and operators to adhere to “best management practices” to manage the covered discharges that occur normally in the operation of a vessel, including ballast water, and implements various training, inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements, as well as corrective actions upon identification of deficiencies. The Company has filed a Notice of Intent to be covered by the 2013 VGP for each of the Company's ships that operate in U.S. waters. The EPA has indicated that a new Vessel General Permit will be issued by the end of 2018. The Company can neither provide assurance that the permit will be issued timely or at all, nor can it predict what additional costs it may incur to comply with any Vessel General Permit.
Many countries have ratified and are thus subject to the liability scheme adopted by the International Maritime Organization (“IMO”) and set out in the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969 (the “1969 Convention”). Some of these countries have also adopted the 1992 Protocol to the 1969 Convention (the “1992 Protocol”). Under both the 1969 Convention and the 1992 Protocol, a vessel’s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil from ships carrying oil in bulk as cargo, subject to certain complete defenses. These conventions also limit the liability of the shipowner under certain circumstances, provided the discharge was not caused by the shipowner’s actual fault or intentional or reckless misconduct.
Vessels trading to countries that are parties to these conventions must provide evidence of insurance covering the liability of the owner. The Company believes that its Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) insurance will cover any liability under these conventions, subject to applicable policy deductibles, exclusions and limitations.
The United States is not a party to the 1969 Convention or the 1992 Protocol, and thus OPA 90, CERCLA, CWA and other federal and state laws apply in the United States as discussed above. In other jurisdictions where the 1969 Convention has not been adopted, various legislative and regulatory schemes or common law govern, and liability is imposed either on the basis of fault or in a manner similar to that convention.
The International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, 2001 was adopted to ensure that adequate, prompt and effective compensation is available to persons who suffer damage caused by spills of oil when used as fuel by vessels. The convention applies to damage caused to the territory, including the territorial sea, and in the EEZs, of the countries that are party to it. Although the United States has not ratified this convention, U.S.-flag vessels operating internationally would be subject to it if they sail within the territories of those countries that have implemented its provisions. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
The National Invasive Species Act (“NISA”) was enacted in the United States in 1996 in response to growing reports of harmful organisms being released into United States waters through ballast water taken on by vessels in foreign ports. The USCG adopted regulations under NISA that impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering U.S. waters. All new vessels constructed on or after December 1, 2013, regardless of ballast water capacity, 
14

must comply with these requirements on delivery from the shipyard absent an extension from the USCG. Existing vessels with a ballast water capacity between 1,500 and 5,000 cubic meters must comply by their first scheduled dry-docking after January 1, 2014 or obtain a USCG extension. For non-exempt vessels, ballast water treatment equipment may be required to be utilized on the vessel. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
Some U.S. states have enacted legislation or regulations to address invasive species through ballast water and hull cleaning management and permitting requirements, which in many cases have also become part of the state’s 2013 VGP certification. Other states may proceed with the enactment of similar requirements that could increase the Company’s costs of operating in state waters.
In addition, the IMO ratified the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water Sediments on September 8, 2016, otherwise known as the Ballast Water Management Convention (the “BWM Convention”). The Company’s vessels that operate internationally will have to become compliant with international ballast water management regulations by their first renewal survey of the International Oil Pollution Prevention (“IOPP”) Certificate issued under MARPOL after September 8, 2017. Because the United States is not a party to the BWM Convention, those vessels may have to install an IMO approved ballast water management system (“BWMS”) or use one of the other management options under the BWM Convention. The Company believes that its vessels comply with these requirements.
The U.S. Endangered Species Act, related regulations and comparable state laws protect species threatened with possible extinction. Protection may include restrictions on the speed of vessels in certain ocean waters and may require the Company to change the routes of the Company’s vessels during particular periods. For example, in an effort to prevent the collision of vessels with the North Atlantic right whale, federal regulations restrict the speed of vessels to ten knots or less in certain areas along the Atlantic Coast of the United States during certain times of the year. The reduced speed and special routing along the Atlantic Coast may result in the use of additional fuel, which could affect the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
The Clean Air Act (as amended, the “CAA”) requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. The CAA also requires states to submit State Implementation Plans (“SIPs”), which are designed to attain national health-based air quality standards throughout the United States, including major metropolitan and/or industrial areas. Several SIPs regulate emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment. The EPA and some states have each proposed more stringent regulations of air emissions from propulsion and auxiliary engines on oceangoing vessels.
MARPOL also addresses air emissions, including emissions of sulfur and nitrous oxide (“NOx”), from vessels, including a requirement to use low sulfur fuels worldwide in both auxiliary and main propulsion diesel engines on vessels. Vessels worldwide are currently required to use fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 3.5%, which the IMO decided in October 2016 to reduce to 0.5% beginning in January 2020. As a result of this reduction, fuel costs for vessel operators could rise dramatically beginning in 2020, which could adversely affect the Company’s profitability or its results of operations. MARPOL also imposes NOx emissions standards on installed marine diesel engines of over 130 kW output power other than those used solely for emergency purposes irrespective of the tonnage of the vessel into which such an engine is installed. Different levels, or Tiers, of control apply based on the vessel’s construction date. Within any particular Tier, the actual NOx limit is determined from the engine’s rated speed on a sliding scale based on engine revolutions per minute. The Tier III controls apply only to the specified vessels while operating in an Emission Control Area (“ECA”), as discussed below, established to further limit NOx emissions. The Tier II controls apply to vessels operating in areas outside of ECAs.
More stringent sulfur and NOx requirements apply in certain designated ECAs. There are currently four ECAs worldwide: the Baltic Sea ECA, North Sea ECA, North American ECA, and U.S. Caribbean ECA. As of January 1, 2015, vessels operating in an ECA must burn fuel with a sulfur content no greater than 0.1%. Further, marine diesel engines on vessels constructed on or after January 1, 2016 that are operated in an ECA must meet the stringent NOx standards described above.
The Company’s operations occasionally generate and require the transportation, treatment and disposal of both hazardous and non-hazardous solid wastes that are subject in the United States to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) or comparable state, local or foreign requirements. From time to time, the Company arranges for the disposal of hazardous waste or hazardous substances at offsite disposal facilities. The EPA has a longstanding policy that RCRA only applies after wastes are “purposely removed” from a vessel. As a general matter, with certain exceptions, vessel owners and operators are required to determine if their wastes are hazardous, obtain a generator identification number, comply with certain standards for the proper management of hazardous wastes, and use hazardous waste manifests for shipments to disposal facilities. Moreover, vessel owners and operators may be subject to more stringent state hazardous waste requirements. If such materials are improperly disposed of by third parties with which the Company contracts, the Company may still be held liable for cleanup costs under applicable laws.
MARPOL also governs the discharge of garbage from ships, the special area for the Wider Caribbean region including the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea went into effect on May 1, 2011. MARPOL defines certain sea areas as “special areas,” requiring a higher level of protection than other areas of the sea.
15

Applicable MARPOL regulations provide for strict garbage management procedures and documentation requirements for all vessels and fixed and floating platforms. These regulations impose a general prohibition on the discharge of all garbage unless the discharge is expressly provided for under the regulations. The regulations have greatly reduced the amount of garbage that vessels are allowed to dispose of at sea and have increased the Company’s costs of disposing garbage remaining on board vessels at their port calls.
Various international conventions and federal, state and local laws and regulations have been considered or implemented to address the environmental effects of emissions of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The U.S. Congress has considered, but not adopted, legislation designed to reduce emission of greenhouse gases. At various United Nations climate change conferences, specific international accords or protocols to establish binding limitations on greenhouse gas emissions have been proposed. In December 1997, the Kyoto Protocol was adopted pursuant to which member parties agreed to implement national programs to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
At the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Paris, the Paris Agreement, which seeks to reduce emissions in an effort to slow global warming was adopted. The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in 2016 but, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department officially informed the United Nations of the United States’ intent to withdraw. The Paris Agreement does not specifically mention shipping.
The IMO’s third study of greenhouse gas emissions from the global shipping fleet, which was concluded in 2014, predicted that, in the absence of appropriate policies, greenhouse gas emissions from ships could increase by 50% to 250% by 2050 depending on economic growth and energy developments in the future. The IMO has announced its intention to develop limits on greenhouse gases from international shipping and is working on proposed mandatory technical and operational measures to achieve these limits. The first step toward this goal occurred in October 2016, when the IMO adopted a system for collecting data on ships’ fuel-oil consumption, which will be mandatory and apply globally.
In the United States, pursuant to an April 2007 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, the EPA was required to consider whether carbon dioxide should be considered a pollutant that endangers public health and welfare, and thus subject to regulation under the CAA. In October 2007, the California Attorney General and a coalition of environmental groups petitioned the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from oceangoing vessels under the CAA. On December 1, 2009, the EPA issued an “endangerment finding” regarding greenhouse gases under the CAA. To date, the regulations proposed and enacted by the EPA regarding carbon dioxide have not involved oceangoing vessels. Under MARPOL, vessels operating in designated ECAs are required to meet fuel sulfur limits and NOx emission limits, including the use of engines that meet the EPA standards for NOx emissions as discussed above.
Any future adoption of climate control treaties, legislation or other regulatory measures by the United Nations, IMO, United States or other countries where the Company operates that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could result in financial and operational impacts on the Company’s business (including potential capital expenditures to reduce such emissions) that the Company cannot predict with certainty at this time. In addition, there may be significant physical effects of climate change from such emissions that have the potential to negatively impact the Company’s customers, personnel, and physical assets any of which could adversely impact cargo levels, the demand for Company’s services, or the Company’s ability to recruit personnel.
The Company seeks to manage exposure to losses from the above-described laws through its development of appropriate risk management programs, including compliance programs, safety management systems and insurance program. Although the Company believes these programs mitigate its legal risk, there can be no assurance that any future regulations or requirements or any discharge or emission of pollutants by the Company will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

Heightened awareness of security needs brought about by the events of September 11, 2001 has caused the USCG, the IMO, states and local ports to adopt heightened security procedures relating to ports and vessels.
Specifically, on November 25, 2002, the U.S. Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (“MTSA”) was signed into law. To implement certain portions of MTSA, in July 2003, the USCG issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Similarly, in December 2002, the IMO adopted amendments to SOLAS, known as the International Ship and Port Facility Security Code (the “ISPS Code”), creating a new chapter dealing specifically with maritime security. The chapter came into effect in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities. Among the various requirements under MTSA and/or the ISPS Code are:

• | onboard installation of automatic information systems to enhance vessel-to-vessel and vessel-to-shore communications;


• | onboard installation of ship security alert systems;

16


• | the development of vessel and facility security plans;


• | the implementation of a Transportation Worker Identification Credential program; and


• | compliance with flag state security certification requirements.

The USCG regulations, which are intended to align with international maritime security standards, generally deem foreign-flag vessels to be in compliance with MTSA vessel security measures provided such vessels have onboard a valid International Ship Security Certificate that attests to the vessel’s compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. However, U.S.-flag vessels that are engaged in international trade must comply with all of the security measures required by MTSA, as well as SOLAS and the ISPS Code.
In response to these new security programs, the Company has implemented security plans and procedures for each of its U.S.-flag vessels, its terminal operation in Sauget, Illinois and its Port Dania facility in Dania Beach, Florida, pursuant to rules implementing MTSA that have been issued by the USCG.
The International Safety Management Code (“ISM Code”), adopted by the IMO as an amendment to SOLAS, provides international standards for the safe management and operation of ships and for the prevention of marine pollution from ships. The United States enforces the ISM Code for all U.S.-flag vessels and those foreign-flag vessels that call at U.S. ports. All of the Company’s vessels that are 500 or more gross tons are required to be certified under the standards set forth in the ISM Code’s safety and pollution protocols. The Company also voluntarily complies with these protocols for some vessels that are under the mandatory 500 gross ton threshold. Under the ISM Code, vessel operators are required to develop an extensive safety management system (“SMS”) that includes, among other things, the adoption of a written system of safety and environmental protection policies setting forth instructions and procedures for operating their vessels subject to the ISM Code, and describing procedures for responding to emergencies. The Company has developed such a safety management system. These SMS policies apply to both the vessel and shore-side personnel and are vessel specific. The ISM Code also requires a Document of Compliance (“DOC”) to be obtained for the vessel manager and a Safety Management Certificate (“SMC”) to be obtained for each vessel subject to the ISM Code that it operates or manages. The Company has obtained DOCs for its shore-side offices that have responsibility for vessel management and SMCs for each of the vessels that such offices operate or manage.
Noncompliance with the ISM Code and other IMO regulations may subject the shipowner or charterer to increased liability, may lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels and may result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. For example, the USCG authorities have indicated that vessels not in compliance with the ISM Code will be prohibited from trading to United States ports.
Industry Hazards and Insurance
Vessel operations involve inherent risks associated with carrying large volumes of cargo and rendering services in a marine environment. Hazards include adverse weather conditions, collisions, fire and mechanical failures, which may result in death or injury to personnel, damage to equipment, loss of operating revenues, contamination of cargo, pollution and other environmental damages and increased costs. The Company maintains hull, liability and war risk, general liability, workers compensation and other insurance customary in the industries in which the Company operates. The Company believes it will be able to renew any expiring policy without causing a material adverse effect on the Company. The Company also conducts training and safety programs to promote a safe working environment and minimize hazards.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, the Company employed 2,264 individuals. In the United States, a total of 925 employees in Ocean Services and Inland Services are unionized under collective bargaining agreements that expire at varying times through July 2, 2022.
Management considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory.
