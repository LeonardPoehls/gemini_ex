Our business development plan includes, among other things, the following strategic initiatives:

· | Expand organically within existing markets and into new markets. Specifically intended to carry out our vision of strengthening our market position in the U.S., we are implementing a combination of on- and off-line marketing approaches to expand our student-customer base in markets we currently serve. Such approaches include the recently launched Membership Program that is designed to maximize the power of personal and commission-based referral of our services to other potential customers; and the AEC Help mobile application, a social network platform that is intended to bring students together under one roof, offering them alternative solutions to issues frequently encountered by foreign students in the United States.

We believe this social media network, AEC Help, will allow us to broaden our reach to potential student customers.

Educational, Non-Corporate Compliance Service Industry
 
The demand for global education is growing rapidly in China, and the United States remains the top choice for Chinese students wishing to study abroad.

The number of Chinese students entering the U.S. for study grew sharply in 2006, when Congress loosened restrictions on student visas from China for the first time since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, and this trend has continued strongly since then. Accordingly, there is a large and growing number of Chinese students in the U.S. seeking a broad range of acclimation support and services, including education consulting services. We strive to become a bridge for these students with our service offerings.
 
According to Project Atlas, a collaborative global research initiative led by the Institute of International Education, in the academic year 2016/2017, the total number international students studying in the U.S. (in both public and private institutions) was 1,078,822, of which 350,755, or 32.5%, were Chinese nationals. For the academic year 2015/2016, the comparable figures were 1,043,839 international students in the U.S., of whom 31.5% or 328,547 were Chinese.  This growth trend has been in place for several years. However, with the current political environment in Washington, DC regarding visas, it is not known whether it will continue in the future.

Corporate Training and Advisory Service Industry
 
Market size of China's education industry
 

Source: Golden Age of China’s Education Industry: Seize the Moment. Technology, Media & Telecommunications Industry, Deloitte China. 2016 
 
The PRC market demand for corporate and executive training is expected to continue to grow and take a bigger market share in the entire general education industry. According to a report published by Deloitte in 2016, Golden Age of China’s Education Industry, the education industry in China is expected to grow from RMB 1,643.2 billion in 2015 to RMB 2,923.5 billion in 2020. Corporate training that accounted for approximately 7.6% of the education industry in 2015 is expected to grow to approximately 9.0% in 2020. Individual career training in 2015 made up 20.2% of the education industry and it is projected to increase to 22.4% of the education industry in 2020, according to the Deloitte report. We believe the growth in the corporate training market is intricately linked to China’s growing economy and desire to improve its competitiveness by meeting or setting international standards.
 
AEC Southern UK is currently focused on delivering customized corporate training and advisory services, with an eye towards general career-related individual training, to be delivered both in person and online. As such, we believe that we are well positioned to address such training needs and plan to deliver customized corporate training for companies in China covering various industries. We are in the process of finalizing our in-house developed online training platform that will be utilized to delivery our corporate training services starting in the first quarter of 2018.
 
Our Competition
 
The education consulting business targeting both PRC citizens aboard and PRC residents is rapidly evolving, highly fragmented and competitive, and we expect competition in this sector to persist and intensify. For services provided by our AEC New York subsidiary, we primarily serve Chinese student customers and their families in the U.S. For services provided by our AEC Southern UK subsidiary, our corporate clients are primarily located in China.
 
Our advisory services for student customers face competition from New Oriental Education & Technology Group Inc., a market leader in the market of advisory services for student customers that we operate in.
 
The market for continuing professional education, corporate learning solutions, and corporate executive training is large, fragmented and highly competitive.

Our Marketing Strategies
 
We believe prospective student customers are attracted to our advisory services due to our excellent brand name, personalized service model and the quality of our services. Historically, as a small business, we rely extensively on our strategic partners and word-of-mouth referrals in growing our student customers; and employ the following marketing and recruiting methods to attract new student customers.
 
Commission-based referrals. To enhance the effectiveness of the referral process, we pay a commission that ranges from 10% to 20% on a success basis. Our placement advisory and career advisory services have benefited from, and are expected to continue to benefit from, commission-based referrals by our current and former student customers.
 
Sponsorships. We are proud sponsors of Chinese Student Associations in various higher education institutions in the Greater New York Area. We regularly promote our services to members and students of the various Chinese Student Associations and are regularly present at events held by such Associations.
 
Marketing materials. We plan to publish a “Chinese Visitors Guide Book”. It is planned to be a travel book with plug-in advertisements for the Company, which will assist Chinese visitors to the U.S. and simultaneously promote our services. We will also advertise in e-magazines, prepare and distribute brochures and present at exhibitions as part of our marketing strategy.
 
Social media marketing. We maintain our own Wechat official accounts that offer information on education and life abroad. In addition, we work with other Wechat official accounts with significant followings to publish information on AEC services. After every offline event, our employees will create chat groups with all event attendants to facilitate direct communication and follow up.
 
Most recently, we launched our in-house developed mobile application—AEC Help. It is an iOS app that users can download for free from the Apple AppStore. Users are international students who are in the U.S. or seek to study in the U.S. The app provides various academic and non-academic resources compiled by us to assist users for studying and living in the U.S. Resources available through AEC Help Application include academic resources where users can filter and search for universities based on the user’s own test scores and preferences, and non-academic resources such as unit conversions, maps, real-time exchange rates, student events, etc. Where the online resources cannot provide sufficient assistance to our users, they are able to reach a member of our staff who will connect the user with a third-party service provide directly. We believe this social media network, AEC Help, will allow us to broaden our reach to potential student customers.

Our target also includes students’ families. The cost of studying abroad is high, therefore international students usually come from middle class or high-net-worth families. We have found that those families tend to invest overseas for wealth preservation and inheritance purposes.
 
The market for our AEC Southern UK’s services is driven by businesses that seek to close the execution gap that may exist between their business objectives and their existing business processes. We have two customers and they both have corporate clients in the food industry that need corporate training. With our custom-designed training programs in business/operation processes and executive training, we are also able to offer solutions to a broader range of companies.

For our AEC Southern UK segment, our 2 clients are Damapai International Trading (Hong Kong) Limited (“Damapai”) and W.W. Industrial China Ltd. (“WW”), representing 19.8% and 80.2 %, 17.9% and 82.1% of revenue of AEC Southern UK for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, respectively. We have entered into long-term agreements with these two customers; and we intend to renew the agreements upon their expiration in January 2018 for Damapai, and in November 2018 for WW. While our commercial relationship is non-exclusive in nature, we have maintained positive working relationships them and we believe they will continue to utilize our services in meeting the corporate training needs of their corporate clients in the PRC. We believe we are not dependent upon these two customers and will be able to find new customers swiftly on commercially reasonable terms, due to our expertise and experience in this field, and the general upswing and expansion of the PRC market demand for corporate and executive training.
 
The PRC market demand for corporate and executive training is expected to continue to grow and take a bigger market share in the entire general education industry. According to a report published by Deloitte in 2016, Golden Age of China’s Education Industry, the education industry in China is expected to grow from RMB 1,643.2 billion in 2015 to RMB 2,923.5 billion in 2020. Corporate training that accounted for approximately 7.6% of the education industry in 2015 is expected to grow to approximately 9.0% in 2020.
 
Our Regulatory Environment
 
Regulation of the Education Industry in the United States
 
Government authorities in the United States, at the Federal, state and local level, extensively regulate education and exchange student programs. Such regulations include, among other things, the regulations and policies of the United States Department of Education. However, unlike the systems of most other countries, education in the United States is highly decentralized, and the Federal government and Department of Education are not heavily involved in determining curricula or educational standards. The establishment and grading of such standards has been left to state and local school districts.
 
The Education Department of the State of New York in 1999 consented for AEC New York to incorporate pursuant to §216 of New York Education Law Relating to Education Corporations, and Section 104 of the New York Business Corporation Law, and consented in 2003 for AEC New York to amend its certificate of incorporate to include education consulting service as its business purpose, pursuant to §216 of New York Education Law Relating to Education Corporations, and Section 104(e) of the New York Business Corporation Law.
 
A more formalized regulation is the requirement that a citizen of a foreign country who wishes to enter the United States must first obtain a visa, either a nonimmigrant visa for temporary stay, or an immigrant visa for permanent residence. Foreign students must have a student visa to study in the United States. Visas generally require an application and an interview.
 
In addition to the regulatory approval requirements described above, we are or will be, directly, or indirectly, subject to extensive regulation of the educational industry by the Federal and state governments and the governments’ of foreign countries in which our services are provided.
 
Regulation of the Education Industry in China
 
The principal laws and regulations governing private education in China consist of the Education Law of the PRC, the Law for Promoting Private Education (2003), the Implementation Rules for the Law for Promoting Private Education (2004), and Law for Promoting Private Education (2016).
 
Under these regulations, “private schools” are defined as schools established by non-governmental organizations or individuals using non-government funds. Private schools providing academic qualifications education, kindergarten education, education for self-study examination and other education shall be subject to approval by the education authorities at or above the county level, while private schools engaging in occupational qualification training and occupational skill training shall be subject to approvals from the authorities in charge of labor and social welfare at or above the county level.

Since our operations in the PRC either delivered through our AEC New York office for education consulting services, placement services and family support services, or through our AEC Southern UK operation for corporate training, we believe we are not involved in providing services relating to the fundamental education systems of the PRC, including a school system of pre-school education, primary education, secondary education and higher education, a system of nine-year compulsory education and a system of education certificates, we believe our operations in the PRC are not subject to the PRC Private Education Laws. If our operations are found to be subject to, and/or in violation of any of these laws, regulations, rules or policies or any other law or governmental regulation to which we or our customers are or will be subject, or if interpretations of the foregoing changes, we and our PRC subsidiaries may be subject to civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Similarly, if our customers are found non-compliant with applicable laws, they may be subject to sanctions.
 
Foreign Investment in Educational Service Industry
 
Under the Foreign Investment Industries Guidance Catalog (2015), or Foreign Investment Catalog, which was amended and promulgated by the National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, and the MOFCOM in March 2015 and became effective on April 10, 2015, foreign investment is encouraged in non-academic vocational training institutions. Preschool education, senior high school education and higher education in grades 10 to 12 are in a restricted industry, meaning foreign educational organizations with relevant qualifications and experience and Chinese educational organizations are only allowed to operate senior high schools in cooperative ways in the PRC. Any foreign investment in higher education and senior high school education has to take the form of a cooperative joint venture. Foreign investment is banned from compulsory education, which means grades 1 to 9. Foreign investment is allowed in after-school tutoring services and training services which do not grant certificates or diplomas. We do not believe we are subject to the aforementioned ban on foreign investment in educational service industries.
Employment Laws
 
We are subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including: wage and hour requirements, working and safety conditions, and social insurance, housing funds and other welfare. These include local labor laws and regulations, which may require substantial resources for compliance.
 
China’s National Labor Law, which became effective on January 1, 1995, and China’s National Labor Contract Law, which became effective on January 1, 2008, permit workers in both state and private enterprises in China to bargain collectively. The National Labor Law and the National Labor Contract Law provide for collective contracts to be developed through collaboration between the labor union (or worker representatives in the absence of a union) and management that specify such matters as working conditions, wage scales, and hours of work. The laws also permit workers and employers in all types of enterprises to sign individual contracts, which are to be drawn up in accordance with the collective contract. The National Labor Contract Law has enhanced rights for the nation’s workers, including permitting open-ended labor contracts and severance payments. The legislation requires employers to provide written contracts to their workers, restricts the use of temporary labor and makes it harder for employers to lay off employees. It also requires that employees with fixed-term contracts be entitled to an indefinite-term contract after a fixed-term contract is renewed once or the employee has worked for the employer for a consecutive ten-year period.
 
We are required by PRC laws and regulations to pay various statutory employee benefits, including pensions, housing funds, medical insurance, work-related injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance to designated governmental agencies for the benefit of our employees. Except for housing funds, we are in compliance with payment of all other employment related insurance on behalf of our employees.

Taxation in the U.S.
 
We are subject to income taxes in the United States, and our domestic tax liabilities will be subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by a number of factors, including:
 

· | changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


· | expected timing and amount of the release of any tax valuation allowances;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | tax effects of stock-based compensation;
--+-----------------------------------------


· | costs related to intercompany restructurings;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | lower than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated future earnings in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory tax rates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, we may be subject to audits of our income, sales and other transaction taxes by U.S. federal and state authorities.
 
Taxation in the PRC
 
Pursuant to the Provisional Regulation of China on Value Added Tax and their implementing rules, all entities and individuals that are engaged in the sale of goods, the provision of repairs and replacement services and the importation of goods in China are generally required to pay VAT at a rate of 17.0% of the gross sales proceeds received, less any deductible VAT already paid or borne by the taxpayer. Further, when exporting goods, the exporter is entitled to a portion of or all the refund of VAT that it has already paid or borne.
 
To ensure compliance with rules and regulations, we have engaged Mazars, an international audit, tax and advisory services firm to help evaluate the tax obligations of our wholly owned subsidiary, AEC Southern UK and its subsidiaries in light of the manner in which they are legally structured, the manner in which business is currently conducted and pertinent tax rules and regulations that are in effect at the respective jurisdictions (that is Wales, UK; Hong Kong and China). Our plan is to comply with the respective tax filing requirements based on Mazars’ assessment.
 
Regulations on Dividend Distribution in the U.S.
 
Our Board of Directors' ability to declare a dividend is subject to restrictions imposed by Nevada corporate law. Nevada corporate law, the Nevada Revised Statutes provides that no distribution (including dividends on, or redemption or repurchases of, shares of capital stock) may be made if, after giving effect to such distribution, (i) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business, or, (ii) except as otherwise specifically permitted by the articles of incorporation, the corporation’s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed at the time of a dissolution to satisfy the preferential rights of preferred stockholders. Directors may consider financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices that are reasonable in the circumstances, a fair valuation, including but not limited to unrealized appreciation and depreciation, and any other method that is reasonable in the circumstances.
 
Regulations on Dividend Distribution in the PRC
 
Under applicable PRC laws and regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, foreign-invested enterprises in China are required to allocate at least 10% of their accumulated profits each year, if any, to fund statutory reserves of up to 50% of the registered capital of the enterprise. Statutory reserves are not distributable as cash dividends. Each wholly owned subsidiary in China must comply with the foregoing regulations.
 
Under PRC law, our subsidiary, AEC Southern Shenzhen, is required to set aside at least 10% of its after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund a statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 50% of its registered capital. Although the statutory reserves can be used, among other ways, to increase the registered capital and eliminate future losses in excess of retained earnings of the respective companies, the reserve funds are not distributable as cash dividends except in the event of liquidation.
 
As of the date of this prospectus, AEC Southern Shenzhen has not conducted any business and does not have any after-tax profit; and it has not declared or paid any dividends to our offshore entities.

M&A Rules and Overseas Listings
 
On August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory agencies, namely, the MOFCOM, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, SAIC, CSRC and SAFE, jointly adopted the M&A Rule which became effective on September 8, 2006. This M&A Rule purports to require, among other things, offshore special purpose vehicles, or SPVs, formed for the purpose of acquiring PRC domestic companies and controlled by PRC companies or individuals, to obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to publicly listing their securities on an overseas stock exchange. While the application of the M&A Rule remains unclear, we believe, based on the advice of our PRC counsel, that CSRC approval was not required in the context of our initial public offering as we are not a special purpose vehicle formed for the purpose of acquiring domestic companies that are controlled by our PRC individual shareholders, as we acquired contractual control rather than equity interests in our domestic affiliated entities. However, we cannot assure you that the relevant PRC government agency, including the CSRC, would reach the same conclusion as our PRC counsel. If the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agency subsequently determines that we needed to obtain the CSRC’s approval for our initial public offering or if CSRC, we may face sanctions by the CSRC or other PRC regulatory agencies. In such event, these regulatory agencies may impose fines and penalties on our operations in the PRC, limit our operating privileges in the PRC, delay or restrict the repatriation of the proceeds from our initial public offering into the PRC, or take other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects, as well as the trading price of our Common Stock.
 
Properties/Facilities
 
Our principal executive office is located at 2 Wall Street, Floor 8, New York, NY 10005. In December 2014, the Company entered into a lease for office space with an unrelated party. The lease was to commence on December 11, 2014, however, due to renovation issues, the lease was changed and commenced on March 1, 2015 and the Company received two months of free rent. This lease agreement requires a monthly rental of $29,558 and expires on July 31, 2025.
 
AEC Southern Shenzhen leases office space from an unrelated third party for a period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2018. This lease agreement requires a monthly rental of RMB 2,000 (approximately US$300). Upon expiration of the lease, we plan to renew or seek new locations.
 
We believe our facilities are sufficient for our business operations.
 
Employees
 
As of the filing date hereof, the Company has 25 full and part-time employees inclusive of outsourced consultants. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
 
We did not have, during the periods presented, and we are currently not a party to, any off-balance sheet arrangements.
 
Seasonality
 
AEC New York typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in its revenues and results of operations, primarily due to quarterly changes in student enrollments resulting from admission seasons. AEC Southern UK does not experience substantial seasonality in its revenues.
