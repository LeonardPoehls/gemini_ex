ITEM 1: | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 We are a publicly traded (OTCQX: TTEN) Delaware limited liability company and independent developer and producer of natural gas, crude oil and NGLs, with operations in basins across the United States with a focus on the horizontal development of  resource potential from the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. We are a sponsor and manager of Drilling Partnerships in which we co-invest, to finance a portion of our natural gas, crude oil and natural gas liquids production activities. As discussed further below, we are the Successor to the business and operations of ARP, a Delaware limited partnership organized in 2012.
 Titan Management manages us and holds our Series A Preferred Share, which entitles Titan Management to receive 2% of the aggregate of distributions paid to shareholders (as if it held 2% of our members’ equity, subject to dilution as discussed below) and to appoint four of our seven directors. Titan Management is a wholly owned subsidiary of ATLS, which is a publicly traded company (OTCQX).
 We believe we have established a strong track record of growing our reserves, production and cash flows through a balanced mix of natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids exploitation and development, sponsorship of our Drilling Partnerships, and the acquisition of oil and gas properties. Our primary business objective is to generate growing yet stable cash flows through the development and acquisition of mature, long-lived natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids properties. As of December 31, 2016, our estimated proved reserves were 970 Bcfe, including the reserves net to our equity interest in our Drilling Partnerships. Of our estimated proved reserves, approximately 90% were proved developed and approximately 72% were natural gas. For the year ended December 31, 2016, our average daily net production was approximately 225.3 MMcfe. 
 
Our operations include three reportable operating segments: gas and oil production, well construction and completion and other partnership management. For financial and other information about our reportable business segments refer to Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 16 to Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
 
Liquidity, Capital Resources, and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
 We have historically funded our operations, acquisitions and cash distributions primarily through cash generated from operations, amounts available under our credit facilities and equity and debt offerings. Our future cash flows are subject to a number of variables, including oil and natural gas prices. Prices for oil and natural gas began to decline significantly during the fourth quarter of 2014 and have continued to decline and remain low in 2016. These lower commodity prices have negatively impacted our revenues, earnings and cash flows. Sustained low commodity prices could have a material and adverse effect on our liquidity position. In addition, challenges with our ability to raise capital through our Drilling Partnerships, either as a result of downturn in commodity prices or other difficulties affecting the fundraising channel, have negatively impacted our ability to remain in compliance with the covenants under our credit facilities.
 We are not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2016, as well as the requirement to deliver audited financial statements without a going concern qualification.  We do not currently have sufficient liquidity to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness, and as a result, there is substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition to the $30 million of indebtedness due on May 1, 2017, we classified the remaining $666.8 million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities as a current liability, based on the occurrence of the event of default, the lenders under our credit facilities, as applicable, could elect to declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable and the lenders could terminate all commitments to extend further credit.  In total, we have $694.8 million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facilities, which is net of $2 million of deferred financing costs, as current portion of long term debt, net within our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2016.
 
Subject to receiving the remaining First Lien lenders’ consent, we expect to finalize an amendment to our First Lien Facility on April 19, 2017 in an attempt to ameliorate some of our liquidity concerns. The amendment is expected to provide for, among other things, waivers of our non-compliance, increases in certain financial covenant ratios and scheduled decreases in our borrowing base. In addition, we expect that we will sell a significant amount of non-core assets in the near future to comply with the requirements of our expected First Lien Facility amendment and to attempt to enhance our liquidity. In addition to the amendments to the financial ratio covenants, the First Lien lenders will waive certain defaults by us with respect to the fourth quarter of 2016, including compliance with the ratios of Total Debt to EBITDA and First Lien Debt to EBITDA, as well as our obligation to deliver financial statements without a “going concern” qualification. The First Lien lenders’ waivers are subject to revocation in certain circumstances, including the exercise of remedies by junior lenders (including pursuant to our second lien credit facility), the failure to extend the standstill period under the intercreditor agreement at least 15 business days prior to its expiration, and the occurrence of additional 
 8


events of default under the First Lien Facility.  Further, unless we are able to obtain an amendment or waiver, the lenders under our Second Lien Facility may declare a default with respect to our failure to comply with financial covenants and deliver audited financial statements without a going concern qualification.  Please see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Credit Facilities—Credit Facility Amendment.”
 
Even following the amendment, we will continue to face liquidity issues and are currently considering, and are likely to make, changes to our capital structure to maintain sufficient liquidity, meet our debt obligations and manage and strengthen our balance sheet. Please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Liquidity— Our long term liquidity requirements and the adequacy of our capital resources are difficult to predict at this time, and we are currently considering, and are likely to make, changes to our capital structure to maintain sufficient liquidity, meet our debt obligations and manage and strengthen our balance sheet.”
 ARP Restructuring and Emergence from Chapter 11 Proceedings
 On July 25, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries and ATLS, solely with respect to certain sections thereof, entered into a Restructuring Support Agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with (i) lenders holding 100% of ARP’s senior secured revolving credit facility (the “First Lien Lenders”), (ii) lenders holding 100% of ARP’s second lien term loan (the “Second Lien Lenders”) and (iii) holders (the “Consenting Noteholders” and, collectively with the First Lien Lenders and the Second Lien Lenders, and their respective successors or permitted assigns that become party to the Restructuring Support Agreement, the “Restructuring Support Parties”) of approximately 80% of the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the 7.75% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “7.75% Senior Notes”) and the 9.25% Senior Notes due 2021 (the “9.25% Senior Notes” and, together with the 7.75% Senior Notes, the “Notes”) of ARP’s subsidiaries, Atlas Resource Partners Holdings, LLC and Atlas Resource Finance Corporation (together, the “Issuers”). Under the Restructuring Support Agreement, the Restructuring Support Parties agreed, subject to certain terms and conditions, to support ARP’s restructuring (the “Restructuring”) pursuant to a pre-packaged plan of reorganization (the “Plan”).
 Pursuant to the Restructuring Support Agreement, ARP completed the sale of certain of its commodity hedge positions on July 25, 2016 and July 26, 2016 and used the proceeds to repay $233.5 million of borrowings outstanding under ARP’s old senior secured revolving credit facility.
 On July 27, 2016, ARP and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Chapter 11”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Bankruptcy Court,” and the cases commenced thereby, the “Chapter 11 Filings”). The cases commenced thereby were jointly administered under the caption “In re: ATLAS RESOURCE PARTNERS, L.P., et al.”
 ARP operated its businesses as “debtors in possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 11 and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court. Under the Plan, all suppliers, vendors, employees, royalty owners, trade partners and landlords were unimpaired by the Plan and were satisfied in full in the ordinary course of business, and ARP’s existing trade contracts and terms were maintained. To assure ordinary course operations, ARP obtained interim approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions seeking authority to use cash collateral on a consensual basis, pay wages and benefits for individuals who provide services to ARP, and pay vendors, oil and gas obligations and other creditor claims in the ordinary course of business.
 On August 26, 2016, an order confirming the Plan was entered by the Bankruptcy Court. On September 1, 2016, (the “Plan Effective Date”), pursuant to the Plan, the following occurred:
  
• | the First Lien Lenders received cash payment of all obligations owed to them by ARP pursuant to the senior secured revolving credit facility (other than $440 million of principal and face amount of letters of credit) and became lenders under our first lien exit facility credit agreement, composed of a $410 million conforming reserve-based tranche and a $30 million non-conforming tranche.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Second Lien Lenders received a pro rata share of our second lien exit facility credit agreement with an aggregate principal amount of $252.5 million. In addition, the Second Lien Lenders received a pro rata share of 10% of our common shares, subject to dilution by a management incentive plan.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Holders of the Notes, in exchange for 100% of the $668 million aggregate principal amount of Notes outstanding plus accrued but unpaid interest as of the commencement of the Chapter 11 Filings, received 90% of our common shares, subject to dilution by a management incentive plan.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ARP transferred all of its assets and operations to us as a new holding company and ARP dissolved. As a result, we became the successor issuer to ARP for purposes of and pursuant to Rule 12g-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | all of ARP’s preferred limited partnership units and common limited partnership units were cancelled without the receipt of any consideration or recovery.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Titan Management, a wholly owned subsidiary of ATLS, received a Series A Preferred Share, which entitles Titan Management to receive to 2% of the aggregate of distributions paid to shareholders (as if it held 2% of our members’ equity, subject to dilution if catch-up contributions are not made with respect to future equity issuances, other than pursuant to the management incentive plan) and certain other rights. Four of the seven initial members of the board of directors of us were designated by Titan Management (the “Titan Class A Directors”). For so long as Titan Management holds the Series A Preferred Share, the Class A Directors will be appointed by a majority of the Class A Directors then in office. We have a continuing right to purchase the preferred share at fair market value (as determined pursuant to the methodology provided for in our limited liability company agreement), subject to the receipt of certain approvals, including the holders of at least 67% of the outstanding common shares of us unaffiliated with Titan Management voting in favor of the exercise of the right to purchase the preferred share.

Geographic and Geologic Overview
 
As of December 31, 2016, our significant gas and oil production positions were in the following six operating areas (refer to Item 2: “Properties” and Item 7: “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information regarding our gas and oil production positions). In connection with our ongoing liquidity enhancement initiatives, we are currently marketing our Appalachia, Raton and Rangely assets to concentrate our portfolio and grow our production through Eagle Ford development in 2017 and 2018.
Eagle Ford. The Eagle Ford Shale is an Upper Cretaceous-age formation that is prospective for horizontal drilling in approximately 26 counties across South Texas. Target vertical depths range from 4,000 to some 11,000+ feet with thickness from 40 to over 400 feet. The Eagle Ford formation is considered to be the primary source rock for many conventional oil and gas fields including the prolific East Texas Oil Field, one of the largest oil fields in the contiguous United States. We own 10,777 contiguous net acres in the Eagle Ford Shale in Atascosa County. We acquired our Eagle Ford position through a series of acquisitions in 2014 and 2015 for approximately $243 million. During the year, we averaged 9.9 MMcfe/d net production volumes. We estimate 83 Bcfe of total proved reserves for our Eagle Ford position, of which 89% are oil.   At December 31, 2016, we had a one-rig program actively drilling on our Eagle Ford Shale position.  We anticipate increasing to a two-rig program during the year ended December 31, 2017.
North Texas. Our North Texas position includes the Barnett Shale and Marble Falls play located east of the Bend Arch and west of the Ouachita Thrust in the Fort Worth Basin of northern Texas. The Barnett Shale is Mississippian-age shale formation located at depths between 5,000 and 8,000 feet and ranges in thickness from 100 and 600 feet. The Marble Falls play is a Pennsylvanian-age formation located above the Barnett Shale and beneath the Atoka at depths of approximately 5,500 feet and ranges in thickness from 50 and 500 feet. We first acquired our positions in the Barnett Shale and Marble Falls play through several acquisitions in 2012, totaling approximately $653 million, and have continued to build our position through organic drilling. During the year, we averaged 41 MMcfe/d net production volumes. We estimate 115 Bcfe of total proved reserves for our North Texas positions, of which 94% are proved developed and producing (“PDP”).
 Appalachian Basin. The Appalachian Basin includes all or parts of: Alabama, Georgia, Kentucky, Maryland, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia and West Virginia. It is the most mature natural gas, crude oil and NGL producing region in the United States, having established the first oil production in 1860. Our development and production activities in the Appalachia Basin principally include the Marcellus Shale, Utica-Point Pleasant Shale, Clinton Sand and other conventional formations primarily in Pennsylvania and Ohio. During the year, we averaged 36,406 MMcfe/d net production volumes. We estimate 204 Bcfe of remaining proved reserves for our Appalachian positions, of which 95% are gas.

• | The Marcellus Shale is a black, organic rich shale formation located at depths between 4,000 and 8,500 feet and ranges in thickness from 50 to 250 feet. We had an interest in approximately 251 Marcellus Shale wells, consisting of 212 vertical wells and 39 horizontal wells. We have an interest in eight horizontal Marcellus Shale wells in Northeastern Pennsylvania, all of which were developed through our Drilling Partnerships. Approximately 1,558 prospective Marcellus Shale acres remained undeveloped in Lycoming County, Pennsylvania.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Utica-Point Pleasant Shale is an Ordovician-age shale, which covers a large portion of Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York and West Virginia and lies several thousand feet below the Devonian-age Marcellus. The Utica-Point Pleasant is an organic rich system comprised of two related shales. The richest concentration of organic material is present within

the Point Pleasant member of the Lower Utica formation; therefore, the primary objective section of this shale play. From central Ohio, the Utica-Point Pleasant play has gentle basin center dip towards its deepest point in central Pennsylvania. In general, as the present day depth increases from West to East, so does the progression of hydrocarbon maturity-along the following, ordered hydrocarbon phase windows: Immature-Oil-Condensate-Rich Gas-Dry Gas Windows. We have an interest in approximately 2,354 wells in Ohio including 12 horizontal Utica-Point Pleasant wells. We have approximately 1,395 net undeveloped acres prospective for the Utica Shale in Trumbull and Stark counties in Ohio.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Coal-Bed Methane. Our coal-bed methane developments are diversified across four well-known coal-bed methane producing areas: the Raton, Black Warrior, Arkoma and Central Appalachian basins. We have more than 476,491 net undeveloped acres prospective for coal-bed methane. We operated 2,783 wells and had an interest in another 910 wells, all of which produce gas generated from coal. During the year, we averaged 116 MMcfe/d net production volumes, representing over 51% of our total production for the year. We estimate 398 Bcfe of remaining proved reserves in our Coal-Bed Methane positions, of which 89% are PDP.
  
• | The Raton asset straddles the New Mexico-Colorado border, along the eastern edge of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The production derives from two coal-bearing intervals, the Raton (Tertiary-Upper Cretaceous Age) and Vermajo (Cretaceous Age) formations. The combined net coal thickness ranges between 18 and 65 feet, with depths between 750 and 2,200 feet. We operate 972 wells in our Raton position. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Black Warrior coal-bed methane asset is located in central Alabama and geologically related with the frontal thrusts associated with the Appalachian Mountains. The three Pennsylvanian-age coal intervals (Pratt, Mary Lee and Black Creek, listed in increasing stratigraphic depth and age) possess combined net coal thicknesses ranging from 16 to 24 feet, at depths of 500 to 2,400 feet. We operate 858 wells and have an interest in an additional 696 wells in our Black Warrior position. We acquired our Raton and Black Warrior positions through an acquisition in 2013 for approximately $710 million. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Arkoma coal-bed methane asset is located in eastern Oklahoma and the Arkoma basin formed by the Ouachita Mountain uplift to the southeast. The main producing coal is the Hartshorne Coal seam which is of middle Pennsylvanian Age. The net coal thickness ranges from 5 to 10 feet, at depths of 14 to 4,900 feet. We operate 563 wells and have an interest in an additional 66 wells in our Arkoma position. We acquired our Arkoma position through an acquisition in 2015 for approximately $32 million.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Central Appalachian coal-bed methane asset is located in Virginia and West Virginia. The Central Appalachian Basin is a mountainous region where coal mining is prevalent. We operate vertical wells in the Pond Creek and Lasher fields located in southern West Virginia and southwestern Virginia and pinnate horizontal wells in southern and northern West Virginia. We operate 411 wells and have an interest in an additional 72 wells in our Virginia and West Virginia positions. We acquired our Virginia and West Virginia positions through an acquisition in 2014 for approximately $98 million.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Rangely. The Rangely Oil Field, located in northwestern Colorado, is one of the oldest and largest oil fields in the Rocky Mountain region. We have an approximate 25% non-operating net working interest in the assets and Chevron Corporation is the current owner/operator of the Rangely Weber Sand Unit. The Weber Formation is Permian to Pennsylvanian in age (245-315 million years ago), and typically consists of fine-grained, cross-bedded calcareous sandstones. Average thickness of the unit is 1,200 feet, although the gross reservoir thickness averages 530 feet, and the net production interval within the formation varies from approximately 150 to 250 feet. We acquired our Rangely position through an acquisition in 2014 for approximately $410 million. Over the past 15 years, the Rangely field has exhibited a 3% exponential annual decline in production. During the year, we averaged 15 MMcfe/d net production volumes. We estimate 162 Bcfe of total remaining proved reserves in our Rangely position, of which 91% are oil and 81% are PDP.
 Mid-Continent. Our Mid-Continent position includes the Mississippi Lime and Hunton formations located in the Anadarko Shelf in northern Oklahoma. The Mississippi Lime formation is an expansive carbonate hydrocarbon system and is located at depths between 4,000 and 7,000 feet between the Pennsylvanian-aged Morrow formation and the Devonian-age world-class source rock Woodford Shale formation. The Mississippi Lime formation can reach 600 feet in gross thickness, with a targeted porosity zone between 50 and 100 feet thickness. The Hunton formation is a limestone formation located at a depth of approximately 7,500 feet, and ranges in thickness from 150 and 300 feet. We acquired our Mississippi Lime position through a series of acquisitions in 2012 for approximately $60 million. During the year, we averaged 7 MMcfe/d net production volumes.   We estimate 123 Bcfe of proved reserves in our Mid-Continent positions, of which 80% are gas. We also own significant salt water disposal assets in the area to support Mississippi Lime production.

Gas and Oil Production
 Matters Impacting Comparability of Results
 Fresh Start Accounting. Upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh-start accounting in accordance with ASC 852. We qualified for fresh-start accounting because (i) the reorganization value of our assets immediately prior to the confirmation was less than the post-petition liabilities and allowed claims and (ii) the holders of existing voting shares of our predecessor company received less than 50% of the voting shares of the post-emergence successor entity.
 As a result of the application of fresh start accounting, at the Plan Effective Date, our assets and liabilities were recorded at their estimated fair values which, in some cases, are significantly different than amounts included in our financial statements prior to the Plan Effective Date. Accordingly, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows on and after the Effective Date are not comparable to our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows prior to the Plan Effective Date. References to “Successor” relate to Titan on and subsequent to the Plan Effective Date. References to “Predecessor” refer to ARP prior to the Plan Effective Date.  We have presented our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows with a black line division to delineate the lack of comparability between the amounts presented on or after September 1, 2016 and dates prior.
 Production Volumes
 Currently, our natural gas, crude oil and NGL production operations are focused in various plays throughout the United States, and include direct interest wells and ownership interests in wells drilled through our Drilling Partnerships. When we drill new wells through our partnership management business we receive an interest in each Drilling Partnership proportionate to the value of our co-investment in it and the value of the acreage we contribute to it, typically 10-30% of the overall capitalization of a particular partnership. The following table presents our total net natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids production volumes and production per day for the periods indicated:

Partnership Management Business
 We conduct certain energy activities through, and a portion of our revenues are attributable to, sponsorship of the Drilling Partnerships. Drilling Partnership investor capital raised by us is deployed to drill and complete wells included within the partnership. As we deploy Drilling Partnership investor capital, we recognize certain management fees we are entitled to receive, including well construction and completion revenue and a portion of administration and oversight revenue. At each period end, if we have Drilling Partnership investor capital that has not yet been deployed, we will recognize a current liability titled “Liabilities Associated with Drilling Contracts” on our consolidated balance sheet. After the Drilling Partnership well is completed and turned in line, we are entitled to receive additional operating and management fees, which are included within well services and administration and oversight revenue, respectively, on a monthly basis while the well is operating. In addition to the management fees we are entitled to receive for services provided, we are also entitled to our pro-rata share of Drilling Partnership gas and oil production revenue, which generally approximates 10-30%.
 During the Successor period from September 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016 we raised $10.7 million from outside investors for participation in our Drilling Partnerships.  During the Predecessor period from January 1, 2012 through August 31, 2016, we raised over $503.2 million from outside investors for participation in our Drilling Partnerships. Net proceeds from these partnerships are used to fund the investors’ share of drilling and completion costs under our drilling contracts with the partnerships.
 Our fund raising activities for sponsored Drilling Partnerships during the last five years are summarized in the following table (amounts in millions):

We finance certain of our development drilling activities through the sponsor limited partnerships. Accordingly, the amount of development activities that we will undertake depends in large part upon our ability to obtain investor subscriptions to invest in these Drilling Partnerships.  Recently, we have experienced a significant decline in the amount of funds raised. In the future, we may not be successful in raising funds through these Drilling Partnerships at the same levels that we previously experienced, and we also may not be successful in increasing the amount of funds we raise. Our ability to raise funds through our Drilling Partnerships depends in large part upon the perception of investors of their potential return on their investment and their tax benefits from investing in them, which perception is influenced significantly by our historical track record of generating returns and tax benefits to the investors in our existing partnerships.  In the event that our Drilling Partnerships do not achieve satisfactory returns on investment or the anticipated tax benefits, we may have difficulty in maintaining or increasing the level of Drilling Partnership fundraising relative to the levels achieved by us.  In this event, we may need to seek financing for our drilling activities through alternative methods, which may not be available, or which may be available only on a less attractive basis than the financing we realized through these Drilling Partnerships, or we may determine to reduce drilling activity.

As managing general partner of our Drilling Partnerships, we recognize our Drilling Partnership management fees in the following manner:
  
• | Well construction and completion. For each well that is drilled by a Drilling Partnership, we receive a 15% mark-up on those costs incurred to drill and complete the wells included within the partnership. Such fees are earned, in accordance with the partnership agreement, and recognized as the services are performed, typically between 60 and 270 days, using the percentage of completion method;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Administration and oversight. For each well drilled by a Drilling Partnership, we receive a fixed fee between $100,000 and $500,000, depending on the type of well drilled, which is earned in accordance with the partnership agreement and recognized at the initiation of the well. Additionally, the Drilling Partnership pays us a monthly per well administrative fee of $75 for the life of the well. The well administrative fee is earned on a monthly basis as the services are performed; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Well services. Each Drilling Partnership pays us a monthly per well operating fee, currently $1,000 to $2,000, depending on the type of well, for the life of the well. Such fees are earned on a monthly basis as the services are performed;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Gathering and processing revenue includes gathering fees we charge to the Drilling Partnership wells for our processing plants in the New Albany and the Chattanooga Shales. Generally, we charge a gathering fee to the Drilling Partnership wells equivalent to the fees we remit. In Appalachia, a majority of our Drilling Partnership wells are subject to a gathering agreement, whereby we remit a gathering fee of 16%. However, based on the respective Drilling Partnership agreements, we charge our Drilling Partnership wells a 13% gathering fee. As a result, some of our gathering expenses within our partnership management segment, specifically those in the Appalachian Basin, will generally exceed the revenues collected from Drilling Partnerships by approximately 3%.
 Our Drilling Partnerships provide tax advantages to our investors because an investor’s share of the partnership’s intangible drilling cost deduction may be used to offset ordinary income. Intangible drilling costs include items that do not have salvage value, such as labor, fuel, repairs, supplies and hauling. Generally, for our Drilling Partnerships, approximately 80% to 94% of the subscription proceeds received have been used to pay 100% of the partnership’s intangible drilling costs. For example, an investment of $10,000 generally permits the investor to deduct from taxable ordinary income approximately $8,000 to $9,400 in the year in which the investor invests.
 15


While our historical structure has varied, we have generally agreed to subordinate a portion of our share of Drilling Partnership gas and oil production revenue, net of corresponding production costs and up to a maximum of 50% of unhedged revenue, from certain Drilling Partnerships for the benefit of the limited partner investors until they have received specified returns, typically from 10% to 12% per year determined on a cumulative basis, over a specified period, typically the first five to eight years, in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreements. We periodically compare the projected return on investment for limited partners in a Drilling Partnership during the subordination period, based upon historical and projected cumulative gas and oil production revenue and expenses, with the return on investment subject to subordination agreed upon within the Drilling Partnership agreement. If the projected return on investment falls below the agreed upon rate, we recognize subordination as an estimated reduction of our pro-rata share of gas and oil production revenue, net of corresponding production costs, during the current period in an amount that will achieve the agreed upon investment return, subject to the limitation of 50% of unhedged cumulative net production revenues over the subordination period. For Drilling Partnerships for which we have recognized subordination in a historical period, if projected investment returns subsequently reflect that the agreed upon limited partner investment return will be achieved during the subordination period, we will recognize an estimated increase in our portion of historical cumulative gas and oil net production, subject to a limitation of the cumulative subordination previously recognized.
 Drilling Activity
 The number of wells we drill will vary depending on, among other things, the amount of money we raise through our Drilling Partnerships, the cost of each well, the estimated recoverable reserves attributable to each well and accessibility to the well site. The following table sets forth information with respect to the number of wells we drilled, both gross and for our interest, during the periods indicated.

We do not operate any of the rigs or related equipment used in our drilling operations, relying instead on specialized subcontractors or joint venture partners for all drilling and completion work. This enables us to streamline our operations and conserve capital for investments in new wells, infrastructure and property acquisitions, while generally retaining control over all geological, drilling, engineering and operating decisions. We perform regular inspection, testing and monitoring functions on each of our Drilling Partnerships and our operated wells.

As of December 31, 2016, we did not have any ongoing drilling activities.
 
Natural Gas and Oil Leases
 The typical oil and gas lease agreement provides for the payment of a percentage of the proceeds, known as a royalty, to the mineral owner(s) for all natural gas, oil and other hydrocarbons produced from any well(s) drilled on the leased premises. In the Appalachian Basin and much of the United States, this amount, historically, has ranged between 1/8th (12.5%) and 1/6th (16.66%) of the hydrocarbons produced, resulting in a net revenue interest to us of between 87.5% and 83.33%. With the discovery of the Marcellus and Utica Shales in the Appalachian Basin in the last few years, and the resultant competition for undeveloped acreage, it has become very common for landowners to demand royalty rates up to 20% or higher, resulting in a net revenue interest of 80% or less. In Oklahoma (Mississippi Lime play) and Texas (Barnett and Eagle Ford Shales and Marble Falls play), both states where we have acquired substantial acreage positions, royalties are commonly in the 15-25% range, resulting in net revenue interests to us in the 75-85% range.
 In the Texas Barnett and Eagle Ford Shales, Oklahoma Mississippi Lime and Appalachian Basin Marcellus and Utica plays, where horizontal wells are generally drilled on much larger drilling units (sometimes approaching 1,000 acres), the mineral and/or surface rights are generally acquired from multiple parties. In the case of “urban” drilling areas in the Barnett Shale, there may be as many as 3,500 royalty owners within a single drilling unit.
 Because the acquisition of hydrocarbon leases in highly desirable basins is an extremely competitive process, and involves certain geological and business risks to identify prospective areas, leases are frequently held by other oil and gas operators. In order to access the rights to drill on those leases held by others, we may elect to farm-in lease rights and/or purchase assignments of leases from competitor operators. Typically, the assignor of such leases will reserve an overriding royalty interest (over and above the existing mineral owner royalty), that can range from 2-3% up to as high as 7 or 8%, and sometimes contain options to convert the overriding royalty interests to working interests at payout of a well. Areas where farm-ins are utilized can result in additional reductions in our net revenue interests, depending upon their terms and how much of a particular drilling unit the farm-in acreage encompasses.
 There will be occasions where competitors owning leasehold interests in areas where we want to drill will not farm-out or sell their leases, but will instead join us as working interest partners, paying their proportionate share of all drilling and operating costs in a well. However, it is generally our goal to obtain 100% of the working interest in any and all new wells that we operate.
 Contractual Revenue Arrangements
 Natural Gas. We market the majority of our natural gas production to gas purchasers directly or to third party midstream companies who gather, treat and process as necessary the gas. The sales price of natural gas produced is a function of the market in the area and typically linked to a regional index. The pricing indices for the majority of our production areas are as follows:

• | Appalachian Basin - Dominion South Point, Tennessee Gas Pipeline Zone 4 (200 Leg), Transco Leidy Line, Columbia Appalachia, NYMEX and Texas Eastern Transmission Corporation (TETCO) M2;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Mississippi Lime - Southern Star;
--+----------------------------------


• | Barnett Shale and Marble Falls- primarily Waha but with smaller amounts sold into a variety of north Texas outlets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Raton – ANR, Panhandle, and NGPL;
--+----------------------------------


• | Black Warrior Basin – Southern Natural;
--+----------------------------------------


• | Eagle Ford – Houston Ship Channel;
--+-----------------------------------


• | Arkoma – Enable Gas; and
--+-------------------------


• | Other regions - primarily the Texas Gas Zone SL spot market (New Albany Shale) and the Cheyenne Hub spot market (Niobrara).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We sell the majority of our natural gas at monthly, fixed index first of the month prices and a smaller portion at index daily prices.
 We hold firm transportation obligations on Colorado Interstate Gas for the benefit of production from the Raton Basin in the New Mexico/Colorado Area. The total of firm transportation obligations held is approximately 65,000 MMBtu/d under contracts expiring in 2019 and 55,000 MMBtu/d under contracts expiring in 2020. We also hold firm transportation obligations on East Tennessee Natural Gas (25,000 MMBtu/d), Columbia Gas Transmission (14,000 MMBtu/d) and Equitrans (11,000 MMBtu/d) for the benefit of production from the central Appalachian Basin under contracts expiring between the years 2017 and 2024. We hold 
 17


gathering obligations with ETC for production in the Barnett Shale. The total gathering obligations held is 2,507 mcf/d under contracts expiring in 2019. We do not have delivery commitments for fixed and determinable quantities of natural gas in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.
 Crude Oil. Crude oil produced from our wells flows directly into leasehold storage tanks where it is sold to an oil purchaser either directly or thru a common carrier acting on behalf of the oil purchaser. The crude oil is typically sold at the prevailing spot market price for each region, less appropriate trucking charges. The majority of our crude oil is sold via truck at the lease. The oil and natural gas liquids production of our Rangely assets flows into a common carrier pipeline and is sold at prevailing market prices, less applicable transportation and oil quality differentials. We do not have delivery commitments or firm transportation obligations for fixed and determinable quantities of crude oil in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.
 Natural Gas Liquids. NGLs are extracted from the natural gas stream by processing and fractionation plants enabling the remaining “dry” gas to meet pipeline specifications for transport or sale to end users or purchasers operating on the receiving pipeline. The resulting plant residue natural gas is sold as described above and the NGLs are generally priced and sold using the Mont Belvieu (TX) or Conway (KS) regional component indices. The cost to process and fractionate the NGLs from the gas stream is typically either a volumetric fee for the gas and liquids processed or a percentage retention by the processing and fractionation facility. We do not have delivery commitments or firm transportation obligations for fixed and determinable quantities of NGLs in any future periods under existing contracts or agreements.
 For the Successor period September 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016, Tenaska Marketing Ventures and Chevron within our gas and oil production segment individually accounted for approximately 22% and 15%, respectively, of our natural gas, oil and NGL consolidated revenues, excluding the impact of all financial derivative activity. For the Predecessor period January 1, 2016 through August 31, 2016, Tenaska Marketing Ventures, Chevron and Interconn Resources LLC within our gas and oil production segment individually accounted for approximately 25%, 16% and 13%, respectively, of our natural gas, oil and NGL consolidated revenues, excluding the impact of all financial derivative activity. 
 Drilling Partnerships. We generally have funded a portion of our drilling activities through sponsorship of tax-advantaged Drilling Partnerships. In addition to providing capital for our drilling activities, our Drilling Partnerships are a source of fee-based revenues, which are not directly dependent on commodity prices. See “Partnership Management Business” for further discussion.
Natural Gas and Oil Hedging
 We seek to provide greater stability in our cash flows through our use of financial hedges for our natural gas, oil and natural gas liquids production. The financial hedges may include purchases of regulated NYMEX futures and options contracts and non-regulated over-the-counter futures and options contracts with qualified counterparties. Financial hedges are contracts between ourselves and counterparties and do not require physical delivery of hydrocarbons. Financial hedges allow us to mitigate hydrocarbon price risk, and cash is settled to the extent there is a price difference between the hedge price and the actual NYMEX settlement price. Settlement typically occurs on a monthly basis, at the time in the future dictated within the hedge contract. Financial hedges executed in accordance with our secured credit facility do not require cash margin and are secured by our natural gas and oil properties. To assure that the financial instruments will be used solely for hedging price risks and not for speculative purposes, we have a management committee to assure that all financial trading is done in compliance with our hedging policies and procedures. We do not intend to contract for positions that we cannot offset with actual production.
Natural Gas Gathering Agreements
 Virtually all natural gas produced is gathered through one or more pipeline systems before sale or delivery to a purchaser or an interstate pipeline. A gathering fee can be charged for each gathering activity that is utilized and by each separate gatherer providing the service. Fees will vary depending on the distance the gas travels and whether additional services such as compression, blending, or treating are provided.
 Barnett and Marble Falls production in Texas is gathered/processed by a variety of companies depending on the location of the production. As in the case of Appalachian and Mississippi Lime production, either a fee is charged for the gathering activity alone, or a gatherer/processor may provide a combination of services to include processing, fractionation and/or compression. In some instances, the market to which the gas is sold will deduct the third-party gathering fees from the proceeds payable and pay the third-party gatherers directly.
 In Appalachia, we have gathering agreements with Laurel Mountain Midstream, LLC (“Laurel Mountain”). Under these agreements, we dedicate our natural gas production in certain areas within southwest Pennsylvania to Laurel Mountain for transportation to interstate pipeline systems or local distribution companies, subject to certain exceptions. In return, Laurel Mountain 
 18


is required to accept and transport our dedicated natural gas subject to certain conditions. The greater of $0.35 per mcf or 16% of the gross sales price of the natural gas is charged by Laurel Mountain for the majority of the gas. A lesser fee does apply to a small number of specific wells in the area. We also use Anadarko Marcellus Midstream, L.L.C.’s facilities to gather our Lycoming Co., Pennsylvania production for a $0.45 MMBtu fee which delivers our production to Transco Leidy Line pipeline for sale to our purchaser. Our Utica production in Ohio is gathered by both Utica East Ohio Midstream, L.L.C. (“UEO”) and Blue Racer Midstream, L.L.C. for delivery to UEO’s Kensington Processing plant.  Residue gas is sold to purchasers on Dominion East Ohio or Tennessee pipelines. UEO markets the NGLs and returns proceeds to us.
 In the Raton Basin (New Mexico and Colorado), we gather all of our production and deliver it to Colorado Interstate Gas Pipeline, an interstate pipeline. In the Black Warrior Basin (Alabama), we gather our own production and deliver it to the Southcross Alabama pipeline who then delivers the gas to the Sothern Natural pipeline to our purchaser.
 Mississippi Lime production is currently gathered and processed by SemGas and plant products including gas and NGLs are sold to SemGas. SemGas returns 95 Percent of Proceeds (“POP”) of the revenues it receives to Titan from the sale of gas and NGLs. The remaining 5% and a $0.3276 MMBtu gathering fee are paid to SemGas for all services provided.
 Availability of Energy Field Services
 We contract for drilling rigs and purchase goods and services necessary for the drilling and completion of wells from a number of drillers and suppliers, none of which supplies a significant portion of our annual needs. Over the past year, we and other oil and natural gas companies have experienced a significant reduction in drilling and operating costs. We cannot predict the duration or stability of the current level of supply and demand for drilling rigs and other goods and services required for our operations with any certainty due to numerous factors affecting the energy industry, including the supply and demand for natural gas and oil.
Competition
 The energy industry is intensely competitive in all of its aspects. We operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties and other energy companies, attracting capital for our Drilling Partnerships, contracting for drilling equipment and securing trained personnel. We also compete with the exploration and production divisions of public utility companies for mineral property acquisitions. Competition is intense for the acquisition of leases considered favorable for the development of hydrocarbons in commercial quantities. Our competitors may be able to pay more for hydrocarbon properties and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties than our financial or personnel resources permit. Furthermore, competition arises not only from numerous domestic and foreign sources of hydrocarbons but also from other industries that supply alternative sources of energy. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas, crude oil, and natural gas liquids.
 Many of our competitors possess greater financial and other resources which may enable them to identify and acquire desirable properties and market their hydrocarbon production more effectively than we do. Moreover, we also compete with a number of other companies that offer interests in Drilling Partnerships. As a result, competition for investment capital to fund Drilling Partnerships is intense.
 Seasonal Nature of Business
 Generally, but not always, the demand for natural gas decreases during the summer months and increases during the winter months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer. This can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. In addition, seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations can limit our drilling and producing activities and other operations in certain areas. These seasonal anomalies may pose challenges for meeting our well construction objectives and increase competition for equipment, supplies and personnel, which could lead to shortages and increase costs or delay our operations. We have in the past drilled a greater number of wells during the winter months, because we typically received the majority of funds from Drilling Partnerships during the fourth calendar quarter.
Environmental Matters and Regulation
 Our operations relating to drilling and waste disposal are subject to stringent and complex laws and regulations pertaining to health, safety and the environment. As operators within the complex natural gas and oil industry, we must comply with laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or affect our business activities in many ways, such as by:

• | restricting the way waste disposal is handled;
--+-----------------------------------------------

 19


 
• | limiting or prohibiting drilling, construction and operating activities in sensitive areas such as wetlands, coastal regions, non-attainment areas, tribal lands or areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring the acquisition of various permits before the commencement of drilling;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring the installation of expensive pollution control equipment and water treatment facilities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restricting the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with siting, drilling, completion, production, and plugging activities;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring remedial measures to reduce, mitigate and/or respond to releases of pollutants or hazardous substances from existing and former operations, such as pit closure and plugging of abandoned wells;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enjoining some or all of the operations of facilities deemed in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | requiring preparation of a Resource Management Plan, an Environmental Assessment, and/or an Environmental Impact Statement with respect to operations affecting federal lands or leases.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. Certain environmental statutes impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where pollutants or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Neighboring landowners and other third parties can file claims for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by noise and/or the release of pollutants or wastes into the environment. These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of natural gas and oil production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the natural gas and oil industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently enact new, and revise existing, environmental laws and regulations, and any new laws or changes to existing laws that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements for the natural gas and oil industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
 We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, and compliance with existing federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations. Nevertheless, the trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Moreover, we cannot assure future events, such as changes in existing laws, the promulgation of new laws, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs.
 Environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on our operations include the following:
 National Environmental Policy Act. Natural gas and oil exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act, or “NEPA.” NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major federal agency actions having the potential to significantly affect the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency will typically require an Environmental Assessment to assess the potential direct, indirect and cumulative impacts of a proposed project and, if necessary, will prepare a more detailed Environmental Impact Statement that will be made available for public review and comment. All of our proposed exploration and production activities on federal lands, if any, require governmental permits, many of which are subject to the requirements of NEPA. This process has the potential to delay the development of natural gas and oil projects.
 Hydraulic Fracturing.  In recent years, federal, state, and local scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing has increased.  Regulation of the practice remains largely the province of state governments, except for a Bureau of Land Management rule that would have imposed conditions on fracturing operations on federal lands, which was enjoined by a federal court holding BLM lacked the authority to adopt the rule.  Common elements of state regulations governing hydraulic fracturing may include, but not be limited to, the following: requirement that logs and pressure test results are included in disclosures to state authorities; disclosure of hydraulic fracturing fluids and chemicals, potentially subject to trade secret/confidential proprietary information protections, and the ratios of same used in operations; specific disposal regimens for hydraulic fracturing fluids; replacement/remediation of contaminated water assets; and minimum depth of hydraulic fracturing.  In December 2016, EPA released the final report of its study of the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water in the U.S. finding that the hydraulic fracturing water cycle can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.  Those circumstances included where (1) there are water withdrawals for hydraulic fracturing in times or areas of low water availability, (2) hydraulic fracturing fluids and chemicals or produced water are spilled, (3) hydraulic fracturing fluids are 
 20


injected into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity, and (4) hydraulic fracturing wastewater is stored or disposed in unlined pits.  If new federal regulations were adopted as a result of these findings, they could increase our cost to operate.
 Oil Spills.  The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”), contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the United States. The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict, joint and several liability for all containment and cleanup costs and certain other damages arising from a spill, including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil to surface waters. While we believe we have been in compliance with OPA, noncompliance could result in varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities.
 Water Discharges. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, the federal regulations that implement the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws and regulations a number of different types of requirements on our operations.  First, these laws and regulations impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas and oil wastes, into navigable waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the relevant state. These permits may require pretreatment of produced waters before discharge. Compliance with such permits and requirements may be costly. Second, the Clean Water Act also prohibits the discharge of dredge and fill material in regulated waters, including wetlands, unless authorized by a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.  The precise definition of waters and wetland subject to the dredge-and-fill permit requirement has been enormously complicated and is subject to on-going litigation.  A broader definition could result in more water and wetlands being subject to protection creating the possibility of additional permitting requirements for some of our existing or future facilities.  Third, the Clean Water Act also requires specified facilities to maintain and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans and to take measures to minimize the risks of petroleum spills.   Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for failure to obtain or non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of the Clean Water Act.
 Air Emissions. Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, as amended, the federal regulations that implement the Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including drilling sites, processing plants, certain storage vessels and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and regulations also apply to entities that use natural gas as fuel, and may increase the costs of customer compliance to the point where demand for natural gas is affected.  Clean Air Act rules impose additional emissions control requirements and practices on some of our operations. Some of our new facilities may be required to obtain permits before work can begin, and existing facilities may be required to incur capital costs in order to comply with new or revised requirements. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. Our failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and potentially criminal enforcement actions. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the requirements of the Clean Air Act and comparable state laws and regulations.  While we will likely be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment to comply with applicable regulations and to obtain and maintain operating permits and approvals for air emissions, we believe that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than other similarly situated companies.
 Greenhouse Gas Regulation and Climate Change. To date, legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas emissions have not had a material impact on our business.  Under the past eight years during the Obama Administration several Clean Air Act regulations were adopted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and a couple foundational regulations were upheld by the courts.  President Trump pledged during the election campaign to suspend or reverse many if not all of the Obama Administration’s initiatives to reduce the nation’s emissions of greenhouse gases.  Some of the foundational regulations, however, appear unyielding.  It would be a significant departure from the principle of stare decisis for the Supreme Court to reverse its decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007) holding that greenhouse gases are “air pollutants” covered by the Clean Air Act.  Similarly, reversing EPA’s final determination that greenhouse gases “endanger” public health and welfare, 74 Fed. Reg. 66,496 (Dec. 15, 2009), upheld in Coalition for Responsible Regulation, Inc. v. EPA, 684 F.3d 102 (D.C. Cir. 2012), would seem to require development of new scientific evidence that runs counter to general discoveries since that determination.  
 On March 28, 2017, President Trump issued an Executive Order on Promoting Energy Independence and Economic Growth explaining how his Administration would withdraw, rescind, revisit, or revise virtually every element of the Obama Administration’s program for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Executive Order, some actions had immediate effect.  Other actions, including those most directly affecting our operations and the overall consumption of fossil fuels, will be the subject of potentially lengthy notice-and-comment rule-making.  With respect to rules more directly applicable to the types of operations we conduct, the Executive Order directed EPA to undertake new rule-making to revise or rescind 2015 methane emissions standards for new or modified wells.  Similarly, the Order directed the Department of Interior to re-write a 2015 rule imposing restrictions on fracturing operations conducted on federal land and a 2016 rule restricting flaring of methane emissions from oil and gas extraction on federal 
 21


land. With respect to rules of greater applicability affecting overall consumption of fossil fuels, the Order instructed EPA to rewrite (1) the 2015 Clean Power Plan – the rule aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants by one-third (compared to 2005 levels), and (2) the 2015 New Source Rule setting greenhouse gas emission requirements for construction of new power plants.  
 While we generally foresee a less stringent approach to the regulation of greenhouse gases, undoing the Obama Administration’s regulations of greenhouse gas emissions will necessarily involve lengthy notice-and-comment rulemaking and the resulting decisions may then be subject to litigation by those opposed to rolling back existing regulations.  Thus, it could be several years before existing regulations are off the books.  Opponents of the rollbacks, including states and environmental groups, may then decide to sue large sources of greenhouse gas emissions for the alleged nuisance created by such emissions.  In 2011, the Supreme Court held that federal common law nuisance claims were displaced by the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from large sources of emissions. If the Administration fails to pursue regulation of emissions from such sources or takes the position that it has no authority to do regulate their emissions, then it is possible that a court would find common law nuisance claims are no longer displaced.    
 Although further regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from our operations may stall at the federal level, it is possible that, in the absence of additional federal regulatory action, states may pursue additional regulation of our operations, including restrictions on new and existing wells and fracturing operations, as many states already have done.
 Waste Handling. The Solid Waste Disposal Act, including RCRA, and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of “hazardous wastes” and the disposal of non-hazardous wastes. With authority granted by federal EPA, individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil and natural gas constitute “solid wastes,” which are regulated under the less stringent non-hazardous waste provisions, but there is no guarantee that the EPA or individual states will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non-hazardous wastes or categorize some non-hazardous wastes as hazardous in the future. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes, and waste compressor oils may be regulated as “solid waste.” The transportation of natural gas in pipelines may also generate some “hazardous wastes” that are subject to RCRA or comparable state law requirements.  We believe that our operations are currently in substantial compliance with the requirements of RCRA and related state and local laws and regulations.  More stringent regulation of natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes could increase the costs to manage and dispose of such wastes.
 CERCLA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the “Superfund” law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on persons who are considered under the statute to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” (but excluding petroleum) into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substance at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.  Our operations are, in many cases, conducted at properties that have been used for natural gas and oil exploitation and production for many years. Although we believe that we utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal.  We are not presently aware the need for us to respond to releases of hazardous substances that would impose costs that would be material to our financial condition. 
 OSHA and Chemical Reporting Regulations. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, or “OSHA,” and comparable state statutes.  On March 25, 2016, OSHA published its final Occupational Exposure to Respirable Crystalline Silica final rule, which imposes specific requirements to protect workers engaged in hydraulic fracturing.  81 Fed. Reg. 16,285.  The requirements of that final rule as it applies to hydraulic fracturing become effective June 23, 2018, except for the engineering controls component of the final rule, which has a compliance date of June 23, 2021.  We expect implementation of the rule to result in significant costs.  The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA, and similar state statutes require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.  If the sectors to which community-right-to-know or similar chemical inventory reporting are expanded, our regulatory burden could increase.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements and with other OSHA and comparable requirements.
 Hydrogen Sulfide. Exposure to gas containing high levels of hydrogen sulfide, referred to as sour gas, is harmful to humans and can result in death. We conduct our natural gas extraction activities in certain formations where hydrogen sulfide may be, or is known to be, present. We employ numerous safety precautions at our operations to ensure the safety of our employees. There are various 
 22


federal and state environmental and safety requirements for handling sour gas, and we are in substantial compliance with all such requirements.
 Drilling and Production. State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of natural gas and oil properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploitation while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from natural gas and oil wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of natural gas and oil we can produce from our or its wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax or impact fee with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction.
 State Regulation and Taxation of Drilling. The various states regulate the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. For example, Pennsylvania has imposed an impact fee on wells drilled into an unconventional formation, which includes the Marcellus Shale. The impact fee, which changes from year to year, is based on the average annual price of natural gas as determined by the NYMEX price, as reported by the Wall Street Journal for the last trading day of each calendar month. For example, based upon natural gas prices for 2015, the impact fee for qualifying unconventional horizontal wells spudded during 2015 was $45,300 per well, while the impact fee for unconventional vertical wells was $9,100 per well. The payment structure for the impact fee makes the fee due the year after an unconventional well is spudded, and the fee will continue for 15 years for an unconventional horizontal well and 10 years for an unconventional vertical well. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of natural gas resources.
 States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum limits on daily production allowable from natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amounts of natural gas that may be produced from our wells, the type of wells that may be drilled in the future in proximity to existing wells and to limit the number of wells or locations from which we can drill. Texas imposes a 7.5% tax on the market value of natural gas sold, 4.6% on the market value of condensate and oil produced and an oil field clean up regulatory fee of $0.000667 per Mcf of gas produced,  a regulatory tax of $.001875 and the oil field clean-up fee of $.00625 per barrel of crude. New Mexico imposes, among other taxes, a severance tax of up to 3.75% of the value of oil and gas produced, a conservation tax of up to 0.24% of the oil and gas sold, and a school emergency tax of up to 3.15% for oil and 4% for gas. Alabama imposes a production tax of up to 2% on oil or gas and a privilege tax of up to 8% on oil or gas. Oklahoma imposes a gross production tax of 7% per Bbl of oil, up to 7% per Mcf of natural gas and a petroleum excise tax of .095% on the gross production of oil and gas.
 The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to occupational safety, resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect upon our unitholders.
 Other Regulation of the Natural Gas and Oil Industry. The natural gas and oil industry is extensively regulated by federal, state and local authorities. Legislation affecting the natural gas and oil industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden on the industry. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the natural gas and oil industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the natural gas and oil industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in their industries with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
 Legislation continues to be introduced in Congress and development of regulations continues in the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies concerning the security of industrial facilities, including natural gas and oil facilities. Our operations may be subject to such laws and regulations. Presently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the potential costs to comply with any such facility security laws or regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial.
