 General Development of the Business 
 Development of the Business – Reporting Segments
 Our business is organized in four reporting segments — Healthcare; Energy; Financial Services Advisory and Compliance; and Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology.  Within these reporting segments we deliver consulting and advisory services and also provide technology-based solutions, data hosting and processing, and business process management services (which we refer to as Technology, Data & Process services herein).  We conduct business globally in certain areas across our reporting segments and are strategically focused on offering services to industries and clients facing transformational change and significant regulatory or legal pressures, including clients in the healthcare, energy and financial services industries. Since our inception, we have grown through selective acquisitions of businesses (which we consider inorganic growth), recruitment of employees (which we consider organic growth) and investments in technology to complement our consulting skills and enhance our service offerings.  These investments have enhanced or expanded existing expertise, added new services, broadened our geographic reach, and enhanced our market share.
 Our Healthcare segment provides consulting services and business process management services.  Clients of this segment include healthcare providers, payers and life sciences companies.  This segment has grown significantly through a combination of strategic acquisitions and recruitment of senior hires.  Our recruiting efforts within this segment have been focused on building multi-functional consulting teams that allow us to help our clients respond to the most significant issues impacting the healthcare industry today.  Our services include strategy consulting, operational and performance improvement consulting, product planning and commercialization expertise and business process management services.  The Cymetrix Corporation (“Cymetrix”) acquisition in 2014 and the RevenueMed, Inc. (“RevenueMed”) acquisition in 2015 greatly expanded our business process management service capabilities, extending those services to both hospitals and physician groups.  These acquisitions and related hiring complement our traditional consulting services, and provide us with more recurring revenue streams.  The term of contracts for business process management services is generally for multiple years.  Our business process management services are enabled by systems, data and technology that can also be leveraged across our other healthcare consulting service offerings.  In addition, the Healthcare segment continues to invest in analytical tools that help our clients manage resources and processes to improve their operations, patient care, and financial performance. 
 Our Energy segment’s professionals provide advisory solutions in business strategy and planning, distributed energy resources and renewables, energy efficiency and demand response and grid modernization transformation. Clients of this segment include utilities, governmental agencies, investors, manufacturers, oil and gas companies, and major corporations. The segment has grown through a combination of investments in hiring, solution development and acquisitions.  These investments have expanded our operations in key markets and geographies and over time have broadened our service offerings to more effectively help our clients respond to and capitalize on the global transformation occurring within the energy sector. We have also grown our benchmarking, data, and research services which now enable us to offer a broad array of market research capabilities (included within our Technology, Data & Process services). Additionally, the November 2016 acquisition of Ecofys Investments B.V. (“Ecofys”), an international consulting firm specializing in renewable energy and sustainability, has provided us with a European platform to augment our capabilities in energy policy, climate strategies, energy systems and markets, urban energy, and sustainability services.
 Our Financial Services Advisory and Compliance segment provides strategic, operational, valuation, risk management, investigative and compliance advisory services to clients primarily in the highly-regulated financial services industry, including major financial and insurance institutions. This segment also provides anti-corruption solutions and anti-money laundering consulting, litigation support, tax compliance and valuation services to clients in a broad variety of industries. From time to time clients seek the services of this segment to perform large scale, compliance-oriented engagements. The strategic, operational, valuation and risk management services within this segment have largely developed over time through the recruitment of senior hires.  Senior hiring

remains a key strategy to drive future growth for this segment.  We have also developed technology tools that enable our professionals to more efficiently identify compliance risks and streamline operational activities for our clients.
 Our Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology segment’s professional services include global dispute, accounting, regulatory, construction computer forensic expertise, valuation and economic analysis.  In addition to these capabilities, our professionals use technological tools to perform eDiscovery services and to deliver custom technology, data analytic and cyber-security solutions. Our clients principally include companies along with their in-house counsel and law firms, as well as accounting firms, corporate boards and government agencies.  Our professionals help clients across the globe through many complex business and legal matters.  These matters include finance, economics, forensic accounting, regulatory compliance, international arbitration, defective construction, computer system disruptions and other information security events.  Our clients operate within a broad range of industries which include but are not limited to financial services, healthcare, life sciences, energy, government and construction. We have built upon our service offerings within this segment and expanded our global and industry reach through investments in acquisitions, the recruitment of senior hires and the development of technology.  Our development of technology tools has enabled our professionals to deliver both flexible and scalable solutions to our clients.
 We operate globally across our reporting segments.  We have continued to build our international footprint to facilitate and expand our service offerings to clients outside of the United States (“U.S.”).  As global demand for our services has increased, we have established international offices to provide our clients with on-the-ground resources including within Europe, the Middle East, and Asia through hiring and acquisitions. 
 We continue to invest in technology infrastructure to support our evolving and expanding technology-based service offerings, and to allow us to deliver more scalable solutions to meet the changing demands of our clients.  
 We have supplemented these technology investments with employee-related initiatives to promote innovation and collaboration.  In addition, we have invested in development programs for our client-service professionals designed to improve sales effectiveness and collaboration across the organization.  We have also focused on other aspects of employee development, including talent management and mentoring programs.  Collectively, these innovation, collaboration, development and sales initiatives are intended to contribute to the professional development of our employees while enhancing our ability to grow the business organically.
 Human Capital Resources
At December 31, 2017, we had 6,130 employees. After adjusting total employees for part-time status and excluding project employees, we had 6,008 full-time equivalent (“FTE”) employees. These FTEs were comprised of the following: 

• | Client-service employees (“Client-Service FTE”) (related costs for these employees are recorded as cost of services before reimbursements)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 1,905 consulting employees (“Consulting FTE”) in businesses that deliver professional services. These individuals record time to client engagements. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 3,037 Technology, Data & Process employees (“Technology, Data & Process FTE”) in businesses that are comprised of technology-enabled professional services, including eDiscovery services, data analytics, business process management services, technology solutions, invoice and insurance claims processing, market research and benchmarking. While some of these individuals may record time to client engagements (in professional services engagements), many do not record time to specific engagements. Revenue generated by these engagements is generally recognized on a per unit basis. 1,608 of these Technology, Data & Process FTEs were based in India. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-billable employees (“Non-billable FTE”)
--+--------------------------------------------


o | 955 non-billable employees who are assigned to administrative and support functions, including office services, corporate functions, analytics and certain practice support functions. The majority of costs related to these employees is recorded in general and administrative expense while the costs directly relating to practice support functions are recorded as cost of services before reimbursements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we centralized resources previously organized as separate practice functions and leveraged our lower cost India footprint for certain activities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also had 111 project employees who perform client services on a contractual basis. Project employee levels vary from period to period based on staffing and resource requirements. The majority of costs related to these employees is recorded in cost of services before reimbursements.
 Our revenues are primarily generated from services performed by our client-service employees.  As a result, our success depends in large part on attracting, retaining and motivating talented, creative and experienced client-service employees at all levels 
 5

and across various geographies.  We employ internal recruiters, retain executive search firms, and utilize personal and business contacts. Our client-service employees are drawn from a variety of sources, including the industries we serve, accounting and other consulting organizations, and top-rated colleges and universities. Our client-service employees include, but are not limited to, PhDs, MDs, MBAs, JDs, CPAs, CFEs (certified fraud examiners), ASAs (accredited senior appraisers), engineers, nurses and former government officials. 
 In developing and growing our Technology, Data, & Process services, we have added employees supporting these businesses.  We recruit, retain, and manage many of our Technology, Data & Process employees differently from our consulting employees.  Particularly, in our business process management services, we add Technology, Data & Process employees through traditional recruitment, by transitioning client employees to become Navigant employees, or by subcontracting services from our clients.  Our demand for these resources may fluctuate depending on our clients’ needs and our ability to more efficiently perform our services by utilizing technology resources.  By managing these employees with our processes, centralizing their functions in our business centers, and leveraging proprietary technology to enable work streams, we are able to more efficiently and effectively deliver services.  We leverage our business centers not only to help us better manage our employees across work streams and projects but also to create opportunities for these employees to develop professionally by exposing them to new service areas and possibilities for promotion within the management teams at these locations.
 We seek to retain our employees by offering competitive compensation packages of base and incentive compensation (and in certain instances share-based compensation and retention incentives), attractive benefits and rewarding careers. We periodically review and adjust, if needed, our employees’ total compensation (including salaries, annual cash incentive compensation, other cash and equity incentives, and benefits) to ensure that it is competitive within the industry and is consistent with our level of performance. In addition to compensation, we promote numerous charitable, philanthropic, and social awareness programs that not only support our community, but also provide experiences for our employees to promote a collaborative and rewarding work environment. 
 We regularly evaluate employees and their productivity against future demand expectations and historical trends. From time to time, we may reduce or add resources in certain areas in an effort to align with changing demands. We may utilize project employees and engage independent contractors on certain engagements, which allow us to quickly adjust staffing in response to changing demand for our services.
 In connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions, our general policy is to obtain non-solicitation covenants from senior and some mid-level employees. Most of these covenants have restrictions that extend 12 months or more beyond the termination of employment. We utilize these contractual agreements and other agreements to protect our business interests, which can also reduce the risk of attrition and provide stability to our existing clients, staff and projects. 
 In our consulting businesses, our bill rates or fees charged to clients are tiered in accordance with the experience and position of our employees staffed on each matter. We monitor and adjust those bill rates or fees according to then-current market conditions for our service offerings and within the various industries we serve.  Similarly, pricing for our Technology, Data, & Process services is based upon the complexity of services delivered and markets served.
 Industry Sectors 
 We provide services to clients in industries undergoing substantial regulatory or structural change, with a primary focus on the energy, healthcare and financial services industries.  Our Disputes, Forensics and Legal Technology segment and Financial Services Advisory & Compliance segment both provide services across all three industries. Our legal and compliance-based service offerings are relevant to law firms and clients in many industries. In addition, we do work for governmental agencies.
Competition 
 The market for our services is highly competitive, highly fragmented and subject to rapid change. The market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise, including general management and information technology consulting firms, strategy firms, global accounting firms, business process and technology solution providers and other local, boutique, regional, national and international consulting firms. Many of these companies are international in scope and have larger teams of personnel and greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. In particular, the Big Four accounting firms (PwC, Deloitte, EY and KPMG) are highly competitive in the consulting industry. However, we believe that our industry focus, deep industry and operational expertise, reputation, global business model and broad range of service offerings enable us to compete effectively in the marketplace.
Developing Client Relationships  
 We market our services directly to corporate executives and senior management, corporate counsel, law firms, corporate boards, special committees and governmental agencies. We use a variety of business development and marketing channels to communicate directly with current and prospective clients, including on-site presentations, industry seminars, thought leadership and industry-
 6

specific articles. In addition, we have strengthened our market presence by developing our brand name and go-to-market strategy. New engagements are sought and won by our senior and mid-level employees working together across our reporting segments. We seek to leverage our client relationships in one business segment to cross-sell service offerings provided by other reporting segments. Clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow-on or complementary services. Our future performance will continue to depend upon our ability to win new engagements, attract and retain employees, develop and continue client relationships and maintain our reputation. 
 We believe our unique mix of deep industry expertise, combined with our scale, global presence, multi-disciplinary professionals and specialized service offerings, positions us to address our clients’ critical business needs. We continue to establish programs to facilitate collaborative product development and marketing efforts, and also to develop new, innovative and repeatable solutions for our clients. 
 Financial Information about our Business Segments
 See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 4 – Segment Information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements for discussion of total revenues, revenues before reimbursements, segment operating profit and total assets by business segment.  Certain areas within our reporting segments operate globally.

How Our Income is Derived 
 Our clients’ demand for our services ultimately drives our revenues and expenses. We derive our revenues from fees on services provided. The majority of our revenues is generated on a time and materials basis, though we also have engagements where fees are a fixed amount (either in total or for a period of time) or are on a per unit or subscription basis. We may also earn incremental revenues, in addition to hourly or fixed fees, that are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or outcomes. Variations in our quarterly or yearly revenues and resulting operating profit margins may occur depending on the timing of such contractual outcomes and our ability to consider these revenues earned and realized. Regardless of the terms of our engagements, our ability to earn fees is reliant on experience and expertise of our client-service employees. 
 Our most significant expense is client-service employee compensation, which includes salaries, incentive compensation, and amortization of sign-on and retention incentive payments, share-based compensation and benefits. Client-service employee compensation is included in cost of services before reimbursable expenses, in addition to technology costs, sales and marketing expenses and the direct costs of recruiting and training client-service employees. 
 Our most significant overhead expenses are administrative compensation and benefits and office-related expenses. Administrative compensation includes salaries, incentive compensation, share-based compensation and benefits for corporate management and administrative personnel that indirectly support client engagements. Office-related expenses primarily consist of rent for our offices. Other administrative costs include bad debt expense, marketing, technology, finance and human capital management. 
 Concentration of Revenues
 Revenues earned from our top 20 clients remained relatively steady at 27%, 27% and 25% of our total revenues for 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. No single client accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues during 2017, 2016 or 2015.  For further information on segment concentration see Item 7 - Management, Discussion and Analysis of Financial condition and Results of Operations – Segment Results below.
 Non-U.S. Operations 
 We operate globally and have offices outside the U.S. including in countries within Europe, the Middle East and Asia.  No country, other than the U.S., accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues during 2017, 2016 or 2015. Our non-U.S. subsidiaries, in the aggregate, represented approximately 10%, or $100.7 million, of our total revenues in 2017 compared to 9%, or $96.3 million, in 2016 and 9%, or $86.0 million, in 2015.  Revenues are allocated among our subsidiaries based on the respective entity or entities employing the personnel deployed on the engagements.  For further geographic information, see Note 4 – Segment Information to the notes to our consolidated financial statements.
