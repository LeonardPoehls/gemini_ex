Business Summary
 
Presently 3DX Industries is focused in the manufacturing sector through additive manufacturing and precision machining including 3D Metal printing. On December 18, 2013, the Company entered into an Equipment Purchase Agreement with Roger Janssen pursuant to which the Company purchased certain assets of a precision manufacturing company owned by Mr. Janssen with over 30 years in the industry. As of October 31, 2015 and 2014 respectively, the Company has generated gross profit of $332,142 and $Nil.
 The Company's manufacturing services will include additive manufacturing through its 3D Metal Printing and Process, and more traditional manufacturing methods using CNC precision machining processes. 3DX uses a binder jet additive manufacturing system for 3D Metal printing. The 3D Metal printing process materializes an object—or mold for an object—layer by layer out of powdered material, a chemical binder and a digital file. The process of metal printing allows for the creation, or materialization of Complex internal geometries, undercuts, angled passages and multi-piece assemblies with accuracy and less waste/environmental impact. The 3D Printing Process is highly accurate and capable of printing complex geometric parts.
 3DX also has a fully operational CNC machine shop in house consisting of fifteen various CNC machining centers including four fanuc robo-drills and numerous additional support equipment. Having a precision machining center under the same roof as our additive manufacturing systems allows for the complete one stop shop advantage we offer to our customers. 3DX will continually seek to expand the range of size and geometric complexity of the parts we can make using these processes The Company will continue to expand the variety of materials we are able to support and to identify additional manufacturing processes to which we can apply using the latest technology in order to better serve our client base.
 We have the ability to serve product developers worldwide who bring new ideas to market in the form of products, industrial and consumer, containing one or more custom parts and components. Many of these product developers use 3D CAD software to create digital models representing their custom part designs that are then used to create physical parts for prototyping, functional testing, market evaluation and/or production. Custom prototype parts play a critical role in the product development process, as they provide product developers with the ability to confirm their intended performance requirements and explore design alternatives.
 Additive manufacturing processes such as 3D Metal Printing can be used to quickly and efficiently produce a physical representation of a part or product. As technology in this area continues to evolve these parts are becoming more accurate and are able to meet the product developers' requirements for dimensional accuracy, cosmetics and material properties. There are instances where the use of more traditional manufacturing processes is required such as CNC Precision machining, in order to finalize the proto-type or production part. As a supplement to additive manufacturing, our CNC machining facility can be used to produce extreme precision, high-quality custom parts in metal or plastic. .
 The ability to meet our clients' needs both in the additive manufacturing sector and in the traditional precision machining arena will make 3DX Industries a leader in the manufacturing market. Having both processes in house is a significant time and cost saving advantage for 3DX's clients and will allow 3DX to integrate seamlessly into the metal printing market. 3DX is in a position to provide 3D Metal Printing, , Precision Tooling, 3D Rapid Proto-Typing, CNC Milling, Large Capacity Milling and Injection Mold Tooling.
 Competition
  5
 

We compete in a marketplace that is still primarily using conventional methods of product-making and prototype development and the market is currently limited to major manufacturing corporations mainly for in house product development. Our Company focus is on the design and manufacture of industrial and consumer products using both 3D metal printing technology and conventional precision machining. This is a massive market covering a range of industries from aviation, automotive, military and medical to consumer products, such as Jewelry and Fashion, as well as technology proto-type products and equipment. Using 3D metal printing technology, 3DX will have the capability to provide products and services to anyone requiring a manufactured part.
 
We believe that we have competitive strengths that position us favorably and will enable us to become a leader in our markets. We also believe that currently there are few "job shop" type manufacturers such as 3DX, capable of offering precision machining services, 3D Metal printing and 3D Composite printing. Having all of these manufacturing process's under one roof, and the expertise to integrate these process's we believe is an advantage to our customers and sets us apart from many of our competitors. However, our industry is evolving rapidly and other companies, including potentially larger and more established companies with developed technological capabilities, may begin to focus on our market. As reported by Grand View Research, "some key industry participants include Stratasys Inc., 3D Systems Corporation, Envisiontec GmbH, and Materialise NV. Intensifying competition is expected to result in lowered prices and increased shipments in the 3D printing market in the coming years. With products maturing rapidly, and iteratively enhancing technology reducing the gap between objects made using this form of printing and conventional methods, the market is expected to witness growing demand" through 2020. See generally Grand View Research, 3D Printing Market Analysis By Application (Automotive, Aerospace, Medical), By Raw Material (Polymers, Metals, Ceramic) And Segment Forecasts To 2020, published December 2013. These companies could more directly compete with us, along with our existing competitors, and both could also launch new products and services that we do not offer that may quickly gain market acceptance. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our ability to attract customers.
 
Industry Trends
 
3D Metal Printing is quickly becoming known throughout the manufacturing industry as "cutting edge" as 3D printers can manufacture everything from toys to automotive parts. Not to be confused with 3D Plastic Printing, which has been around for some time, 3D Metal printing is a new and innovative method that will change the way products are currently manufactured.
 
Manufacturing can be described as either additive or subtractive. Subtractive manufacturing, which includes milling and lathing, is comparable to sculpting wherein a manufacturer starts with a block of metal which is chipped and shaved away until a statue or engine part emerges. In comparison, additive manufacturing is conducted through the successive layering of materials, without the intervention of cutting, drilling, etc., which come together in order to make one metal piece. Additive manufacturing is a more efficient process that can be used to create designs that cannot be made using traditional techniques. This technology differs from mass production, which results in a large volume of identical parts at low cost. While the majority of the items produced using this process have been mock-ups and prototypes, producers are migrating towards manufacturing low-volume products to be used across various industries. The foremost advantage of this technology is the production of spare parts which cannot be easily obtained otherwise.
 
3D printing helps in the production of reliable products and lowers the need for iterative product development, thus decreasing the time-to-market of new products. Furthermore, the process alleviates the wastage of raw material as in the case of machining, since only the amount of material necessary for the part under printing is used. Although these techniques are in the process of change, much of manufacturing today still falls in the subtractive category.
