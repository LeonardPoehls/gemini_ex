ITEM 1. BUSINESS
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, "Milacron", "Company", "we", "us", "ours" refer to the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries except where the context requires otherwise. References to “Milacron LLC” refer to Milacron LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary.
Corporate History
Milacron Inc. began operations in 1860 in Cincinnati, Ohio as a screw, tap and die manufacturer, and expanded over the subsequent decades into a leading U.S. manufacturer of milling machinery and other equipment for metal processing. In the 1940s the company expanded into metalworking fluids and in the 1960s diversified into the growing market for plastic processing equipment by developing a line of injection molding equipment. After consistent growth from the 1960s through the 1990s, the plastic processing technology industry in North America was challenged in the 2001-2009 period by a reduction of spending by its customer base. As a result of significant legacy liabilities, excess production capacity and the 2009 recession, Milacron Inc. filed for bankruptcy protection in March 2009, resulting in the sale later that year of substantially all the assets and certain liabilities and equity interests of the company to newly formed Milacron Holdings Inc. (“MHI”). In April 2012 affiliates of CCMP Capital Advisors, LLC(collectively referred to as “CCMP”), together with certain members of our management, purchased the stock of MHI, forming the current Company (the “CCMP Acquisition”). Since 2012, Milacron has expanded its global manufacturing platform and product offering through acquisitions, including Mold-Masters Luxembourg Holdings S.à r.l. ("Mold-Masters") (the "Mold-Masters Acquisition") in March 2013, and in June 2015 the Company completed an initial public offering ("IPO") of its common stock.
Business Overview
Milacron is a global leader in the manufacture, distribution and service of highly engineered and customized systems within the plastic technology and processing industry. We are the only global company with a full-line product portfolio that includes hot runner systems, injection molding, blow molding and extrusion equipment. We maintain strong market positions across these products, as well as leading positions in process control systems, mold bases and components, maintenance, repair and operating ("MRO") supplies and fluid technology.
Milacron has strong brand recognition with products sold in over 100 countries across six continents and our established and market driven global footprint is well-positioned to benefit from continued robust industry growth in both developed and emerging markets. Our sales are geographically diversified with 54% in North America, 20% in Europe, 10% in China, 9% in India and 7% in the rest of the world for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our breadth of products, long history, and global reach have resulted in a large installed base of over 40,000 plastic processing machines and over 150,000 hot runner systems as of December 31, 2016.
We are headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio and have 5,843 employees worldwide. Principal manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, Canada, China, Germany, the Czech Republic and India. 
Operating Segments
The following is a summary of the product lines and markets served by our operating segments. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"), we have reported information about our three operating segments within Note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which can be found in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Annual Report.
Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies ("APPT")
Our APPT segment designs, manufactures and sells plastic processing equipment and systems, which include injection molding, blow molding, extrusion and auxiliary systems along with the related parts and service. We are the only full-line plastic equipment supplier with a significant offering across all three technologies in North America. We provide aftermarket service and support for our core plastic equipment business and are expanding our capabilities in the co-injection market. Our APPT segment has a diverse set of customers, including companies who serve in the consumer goods, packaging, electronics, medical, automotive and construction end markets. We believe our competitive strength in APPT is our ability to supply and support our customers through the entire life cycle of their equipment usage to deliver precision parts at the lowest cost for our customers.
Increased demand in the plastic processing machinery industry is expected to be driven by the overall expected rise in plastic processing, increasing equipment age and continuing advances in technology, such as the shift to higher efficiency and lower energy equipment, as plastic processors seek to reduce their operating costs and produce higher quality products. With 66% of APPT sales in North America, demand is also impacted by customers bringing manufacturing operations back to North America.

Capital expenditures in our APPT business were $30.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, of which approximately 24% related to capacity expansion for the production of plastic processing equipment. 
Melt Delivery and Control Systems ("MDCS")
Our MDCS segment designs, manufactures and sells highly-engineered, technically advanced hot runner and process control systems, mold bases and components, and sells MRO supplies for plastic processing operations. Hot runner systems are custom-designed for each product a customer manufactures on an injection molding machine. Our MDCS segment derives substantially all of its sales from recurring consumable products, parts and services. Hot runner systems are highly customized and replaced frequently due to design changes and innovation in customers’ end products, driving a one to five year replacement cycle. Recurring sales for our MDCS segment is supported by a large estimated installed base of more than 150,000 hot runner systems worldwide as of December 31, 2016.
Our MDCS segment serves a diverse group of global customers across the entire plastic processing value chain and manufacturing spectrum, including OEMs, molders and mold makers, in consumer goods, electronics, automotive, packaging and medical end markets. As injection molding processing technologies and material requirements evolve, our MDCS business is committed to partnering with its customers across the life cycle of a machine by leveraging its industry knowledge and engineering expertise to develop technologies that help its customers adapt and succeed. 
Consistent with historical periods, according to a June 2016 Interconnection Consulting report, the hot runner market is expected to grow faster than the overall global economy based on macroeconomic drivers involving product life cycles, demographics, technology conversion and greater use of plastic. Demand within the hot runner market is driven more by the frequency of product design changes and model refreshes than by end product volume, because hot runner systems are typically custom ordered for each new product mold, representing a critical factor in the market’s resiliency during economic cycles.
Capital expenditures in our MDCS segment were $24.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, of which 20% was related to capacity expansion in China for the production of hot runner systems. Approximately 45% of the capital expenditures within the MDCS segment were related to the purchase of two properties located in Ontario, Canada during the fourth quarter of 2016 which were previously leased.
Fluid Technologies ("Fluids")
Our Fluids segment is a global manufacturer of products that are used in a variety of metalworking processes such as cutting, grinding, stamping and forming and high speed machining. The technology we provide is used in diverse global end markets such as aerospace, medical, automotive, industrial components and machinery, bearings, munitions, packaging, job shops, and glass and mirror production. We are an established market leader in synthetic and semi-synthetic metalworking fluids and offer a full line of innovative metalworking products. Our fluid technologies are essential to improving manufacturing operations by providing more machine uptime, producing more parts of higher quality in a shorter time. We sell fluids with advanced technologies that extend tool life, reduce coolant usage and improve productivity in metal removal and metal forming operations.  Our fluids are often custom-designed to meet not only stringent performance, health, safety and environmental requirements based on innovative technology, but also for specific customer application and productivity needs.
Key Drivers of our Businesses
Our strategy is designed to maximize revenue from consumable products across the life of a machine, while offering plastic technology solutions to a broad customer base. Management estimates that the value of available consumables revenue across the life of a machine is one to four times the cost of a machine. This strategy is shifting our revenue and earnings model to be more heavily weighted towards consumables. The consumables portion of our APPT and MDCS segments consists of: (1) machine aftermarket parts and service which are required annually, (2) hot runner systems and mold bases which are required each time new plastic parts are designed and existing plastic parts are redesigned and (3) upgrades and overhauls which occur as customers decide to improve the performance or extend the life of their machines. Upon a customer’s decision to replace a machine, we can repurchase the existing machine and sell it as a certified pre-owned machine. All of our sales in our Fluids segment are considered to be consumable and, when combined with our APPT and MDCS consumable product lines, consumables accounted for 63% and 61% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We believe this percentage will increase as we capture more of our customers’ spend on consumable products through our lifecycle sales approach.

Milacron executes its strategy through selective initiatives that leverage our market position, geographic footprint and core competencies. Management expects, in the near term, profitability will be driven by both sales growth and margin expansion. Management expects that sales growth will come from underlying market growth in our key segments, geographic expansion of certain product lines and incremental share gain from new products. New products are focused on solidifying our current market position, expanding our addressable market and expanding the market through the introduction of technology that displaces other materials, primarily metal and glass. Operating margin expansion is expected to result from active organizational design and cost reduction initiatives focused on leveraging our geographic footprint that will allow us to consolidate manufacturing capacity, sales offices and call centers on a regional basis, and shift certain back-office functions from a decentralized local structure to a low-cost country global shared service center model.
Global population growth, coupled with continued urbanization, increased purchasing power and improved lifestyle in emerging markets has resulted in greater demand for a broad range of finished plastic products in many segments of the economy, including automotive, construction and consumer products. We believe our strong global presence positions us well to capture a portion of this growth. We have made significant investments in China and India in order to capitalize on the projected growth rates of the plastic business in these markets. We plan to continue to expand our manufacturing capabilities while also increasing our technical, marketing and sales efforts. In Central and South America, Southeast Asia and Eastern Europe, we are building capabilities and working on creating new relationships to support this growth. We also continue to strategically reorganize our manufacturing base in order to shift resources to high growth geographic markets.
Cost Reduction Initiatives
Since 2014, we have undertaken a number of organizational redesign and cost reduction initiatives to improve our cost structure and operating flexibility. This includes consolidating manufacturing and back office infrastructure in North America and Europe. We expect these organizational redesign and cost reduction initiatives to yield approximately $35 million of annual run-rate cost savings by the end of 2017, of which approximately $17 million has been achieved through 2016. Milacron incurred approximately $33 million and $22 million of one-time costs related to these projects during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
See “Item 1A. - Risk Factors - Our results also depend on the successful implementation of several additional strategic initiatives. We may not be able to implement these strategies successfully, on a timely basis, or at all.”
Customers
Our customers consist of many blue-chip and Fortune 500 companies including OEMs, molders and mold-makers. Our customer base covers a wide range of end market applications including packaging, automotive, medical, construction, consumer goods and electronics. We have long-standing relationships with our key customers, having served many of our top customers for over 30 years. In 2016, our largest customer accounted for only 1.4% of total sales and our top 10 largest customers accounted for only 5.1% of total sales. 
Backlog
Our backlog of unfilled orders increased to $225.6 million at December 31, 2016 from $211.6 million at December 31, 2015. Excluding $4.4 million of unfavorable effects of foreign currency movements, backlog increased 8.7% compared to December 31, 2015. The increase in our backlog was primarily a result of strength in the North American and European equipment businesses. All of our backlog is expected to be filled within the next twelve months and there are no seasonal or other aspects of the backlog that would impact filling the orders. 
Sales and Marketing 
Our sales have an increasingly global focus, while maintaining regional flavor through our international brands. We have also focused our sales on key accounts, implementing corporate buying agreements with select customers while targeting several others. Our sales of aftermarket services and parts and our MDCS products benefit from our extensive global installed base of equipment, creating an advantage over our competitors in securing a wide base of customers for our high-margin offerings.
Our direct sales efforts have resulted in a more concentrated effort to promote our value-add products which may include machine upgrades to promote improved performance or cost savings for our customers. Our sales force also acts as the conduit between the customer and our team of engineers, working closely with the customer to design a product that meets their specifications. We have also created a Strategic Accounts Management sales leadership team to drive relationships with major plastic processors across our different product lines. We believe this will enhance our leadership position in the injection molding equipment market and continue to drive share gains for the overall business.

Our Fluids business sells its products primarily through its direct sales and distribution networks. In connection with most accounts, the segment supports its fluids with service and analysis, but generally does not enter into contracts for chemical management. We continuously work with customers to reformulate our products to best serve their individual needs.
We do not typically have long-term supply agreements with customers and terms are generally negotiated on an individual order basis. We typically require customers purchasing injection molding, blow molding or extrusion machines to make a 10% to 40% down payment when an order is placed, often with a series of additional progress payments required prior to shipment which helps ensure collection of the full purchase price. Pricing is set at the time of order, typically on a customized basis for each product. Raw materials and component purchases are managed based on new machine order trends, allowing us to reduce the risk of changes in raw material and components pricing.
Raw Materials
Steel, which we source both directly and indirectly through our component suppliers, is the primary material used in our APPT and MDCS products. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge our commodity price risk and currently do not have a significant number of long-term supply contracts with key suppliers. In order to secure our supply needs, we have developed a global network of reliable, low-cost suppliers. 
Within Fluids, many of the raw materials are derivatives of petroleum or natural gas. As a result, fluctuations in commodity-based pricing may impact the cost of these materials. We manage the impact of raw material cost increases through sales pricing adjustments, but we may be impacted by a delay in implementing these adjustments throughout our distribution network. In addition, due to the specialty nature of our products, some of our raw materials have few sources, and we may be impacted by disruptions to supply. Where possible, we seek alternative sources and, in some situations, we are able to reformulate product with alternative materials without impacting performance, environmental, or health and safety features.
Intellectual Property 
Milacron considers its intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, and trademarks, to be of significant value to its business as a whole. We currently hold approximately 1,000 issued and pending patents worldwide.  In addition to our patent portfolio we also have a number of trade secrets and know how relating to our MDCS products, designs, and manufacturing techniques as well as proprietary chemical formulations used in our Fluids business. All of which, when combined, serve an important role in protecting us and our customers’ competitive positions by building barriers to entry and increasing switching costs. We develop new intellectual property on an ongoing basis and consider all of our intellectual property to be valuable. We are committed to protecting it through internal policies and training, confidentiality agreements with employees, customers and suppliers, as well as filing and obtaining patents for innovative new products and processes including product modifications and improvements.
Research and Development
We continually invest in research and development to improve the performance of existing products, to bring new products to market and to remain at the technological forefront of the plastic processing, melt delivery and controls and metalworking fluids industries. We have design engineers in all major production regions worldwide, including a global design center in India and research and development centers in the United States and Canada. We invested $21.1 million, $21.8 million and $24.3 million in research and development for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Competition
Our competition varies within each segment based on the nature of our products, the industries we serve and geographical locations. 
Advanced Plastic Processing Technologies
In general, plastic equipment competitors are large companies that compete with us on a global basis. Some are divisions of larger companies, and some offer an extensive range of plastic processing machines. Our main machine competitors are Arburg (Germany), Battenfeld Cincinnati (Austria, which includes American Maplan (United States)), Bekum (Germany), Davis Standard (United States), Engel (Austria), Graham Engineering (United States), Haitian International Holdings (China), Husky (Canada), Krauss Maffei (Germany, which includes Netstal Maschinen AG (Switzerland)), Sumitomo Heavy Industries (Japan) and Toshiba (Japan).

Melt Delivery and Control Systems
The hot runner and mold industry is highly fragmented. The majority of the industry competes on regional and niche levels, with only a few truly global players. Our main competitors in the MDCS market are Husky (Canada), Yudo (Korea), Synventive (United States), Manner (Germany), Ewikon (Germany), Incoe (United States), Thermoplay (Italy), Gamaflux (United States) and HRS Flow (Italy) for the hot runner market and LKM (China), Futaba (Japan), Hasco (Germany), Meusburger (Austria), Misumi (Japan, which includes PCS (United States)) and Progressive (United States) for the moldbase market.
Fluid Technologies
Our Fluids segment competes with other suppliers of industrial fluids such as Castrol Industrial (U.K.), FUCHS Petrolub (Germany), Quaker Chemical (United States) and Houghton/DA Stuart (United States), which was acquired by Gulf Oil of India. However, because we specialize in high-performance synthetic (water-based) and semi-synthetic fluids, we believe there are few players who compete directly with our Fluids business. 
Seasonal Variation in Business 
Generally, the highest volume of our equipment sales occurs in our fourth quarter due in large part to the timing of customers' capital spending programs. Accordingly, first quarter equipment sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers' capital spending programs. There is less seasonal variation in business within the MDCS and Fluids segments due to the consumable nature of those products.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, Milacron had 5,843 employees. Approximately 600 of our European employees belong to work councils or are otherwise subject to labor agreements. 
Environmental and Regulatory Matters
We are subject to laws, regulations and permitting requirements relating to the protection of the environment and public and workplace health and safety, including those governing discharges of pollutants to the air and water, the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the clean-up of contaminated sites and the protection of employee health and safety. Failure to comply with, or imposition of liability under, such laws and regulations could result in significant costs, including clean-up costs, fines and sanctions, and claims by third parties for property damage and personal injury. Some environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability on present and former owners and operators of facilities and sites for contamination at those locations. Many of our facilities and sites have an extended history of industrial use. From time to time, soil or groundwater contamination has been detected at some of our sites. We are currently, and have in the past been, engaged in investigation and remediation of these facilities. We do not currently believe that any future remediation or compliance costs, or claims of government or other parties, involving environmental, health or safety matters would have a material adverse effect on our business. However, it is not possible to quantify with certainty the potential impact of actions relating to environmental, health and safety matters, particularly remediation and other compliance efforts that our subsidiaries may undertake in the future, due to uncertainties about the status of laws, regulations, technology and information related to individual sites.
