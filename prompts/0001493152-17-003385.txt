ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
Bagger Dave’s Burger Tavern, Inc. (“Bagger Dave’s” or the “Company”) was originally a wholly owned subsidiary of Diversified Restaurant Holdings, Inc. (“DRH”). DRH is a fully reporting public company that owns and operates 64 Buffalo Wild Wings Restaurants. On August 4, 2016, DRH announced that its Board of Directors unanimously approved a plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of its Bagger Dave’s business. Specifically, DRH contributed its 100% owned entity, AMC Burgers, LLC and certain real estate entities into Bagger Dave's Burger Tavern, Inc., a newly created Nevada corporation ("Bagger Dave's" or "Bagger"), which was then spun-off into a stand-alone, publicly-traded company on the over-the-counter exchange. In connection with the Spin-Off, DRH contributed to Bagger certain assets, liabilities, and employees related to its Bagger Dave's businesses. Intercompany balances due to/from DRH, which included amounts from sales, were contributed to equity. Additionally, DRH contributed $2 million in cash to Bagger to provide working capital for Bagger’s operations and is a guarantor for certain of Bagger's lease obligations.
 
DRH decided to spin off Bagger Dave’s after considering all reasonable strategic and structural alternatives because of the disparity between its two brands Buffalo Wild Wings (“BWW”) as franchisee and Burger Dave’s. The management teams of Bagger Dave’s and DRH agreed that the nature of the two concepts varied greatly, and that each would be more valuable and operate more effectively independently of each other. Bagger Dave’s is an original concept that was developed by the management team of DRH. In contrast to operating a franchised concept like BWW, it has no development restrictions and it has the flexibility to enhance brand attributes such as logos, trade dress and restaurant design, change its menu offerings and improve its operational model in an effort to better align with guest expectations without the approval of a franchisor. To manage these functions effectively, specific resources are required that are not necessary for a franchisee. For example, menu development, purchasing and brand marketing are critical to the success of Bagger Dave’s, but not necessary for a BWW franchisee since these function are managed by the franchisor. In addition, with only 18 locations, Bagger Dave’s is a start-up brand with high growth potential while BWW is a mature brand and as a franchisee, DRH’s organic growth potential is limited to its development rights.


Our headquarters are located at 807 W. Front St., Suite B, Traverse City, Michigan 49684. We can also be found on the Internet at www.baggerdaves.com.
 
DRH originated the Bagger Dave’s concept with the first restaurant opening in January 2008 in Berkley, Michigan. On January 9, 2017, the Company closed one of its locations in Grand Rapids Michigan. As of the date of this filing, there are 18 Bagger Dave’s restaurants in operation, 15 in Michigan, one in Indiana and two in Ohio. Bagger Dave’s has the right to the Bagger Dave’s concept and has rights to franchise the concept in Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Wisconsin. We do not intend to pursue franchise development at this time.


Launched in January, 2008, Bagger Dave’s is a unique, full-service, ultra-casual restaurant and bar concept. We have worked to create a concept that provides a warm, inviting and entertaining atmosphere through a friendly and memorable guest experience.


Bagger Dave’s specializes in locally-sourced, never-frozen prime rib recipe burgers, all-natural lean turkey burgers, hand-cut fries, locally crafted beers on draft, hand-dipped milk shakes, salads, black bean turkey chili and much more, delivered in a warm, hip atmosphere with friendly full service. The concept differentiates itself from other full-service casual dining establishments by the absence of walk-in freezers and microwaves, substantiating our fresh food offerings. The concept focuses on local flair of the city by showcasing historical photos of the town in which the restaurant resides. Running above the dining room and bar, the concept features an electric train; a feature which was the genesis of Bagger Dave’s logo.

The guiding principle of the Bagger Dave’s brand is to delight our guests through fresh food offerings, exceptional service, and an entertaining atmosphere. The menu focuses on burgers, craft beers and our Belgian-style, fresh-cut fries and is accompanied by a variety of sides, salads, select wines and a unique adult-beverage menu.
 
Our Burgers
 
Our burgers are offered with a choice of five proteins; USDA, fresh premium prime-rib recipe beef (offered in regular or small size patties), Michigan ground turkey, farm-raised, cage-free grilled chicken breasts, Mahi-Mahi and black bean patties. Guests can choose from our list of chef-created burgers including the Train Wreck Burger ®, the Blues Burger ® and the Tuscan Chicken sandwich. Guests can also choose to “Create Your Own” which allows them to customize their experience by choosing from a variety of proteins, buns, cheeses, house-recipe sauces presenting bold and exciting new flavors, premium toppings such as bacon, egg, guacamole, and an array of complimentary toppings, such as sautéed mushrooms and onions, barbecue sauce, and other standard condiments.
Our Fries and Sweet Potato Chips
 
Our fries are cut in-house from a rare, domestically grown Northeastern potato variety and cooked in a cottonseed soybean specialty oil using a six-step Belgian-style process producing a fry reminiscent of those served at community fairs. Dave’s Sweet Potato Chips® are another Bagger Dave’s specialty which uses North Carolina grown fresh-cut premium sweet potatoes. Guests can choose from our house created signature dipping sauces to complement their order entrée and sides. Since our fryers are dedicated to potatoes and there are no breaded, frozen products offered at Bagger Dave’s, our potato fries and sweet potato chips are gluten free and trans-fat free.
Our Craft Beers, Wines and Specialty Cocktails
 
We offer up to 12 locally crafted beers that are hand selected and seasonally rotated based on customer feedback, popularity and uniqueness. We strive to provide our guests offerings that most other restaurants cannot by leveraging our relationships with local craft brewers. We serve our craft beers by the glass or, for guests who prefer to take some home, we will fill up a growler. Similarly, we provide a select offering of red and white wines at different price points which can be paired with our burgers. All of our wines are offered by the glass or by the bottle.
 
Other adult beverages include our hand-dipped adult shakes including the PB & Maple Bourbon Shake, the Brandy Alexander and the locally inspired Hummer which consists of vanilla ice cream, light rum and coffee liqueur. We also have an offering of signature drinks unique to Bagger Dave’s which utilizes our craft soda, wines and full range of liquor offerings to produce cocktails such as the Red Sky Sangria, Buzz Button Margarita (topped with an edible, mouth-numbing flower known as the Szechuan button) and Strawberry Mule. We also have a meaningful selection of bourbons which includes a combination of well-known premium brands, small-batch labels and locally distilled spirits.
 
Other Menu Offerings
 
To further customize their experience, guests can choose from a selection of starters or sides including our Amazingly Delicious Turkey Black Bean Chili®, fresh, made from scratch Twisted Mac ‘N’ Cheese, Crispy Fried Artichokes (gluten free), Sloppy Dave’s Fries and Korean BBQ Naan Crisp. Beyond burger offerings, Bagger Dave’s offers other entrées such as an Awesome Grilled Cheese sandwich, a California BLT sandwich, Sloppy Dave’s sandwich and a variety of unique, entrée-sized chopped salads with a selection of proteins including a grilled chicken breast or Korean BBQ beef. Bagger Dave’s also offers hand-dipped ice cream and milkshakes with a variety of free mix-ins.

Growth Strategy
 
We plan to drive top and bottom line growth through the achievement of positive same-store-sales in comparable restaurant locations and the successful implementation of cost reduction initiatives at the restaurant and support level. We closed 11 underperforming locations in 2015 and another one on January 9, 2017 where we determined that sustainable top and bottom line growth would be difficult to achieve, allowing us to focus on those locations where our growth opportunities are the strongest.


As our initiatives to improve our current restaurants take effect, we expect to be in a position to drive additional future volume growth using a disciplined process based on a thorough market knowledge of the prospective locations. While we do not anticipate development of any new restaurant locations during 2017, we anticipate that growth through new restaurant development may become viable in future years.

We intend to drive same-store-sales growth in all of our locations through the execution of local, traffic-driven marketing and advertising strategies, continued support of the community through sponsorship programs and local charities, selective price increases to certain menu items, and delivery of quality food and service in a clean and modernized environment. One of our guiding principles is that a happy team member translates to a happy guest. A happy guest drives repeat sales and word-of-mouth referrals; two key factors that are fundamental and directly support our local marketing strategy.
 
We plan to improve our margins through a number of initiatives including: enhanced methods to manage cost of sales and hourly labor with use of technology and improved application of standards; consolidation of vendors, leveraging our scale to obtain lower product pricing and distribution costs; working with all service vendors to obtain competitive pricing, optimal frequency of service and productive billing which includes minimizing the number of invoices and securing highly-predictable periodic pricing; selective price increases to certain menu items.
 
Site Selection
 
We consider the real estate selection process to be a key factor in the long-term success of each restaurant, and as such, we devote a significant amount of time and effort into identifying and evaluating each potential location. We consider several metrics to assess the strength of each proposed site, including daytime population, accessibility, population density, visibility and neighboring retailers.
 
For our restaurants, we prefer a strong end-cap position, which is a premier, highly visible corner positioned in a well-anchored shopping center or lifestyle entertainment center. We also seek to develop freestanding locations, if the opportunity meets our site selection criteria, along with specific economic thresholds.
 
Restaurant Operations
 
We believe in retaining high quality restaurant managers, valuing our team members and providing fast, friendly service to our guests are key to our continued success. In order to retain our unique culture as we grow, we devote substantial resources to identifying, selecting, and training our restaurant-level team members. We typically have six in-restaurant trainers at each existing location who provide both front- and back-of-house training on site. We also have a seven-week training program for our restaurant managers, which consists of an average of four weeks of restaurant training and three weeks of cultural training. During their training, managers observe our established restaurants’ operations and guest interactions. We believe our focus on guest-centric training is a core aspect of our Company and reinforces our mission to delight our guests.
Management and Staffing
 
The core values that define our corporate culture are cleanliness, service and organization. Our restaurants are generally staffed with one managing partner and up to three assistant managers depending on the sales volume of the restaurant. The managing partner is responsible for day-to-day operations and for maintaining the standards of quality and performance that define our corporate culture. We utilize regional managing partners to oversee our managing partners and supervise the operation of our restaurants, including the continuing development of each restaurant’s management team. Through regular visits to the restaurants and constant communication with the management team, the regional managing partners ensure adherence to all aspects of our concept, strategy and standards of quality.
Training, Development, and Recruiting
 
We believe that successful restaurant operations, guest satisfaction, quality, and cleanliness begin with the team member - a key component of our strategy. We pride ourselves on facilitating a well-organized, thorough, hands-on training program. In 2013, after nine months of developing our new training program with the help of industry experts, we introduced our Hospitality Excellence Academy (“HEA”). To ensure success of our organization, HEA was designed to foster our culture of excellence by cultivating the leaders of tomorrow.

We offer an incentive program that we believe is very competitive in the restaurant industry. Aside from competitive base salaries and benefits, management is incentivized with a performance-based bonus program. We also provide group health, dental, and vision insurance, a company-sponsored 401(k) plan with a discretionary matching contribution feature, a tuition reimbursement program, a referral bonus program and opportunities for career advancement.
 
We emphasize growth from within the organization as much as possible, giving our team members the opportunity to develop and advance. We believe this philosophy helps build a strong, loyal management team with high team member retention rates, giving us an advantage over our competitors. We strive for a balance of internal promotion and external hiring.
 
Restaurants
 
Our typical Bagger Dave’s restaurants range in size from 3,800 to 6,100 square feet, with a historical square foot average of about 4,300. We plan major renovations every seven to ten years. Given the age and condition of our current restaurants along with many recent updates to older locations, we do not anticipate any major capital outlays over the next three years.
Quality Control and Purchasing
 
We strive to maintain high quality standards, protecting our food supply at all times.
 
We seek to obtain the highest quality ingredients, products, and supplies from reliable sources at competitive prices.
 
To maximize our purchasing efficiencies, we negotiate, when available, fixed-price contracts (usually for a one-year period) or, where appropriate, commodity-price contracts.
 
Marketing and Advertising
 
We plan to spend up to 3.0% of all restaurant sales on marketing and advertising. In addition, charitable donations and local community sponsorships help us develop local public relations and are a major component of our marketing efforts. We support programs that build traffic at the grass-roots level. We also participate in numerous local restaurant marketing events throughout the communities we serve.


The advertising and marketing plan relies on local media, menu specials, promotions, and community events. We are also building our marketing reach with our current guests by telling our story through social media and Bagger Bucks loyalty rewards program. We attribute a large part of our growth to word-of-mouth.
 
Information Systems and Technology
 
Enhancing the security of our financial data and other personal information remains a high priority for us. We continue to innovate and modernize our technology infrastructure to provide improved efficiency, control and security. Our ability to accept credit cards as payment in our restaurants and for online gift card orders depends on us remaining compliant with standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council (“PCI”). The standards set by PCI contain compliance guidelines and standards with regard to our security surrounding the physical and electronic storage, processing and transmission of individual cardholder data. We maintain security measures that are designed to protect and prevent unauthorized access to such information.

We also believe that technology can provide a competitive advantage and enable our strategy for growth through efficient restaurant operations, information analysis and ease and speed of guest service. We have a standard point-of-sale system in our restaurants that is integrated into our corporate office through a web-based above-store business intelligence reporting and analysis tool. Our systems are designed to improve operating efficiencies, enable rapid analysis of marketing and financial information and improve administrative productivity. In 2012, we launched online ordering and recently launched table side ordering devices that allow servers to create orders and send orders to the kitchen while standing with the customer. We believe the table-side ordering will help decrease serving time and increase customer turnover and satisfaction since these devices also accommodate credit card swipes so that the card never has to leave the customer’s sight.
 
We are constantly assessing new technologies to improve operations, back-office processes and overall guest experience. This includes the implementation of mobile payment options, advanced programming of kitchen display units, tablet-based wait-listing applications and a mobile-based loyalty program.
 
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is highly competitive. We believe we compete primarily with national casual dining and quick-casual establishments. Competition is expected to remain intense with respect to price, service, location, concept and type and quality of food. There is also competition for real estate sites, qualified management personnel and hourly restaurant staff. Many of our competitors have been in existence longer than we have and may be better established in markets where we are currently located or may, in the future, be located. Accordingly, we strive to continually improve our restaurants, maintain high quality standards and treat our guests in a manner that encourages them to return. We believe our pricing communicates value in a comfortable, welcoming atmosphere that provides full service to the guest.
Trademarks, Service Marks, and Trade Secrets
 
Our domestically-registered trademarks and service marks include Bagger Dave’s Burger Tavern®, Sloppy Dave’s BBQ®, Railhouse Burger Sauce®, The Blues Burger®, Train Wreck Burger®, Dave’s Sweet Potato Chips®, Meaningless Free Toppings®, Sloppy Dave’s Fries® and Amazingly Delicious Turkey Black Bean Chili®. We place considerable value on our trademarks, service marks, trade secrets and other proprietary rights and believe they are important to our brand-building efforts and the marketing of our Bagger Dave’s restaurant concept. We intend to actively enforce and defend our intellectual property, however, we cannot predict whether the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of these rights or the use by others of restaurant features based upon or similar to our concepts. Although we believe we have sufficient protections concerning our trademarks and service marks, we may face claims of infringement that could interfere with our ability to market our restaurants and promote our brand.
Government Regulations
 
The restaurant industry is subject to numerous federal, state, and local governmental regulations, including those relating to the preparation and sale of food and alcoholic beverages, sanitation, public health, nutrition labeling requirements, fire codes, zoning, and building requirements and to periodic review by state and municipal authorities for areas in which the restaurants are located. Each restaurant requires appropriate licenses from regulatory authorities allowing it to sell beer, wine and liquor and each restaurant requires food service licenses from local health authorities. The majority of our licenses to sell alcoholic beverages must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, including violation by us or our team members of any law or regulation pertaining to alcoholic beverage control, such as those regulating the minimum age of team members or patrons who may serve or be served alcoholic beverages, the serving of alcoholic beverages to visibly intoxicated patrons, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control. In order to reduce this risk, restaurant team members are trained in standardized operating procedures designed to assure compliance with all applicable codes and regulations. We have not encountered any material problems relating to alcoholic beverage licenses or permits to date.

We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with team members. Our failure to comply with federal, state and local employment laws and regulations may subject us to losses and harm our brands. The laws and regulations govern such matters as: wage and hour requirements; workers’ compensation insurance; unemployment and other taxes; working and safety conditions; overtime; and citizenship and immigration status. Significant additional government-imposed regulations under the Fair Labor Standards Act and similar laws related to minimum wages, overtime, rest breaks, paid leaves of absence, and mandated health benefits may also impact the performance of our operations. In addition, team member claims based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wages, hour requirements and payments to team members who receive gratuities, may divert financial and management resources and adversely affect operations. The losses that may be incurred as a result of any violation of such governmental regulations by the Company are difficult to quantify. To our knowledge, we are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state and local laws affecting our business.
 
The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“PPACA”) was enacted in March 2010. On January 1, 2015, the employer portion of the PPACA went into effect. In addition to being required to provide full-time employees with medical insurance that meets minimum value and affordability standards, the employer mandate requires employers to provide covered employees and the Internal Revenue Service with specific reportable benefit information. The Company’s 2015 and 2016 medical plans have been offered to all full-time employees and meets the minimum value and affordability requirements of the PPACA, and the Company believes that it will be able to meet the informational reporting requirements of PPACA when due.
 
Compliance with these laws and regulations may lead to increased costs and operational complexity and may increase our exposure to governmental investigations or litigation. We may also be subject, in certain states, to “dram shop” statutes, which generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person. We carry liquor liability coverage as part of our existing comprehensive general liability insurance, which we believe is consistent with coverage carried by other companies in the restaurant industry of similar size and scope of operations. Even though we carry liquor liability insurance, a judgment against us under a “dram shop” statute in excess of our liability coverage could have a material adverse effect on our operations.
