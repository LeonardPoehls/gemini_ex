Item 1. Business 
Overview
 
Bang Holdings Corp wholly owns two subsidiaries, Bang Digital Media, a cannabis focused digital media company, and Bang Vapor, an e-juice company.
 
Bang Digital Media is the hub for all ‘cannabusiness’ related advertising, content creation, technology and marketing. It consists of two divisions, the multi-platform 4TTnetwork, and a network of social media influencers that we call the Green Monkey Network.
 
The 4TTnetwork is comprised primarily of specifically targeted audiences. These are 4TwentyToday, VaporBang, and 4TT/V which cross the social media platforms of Facebook, Twitter, Massroots, Instagram, SnapChat and YouTube.
 
4TwentyToday is a digital, multi-platform channel that enables us to target advertising for Bang Holdings products and services across social media platforms. We currently have in excess of 625,000 users of our network, with a steady growth rate of around three thousand subscribers per week. By continuing to create targeted, quality content for this community on a daily basis 4TwentyToday has, for example, created one of the most actively engaged marijuana pages on Facebook. This has built high levels of trust and goodwill in the community, which will be convertible to revenues once we have reached a critical mass of users.
 
Using the same skillset, we are developing VaporBang – a digital, multi-platform community for vaping enthusiasts. At more than 88,000 strong, ours is the largest vaping community on Facebook. This enabled us to carry out beta testing of product to this targeted audience and to develop strong recognition for the Bang brand.
 
Our most successful post on Facebook in 2016 had 15.6 million views, leading to 1,832,507 “reactions,” 610,000 “shares,” and 164,000 “comments.” The post was created to build upon our social media footprint related to our business, not specifically towards our products.
 
The ‘Green Monkey Network’ is a network of social media influencers who are open to working as ambassadors in the marijuana industry. These influencers expand the Bang network by more than 12 million users.
 
Ultimately, the KPI (Key Performance Indicator) of Bang Digital Media is in the direct and expanded growth of our networks. By continuing to grow 4TwentyToday and the ‘Green Monkey Network’ to 100 million users we will have the digital reach to propel marijuana-friendly brands into the spotlight.
 
Bang Vapor is a marketer of vaporizer pens and E-liquid for the vaporizer industry, through the use of a razor and razor blade model. “Electronic cigarettes” or “e-cigs” and “vaporizers” are battery-powered products that enable users to inhale nicotine vapor without smoke, tar, ash or carbon monoxide.
 
Bang Vapor completed its soft launch in the first quarter of 2016. Due to costs involved in meeting the new deeming regulations imposed by the FDA on E-liquid Bang Vapor will not be sustainable or profitable moving forward. During the first quarter of 2017, all Bang Vapor digital property - i.e. Facebook and other social media pages, created content, subscriber lists, etc. have been transferred to Bang Digital Media.

Marketing and Sales
 
The Company’s marketing strategy is a multi-pronged approach that includes viral marketing strategies, celebrity & social influencer endorsements, affiliate marketing, conventional online advertising and attending tradeshows. During 2016, we spent approximately $100,000 on the creation and growth of Bang Digital Media, the primary social media footprint of Bang Holdings Corp.  We employ only one full-time employee who handles all of the Company's social media accounts, which currently has approximately 1,600,000 subscribers across various social media platforms, including, but not limited to, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and MassRoots.
 
Viral Marketing: The marketing team aims to produce “hits” through the release of content developed by the company on 4TwentyToday’s “YouTube” and “Facebook” pages, other social media, and our website. A portion of our marketing budget will be allocated to developing viral videos produced by our CEO, Steve Berke. Mr. Berke has had significant successes popularizing YouTube videos in the past, including, “Pot Shop,” which generated around 14.5 million views. In addition to Mr. Berke’s YouTube successes, his two campaigns for mayor of Miami Beach received national coverage, including the cover of the New York Times, the cover of the Huffington Post and a 6-page spread in Maxim magazine. Mr. Berke was named one of the top eight comedians to ever run for office by ABC News. We intend to capitalize on his popularity, and reputation as a leading advocate for medical marijuana, through 4TwentyToday, a channel on YouTube and Facebook to promote the Company. Our research has shown there are three distinct user groups in the vapor space; the hardcore vapor, ex-smokers/smokers wanting to replace their nicotine addiction, and marijuana users.  Marijuana enthusiasts are familiar with vaping technology and are a niche market that is easy for us to reach and promote our flavors and products to with limited competition from other competitors in the vaporizer and e-liquid space.
 
Celebrity and Social Influencer Endorsements: We will build partnerships with influential social media personalities and celebrities in several key genres to serve as brand ambassadors. Each brand ambassador will have their own affiliate website to sell Bang products and make commissions off of each sale. By giving a unique platform to social media influencers to monetize their followings, Bang Vapor will be able to build brand awareness and employ an army of influencers to sell product in order to become a leading brand in the e-cig/vaporizer space.
Size of Market
 
According to the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association, there are approximately 3.5 million e-cigarette users. And while, according to Wells Fargo Securities, the total tobacco volume is decreasing by around 2% per year, the smokeless tobacco volume increased by around 5%. Additionally, Wells Fargo analysts expect the e-cigarette annual growth to be over 20%. (Source:www.ecigarette-politics.com/files/WF-DallasMarch2014.ppt)
 
According to research carried out by the Pew Research Center, 49 percent of Americans admit to having used marijuana, and some 18.9 million have done so within the last calendar month. (Source: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/04/14/6-facts-about-marijuana/)

According to industry research the annual legal marijuana market is expected to grow to $22 billion within four years. (Source: The State of Legal Marijuna Markets, 3rd Edition by Arcview Market Research)
 
There is significant market crossover within the communities Bang has built online, as many marijuana users are vaporizing their pot.
 
Competition
 
In the marijuana related digital media space, there is only one reasonable comparable that is publicly traded, Massroots. However, as opposed to their model, which resides on a platform that serves a more narrow demographic, Bang Digital Media creates multi-platform channels that directly serve the marijuana user, but can also be served to a far greater number of marijuana-friendly users. This allows for a far greater and more sustainable growth rate.
Employees and Independent Contractors
 
As of April 10, 2017, we have four (4) full time employees and one independent contractor. We have no part time employees.
 
Over time, we may be required to hire employees or engage independent contractors in order to execute various projects necessary to grow and develop the business. These decisions will be made by our Officers and Directors, if and when appropriate.
