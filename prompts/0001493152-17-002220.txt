ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Business Overview
 
We provide unsecured online consumer loans under the brand name “Mr. Amazing Loans” via our website and online application portal at www.mramazingloans.com. We started our business and opened our first office in Las Vegas, Nevada in 2010. We currently offer $5,000 and $10,000 unsecured consumer loans that mature in five years. We are currently licensed and originating direct consumer loans in 19 states – Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia. We provide loans to residents of these states through our online application portal, with all loans originated, processed and serviced out of our centralized Las Vegas head office, which eliminates the need for physical offices in all of these states.
 
Our strategy is to address the market needs of underbanked consumers that tend to be ignored by mainstream institutional credit providers such as banks and credit unions, and charged excessive fees and interest by fringe lenders such as payday lenders. In the current global environment, we believe there is a substantial need and opportunity for the small personal loans we offer.
 
All of our personal loans are offered at prevailing statutory rates with fixed affordable repayments and no prepayment penalties. We conduct full underwriting on all applications including credit checks and review of bank statements to ensure customers have capacity to repay their loans, and have designed our loans to help customers reach a stronger financial position.
 
We plan to continue expanding our state coverage in 2017 by obtaining state lending licenses in six additional states, increasing our coverage to 25 states and approximately 240 million people. As soon as we receive new state licenses we will add to our existing online marketing and distribution channels which we expect will generate immediate business at a customer acquisition cost within our desired budget.
 
Recent Developments
 
On January 5, 2017, we commenced a tender offer to purchase up to all outstanding shares of common stock of OneMain Holdings Inc., a NYSE-listed company; provided, however, that we are willing to accept any number of shares of OneMain common stock, even if such shares, in the aggregate, constitute less than a majority of OneMain’s outstanding common stock (the “OneMain Tender Offer”). The OneMain Tender Offer was scheduled to expire at 12:00 a.m., Eastern time, on February 6, 2017, unless extended. On February 7, 2017, we extended the OneMain Tender Offer such that it will expire at 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on Monday, March 27, 2017, unless it is extended or earlier terminated. Complete terms and conditions of the OneMain Tender Offer are set forth in the Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO and in the registration statement on Form S-4, each of which we originally filed with the SEC on January 5, 2017, and each of which as may be amended. This description and other information in this annual report on Form 10-K regarding the OneMain Tender Offer is included in this annual report on Form 10-K solely for informational purposes. Nothing in this annual report on Form 10-K should be construed as an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of an offer to buy, any shares in connection with the OneMain Tender Offer.
 
In January 2017, our Board of Directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the open market repurchase of up to $2,000,000 of our common stock. Purchases under the program are authorized through December 31, 2017. No shares will be repurchased under the program until the OneMain Tender Offer has closed or has been terminated.
 
In December 2016, we launched a private offering of up to $10 million aggregate principal amount of our 12% senior unsecured notes due December 31, 2026 (the “Notes”), on a self-underwritten basis. As of March 3, 2016, no Notes have been sold. There can be no assurance that the private offering of Notes will be completed. We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering to increase the size of our loan book. This description and other information in this annual report on Form 10-K regarding the Notes offering is included in this annual report on Form 10-K solely for informational purposes. Nothing in this annual report on Form 10-K should be construed as an offer to sell, nor the solicitation of an offer to buy, any Notes.

Our strategy is to address the funding needs of “under-banked” consumers that tend to be ignored by mainstream institutional credit providers such as traditional banks and credit unions, and charged high advanced fees and interest by fringe lenders such as payday lenders. In the current economic environment, we believe there is a substantial need for the small personal loans that we offer.
 
All of our personal loans are offered at less than prevailing maximum statutory rates with fixed repayments and no prepayment penalties. We conduct full underwriting on all applications, including credit checks and review of bank statements to ensure customers have the capacity to repay their loans.
 
We plan to continue expanding our state coverage by obtaining state lending licenses in an additional six states, increasing our coverage to 25 states in 2017. As soon as we receive new state licenses, we are prepared to re-focus our existing online marketing and distribution channel resources to those states, which we expect will continue to lower our average customer acquisition cost.
 
We have a history of reporting recurring losses and have not generated positive net cash flows from operations. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we generated revenue of $2,135,046 and $1,835,165, respectively, and had net losses of $4,728,869 and $5,698,198, respectively.
 
We were organized as a Florida corporation on January 21, 1999, originally under the name Interact Technologies, Inc. In February 2013, we changed our name to IEG Holdings Corporation. We have two wholly-owned subsidiaries, IEC, our U.S. operating entity that holds all of our state licenses, leases, employee contracts and other operating and administrative assets, and IEC SPV, a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity that holds our U.S. loan receivables.
 
Market
 
We operate in the consumer finance industry serving the large and growing population of consumers who have limited access to credit from banks, credit card companies and other lenders. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 7.7% (1 in 13) of households in the United States were unbanked in 2013. This proportion represented nearly 9.6 million households. According to the Center for Financial Services December 2015 report, the rapid rise of short term credit, which grew 37% from 2012 to 2014, while single payment credit grew only 0.1% over the same period, is starkly apparent. With anticipated regulatory changes likely to alter the feasibility of offering loans due in one lump sum, many companies are investing more heavily in installment-based credit products, while new players are seeking to upend the economics of small-dollar loans through online channels and alternative underwriting. The strong marketing and new account approval rates of subprime credit cards have also provided consumers with increased access to funds available on a short-term basis. Together, these shifts in the consumer lending industry suggest that total revenue for short term credit products, sized at $29 billion in 2014, will soon outpace that of single payment credit products, sized at $38 billion for the same year. In fact, short term credit products already generate nearly twice as much annual revenue as single payment credit products.
 
Installment lending to non-prime consumers is one of the most highly fragmented sectors of the consumer finance industry. We are a state-licensed Internet-based personal loan company serving in the consumer installment lending industry. Our online lending platform provides the distribution network to efficiently address this growing market of consumers without the significant costs and overhead associated with an extensive branch network. We believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the significant growth and expansion opportunity created by the continued shift of consumers to online services, such as online banking and in our case online personal loans.
 
We are currently licensed and providing loans online to residents of Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia, with plans to continue to expand across the United States by acquiring additional state lending licenses. The following is a breakdown of our cumulative loan origination amounts in each licensed state for our current active loan portfolio as at December 31, 2016:
 

State | Origination Volume ($) | | Current Principal ($) | | Number of Loans

Business Strategy
 
Our business strategy is to lower the cost of providing consumer loans by leveraging our online lending platform and distribution network, while continuing to obtain additional state licenses to enable further loan book growth and portfolio diversification. Our strategy includes a number of key elements:

● | State-Licensed Model: Our state-licensed business model is a key element of our business strategy. We are currently licensed in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia and plan to continue expanding across the United States by acquiring additional state lending licenses. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Online Distribution: We launched online lending in March 2013 and commenced online advertising in July 2013. Upon fulfillment of state regulatory requirements, we received approval from regulators in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia to operate solely online in these states. This allows us to fully service all 19 states from our centralized Las Vegas headquarters, which we believe is a key competitive advantage over brick and mortar lenders. 
● | Cost-Effective Customer Acquisition: Our customer acquisition costs have been reduced since we launched online lending and marketing. 
● | Continue to Grow Loan Book: Total cumulative loan originations as of December 31, 2016 have increased 154% to $14,109,023 since our January 1, 2015 total of $5,549,023. This growth in lending is attributable to launching online lending and joint venturing with a number of new marketing partners, however, such past growth is not necessarily indicative or predictive of our future results of operation. We also plan to obtain an additional six state lending licenses in 2017. 
● | Strategic Acquisitions: We have reviewed, and continue to review, opportunities to expand our business through acquisition or merger in the consumer finance sector. We are pursuing opportunities that provide synergies with our existing business and specifically target potential acquisitions that are significantly accretive to net asset value and/or provide significant revenue growth opportunities via a minority or majority shareholding. 

Competitive Strengths
 
We believe our competitive strengths are:
 

● | Large Market and Scope for Growth: Large personal and payday loan market in the United States presents opportunity for significant growth and expansion. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Regulation: We are materially compliant with state lending licenses in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia, and are well positioned for current and future regulatory changes due to ongoing compliance and conservative business model. 
● | Customer Proposition: Our unsecured $5,000 and $10,000 installment loans are all offered over five years and feature affordable weekly repayments. Rates range from 19.9% - 29.9% APR which make us a low cost alternative to payday loans which have an average APR of over 400%.

-


● | Online Distribution: Special approval has been granted by the Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah and Virginia regulators to operate our business without a physical office location in each state. As a result, we have closed offices in Arizona, Illinois and Florida and moved to full online loan distribution, enabling us to offer loans to residents in all 19 of our licensed states from our Las Vegas headquarters. We plan to apply for the same regulatory approval for six additional states in 2017. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Customer Acquisition: We launched online advertising in July 2013 with positive results from search engine cost per click advertising and online lead generation. In addition, we engaged a number of new marketing partners in 2014, 2015 and 2016, including online lead generators and direct mail. All of these avenues provide opportunities for strong growth at low customer acquisition costs. 
● | Barriers to Entry: We believe that state licensure acts as a barrier to entry into our segment of the consumer loan market. We are strongly positioned with approval to operate under 19 state licenses from one centralized head office. 

Products
 
We currently provide $5,000 and $10,000 online consumer loans unsecured over a five-year term with rates ranging from 19.9% to 29.9% annual percentage rate. Our current loan portfolio also includes loans remaining from our previous product offerings which were $2,000 to $10,000 loans unsecured over a three- to five-year term at 18.0% to 29.9%.
 
Our personal loan products are fully amortizing, fixed rate, unsecured installment loans and all loans are offered at prevailing statutory rates, with our standard loan product being a 29.9% interest rate and annual percentage rate, fully amortizing, five-year unsecured personal loan. The variations from this standard loan product in certain states is due to individual state requirements and to comply with our state lending licenses; for example, Florida requires a blended rate which caps the maximum rate on a $5,000 loan at 24%.
 
The following is a breakdown of loan terms and interest rates for each currently licensed state:

We commenced originating personal loans online in July 2013. Prior to that, we provided loans to customers via our office network, which comprised one office in each state as required by state licensing regulations. Our online loan origination platform now means that a qualifying customer can obtain a loan from us without having to come into an office location. We have maintained our full underwriting processes, identity verifications and fraud checks to ensure that online customers are verified to the same degree that customers were when they obtained a loan in an office. We expect our website and application portal, www.mramazingloans.com, to be a key driver of customer conversions and loan book growth.
 
The following graphs depict our monthly loan origination values from January 2013 through December 2016 and our yearly revenue for 2013 through 2016:

Customer Acquisition
 
Since launching online lending in July 2013, our marketing efforts have been focused on online customer acquisition. We saw significant increases in loan applications and inquiries as a result of search engine advertising and commenced banner advertising, remarketing and search engine optimization in 2014. We commenced online video advertising in 2015. We have also engaged numerous online lead generators who provide personal loan leads on a daily basis with a combination of cost per funded loan and cost per application expense. We are continuing to develop relationships with additional lead generation partners to drive further growth. We also supplement our online marketing efforts with traditional direct mail advertising.
Loan Underwriting
 
Applicants apply online providing income, employment and banking information in the pre-approval process. The pre-approval process utilizes a soft credit pull, electronic review of 60-90 day banking history and if the applicant successfully meets the minimum pre-approval criteria they are invited to proceed. Upon accepting the conditional pre-approval, the applicant authorizes a full credit report from Experian and verification of employment. Applicants are provided disclosures and privacy statements during this process.
 
Once the application has been transmitted, a full credit report is obtained and the automated preliminary underwriting is completed based on stated income and expense data obtained from the credit report. The automated preliminary underwriting includes, but is not limited to, credit score, number of credit inquiries, outstanding unpaid collections, length of credit history, length of employment, debt to income ratio and internet protocol, or “IP,” address to verify location of applicant.
 
The second step in the underwriting process for those applicants that are conditionally approved based on stated income, credit score, number of credit inquires, outstanding unpaid collections, length of credit history and length of employments, debt to income ratio, IP address, is to validate the actual income (current pay invoices and prior year W-2) and a review of the 60-90 day read-only statements from the applicant’s primary bank for satisfactory money management. During this process the pay invoices are reviewed for garnishments, hardship loans and other legal liens allowed on wages. Bank statements are transmitted electronically directly to underwriting to ensure the integrity of the information. This process allows the underwriter to review the money management of every applicant and to assess the ability to take on additional expense. It also provides the underwriter with additional debt not found on traditional credit reports such as payday loans, title loans and IRS payments that could affect the ability of the applicant to assume additional debt. If all conditions are met as it relates to money management, maximum debt to income, minimum length of employment, and satisfactory credit history the underwriter recommends final approval and request to draw documents.
 
The final step in the underwriting process is to present the completed file to the Chief Credit Officer for final approval and order to draw documents. The file is then reviewed for any exceptions to policy, compliance with the underwriting policies and to ensure the loan system is reflective of what has been presented by the underwriter. The applicant is then approved for a $5,000 or $10,000 loan based on income, ability to repay and credit strength. Rate and loan terms are fixed (fixed rate and fixed term can vary based on regulatory state maximums) as we do not utilize risk based variable pricing models eliminating the risk of discrimination and other compliance related issues.
 
The closing process is completed by contacting the applicant, communicating the lending decision and reviewing loan terms and conditions. Upon acceptance an identity check using Experian’s Precise Identity Screening is completed and if successful loan documents are emailed for electronic signature, and returned to us for final verifications, document review and funding.
 
Servicing
 
All of our loan servicing is handled in our centralized Las Vegas head office. All servicing and collection activity is conducted and documented using an industry standard loan service software system which handles and records all records and transactions of loan originations, loan servicing, collections and reporting.
 
Our primary third-party servicing arrangement is with CyberRidge, LLC, a company that licenses its consumer loan software to us. We use this software for our loan management system. We have a servicing agreement with CyberRidge, LLC which renews automatically unless either party notifies the other, at least 60 days prior to the end of the renewal term. We believe the risk of termination is low as we are a paying customer of CyberRidge, LLC and have maintained a positive working relationship since 2012. In the unlikely event that the agreement was terminated, we believe 60 days’ notice would be sufficient to find a suitable replacement with minimal disruption to our business.

Regulation
 
Consumer loans in the United States are regulated at both the federal and state level. National oversight is provided by the Federal Trade Commission, which enforces the following credit laws that protect consumers’ rights to get, use and maintain credit:

● | The Truth in Lending Act promotes the informed use of consumer credit, by requiring disclosures about its terms and cost to standardize the manner in which costs associated with borrowing are calculated and disclosed. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The Fair Credit Reporting Act promotes the accuracy and privacy of information in the files of the nation’s credit reporting companies. If a company denies an application, under the Fair Credit Reporting Act consumers have the right to the name and address of the credit reporting company they contacted, provided the denial was based on information given by the credit reporting company. 
● | The Equal Opportunity Credit Act prohibits credit discrimination on the basis of sex, race, marital status, religion, national origin, age, or receipt of public assistance. Creditors may ask for this information (except religion) in certain situations, but they may not use it to discriminate against consumers when deciding whether to grant you credit. 
● | The Fair Credit Billing Act and Electronic Fund Transfer Act establish procedures for resolving mistakes on credit billing and electronic fund transfer account statements. 
● | The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”) applies to personal, family, and household debts. The FDCPA prohibits debt collectors from engaging in unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices while collecting these debts. 

 
In addition, the CFPB, a federal oversight body organized in connection with the Dodd-Frank Act has broad authority over our business. The CFPB is a new agency which commenced operations in 2011, and there continues to be uncertainty as to how the agency’s actions or the actions of any other new agency could impact our business or that of our issuing banks. The CFPB has the authority to write regulations under federal consumer financial protection laws, such as the Truth in Lending Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and to enforce those laws against and examine financial institutions for compliance. The CFPB is authorized to prevent “unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices” through its regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority. To assist in its enforcement, the CFPB maintains an online complaint system that allows consumers to log complaints with respect to various consumer finance products, including the loan products we facilitate. This system could inform future CFPB decisions with respect to its regulatory, enforcement or examination focus.
 
We are subject to the CFPB’s jurisdiction, including its enforcement authority, as a servicer and acquirer of consumer credit. The CFPB may request reports concerning our organization, business conduct, markets and activities. The CFPB may also conduct on-site examinations of our business on a periodic basis if the CFPB were to determine, through its complaint system, that we were engaging in activities that pose risks to consumers.
 
There continues to be uncertainty as to how the CFPB’s strategies and priorities, including in both its examination and enforcement processes, will impact our businesses and our results of operations going forward. Actions by the CFPB could result in requirements to alter or cease offering affected loan products and services, making them less attractive and restricting our ability to offer them.
 
Consumer loans are also regulated at the state level, and the regulatory requirements vary between states. We are licensed in the following states:
 

● | Alabama (Consumer Credit License, No. MC 22125, which commenced on August 13, 2015)

Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive environment. Several personal consumer loan companies operate in the United States. Our competitors include:
 

● | large, publicly-traded, state-licensed personal loan companies, 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | peer-to-peer lending companies, such as Lending Club and Prosper, 
● | online personal loan companies, such as Avant, 
● | “brick and mortar” personal loan companies, including those that have implemented websites to facilitate online lending, and 
● | payday lenders, tribal lenders and other online consumer loan companies. 

 
We believe we compete based on affordable repayment terms, favorable interest rates and low overhead due to on-line distribution. We believe that in the future we will face increased competition from these companies as we expand our operations. Most of the entities against which we compete, or may compete, are larger and have greater financial resources than us. No assurance can be given that increased competition will not have an adverse effect on our company.
 
Office Location
 
Our executive office, which also serves as our centralized operational headquarters and Nevada branch, is located at 6160 West Tropicana Ave, Suite E-13, Las Vegas, Nevada 89103. This facility occupies a total of approximately 2,125 square feet under a lease that expires in September 2017. Our annual rental cost for this facility is approximately $56,313, plus a proportionate share of operating expenses of approximately $12,112 annually. We believe this facility is adequate for our current and near term future needs due to our online strategy and our ability to operate 7 days a week with unrestricted hours of operation from this location.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had five full-time employees and one part-time employee. None of our employees is represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Corporate History
 
We were organized as a Florida corporation on January 21, 1999, under the name Interact Technologies, Inc. (“Interact”). Interact was formed for the purpose of acquiring certain medical technology. On February 18, 1999, we changed our name to Fairhaven Technologies, Inc. (“Fairhaven”). Fairhaven’s business plan continued to involve the acquisition of certain medical technology. By June 1999, Fairhaven abandoned its business plan and had no operations until December 2001. On December 14, 2001, we changed our name to Ideal Accents, Inc. Ideal Accents, Inc. was engaged primarily in the business of accessorizing cars and trucks at the new vehicle dealer level. Ideal Accents, Inc. ceased operations in 2005. IEC, our wholly owned subsidiary, commenced operations in 2010 and in February 2013, we changed our name to IEG Holdings Corporation.
 
In 2005, Mr. Mathieson, our Chief Executive Officer and sole director, founded IEG in Sydney, Australia. IEG launched the Mr. Amazing Loans business in the United States via IEGC in 2010. On January 28, 2013, IEGC entered into a stock exchange agreement (the “Stock Exchange Agreement”) among IEGC, its sole stockholder, IEG, and our company. Under the terms of the Stock Exchange Agreement, we agreed to acquire a 100% interest in IEGC for 272,447 shares of our common stock after giving effect to a 1-for-6 reverse stock split (also adjusted for the 1-for-100 reverse stock split that took effect June 17, 2015 and the net 1-for-10 reverse stock split that was effective on October 27, 2016). On February 14, 2013, we filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Florida which had the effect of:
 

● | changing our name from Ideal Accents, Inc. to IEG Holdings Corporation, 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | increasing the number of shares of our authorized common stock to 1,000,000,000, $0.001 par value, 
● | creating 50,000,000 shares of “blank-check” preferred stock, and 
● | effecting the Reverse Stock Split pursuant to the terms of the Stock Exchange Agreement. 

 
FINRA approved the amendment to our articles of incorporation, as amended, on March 11, 2013.

On March 13, 2013, we completed the acquisition of IEGC under the terms of the Stock Exchange Agreement and issued to IEG 272,447 shares of our common stock after giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split whereby we acquired a 100% interest in IEGC. The stock exchange agreement between IEGC, IEG and IEG Holdings resulted in a reverse acquisition with a public shell, with IEGC being the accounting acquirer. IEG Holdings issued 90 shares of its common stock to the stockholders of IEG (IEG transferred its ownership in IEGC to its stockholders, which is why the shares were issued to the ultimate stockholders of IEG rather than to IEG itself) for each share of IEGC, in exchange for 100% ownership interest in IEGC. We determined that IEGC was the accounting acquirer because of the following facts and circumstances:
 

1. | After consummation of the transaction, the ultimate stockholders of IEGC own 99.1% of the outstanding shares of IEG Holdings; 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | The board of directors of IEG Holdings immediately after the transaction is comprised exclusively of former directors of IEGC; and 
3. | The operations of IEG Holdings immediately after the transaction are those of IEGC. 

 
After completing the Stock Exchange Agreement and terminating all Australian operations via the sale of the remaining loan book, IEG entered into voluntary liquidation on June 25, 2014. In August 2015, IEGC assigned all of its tangible and intangible assets to IEG Holdings and IEGC was dissolved.
 
On May 1, 2015, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Florida. The amendment was approved by FINRA, and became effective, on June 17, 2015. The articles of amendment effected (i) a 1-for-100 reverse stock split, and (ii) an increase in our authorized capital stock from 2,550,000,000 shares to 3,050,000,000 shares, of which 3,000,000,000 shares are common stock and 50,000,000 are preferred stock.
 
On September 10, 2015, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, with the Secretary of State of Florida. The articles of amendment had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock, from 1,333/100,000 (0.01333) to 2,666/100,000 (0.02666) shares of common stock for each Series H preferred share, to account for the Company’s offering to existing stockholders of the Company commenced August 3, 2015.

On March 22, 2016, we filed articles of amendment to our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended. The amendment had the effect, among other things, of adjusting the conversion ratio of the Series H preferred stock from 0.1 shares to 0.2 shares of common stock for each Series H preferred share, to account for our offering to existing stockholders commenced March 16, 2016.
 
Effective April 1, 2016, we amended our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, in order to effect a 1-for-100 reverse stock split. No fractional shares were issued. Rather, we paid stockholders who would have received a fractional share an amount equal to the average closing price per share of our common stock on the OTCQB, averaged over the period of 30 consecutive calendar days ending on (and including) April 1, 2016. In addition, after the reverse stock split was effected on April 1, 2016, we amended our amended and restated articles of incorporation, as amended, to effect (i) a 100-for-1 forward stock split, and (ii) a reduction in the number of authorized shares of common stock from 3 billion to 200 million.

Legal Proceedings
 
We are not a party to any pending or threatened litigation.
 
Emerging Growth Company Status
 
We are an “emerging growth company” as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We intend to take advantage of all of these exemptions.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards, and delay compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies. We have elected to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We could be an emerging growth company until the last day of the first fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our first common equity offering, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier if our annual revenues exceed $1.0 billion, if we issue more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt in any three-year period or if we become a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act.
