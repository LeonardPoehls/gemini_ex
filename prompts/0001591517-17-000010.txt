For a discussion of certain business dispositions and acquisitions we completed in 2016, see Note 3, "Acquisitions and Dispositions," to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.
The Separation
On March 6, 2013, Time Warner Inc. ("Time Warner") announced plans for the complete legal and structural separation of its magazine publishing and related business from Time Warner (the "Spin-Off"). On June 6, 2014 (the "Distribution 
4

Date"), the Spin-Off was completed by way of a pro rata dividend of Time Inc. shares held by Time Warner to its stockholders as of May 23, 2014 based on a distribution ratio of one share of Time Inc. common stock for every eight shares of Time Warner common stock held (the "Distribution"). Following the Spin-Off, Time Warner stockholders became the owners of 100% of the outstanding shares of common stock of Time Inc. and Time Inc. began operating as an independent, publicly-traded company with its common stock trading on The New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol "TIME". In connection with the Spin-Off, we and Time Warner entered into the Separation and Distribution Agreement dated June 4, 2014 (the "Separation and Distribution Agreement") and certain other related agreements which govern our relationship with Time Warner following the Spin-Off. (See Note 16, "Related Party Transactions and Relationship with Time Warner," to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K.)
Our Strategy
For several years, Time Inc. has been making the transition from print publisher to multi-platform media company. We have migrated away from a decentralized holding company model of siloed brands to integrated platforms built for scale. We now operate as a set of platforms across editorial, advertising, consumer marketing and technology that we believe will enable us to more effectively pursue our key growth drivers, as well as efficiencies.
Our platform strategy is aimed at leveraging the power of our world-class brands and content, large-scale and growing audiences, advertising capabilities, advanced data/targeting and subscription marketing to drive monetization of our advertising, subscription and other revenues.
The key components of our platform strategy are as follows:

• | Content and edit platform


• | Advertising platform


• | Consumer marketing and revenue platform


• | Expanding revenues through brand extensions

Content and Edit Platform. Time Inc. is a premier global multi-platform media company with particular strengths in the United States and the United Kingdom. Our editorial operation is pursuing opportunities to extend our content across platforms and create new monetization opportunities from our audiences and for our advertisers.

• | We have made significant changes to our editorial and production operations to position ourselves for cross-platform success. In 2016, we centralized our U.S. editorial reporting structure and created 10 digital desks covering topics where we have particular strength as a company, namely Celebrity, Entertainment, Food, Health, Home, News, Sports, Style & Beauty, Technology and Travel & Luxury. We believe the benefits of centralization and our platform approach to content creation include content sharing, implementing best practices across the organization and enterprise-level content initiatives.


• | We believe our content platform positions us for success in digital video because of our trusted and well-known brands, existing infrastructure (including state-of-the-art facilities that allow for lower-cost video production) and marketing/promotional reach across print and digital media. In 2016, Time Inc.’s digital video grew significantly, with 4.6 billion video starts, up nearly 150% from 2015, while our digital video unique visitors grew 82% year-over-year.


• | We have unified our content management system to more rapidly create, share and syndicate content across our entire U.S. portfolio and develop product features. In 2016, we consolidated multiple U.S. content management systems down to two core platforms that will work as one. We believe that this platform approach will enable us to more effectively and efficiently implement changes and share content more rapidly across our digital sites. For example, we can now quickly and efficiently introduce new ad tech capabilities, ad units and e-commerce features across all sites.

Advertising Platform. We believe we occupy a differentiated space in the media and advertising world by bringing together our world-class storytelling capabilities, large-scale and growing audiences, native advertising capabilities and advanced people-based targeting through our proprietary dataset. In 2016, we made key structural changes, invested in our core advertising sales organization, and we acquired new capabilities with the acquisition of Viant, a people-based advertising technology company. As we move forward, we believe our key growth drivers will be native advertising and brand content, people-based targeting, video and programmatic sales.

Our platform approach to advertising offers an "end-to-end" solution for marketers through the path-to-purchase cycle, along with unique return on investment measurement capabilities.

• | In 2016, we centralized our advertising sales reporting structure in the U.S. We established a category sales approach that offers cross-brand solutions to advertisers on a category-by-category basis (e.g., pharmaceutical, food, autos). These actions are transforming the way our advertising sales organization goes to market; it is enabling us to have more expansive and deeper relationships with our advertiser and agency partners, helping us leverage our scale and the full suite of our advertising products, brands and data/targeting capabilities.


• | In 2016, we also launched The Foundry, our creative lab and content studio located in Brooklyn, New York, and doubled our native advertising revenues from the previous year. Our native studio has added substantial native capabilities and has been well received by our clients.


• | In early 2017, we acquired Adelphic Inc., a mobile-first self-serve demand-side platform. With this acquisition, Viant is enabled to provide advertisers with a self-serve buying process through Adelphic's mobile-first, cross-channel programmatic advertising platform. Adelphic’s self-service media planning and execution tools, including its ability to reach consumers across all screens and formats, are expected to bolster Viant’s people-based data and analytics offerings.

Consumer Marketing and Revenue Platform. Time Inc. is one of the largest subscription marketers in the U.S. media industry, with approximately 30 million active subscribers. We see opportunities to leverage our consumer marketing engine to drive sales of other products and services.

• | In 2016, we realigned our consumer marketing organization to integrate functions across our brands. This platform approach is aimed at creating efficiencies and providing support across our key growth drivers.


• | We are also working to transform our data architecture to enable us to gain a cross-portfolio, 360-degree view of our customers and prospects. By better understanding their needs and wants, we believe we can create stickier relationships and can introduce them to other non-print products and services.


• | We have been introducing advanced analytical techniques and methods including new marketing technology—this includes consumer-centric micro-targeting and segmentation.


• | In 2016, we acquired Bizrate Insights Inc. ("Bizrate Insights"), a consumer data company that specializes in developing consumer insights by extending its online and mobile surveys across partner sites. The acquisition of Bizrate Insights is expected to enable Time Inc. to enhance and expand our data capabilities, and generate incremental consumer subscription revenue.

Expanding Revenues Through Brand Extensions. Given the power and diversity of our brand portfolio, we see opportunities to continue to invest in and build out adjacencies and other extensions of our brands into non-print and non-advertising revenues. Areas of focus include high-margin brand licensing revenues, TV and long-form video, and live media.

• | We believe brand licensing is an area with large-scale potential. Two of our larger licensing programs are Real Simple’s partnership with Bed, Bath & Beyond, where we currently have hundreds of products, and our partnership with Dillard’s, which carries a line of Southern Living products. We intend to focus more closely on this potentially high-margin area, particularly by pursuing opportunities across more of our brands.


• | In over-the-top (OTT) video, in 2016, we launched the People/Entertainment Weekly Network (PEN). We have programmed more than 100 hours of original content since launch, and in 2017 we expect to expand PEN’s programming slate by producing over 300 hours of original content.


• | In the area of television production, in early 2017, we launched Time Inc. Productions which has over 75 projects in production and development. We believe there is strong and growing demand from broadcast, cable and digital networks for distinctive original content. Our strong brands and editorial content provide source material that we believe is well-suited for TV programming. We estimate that we will produce nearly 40 hours of long-form programming across our portfolio in 2017 for 11 different networks, up from five hours in 2014.


• | In live media, Time Inc. expects to host or manage many celebrated events in 2017, including the Essence Festival, Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Conferences and the Food & Wine Classic. In addition to launching new events,

6

we intend to expand certain of these franchises internationally; we extended the Essence Festival to Durban, South Africa in 2016 and we expect to do so again in 2017. In 2016, we hosted the Fortune/Time Global Forum in Rome in partnership with the Vatican, and in late 2017, our Fortune brand is planning to bring the next Fortune Global Forum to Guangzhou, China.
How We Generate Revenues
The sale of advertising generates approximately half of our Revenues. Circulation (or the sale of magazines to consumers) generates approximately one-third of our Revenues. The balance of our Revenues is generated by our other operations related to magazine publishing and live events. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Consolidated Results of Operations." A significant majority of our Revenues are generated in the United States. See Note 18, "Segment Information," to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K for certain financial information by geographic area. 
Advertising Revenues
We derive approximately half our Revenues from the sale of advertising, primarily from our print magazines, digital platforms and marketing services. In 2016, according to PIB, our U.S. magazines accounted for 25.7% of the total U.S. advertising revenues generated across the industry by consumer magazines, excluding newspaper supplements. Our U.S. magazines accounted for 24.9% and 24.6% of such total industry revenues in 2015 and 2014, respectively. In 2016, People, Sports Illustrated and InStyle were ranked 1, 5 and 6, respectively, among all U.S. magazines in U.S. advertising revenues, and we had six of the top 25 magazines based on the same measure. We have generated significant digital advertising growth and we continue to invest in technology that will allow us to more effectively manage the delivery of both content and advertisements to our audiences. As mentioned above, in March 2016, we acquired certain assets of Viant, a business that specializes in data-driven, people-based marketing. With Viant’s platform, we are combining our premium content, subscriber and visitor data, and advertising inventory with first-party data and targeting capabilities to bring substantial value to our advertisers and increase our revenue. In addition, we are growing video extensions of our brands including the People/Entertainment Weekly Network and numerous digital video productions.
Advertising in our print edition and on our websites is predominantly consumer advertising, including beauty, food, fashion and retail, pharmaceutical, financial services, entertainment, travel, auto, technology/telecommunication and home. We have a diverse pool of advertisers, and no single advertising category accounted for more than 17% of our aggregate domestic advertising revenues in 2016. None of our advertising clients accounted for more than 5% of our aggregate domestic advertising revenues in 2016.
We conduct our advertising sales through centralized category-based sales and marketing teams that are supported by brand sales and product sales teams. These teams have depth of expertise on specific Time Inc. brands or products. Additionally, we sell advertising programmatically through ad exchanges and our private programmatic marketplace.
Through The Foundry, we provide content marketing and advertising services to clients across a broad range of industries. These services include using our content creation expertise to develop content marketing programs across multiple platforms, including native advertising that enable clients to engage new consumers and build long-term relationships with existing customers. Additionally, through MNI Targeted Media Inc., we provide clients with a single point of contact for a range of targeted print and digital advertising programs. We offer these clients both digital and print products. Our digital products include programmatic offerings and custom display advertising on local and national websites. Our print products include customized geographic and demographic-targeted advertising programs in approximately 35 top U.S. magazines, including our own magazines and those of other leading magazine publishers. In addition, we offer “cover wraps” and other add-ons to magazines, allowing advertisers to distribute direct marketing messages to specific locations such as medical offices.
The rates at which we sell print advertising depend on each magazine's rate base, which is the circulation of the magazine that we guarantee to our advertisers, as well as our audience size. If we are not able to meet our committed rate base, the price paid by advertisers is generally subject to downward adjustments, including in the form of future credits or discounts. Our published rates for each of our magazines are subject to negotiation with each of our advertisers. We sell digital advertising primarily on a flat rate/sponsorship basis or on a cost per impression, or CPM, basis. Flat rate/sponsorship deals are sold on an exclusive basis to advertisers giving them access to our major events. CPM deals are sold on an impression basis with a guarantee that we will deliver the negotiated volume commitment. If we are not able to meet the impression goal, we will extend the campaign or provide alternative placements.

Circulation
Circulation generates approximately one-third of our Revenues. Circulation is an important component in determining our Advertising revenues because advertising rates depend on circulation and audience. Most of our U.S. magazines are sold primarily by subscription and delivered to subscribers through the mail. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had an average of approximately 30 million active subscriptions worldwide. Most of our international magazines are sold primarily at newsstands and other retail locations. Subscriptions are sold primarily through direct mail, subscription sales agents, marketing agreements with other companies, our owned websites, online advertising and email solicitations, and insert cards in our magazines and other publications. Additionally, digital-only subscriptions and single-copy digital issues of our magazines are sold or distributed through various app stores and other digital storefronts across multiple platforms. We also sell bundled subscriptions that combine print delivery with cross-platform digital access. In 2016, subscription sales generated approximately two-thirds of our Circulation revenues, while sales at newsstands and other retail outlets accounted for the remainder.
Subscription Sales and Fulfillment
Our consumer marketing efforts include centralized direct-to-consumer marketing services for our titles, including customer acquisition and retention, consumer research, data analytics, financial analysis and other ancillary services by employing a variety of advertising and marketing strategies. These include targeted direct mail, email, digital and social media solicitation campaigns, conducted using consumer information drawn from our internal marketing databases or our branded digital platforms, or leased or purchased from third parties. Overall brand marketing activities are also conducted for our titles via other print, television, online and social media. Other consumer marketing functions include fulfillment, customer service and database management services, including order and payment processing and call-center support. We also provide fulfillment and related services for certain other publishers’ magazines.
Newsstand Sales
Newsstand sales include sales through traditional newsstands as well as supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies and other retail outlets. Through our retail distribution operations, we market and arrange for the distribution of our magazines and certain other publishers’ magazines to retailers through third-party wholesalers.
Our retail distribution operations, Time Inc. Retail (“TIR”) and Marketforce (UK) Ltd. ("Marketforce"), provide services relating to wholesale and retail distribution, billing and marketing. Under arrangements with TIR and Marketforce, third-party wholesalers purchase our magazines and the magazines of our publisher clients, and those wholesalers sell and deliver copies of those magazines to individual retailers. TIR and Marketforce are paid by the wholesalers for magazines they purchase, less credit for returns of unsold magazines. TIR generally advances funds to our publisher clients based on anticipated sales. Marketforce generally remits funds to its publisher clients when it has been paid. Under the contractual arrangements with our publisher clients, in the United States our publisher clients generally bear the risk of loss for non-payment of any amounts due from wholesalers with respect to their magazines, while in the United Kingdom we generally bear this risk. TIR and Marketforce also administer payments from our publisher clients to retailers for promotional allowances, including for the placement of magazines at retail locations.
Newsstand sales are highly sensitive to cover selection, retail placement and other factors. Our retail distribution operations coordinate with our consumer marketing, fulfillment and content creation groups to implement retail marketing plans and analyze expected demand for individual issues of our magazine titles.
We rely on wholesalers for retail distribution of our magazines. A small number of wholesalers are responsible for a substantial percentage of the wholesale magazine distribution business. In the United States, declines in magazine sales at newsstands and other retail outlets have increased the financial instability of magazine wholesalers. Several of our smaller wholesalers ceased operations in early 2014. In May 2014, we informed the then second-largest wholesaler of our publications (the “Discontinued Wholesaler”) that effective immediately we would discontinue sales of publications to that wholesaler. This action was taken after the Discontinued Wholesaler's failure to pay amounts due to us and after discussions with the Discontinued Wholesaler. The Discontinued Wholesaler filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in June 2014. Additionally, we amended the terms of our existing agreements with the largest wholesaler of our publications (the “Selected Wholesaler”) to expand the retail locations serviced by the Selected Wholesaler to include the vast majority of those that had been serviced by the Discontinued Wholesaler prior to the discontinuation. The change in distribution arrangements did not have a material impact on the distribution of our magazines. Our amended agreement with the Selected Wholesaler extends through May 2019. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We could face increased costs and business disruption from instability in our wholesaler distribution channels.”
8

We believe the action we took has improved the strength and stability of our retail distribution network. However, we will continue to closely monitor industry-wide trends and the implications they may have on our relationships with our wholesalers.
Related Operations
We have a number of other operations related to publishing. Our subsidiary, Synapse Group, Inc. (“Synapse”), is an affinity marketing company that partners with brick and mortar retailers, websites, airline frequent flier programs and customer service and direct response call centers. It is a robust marketer of magazine subscriptions in the United States. Building on its continuity marketing expertise, Synapse has diversified its business to also market other products and services. For example, Synapse manages several branded continuity membership programs and is developing continuity programs for product partners.
We also offer our advertisers a broad range of analytics and research services, including consumer insights, audience measurement and accountability reporting. In September 2016, we acquired Bizrate Insights, a consumer data company that specializes in developing consumer insights by extending its online and mobile surveys across partner sites.
We also publish branded books, including soft-cover “bookazines,” through Time Inc. Books. These are distributed through magazine-style “check-out pockets” at retail outlets and traditional trade book channels. We publish books on a diverse range of topics aligned with our brands, including special commemorative and biographical books. We also publish books under various licensed third-party brands and a number of original titles. Under our Oxmoor House imprint, we also publish a variety of home, cooking and health books under our lifestyle-oriented brands as well as under licensed third-party brands.
As of December 31, 2016, we licensed nearly 50 editions of our magazines, including the use of our trademarks and certain copyrighted content, for print or digital publication to publishers in over 30 countries. We also license to third parties the rights to our various brands and properties, including editions of our magazines and the use of our trademarks, individual articles, photos and other copyrighted content.
We also host hundreds of live events each year, including the Essence Festival, Fortune’s Most Powerful Women Conferences and the Food & Wine Classic. In December 2016, we hosted the Fortune/Time Global Forum in Rome in partnership with the Vatican. We believe that live events are a natural extension of our brands and can help build growth opportunities for our marketing partners. 
In addition, we own SI Play, an online league management solution that provides digital tools to participants in youth sports for player registration, scheduling, communication and scorekeeping.
Production
Our paper procurement and printing functions are centrally managed across all our U.S. and U.K. magazines. This allows us to obtain volume discounts with our third-party suppliers and to achieve other efficiencies in our production operations. The final imaging and layout stage of our editorial production process is also centralized across all of our U.S. magazines, facilitating the adaptation of our magazines from print to digital form.
Coated and uncoated papers of various grades and weights are the principal raw materials used in the production of our magazines. A variety of factors affect paper prices and availability, including demand, capacity, raw material and energy costs and general economic conditions. Our current paper supply arrangements are based on an annual request-for-proposal process establishing a non-binding pricing framework for the year. Price and volume adjustments are negotiated from time to time under this pricing framework, typically on a quarterly basis. We believe we will continue to have access to an adequate supply of paper for our future needs. Should disruptions affect our current suppliers, alternative sources of paper are generally available at competitive prices.
Printing is a significant component in the production of our print magazines. The bulk of our U.S. printing is consolidated under multi-year contracts with a single printer. In April 2016, our sole printing supplier in the U.K. announced a liquidation bankruptcy proceeding. In order to secure U.K.-based printing resources for our titles, we extended a loan to the purchaser of the printing site where our U.K. titles were printed and entered into a new printing agreement with that purchaser to print all our U.K. titles.
Subscription copies of our U.S. magazines are delivered through the United States Postal Service ("USPS") as periodicals mail. We coordinate with our printers and local USPS distribution centers to achieve efficiencies in our production and distribution processes and to minimize mail processing costs and delays. However, we are subject to postal rate increases 
9

that affect delivery costs associated with our magazines, as well as our promotional and billing mailings. In April 2016, the USPS announced a 4.3% rate decrease for all classes of mail as a result of the removal of the exigent surcharge that was imposed in December 2013, effective April 10, 2016. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of increases in postal rates, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by postal service changes.” In addition, the financial condition of the USPS continues to decline with large net annual losses despite revenue gains and a moderating decline in the volume of mail delivered.
Competition
We compete with other magazine publishers for market share and for the time and attention of consumers of magazine media content. We also compete with digital publishers and other forms of media, including, among others, social media platforms, search platforms, portals and digital marketing services. In addition, we compete to some extent with national newspapers.
Competition among print magazine and digital publishers for advertising is primarily based on the circulation and readership of magazines and the number of visitors to websites, respectively, the demographics of customer bases, advertising rates, the effectiveness of advertising sales teams and the results observed by advertisers. The shift in consumer preference from print media to digital media, as well as growing consumer engagement with digital media, such as online and mobile social networking, have introduced significant new competition for advertising.
Competition among print magazine publishers for magazine readership is primarily based on brand perception, magazine content, quality and price. Competition for subscription-based readership is also based on subscriber acquisition and retention, and competition for newsstand-based readership is also based on magazine cover selection and the placement and display of magazines in retail outlets. Technological advances and the growing popularity of digitally-delivered content and mobile consumer devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have introduced significant new competition for circulation in the form of readily available free or low-priced digital content.
Our magazine publishing and digital operations compete with numerous other magazine, digital publishers, social media platforms, search platforms, portals and digital marketing services for audience and for advertising directed at the general public and at more focused demographic groups. The use of digital devices as distribution platforms for content has lowered the barriers to entry for launching digital products that compete with our business. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—Risks Relating to Our Business—We face significant competition across the media landscape, including from magazine publishers, digital publishers, social media platforms, search platforms, portals and digital marketing services, among others, which we expect will continue, and as a result we may not be able to maintain or improve our operating results.” Nonetheless, we believe that our quality brands, reputation, scale and integrated publishing operations provide us with significant competitive advantages.
Intellectual Property
We are a leading creator, owner and distributor of intellectual property. Our intellectual property assets include:

• | trademarks in product and service names and logos, including our key brands and trade names, such as “People,” “Sports Illustrated,” “InStyle,” “Time,” “Fortune” and “Travel + Leisure”;


• | copyrights in magazines, software, books, videos, websites and mobile apps, as well as in text and photos created or commissioned by us as “works made for hire”;


• | domain names;


• | licenses of intellectual property rights, including rights to many of the photos appearing in our magazines and third-party content appearing in our products; and


• | patents for inventions related to our products, business methods and/or services (although none of our patents are material to the financial condition or operation of our business).

We derive value and revenues from these intellectual property assets through a range of business activities, including the sale or distribution of print magazines and books, the distribution of mobile apps and the operation of websites and other digital properties. We also derive revenues related to our intellectual property through advertising in our print magazines, events and conferences, websites, mobile apps and other digital properties and from various types of licensing activities, including licensing and syndication of our trademarks and copyrights in the United States and internationally.
Our intellectual property assets are, collectively, among our most valuable assets and are important to our continued success and our competitive position. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely on a combination of copyright, 
10

trademark, unfair competition, patent and trade secret laws and contractual provisions. The duration of the protection afforded to our intellectual property depends on the type of property in question and the laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction. In the case of licenses, our intellectual property rights also depend on contractual provisions. With respect to our trademarks and trade names, trademark laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries or regions where a mark has been registered, protected or used. While trademark registrations may generally be maintained in effect for as long as the mark is in use in the respective jurisdictions, there may be occasions where a mark, name or title is not registrable or protectable and may be barred from use in a particular country or region for either substantive or technical reasons. Even if registration for a mark has been obtained, a trademark registration may be subject to cancellation or invalidation based on certain use requirements and third-party challenges, or on other grounds. With respect to our copyrights, the usual copyright term for authored works in the United States is the life of the author plus 70 years, and for “works made for hire,” the copyright term is the shorter of 95 years from the first publication or 120 years from creation. With respect to our patents, patent laws and rights are generally territorial in scope and limited to those countries or regions where a patent has been obtained. In the United States, in general, for patents based on applications filed before June 8, 1995, patents are valid until the later of 17 years from the date of issue or 20 years from the date of the earliest filed application in its chain of parentage. For patents based on applications filed on or after June 8, 1995, patents are valid until 20 years from the date of the earliest filed application in its chain of parentage. In some instances, where appropriate, we may choose not to seek patent protection for a developed technology and instead undertake measures to protect such technology as a trade secret.  There also may be occasions where a technology is not patentable or protectable under the laws of a particular jurisdiction, or barred from use in a particular country or region for either substantive or technical reasons. Even where a patent has been obtained, it may be subject to invalidation based on statutory interpretation or third-party challenges, or on other grounds. With respect to our domain names, the term for each domain name is dictated by the rules and terms agreed upon with the registrar for each particular domain name.
We actively protect, police and enforce our proprietary rights in our intellectual property in the U.S. and abroad based on our legal and business judgment under the circumstances. Our license agreements and other third-party user agreements contain provisions regarding the proper use and protection of our content and trademarks. With respect to trademarks, we seek registration for our marks, as appropriate, in countries or regions where our use of the marks may be planned or anticipated or where registration is otherwise warranted. We police our trademark rights through certain third-party vendors and in-house trademark watching mechanisms, and, where appropriate, we challenge third-party uses of trademarks, or applications to register trademarks, of which we become aware. Where necessary, we take appropriate legal action against such uses based on our legal and business judgment. We also engage in online enforcement of our brands and challenge domain name registrations and uses that we deem to undermine or conflict with our trademark rights. The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) continues to expand the supply of domain names on the Internet and so far has designated more than 1,500 generic Top Level Domains (i.e., the characters that appear to the right of the period in domain names, such as .com, .net and .org) ("gTLDs"), which could significantly change the structure of the Internet and make it significantly more expensive for us to protect our intellectual property on the Internet. Policing unauthorized use of our products, content and related intellectual property is often difficult, and the steps taken may not in every case prevent infringement by unauthorized third parties of our intellectual property rights.
Outside the United States, laws and regulations relating to intellectual property protection and the effective enforcement of these laws and regulations vary greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Judicial, legislative and administrative developments are taking place in certain jurisdictions that may have the impact of limiting the ability of rights holders to exploit and enforce certain of their exclusive intellectual property rights outside the United States.
Regulatory Matters 
Our business is subject to and affected by laws, regulations and policies of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities as well as the laws and regulations of international countries and bodies such as the European Union (the “EU”), and these laws and regulations are subject to change. The following descriptions of significant U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, regulatory agency inquiries, rulemaking proceedings and other developments are not intended to substitute for the full texts of the respective laws, regulations, inquiries, rulemaking proceedings and other related materials.
Regulation Relating to Data Privacy, Data Security and Cybersecurity 
Our business is subject to existing laws and regulations governing data privacy, data security and cybersecurity in the United States and internationally. For example, in the United States, we are subject to: (1) the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”), which affects certain of our websites, mobile apps and other online business activities and restricts the collection, maintenance and use of persistent identifiers (such as IP addresses or device serial numbers), location information, images, recordings and other personal information regarding children; (2) the Privacy and Security Rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which imposes privacy and security requirements on our health 
11

plans for employees and on service providers under those plans; (3) state statutes requiring notice to individuals when a data breach results in the release of personally identifiable information; and (4) privacy and security rules imposed by the payment card industry, as well as other regulations designed to protect against identity theft and fraud in connection with the collection of credit and debit card payments from consumers.
Moreover, new laws and regulations have been adopted or are being considered in the United States and internationally that could affect how we collect, use and protect data. New or expanded laws and regulations regarding information security, online and behavioral advertising, geolocation tracking, cloud computing and data collection, sharing and use could increase our compliance costs. Additionally, increased enforcement actions could also increase our costs, and enforcement has been increasing. Since 2002, the Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") has brought over 50 cases citing companies for failure to either design or implement an appropriately comprehensive privacy or data security program. Since 2014, the Federal Communications Commission (the “FCC”) has also become increasingly involved in privacy and data security enforcement actions. These trends with the FTC and FCC appear to be continuing, as indicated by the Consumer Protection Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”) entered into by the FTC and FCC on November 16, 2015. Under the MOU, the FTC and FCC will work together in bringing data privacy and security enforcement actions against certain companies and will share data privacy and security compliance information between each other. Additionally, on October 27, 2016, the FCC announced the adoption of new privacy regulations for Internet Service Providers in order to better protect consumer privacy. 
Many state legislatures have also adopted legislation that regulates how businesses operate online, including measures relating to privacy, data security and data breaches. For example, laws in 47 states require businesses to provide notice to customers whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. The laws are not consistent, and compliance in the event of a widespread data breach is costly. Further, states are constantly amending existing laws, requiring attention to regulatory requirements. Recently, states have been broadening those notification laws and increasing the requirements of companies who suffer a data breach. For example, in April 2015, Washington passed a new law that strengthened its data breach notification requirements. The new law includes content requirements for notification letters provided to Washington consumers who are affected by a data breach. The new law also requires companies suffering a data breach to notify the Washington attorney general if the breach affects more than 500 state residents. In June 2015, Connecticut also revised its data security laws. The new law requires companies who suffer a data breach involving Social Security numbers to offer at least one year of free identity theft prevention services to affected Connecticut consumers. The new Connecticut law also requires consumer notification within 90 days for all data breaches. In September 2016, California amended and broadened its data breach notification statute to require consumer notification when there has been an unauthorized acquisition of a consumer’s encrypted personal information along with the applicable encryption key. Similarly, Nebraska, Nevada, Rhode Island and Tennessee also amended and broadened their data breach notification statutes in 2016 to strengthen data breach notification requirements, broaden the scope of the definition of personal information and impose new requirements on content and notification. Late in 2016, Illinois enacted a sweeping revision of its Personal Information Protection Act that took effect on January 1, 2017.
States are also active in other areas of data privacy. For example, on January 1, 2016, the Delaware Online Privacy and Protection Act took effect. This new law includes prohibitions against certain advertising to children (defined as those under the age of 18), including prohibitions against advertising related to firearms, tobacco and alcohol. The law also mandates privacy policies for websites and apps that collect personal information from Delaware residents.
Foreign governments are also focusing on similar data privacy and security concerns. In 2015, two major developments occurred in the European Union. First, in October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework, which thousands of U.S. companies had been relying upon in order to legally transfer personal data from the E.U. to the U.S. While the Safe Harbor was important to a significant number of U.S. companies, there are other ways for companies to comply with the E.U. restrictions and requirements for transferring personal data. For example, companies could enter into model contracts, which contain pre-approved standardized contractual clauses (the “Standard Clauses”) related to data privacy and security. On February 2, 2016, the European Commission and the U.S. Department of Commerce announced the Privacy Shield program, an agreement on a new framework for transatlantic data flows to replace the invalidated U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework. The Privacy Shield program requires U.S. companies to comply with stronger and more robust privacy requirements than were required under the old U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework. The Privacy Shield program went into effect on August 1, 2016, but is subject to annual review by the European Commission and could be withdrawn by the Commission or invalidated by European Court of Justice. Furthermore, the validity of personal data transfers under the Standard Clauses has been challenged in Ireland and is widely expected to be appealed eventually before the European Court of Justice, possibly before the end of 2017. If the Standard Clauses are invalidated by the European Court of Justice, transatlantic data flows could be disrupted.

Second, on December 15, 2015, the European Commission announced that it has reached agreement upon the text of the General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”). The official text of the GDPR was published on May 4, 2016 and will go into effect on May 25, 2018, replacing the Data Protection Directive (95/46/EC), which was adopted in 1995. The GDPR will introduce numerous privacy-related changes for companies operating in the E.U., including greater control for data subjects (e.g., the “right to be forgotten”), increased data portability for EU consumers, data breach notification requirements, and increased fines, with potential fines for violations of certain provisions of GDPR reaching as high as 4% of a company’s annual total revenue, potentially including the revenue of its international affiliates. The GDPR also has certain benefits for companies operating in the E.U., including the fact that the GDPR, which applies uniformly throughout the E.U., reduces the range of situations in which companies will need to consider different laws of each member nation of the E.U.
Additionally, foreign governments outside of the E.U. are also taking steps to fortify their data privacy laws and regulations. For example, Turkey’s new Data Protection Law came into effect on April 7, 2016 and is modeled after the data privacy laws in the E.U. In Argentina, the Argentina Data Protection Agency issued a new regulation on November 18, 2016, that includes new requirements on international transfers of personal data. 
As the privacy laws and regulations around the world continue to evolve, these changes could adversely affect our business operations, websites and mobile applications that are accessed by residents in the applicable countries.
Marketing Regulation 
Our U.S. magazine subscription, direct marketing and advertising sales activities are subject to regulation by the FTC and each of the states under general consumer protection statutes prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Certain marketing activities are also subject to specific state and federal statutes and rules, such as the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, COPPA, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (relating to financial privacy), the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003 (CAN SPAM), the FTC Mail or Telephone Order Merchandise Rule and the Restore Online Shoppers’ Confidence Act. The FTC has also published a number of proposed rules, which, if enacted, could have an adverse impact on our marketing and subscription activities. For example, in 2009, the FTC proposed a rule that would regulate consumer offers that include a trial period (for free or at a reduced cost) for a specified period after which consumers would continue to receive products at a specified price until the offer is canceled. The rulemaking proceeding is still pending. The FTC also publishes guidelines from time to time that generally explain how to make disclosures in connection with various direct marketing and advertising activities to avoid unfair or deceptive acts or practices. For example, in December 2015, the FTC issued an Enforcement Policy Statement and accompanying Guide for Businesses addressing the use of native advertising by publishers and advertisers. In these documents the FTC lays out the general principles it will consider in determining whether any particular native advertising is deceptive and violates the FTC Act. We believe our native advertising practices are generally consistent with the FTC’s Enforcement Policy Statement, but it is uncertain as to how the FTC will interpret its guidelines and how aggressive it will be in enforcing its position. We also regularly receive and resolve routine inquiries from state Attorneys General. Further, we are subject to agreements with state Attorneys General addressing some of our marketing activities, such as magazine subscription renewals. Since we entered into those agreements, many states have adopted regulations addressing the marketing activities that are the subject of our agreements with the state Attorneys General. For example, in 2010, California enacted a law requiring specific disclosures in automatic renewal offers similar to those required under our agreements with state Attorneys General. Other federal and state statutes and rules also regulate conduct in areas such as telemarketing.
In connection with our magazine subscription and marketing activities outside the United States, we are subject to local laws and regulations relating to consumer protection and electronic marketing, especially across Europe and the Asia Pacific region and in Canada. In Canada, our marketing activities are subject to the Canadian Anti-Spam Law, which is generally broader than the U.S. CAN SPAM law. In the United Kingdom, these laws and regulations include the Data Protection Act of 1998, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 (SI 2003/2426) (Privacy Regulations) as amended by the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) (Amendment) Regulations 2011 (SI 2011/1208), the Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013, the Consumer Rights Act 2015 and, beginning in May 2018, the GDPR. In addition, there are various international codes, directives, laws and regulations relating to the nature of content and advertising, including content restriction laws and consumer protection laws (such as laws relating to political advertisements, electronic commerce and the marketing of pharmaceutical and tobacco products and alcoholic beverages).
Postal Regulation
Our U.S. magazine subscription, direct marketing and book publishing businesses are affected by laws and regulations relating to the USPS. Current federal law requires the USPS to prefund most of its projected future liabilities under its retiree health benefit system. The prefunding requirements included annual payments to the Department of Treasury in amounts 
13

of as much as $5.8 billion per year during the period through 2016. The USPS has lacked the funds to make most of these payments, and defaults on future prefunding payments that will be due under current law are also likely. In addition, both the USPS and its regulator, the Postal Regulatory Commission (“PRC”), have reported in recent years that the rates for several products of mail used to distribute the Company’s publications, including Periodicals Mail and Standard Mail Flats, do not cover the costs attributable to those products.
As a result of these and other issues, members of Congress are considering the need for postal reform legislation. If postal reform legislation is enacted, it could result in, among other things, increases in postal rates, local post office closures and the elimination of Saturday mail delivery. The elimination of current protections against significant and unpredictable rate increases or other changes to the USPS as a result of the enactment of postal reform legislation could have an adverse effect on our businesses. 
Additionally, as mandated by current law, the PRC began a review in December 2016 of how well the existing postal regulatory system is meeting the objectives of current postal law. The PRC could implement a new or modified system for setting postage rates as early as 2018. The changes, if upheld in court, could lead to significant increases in the postal rates we pay, and other changes in the terms and conditions of postal service that could have an adverse effect on our business.
For more information, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-Our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of increases in postal rates, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by postal service changes."
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 7,450 employees, of whom approximately 4,950 were located in the United States, approximately 1,500 were located in the United Kingdom, approximately 800 were located in India and approximately 200 were located in various other locations throughout Europe and Asia. Approximately 170 full-time, 20 part-time and 80 temporary editorial employees in the United States at five of our magazine titles are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with the NewsGuild of New York, TNG/CWA Local 31003, which is scheduled to expire on March 31, 2019. In our international operations, we have various arrangements with our employees that we believe to be customary for multinational corporations. We have had no strikes or work stoppages during the last five years. We believe that our employee relations are generally good.
