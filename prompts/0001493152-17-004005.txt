We have one wholly owned subsidiary, Her Marketing Concepts, Inc. (“Her Marketing”), a Nevada Corporation, the primary purpose of which is to purchase various media for customer and lead generation. Additionally, Her Marketing acts as a conduit for the implementation and management of the Media Investor Purchase Agreement described below. All our employees are employed by Her Marketing using a Professional Employment Organization otherwise known as a PEO.
 
Corporate History 
 
On July 25, 2008, EZJR, Inc (“EZJR”), a Nevada corporation, and IVPSA Corporation, entered into an Acquisition Agreement and Plan of Merger. Immediately upon the effectiveness of the merger, the original EZJR ceased to exist.
 
In January 2012, we entered into a two-step transaction with OwnerWiz Realty Inc. (“OWR”), a privately held Georgia corporation, as follows: (a) First Step – In January 2012, an entity owned by the shareholders of OWR and parent company of OW Marketing, Inc. (“OWM”) acquired 1,875,000 shares of EZJR’s restricted common stock shares representing approximately 95.25% of the then total outstanding common stock shares of 1,966,688 shares from the then two major shareholders in a private transaction; and (b) Second Step – In March 1, 2012, EZJR Acquisition Corporation (“Sub”), a Nevada corporation and EZJR’s subsidiary and OWR, entered a Share Exchange Agreement and Plan of Merger “Share Exchange” pursuant to which the Sub was merged with and into OWR, with OWR surviving as a wholly-owned subsidiary of EZJR. EZJR acquired all the outstanding capital stock of OWR in exchange for issuing 195,000 restricted shares of EZJR’s common stock, which were issued to two shareholders of OWR. Since the former shareholders of OWR owned over 95% of the outstanding common stock of EZJR upon consummation of the Share Exchange, the transaction was recorded as a reverse merger and resulted in a recapitalization with OWR being the acquirer for accounting purposes.
 
On January 28, 2014, we acquired Leading Edge Financial (“LEF”), a private Florida corporation engaged in the business of personal credit management in a stock exchange transaction whereby we exchanged 1,146,250 shares of our restricted common stock in exchange for 100% of LEF’s stock.
 
On April 22, 2015, we incorporated Her Marketing Concepts, Inc. (“Her Marketing”), a Nevada Corporation, as a wholly owned subsidiary. The primary purpose of Her Marketing is to purchase various media for customer and lead generation. Since November 28, 2016, all employees of the Company are employed by Her Marketing using a Professional Employment Organization otherwise known as a PEO.
 
On May 15, 2015, we entered into an agreement with AdMaxOffers.com LLC (“Admax”), our shareholder and beneficial owner, to sell all of its ownership interest in OWR and LEF in exchange for Admax returning to us 325,000 shares of our common stock (valued at $422,500 at the time of the transaction). In accordance with this divesture transaction, the majority of OWR’s assets and obligations, LEF, and OWM are no longer our assets and obligations. As part of the sale of these subsidiaries to Admax, Admax agreed to assume the liabilities for all compensation owed to both our former Chief Technology Officer and the then Chief Executive Officer. In turn, we agreed to assume the following liabilities of OWM and LEF, as follows: 1) estimated unpaid payroll taxes of $6,665 plus estimated late fees of $1,033; 2) remaining administrative fees and other fees owed under an Assurance of Voluntary Compliance pursuant to the Fair Business Practice Act with the State of Georgia of approximately $10,000; 3) a customer refund for $1,500; and 4) a $25,000 note payable plus unpaid interest. Additionally, we agreed to reimburse Edward Zimbardi and Brenda Zimbardi up to $10,000 for legal fees that they may incur to defend against lawsuits related to any legal decisions that assumed on our behalf while serving as our officer or any of our subsidiaries at the time.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2015, the operations of OWR, LEF and OWM are accounted for as discontinued operations.

On September 15, 2016, we purchased 150,000 of our common shares from Admax by issuing a promissory note for $60,000 payable monthly in equal installments of $5,000 until fully paid. Assuming an implied interest rate of 6.5%, the value of the note booked as a payment was $57,940. As part of this transaction Admax agreed that it would not sell any free-trading shares for a period of one year from the transaction date. On November 25, 2016, we purchased an additional 500,000 common shares of Her from Admax for $25,000 cash.
 
On November 28, 2016, we entered into an Asset Share Purchase & Business Agreement with Cabello Real Ltd. (“Cabello”), a private United Arab Emeritus company, to acquire the exclusive U.S. rights to the Her Imports trademark. In exchange for these rights, and other digital assets, we issued to Cabello ten million shares of our unregistered non-voting, non-cumulative, callable preferred stock and 7,500,000 of our unregistered common stock. In addition to conveyance of the Her Imports trademark rights, we purchased certain other assets owned by Cabello, including customer lists and various digital content. Simultaneously, we terminated our Marketing and Selling Agreement with Her Holding, Inc. (“Her Holding”) (See also below section titled Agreements with Her Imports, LLC).
 
On January 12, 2017, pursuant to a Definitive Information Statement file on Schedule 14c, which was sent to the shareholders of the Company on December 20, 2016, the Company changed its name from EZJR, Inc. to Her Imports.
 
On January 31, 2017, the Company effected a 1-for- 2 reverse stock split effective January 31, 2017. The par value was not adjusted as a result of the reverse stock split. All references to numbers of shares of our common stock and per-share information in this Form 10-K and the accompanying financial statements have been adjusted retroactively to reflect the split
 
Business
 
We sell human hair extensions and related hair-care and beauty products at retail locations throughout the U.S. and on our Website at www.herimports.com. Additionally, by way of our proprietary eCommerce platform and strategic leveraging of social media buys, we convert prospects into customers while developing long-term personal relationships and loyal customers. As of December 31, 2016, we operated 30 US retail locations. These locations are primarily in “executive office suites” such as Regus PLC, which provides furniture, administrative staff and security. We stock each of our leased locations with products and point-of-sale equipment. We lease these locations on a short-term basis (one year or less, with the exception of three leases longer than one year), which permits us to open and close locations with a minimal amount of time and expense. At these locations, the customer is provided with a personal, one-on-one consultation. Additionally, we have one “super-store” in Greenbelt Maryland, which is staffed with consultants and equipped with a waiting room.
 
After December 31, 2016, we opened three mall kiosks where we display and sell a limited amount of hair extensions but also hair-care and styling products. These locations expose foot traffic to the Her Imports brand. Where necessary, the customer can be referred to a location where a confidential and personal, one-on-one consultation is desired.
 
Agreements with Her Imports, LLC, Her Holding, Inc. and termination of the Agreement
 
On October 1, 2014, we entered into a Marketing and Selling Agreement (the “Agreement”) with Her Imports, LLC (the “LLC”), a retailer of human hair extensions and related products. Under the agreement, we were to custom design the LLC’s ecommerce Websites and generate customer leads through email marketing campaigns, online advertising and social media and various affiliate marketing campaigns. Additionally, we were to sell LLC’s products as well as other products to these customers. As part of the Agreement, we purchased LLC’s inventory that was on hand at September 30, 2014 in exchange for a Secured Promissory Note. We intend to enter similar agreements with other brands and retailers, some of who will pay a commission to us based on the sales generated.

In addition to our selling the LLC’s products online, LLC’s products were sold at independent retail store locations. As part of the agreement, we reimburse the LLC for the expenses of these store locations, employee costs, connectivity expenses and certain other expenses as agreed upon. We make all retail store sales and processed through a Point-of-Sale (POS) system implemented by us. Additionally, we reimburse the LLC for specific customer service costs, warehousing and fulfillment expenses. Finally, we pay the LLC a 10% royalty on net sales. In return, the LLC provides us with assistance in developing and sourcing of products, promotion of products, employee training, customer service and high level store management. On November 14, 2014, the agreement was modified to allow any payments that we made on behalf of the LLC to be offset against any royalty payments. Effective September 1, 2015, we issued 2,000,000 shares of restricted common stock valued at $2,200,000 to Her Holding in exchange for a reduction in the royalty cash payments to 2.5%. Additionally, we agreed to pay for certain connectivity, telephony and customer service expenses that heretofore were paid by LLC.
 
On November 28, 2016, simultaneous with the termination of the Her Holding agreements as described above, we entered into an Asset Share Purchase & Business Agreement with Cabello Real Ltd. as also described above and we hired all the LLC’s and Her Holding’s employees and assumed all location leases. At the time of that agreement termination, we wrote off $977,066 in unamortized prepaid royalties and $362,447 of advances to Her Holding that were forgiven in return for termination of the agreement. This resulted in a loss on termination of the agreement of $1,339,514. As a result of this transaction, our business going forward and continuing to date, concentrates on the Hair Extension and related products business.
 
Our goal is to expand to over 100 retail locations by the end of 2019, the potential success of which is contingent upon adequate revenues and/or financing, of which there are no assurances that we will be successful in doing so. Additionally, we plan to expand the product offerings on our website.
 
eCommerce Platform
 
On May 28, 2014, we entered an Asset Purchase Agreement with Leader Act Ltd HK, (“Leader”) a private Hong Kong corporation to purchase an ecommerce Platform (“Platform”) software program developed and owned by Leader. The Platform entails all aspects of interaction that a company has with its customer, whether it is sales or service-related, provides a greater understanding of the customer and helps manage customer data and all interaction with the customer. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Leader agreed to service and maintain the software for a period of two years. Later, Leader paid to service and maintain the software. For the Platform and service and maintenance, we issued Leader 10,000,000 restricted shares of common stock valued at $0.05 per share. For financial reporting purposes, $350,000 of the purchase price was allocated to the Platform and $150,000 was allocated to the software maintenance agreement, which was booked as a prepaid at the date of the acquisition and is being amortized on a straight-line basis over the two-year term of the agreement. This agreement expired in May 2016. On October 13, 2016, we entered into a five-year maintenance agreement on the Platform with Leader in exchange for 3,000,000 shares of our common stock valued at $375,000.
 
Media Investor Purchaser Agreement
 
On June 29, 2014, we entered into a Media Investor Purchaser Agreement (“MIP”) with Leader. Under the terms of the MIP Agreement, Leader undertakes the responsibility to provide the investment dollars of the “media purchase” for customers and lead generation and to manage this process. In doing so, Leader will create the offers, spend the funds necessary to purchase various media and manage the overall process. Our current on-line offers are focused on selling various consumer products. Leader is also responsible for graphic design, Website design and various other programming expenses. The net revenue from the media purchase will be shared with each party receiving 50 percent after the deduction of certain costs and expenses, including the media purchase, merchant fees, product costs, and affiliate fees. Under the agreement, we will be responsible for customer service, network costs, accounting and other general and administrative costs. Leader can advance us up to $500,000, which may be converted, into a total of 5,000,000 of our restricted common shares at the fixed price of $0.10 per share. Once Leader has acquired the 5,000,000 shares of our stock ownership, the MIP Agreement is no longer in force. Leader had previously advanced us the sum of $50,000 for media purchases and on June 26, 2014, these funds were used to purchase 5,000 of our restricted common stock shares at $0.10 per share. Since September 30, 2014, there has been no activity related to the MIP agreement since we have been focusing its marketing efforts on the agreement with Her Imports; however, we anticipate that the MIP program will be reactivated at some point in the future.

Growth Strategy
 
Our growth strategy consists of the following key elements:
 

● | Expand our geographic reach. We plan to add new retail locations throughout the United States. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Broaden our addressable market. Currently our market consists primary of African American Women. We believe that we can expand our business by addressing the needs of other ethnic groups in the U.S. 
● | Expand our product offering. We plan to add new styles of hair extensions and wigs as the market demands. Additionally, we plan to offer a broader range of haircare and beauty products. 

Products
 
Currently, the products we sell fall into three general categories as follows:
 

● | Human hair extensions and related human hair products. Our hair extensions come in a variety of styles for a variety of uses. We currently focus on products that are woven into existing hair on the human scalp. However, recently, we have begun sourcing and selling products often referred to as “clip-ins” that can temporarily be installed and then removed for later reuse. Finally, we are now exploring selling full, high quality wigs. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hair care products. We currently sell six different hair care products, all under the brand OSIworks. The products include various shampoos and conditioners, specifically designed and formulated for use with human hair extensions. Additionally, we also sell an adhesive to be used in extension installation called Cling. Cling is not water soluble and, as a result, allow the wearer of hair extension to participate in activities such as swimming, water sports and jogging without fear that the installation of the extensions may be affected. 
● | Beauty products and related accessories. We sell a variety of beauty related accessories including silk bonnets, styling tools, and makeup. Styling tools include flatirons and curling irons and are sold under the brand Her Imports. Makeup is sold under the brand Skin & Yang. 

Customers
 
Our customers tend to be African-American women who wish to have longer hair. We sell other product offerings to other ethnic groups to expand our customer base.
Customer Acquisition
 
We obtain customers through two primary channels, online marketing and through a network of affiliates.
 
Online Marketing. 
 
To acquire customers, we are currently using a variety of low-cost marketing tactics including:
 

● | Social Media including Instagram, Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Develop relationships with hair stylists for referrals. 
● | Recently opening three mall kiosks to expose our products to mall foot traffic. 
● | Using email and text messaging to our existing customer base and potential customers who have registered on our website. 

 
In addition to the above, during 2016 we acquired a significant number of social media “followers” by using radio advertising. While this method of obtaining customers was significantly more expensive than our current approach we did build our data base of potential customers that we are now leveraging through social media. However, it appears that local radio appears to be the most cost effective in smaller markets. In the future, we plan to further explore additional traditional forms of attracting new customers, including, but not limited to, celebrity endorsements, public relations and events.

Competitors
 
Hair Extensions. There are many competitors that sell hair extensions including individuals, salons, mall kiosks and online stores.
 
Some of our competitors include:
 
AliExpress
 Queen Virgin Remy
 Go Naked Hair
 Bella Dream Hair
 Extensions Plus
 Bellami Hair
 Indique Hair
 
Certain of these competitors have physical locations while the majority only sell online. Some competitors only sell low-quality synthetic hair. We believe that we sell the highest quality product at a competitive price, primarily because we only sell 100% human hair.
 
Our competitive disadvantages are:
 

● | Many of our competitors sell inferior products at lower prices. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Customers have a difficult time differentiating between vendors of human hair extensions. 
● | We do not currently address all geographical areas in the U.S. 

 
We intend to compete against our competitors through the following methods:
 

● | Offering superior products to our customers. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Educating our customers regarding quality issues for human hair extensions. 
● | Providing accessory products to our customers. 
● | Expanding our geographical reach by opening new retail locations. 
● | Providing a superior online shopping experience to our customers. 

Seasonality
 
The business areas in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations due to the ability of our customers to pay for products, which ability correspond to product demand. Our revenues have historically been better during tax season, while our revenues have experienced declines in the latter part of summer. As such, past quarterly results are not indicative of future results and may be subject to seasonal fluctuations.
Patents, Trademarks, Franchises, Concessions, Royalty Agreements
 
We have no patents, licenses, franchises, concessions, or royalty agreements. We rely on a combination of US trademark, copyright, trade secret and patent laws as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We rely on copyright laws to protect our future computer programs and our proprietary databases. On November 14, 2014, the US Patent and Trademark Office approved the “Her Imports” trademark. On November 28, 2016, we purchased the Her Imports trademark for exclusive use in the United States.

Government Regulations 
 
We are subject to a number of laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. Numerous laws and regulatory schemes have been adopted at the national and state level in the United States. Our business is subject to the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and similar laws adopted by a number of states, which regulate unsolicited commercial emails, create criminal penalties for emails containing fraudulent headers and control other abusive online marketing practices. Similarly, the Federal Trade Commission, has guidelines that impose responsibilities on us with respect to communications with consumers and impose fines and liability for failure to comply with rules with respect to advertising or marketing practices they may deem misleading or deceptive.
 
Need for any Government Approval of Products or Services
 
Our services do not require government approval.
 
Costs and Effects of Environmental Laws
 
We are not subject to any costs or effects of environmental laws.

Number of Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, we had 51 full-time employees and 22 part-time employees. We also have 6 full-time independent contractors which may become full-time employees at some time in the future.
