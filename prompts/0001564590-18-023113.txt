Item 1.  Business.
Overview
 Great Elm has continued our transformation over the past year.  We:
  
▪ | expanded our investment management business;
--+---------------------------------------------


▪ | closed on our first real estate business opportunity; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


▪ | explored a number of acquisition and investment opportunities and in September 2018, we closed on our first operating company acquisition. For additional information see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our goal is to build a diversified holding company focused on generating attractive risk-adjusted returns on investment and long-term value creation.  We will accomplish this principally through:
  
▪ | continuous review of acquisitions of businesses, securities and assets that generate attractive risk-adjusted returns and exhibit the potential for significant long-term value creation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | effective use of the skills of our team, our financial resources, including our tax assets, our willingness to create bespoke solutions and our ability to prudently assume risks; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | evaluating the retention and disposition of our operations and holdings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In February 2018, we expanded our investment management business through agreements to provide investment advisory services to a group of separately managed accounts (SMA).  This grows the investment management business previously established in connection with the launch of GECC in 2016.  Additionally, in March 2018 we started our real estate business and made our first real estate acquisition, an 80.1% interest in CRIC IT Fort Myers LLC, through Great Elm FM Holdings, Inc., a majority-owned subsidiary.
 We continue to explore other opportunities in the investment management and real estate businesses including, but not limited to, transactions with other business development companies (BDCs) that trade at a discount to their net asset value, as well as the creation of closed-end investment vehicles.
 As of June 30, 2018, we had approximately $1.7 billion of net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards for Federal income tax purposes.

 Our Divested Patent Business
 On April 6, 2016, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Optis UP Holdings, LLC (Optis) providing for the sale of the entities that conducted our patent licensing business (the Divestiture).  The Divestiture was completed on June 30, 2016.
 In the Divestiture, we received $34.2 million in gross cash proceeds, inclusive of reimbursement of $4.2 million of agreed upon expenses, and may be entitled to up to an additional $10 million cash payment due on June 30, 2018.  Optis has claimed that it has losses indemnifiable under the purchase and sale agreement in excess of the $10 million contractual payment.  As of June 30, 2018, the Company is in active discussions with Optis regarding final payment terms.  As a result, we have not recognized any portion of the $10 million in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for the periods presented.  Our legacy patent licensing business is reflected in our financial statements as discontinued operations.
 Great Elm Capital Corp. ― Our Investment Management Business
 We decided to invest in the asset management business because of our assessment of its ability to generate recurring free cash flows, its growth prospects and our Board’s and employees’ industry expertise.

GECC was established in 2016 and obtained its initial portfolio of investments in November 2016 through a merger (the Merger) with Full Circle Capital Corporation (Full Circle) and an in-kind contribution from certain private investment funds (the MAST Funds) managed by Mast Capital Management, LLC (MAST Capital), along with $30 million cash contributed by the Company.  At this time, GECC elected to be treated as a BDC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the Investment Company Act).
 Great Elm Capital Management, Inc., our wholly-owned registered investment adviser subsidiary (GECM), is the external investment adviser to GECC.  In connection with the November 2016 contribution by the MAST Funds, GECM hired all of the employees of MAST Capital, acquired the entire infrastructure used by our GECM team, and established a cost sharing agreement with MAST Capital.
 In September 2017, we entered into a separation agreement that separated our business from MAST Capital (Separation Agreement) which restructured many of these arrangements.
 GECC and GECM entered into an investment management agreement in September 2016, whereby GECM is entitled to:
  
▪ | management fees measured by GECC’s gross assets (other than cash and cash equivalents, including investments in money market funds);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | an incentive fee if GECC’s net investment income (NII) exceeds a hurdle rate; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


▪ | an incentive fee based on GECC’s capital gains.
--+------------------------------------------------

 We also earn an administration fee based on the reimbursement of the portion of GECM’s expenses allocable to GECC.
 We own approximately 18% of GECC’s shares that we may hold to generate dividends or sell to redeploy our capital in higher yielding opportunities.  In September 2018, we transferred 668,306 of these shares to Great Elm DME Holdings, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary.
 GECM is also the investment advisor to three SMAs and our newly launched credit fund, Great Elm Opportunity Fund, L.P. (GEOF).
 Acquisition Program
 GECM’s team also is developing an active acquisition program for us in the investment management business, in select opportunities in real estate and other industries through the acquisition of operating businesses.  In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, we evaluated a number of opportunities in these areas.
Competition
 We face competition from larger, well financed organizations (both domestic and foreign), including operating companies, global asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, private equity funds, sovereign wealth funds and state owned enterprises.  Government regulation is a key competitive factor.
Employees
 We had 12 employees as of June 30, 2018.
