Business Summary
 
We operate our business within the following product groups: Talon Zipper and Talon Trim (which includes our Tekfit stretch technology products). In our Talon Zipper group, we design, engineer, test and distribute custom zippers under our Talon trademark to apparel brands and manufacturers on a global basis. Talon enjoys extensive brand recognition and heritage within the apparel industry worldwide and is a 120+ year-old brand, renowned for its quality and product innovation and as the inventor of the formed wire metal zipper for the jeans industry. We are a specified custom zipper and preferred zipper brand for numerous manufacturers in the designer, sportswear, children’s wear and outerwear markets worldwide. We provide multiple lines of high quality custom zippers, including metal, coil and plastic zippers, vintage zippers, and specialty zippers for kids clothing and other fit-for-purpose applications, such as footwear, workwear and specialty bags. All products are for distribution to apparel manufacturers worldwide, including markets in China, Taiwan, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam, the Middle East, Europe, Mexico and Central America. We have sales and marketing teams in most of these areas. We have joint manufacturing arrangements in strategic international local markets to manufacture, finish and distribute our products locally under the Talon brand name. Our manufacturing partners operate under our direct manufacturing and quality assurance oversight, in accordance with our manufacturing specifications and quality standards, using only Talon approved and authorized raw materials. The unique and comprehensive supply chain network results in high quality finished zippers for our customers in their local markets. Our operating structure allows us to significantly improve the speed at which we serve the market and the service we provide to our customers, and to effectively expand the geographic footprint of our Talon products. 
 
Our Talon Trim products group act as a fully-integrated single-source designer, product developer and exclusive supplier for a full range of custom trim items for manufacturers of fashion apparel. Our business focuses on servicing all of the trim requirements of our customers at the manufacturing and retail brand level of the fashion apparel industry. Our Talon Trim products include essentially all components required to manufacture a garment with the exception of the fabric and the thread. Talon Trim items include labels, buttons, rivets, leather patches, woven labels, heat transfer seals, tapes, ribbons, printed marketing material, polybasic, packing cartons and hangers. Talon Trim items comprise a relatively small part of the cost of most apparel products but comprise the vast majority of components necessary to fabricate and finish a typical apparel product. We offer customers a one-stop outsource service for all zipper and trim related matters. Our teams work with industry merchants, product developers and designers, and function as an extension of their staff. 
 
Our Talon Trim products also include our Talon Stretch Technology products. Under the Tekfit brand, we supply apparel manufacturers with interlining products and an advanced, patented fabric technology that creates stretchable fabric from non-stretchable material. This innovative technology allows the fabric to be altered through the addition of stretch characteristics resulting in greatly improved fit and comfort. Manufacturers use this technology to build-in stretch into standard waistbands that does not alter the appearance of the garment, but will allow the waist to stretch out and back by as much as two waist sizes. They also utilize this technology within inner pocketing shapewear panels to provide a firm comfort fit across the stomach and hips, while manufacturers of dress shirts use this stretch technology to produce comfortable, flexible shirt collars. Talon’s Stretch Technology and its Tekfit brand products have multiple applications in virtually any garment where added flexibility and comfort is desired.

Our Talon Zipper and Talon Trim product teams collaborate with customers on their design vision and present examples of their vision in graphic form for all apparel accessory components. We design the buttons, snaps, hang tags, labels, zippers, zipper pulls and other items to meet the customer’s needs. Once our customer selects the designs they prefer, our sourcing and production teams coordinate with our manufacturing partners worldwide to ensure the best manufacturing solution for the items being produced. The proper manufacturing solution is an essential part of the expertise and service we provide to customers. Selecting the best facility to ensure timely production, the proper finishes, or other material needs or manufacturing techniques to be used is critical. We offer customers a depth and breadth of knowledge in the manufacturing of these products that our customers cannot otherwise easily achieve. We are consistently innovating new items, manufacturing techniques and finishes, introducing many new, fresh and unique ideas to our customers. Once our customers make a final decision on the accessories that will be used on their garments, we are in many instances identified as the sole or preferred source supplier for the project, and our customers’ factories are then directed to purchase the products directly from us. Throughout the garment manufacturing process, we consistently monitor the timing and accuracy of the production items until delivery to our customers’ apparel factories.
 
We serve as a nominated supplier in our Talon Zipper and Talon Trim products (including our Tekfit stretch technology products) for a variety of major retail brand and private-label oriented companies. A nominated supplier is a supplier that has been approved for its quality and service by a major retail brand or private-label company. Apparel contractors manufacturing for the retail brand or private-label company typically purchase their zipper and trim components from a supplier that has been nominated. We seek to expand our services as a supplier of select items for such customers, to being a preferred or single-source provider of the entire customer’s authorized trim and zipper requirements. Our ability to offer a full range of trim and zipper products is attractive to brand name and private-label oriented customers because it enables the customer to address their quality and supply needs for all of their trim requirements from a single source, avoiding the time and expense necessary to monitor quality and supply from multiple vendors and manufacturer sources. Becoming a nominated supplier to brand customers gives us an advantage to become the preferred or sole vendor of trim and zipper items for all apparel manufacturers contracted for production for that brand name.
 
Our teams of sales employees, customer service representatives, merchandisers, creative design personnel and global production and distribution coordinators based at our facilities located in the United States, Europe, and throughout Southeast Asia, enable us to take advantage of and address the increasingly complicated requirements of the large and expanding demand for complete end-to-end apparel accessory solutions. We plan to continue to expand operations in Asia, Europe, and Latin America to take advantage of the large apparel manufacturing markets in these regions. 
 
Products
 
Talon Zipper - We offer a full line of custom metal, coil and plastic zippers bearing the Talon brand name or logo. Talon zippers are used primarily by manufacturers in the apparel industry and are distributed through our distribution facilities in the United States, Europe, Hong Kong and China and through these designated offices to other international markets, including Taiwan, India, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Vietnam, Dominican Republic and others. 
 
We expand our distribution of Talon zippers through the establishment of a combination of Talon owned sales and distribution locations, and strategic manufacturing and distribution relationships. These distribution and manufacturing relationships, in combination with Talon owned and affiliated facilities, improve our time-to-market by allowing us to source, finish and distribute to apparel manufacturers within their local markets. The branded apparel zipper market is dominated by one company and we have positioned Talon to be a viable global alternative to this competitor and capture an increased market share position. We leverage the brand awareness of the Talon name by branding other products in our line with the Talon name.

Talon Trim Group - We consider our high level of customer service as a fully integrated single-source supplier essential to our success. We combine our quality customer service within our Talon Trim solutions with a history of design and manufacturing expertise to offer our customers a complete trim solution product. We believe this full-service product gives us a competitive edge over companies that only offer selected trim components because our full service solutions save our customers substantial time in ordering, designing, sampling and managing trim sourcing from several different suppliers. Our tracking and order management systems allow us to seamlessly supply Talon Trim solutions and products to apparel brands, retailers and manufacturers around the world. We produce custom hang tags, metal fasteners, woven, leather, synthetic, embroidered and novelty labels and tapes, which can be printed on or woven into a wide range of fabrics, as well as interlining and stretch technology components and other materials using specialized equipment. Our Tekfit products, which are a part of the Talon Trim Group, provide manufacturers with fabric interlinings and patented technology, manufacturing know-how, proprietary equipment and materials necessary to produce expandable waistbands, shirt collars and various other stretch technology apparel interlining components. All of Talon Trim Group products are sold to a similar class of customers, sourced from specialty trim suppliers, are distributed using similar distribution methods and are sold by a shared salesforce; these similarities support the aggregation of the operating results into a combined Talon Trim Group. 
 
 The percentages of total revenue contributed by each of our two primary product groups for the last three fiscal years are as follows:
 

 | Years Ended December 31, | 
-------------------------+--------------------------+-----
 | 2016 | | | 2015 | | 2014
Product Group Net Sales: | | | | | | | | 
Talon Zipper | | 36.4 | % | | 44.0 | % | 50.1 | %
Talon Trim | | 63.6 | % | | 56.0 | % | 49.9 | %

Design and Development
 
Our in-house creative teams develop products with innovative technology and designs that we believe distinguish our products from those of our competitors. We are constantly innovating our products to expand our product offerings and address new market needs. We support our skills and expertise in material procurement and product manufacturing coordination with product technology and designs intended to meet fashion demands, as well as cost and functional parameters. An example of this is the Talon KidZip®, which is a specialty zipper for children’s apparel, engineered to surpass industry established strength and safety standards, while maintaining the fashion image and requirements of today’s apparel demands. We have introduced two new fit for purpose specialty zippers to our range of zipper products, including a specialty zipper line designed specifically for the demanding requirements of workwear applications; and a specialty zipper line designed specifically for the demanding requirements of footwear applications. Our workwear application zipper improves durability, strength and safety features required by construction, utility, and safety workers, while our footwear application zipper features improves durability over a standard zipper and is designed to endure under high stress applications experienced in a variety of footwear, such as boots and shoes. 
 
Many specialty design companies with which we compete have limited capabilities with regard to the range of their product offerings, sourcing or manufacturing experience, and consequently they create products or designs that often cannot be implemented due to limitations in the manufacturing process, the high expense of required materials, or a lack of functionality in the resulting product. We design products to function within the limitations imposed by the applicable materials and manufacturing framework, while meeting our customers’ specialty needs. Using our manufacturing experience, we ensure delivery of quality products and minimize the time-consuming delays that often arise in coordinating the efforts of independent design houses and manufacturing facilities. By supporting our material procurement and product manufacturing services with design services, we reduce development and production costs and deliver products to our customers sooner than many of our competitors. Our design teams are based in our U.S. and Asian facilities.

Customers 
 
We have over 800 active customers representing more than 250 of the world’s best known brands. Our customers include the designated suppliers of well-known apparel retailers and brands, such as VF Corporation, Fat Face, Express, Polo Ralph Lauren, American Eagle, Next, Eddie Bauer, Uniqlo, PVH, Ben Sherman, NY & Co., Guess, and Berne USA among others. Our customers also include contractors, agents and importers for mass merchant retailers such as Kohl’s, Wal-Mart, JC Penney, Costco and others.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our three largest customers combined represented approximately 8%, 6% and 5%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. 
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We sell our products through our own sales force based in the United States, Hong Kong, China, India, Indonesia, Vietnam and Bangladesh. We also sell through outside sales representatives in Europe, and we develop Central America opportunities through our U.S. sales force and outside sales representatives. We employ customer service representatives who are assigned to key customers and provide local customer support. We have developed relationships with our major customers and brands at senior levels, and our sales teams actively participate with these customers/brands in their marketing and sales programs and sales strategies. When we become the nominated supplier for a brand’s packaging or trim requirements, we market ourselves as an in-house function of the brand’s trim procurement operation.
Sourcing and Assembly
 
We have developed expertise in identifying high quality materials, competitive prices and approved manufacturers for particular products and materials and ensuring strict adherence to quality manufacturing processes and materials. Our expertise enables us to produce a broad range of apparel accessories and Trim products at competitive prices. The majority of products that we procure and distribute are secured on a finished-good basis, manufactured by our partners and under our direct oversight. Raw materials used to manufacture or assemble all of our products are obtained only from sources we authorize and specify and are in adequate supply. We purchase products only from qualified material suppliers, and typically guarantee our customers that all materials used in the manufacture of our products are compliant with government regulations and controls over restricted substances.
 
We develop product artwork and any necessary dies and molds used to design and manufacture our products. Products that we design and sell are produced by manufacturing partners under our direct supervision or through joint manufacturing arrangements. We are confident in our ability to identify, secure and maintain high quality manufacturing sources. We will continue to build upon our production through qualified suppliers, particularly with respect to manufacturing activities that require substantial investments in time and capital equipment.
 
Principally through our Asian facilities, we distribute Talon Zipper and Talon Trim apparel accessories and stretch technology components, and oversee the manufacture and distribution of the full range of our products. Through our Asian facilities, we serve our customers worldwide. 
 
Intellectual Property Rights and Licenses
 
We have trademarks as well as patent rights, copyrights, software copyrights and trade names for which we rely on common law protection, including the Talon trademark. Several of our other trademarks are the subject of applications for federal trademark protection through registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including “Talon,” “Tag-It,” “Kidzip” and “Tekfit.” We hold patent rights for several key processes and products, including the Tekfit stretchable fabric products, specialty zippers and garment fasteners.

Seasonality
 
We typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales volume consistent with the purchase demands of the apparel industry. In most years, these seasonal fluctuations result in lower sales volumes for our business in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to the seasonal buying patterns by the majority of our customers. Sales of our products typically precede the retail sales patterns by approximately 90 to 150 days, with this cycle pattern closer to 75 to 90 days for our more generic products sold to mass merchandisers. The apparel retailers typically experience their highest sales volumes during the fourth quarter in association with year-end holiday purchases. Backlogs of sales orders are not considered material in the industries in which we compete, which reduces the predictability of our sales and reinforces the volatility of these cyclical buying patterns on our sales volume. Operating expenses typically follow our seasonal sales patterns fluctuating with the quarterly sales. However our first quarter is typically burdened with higher costs associated with year-end audits, legal reviews, and costs associated with SEC filings, resulting in proportionally higher costs in the first quarter. Because of these fluctuations in our sales and operating costs, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year.
Inventories 
 
In order to meet the rapid delivery requirements of our customers, we may be required to purchase inventories of raw materials based upon projections made by our customers. In these cases we may carry a substantial amount of inventory on their behalf. We manage this risk by obtaining customer commitments to purchase any excess materials or inventories. These commitments provide that in the event that inventories remain with us in excess of the apparel program life or the termination of production of a customer’s product line related to the inventories, the customer is required to purchase the inventories from us under normal invoice and selling terms. While these agreements provide us some advantage in the negotiated disposition of these inventories, we cannot be assured that our customers will complete these agreements or that we can enforce these agreements without adversely affecting our business operations.
Competition
 
We operate in highly competitive and fragmented segments of the apparel industry that include numerous local and regional companies that provide some or all of the products we offer. We also compete with U.S, and international design companies, distributors and manufacturers of tags, trim, packaging products and zippers. Some of our competitors are significantly larger in size and resources than us and have greater name recognition, longer operating histories and more financial and other resources.
 
Because of our integrated materials, manufacturing and assembly capabilities and our full-service zipper and trim solutions, we believe that we are able to effectively compete for our customers’ business, particularly where our customers require a high level of confidence regarding compliance with restricted substance regulations, and with the effective coordination of separately sourced production functions. We believe that we successfully compete in our industry by offering superior product pricing, quality, customer service, design capabilities, delivery lead times and complete supply-chain management. We also believe the Talon brand name and the quality of our Talon brand zippers allows us to gain market share in the apparel accessory industry. The unique qualities of our Tekfit stretch fabric technology will also allow us to compete effectively in the growing market for waistband, shirt collar and shapewear garment components.
 
Segment Information
 
We operate in one industry segment, the distribution of a full range of apparel zipper, trim and interlining products to manufacturers of fashion apparel, specialty retailers and mass merchandisers. We separately report our revenues and gross margins by our product selling groups in this segment to the extent these are distinguished and separate.
