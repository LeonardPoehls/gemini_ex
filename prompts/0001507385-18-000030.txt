Item 1. Business.
Overview 
VEREIT is a full-service real estate operating company which owns and manages one of the largest portfolios of single-tenant commercial properties in the U.S. The Company has 4,091 retail, restaurant, office and industrial operating properties with an aggregate of 94.4 million square feet, of which 98.8% was leased as of December 31, 2017, with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 9.5 years. VEREIT’s business model provides equity capital to creditworthy corporations in return for long-term leases on their properties.
Substantially all of our real estate operations are conducted through the Operating Partnership. VEREIT, Inc. is the sole general partner and holder of 97.6% of the common partnership interests in the Operating Partnership (the “OP Units”) as of December 31, 2017 with the remaining 2.4% of the OP Units owned by certain non-affiliated investors and certain former directors, officers and employees of the Former Manager (defined below).
Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company operated through two business segments, the real estate investment segment and the investment management segment, Cole Capital. On November 13, 2017, the Company entered into a purchase and sale agreement to sell substantially all of the Cole Capital segment. The sale closed on February 1, 2018. Substantially all of the Cole Capital segment is presented as discontinued operations and the Company’s remaining financial results are reported as a single segment for all periods presented. The Company's continuing operations represent primarily those of the real estate investment segment. See Note 5 —Discontinued Operations, for further information on the sale of Cole Capital.
VEREIT, Inc. was incorporated in the State of Maryland on December 2, 2010 and has elected to be treated as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Operating Partnership was formed in the State of Delaware on January 13, 2011. We operate our business in a manner that permits us to maintain our exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). VEREIT, Inc.’s shares of common stock and 6.70% Series F Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series F Preferred Stock”) trade on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the trading symbols “VER” and “VER PRF,” respectively. 
2017 Developments
Real Estate Acquisitions
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company acquired controlling financial interests in 88 commercial properties for an aggregate purchase price of $748.8 million. 
Real Estate Dispositions
During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company disposed of 137 properties for an aggregate sales price of $594.9 million, of which the Company’s share was $574.4 million after the profit participation payments related to the disposition of 31 Red Lobster properties and the consolidated joint venture partner’s share of the sales price, resulting in consolidated proceeds of $445.5 million after closing costs and a $66.0 million debt assumption.
Balance Sheet and Liquidity
2017 Bond Offering 
On August 11, 2017, the Company closed a senior note offering, consisting of $600.0 million aggregate principal amount of the Operating Partnership’s 3.950% Senior Notes due 2027, (the “2017 Bond Offering”). As discussed in Note 10 – Debt, the Company subsequently used the proceeds from the 2017 Bond Offering to repay borrowings, including swap termination costs and accrued and unpaid interest under its $500.0 million Credit Facility Term Loan. The Company used the remaining proceeds to pay down secured debt. 
Share Repurchase Program
On May 12, 2017, the Company’s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $200.0 million of the Company’s outstanding Common Stock over the subsequent 12 months, as market conditions warrant. During the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company repurchased 68,759 shares of Common Stock in multiple open market transactions for $0.5 million as part of the Share Repurchase Program.

Debt Reductions
The Company decreased total debt by $293.8 million, from $6.4 billion to $6.1 billion, partially due to the repayment of the Credit Facility Term Loan of $500.0 million and a $579.9 million reduction of secured debt. These reductions of debt were partially offset by the issuance of $600.0 million of unsecured notes and net borrowings on the revolving credit facility of $185.0 million. 
Cole Capital Sale
On November 13, 2017, we entered into a purchase and sale agreement (as amended by that certain First Amendment to the Purchase and Sale agreement, dated as of February 1, 2018, the “Cole Capital Purchase and Sale Agreement”) with CCA Acquisition, LLC (the “Cole Purchaser”), an affiliate of CIM Group, LLC. Under the terms of the Cole Capital Purchase and Sale Agreement, the Company agreed to sell to the Cole Purchaser all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of Cole Capital Advisors, Inc. (“CCA”), our subsidiary that sponsors and manages non-listed real estate investment trusts, and certain of CCA’s subsidiaries. The sale closed (the “Cole Capital Closing Date”) on February 1, 2018 for total consideration of approximately $120 million paid in cash.
On the Cole Capital Closing Date, we entered into a services agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with Cole Capital, pursuant to which we will continue to provide certain services to Cole Capital and its subsidiaries and to Cole Credit Property Trust IV, Inc. (“CCPT IV”), Cole Real Estate Income Strategy (Daily NAV), Inc. (“INAV”), Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT II), Inc. (“CCIT II”), Cole Office & Industrial REIT (CCIT III), Inc. (“CCIT III”), and Cole Credit Property Trust V, Inc. (“CCPT V” and collectively with CCPT IV, INAV, CCIT II and CCIT III, the “Cole REITs”) including operational real estate support. Under the terms of the Services Agreement, we will be entitled to receive reimbursement for certain of the services provided and fees based on the future revenues of Cole Capital above a specified dollar threshold (the “Net Revenue Payments”), up to an aggregate of $80 million in Net Revenue Payments.
Primary Investment Focus
We own and actively manage a diversified portfolio of single-tenant retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate assets subject to long-term net leases with creditworthy tenants. Our focus is on single-tenant, net-leased properties that are strategically located and essential to the business operations of the tenant, as well as retail properties that offer necessity and value-oriented products or services. We actively manage the portfolio by considering several metrics including property type, tenant concentration, geography, credit and key economic factors for appropriate balance and diversity. We believe that actively managing our portfolio allows us to attain the best operating results for each asset and the overall portfolio through strategic planning, implementation of these plans and responding proactively to changes and challenges in the marketplace.
Investment Policies
When evaluating prospective investments in or dispositions of real property, our management considers relevant real estate and financial factors, including the location of the property, the leases and other agreements affecting the property and business operations of the tenant, the creditworthiness of major tenants, its income-producing capacity, its physical condition, its prospects for appreciation, its prospects for liquidity, tax considerations and other factors. In this regard, our management will have substantial discretion with respect to the selection of specific investments, subject in certain instances to the approval of the Board of Directors.
As part of our overall portfolio strategy, we seek to lease space and/or acquire properties leased to creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting and operating guidelines. Prior to entering into any transaction, our corporate credit analysis and underwriting professionals conduct a review of a tenant’s credit quality. In addition, we consistently monitor the credit quality of our portfolio by actively reviewing the creditworthiness of certain tenants, focusing primarily on those tenants representing the greatest concentration of our portfolio. This review primarily includes an analysis of the tenant’s financial statements either quarterly, or as frequently as the lease permits. We also consider tenant credit quality when assessing our portfolio for strategic dispositions. When we assess tenant credit quality, we, among other factors that we may deem relevant: (i) review relevant financial information, including financial ratios, net worth, revenue, cash flows, leverage and liquidity; (ii) evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant’s management team; and (iii) assess the strength/growth of the tenant’s industry. On an on-going basis, we evaluate the need for an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant’s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease. The factors considered in determining the credit risk of our tenants include, but are not limited to: payment history; credit status and change in status (credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric); change in tenant space needs (i.e., expansion/downsize); tenant financial performance; economic conditions in a specific geographic region; and industry specific credit considerations. We are of the opinion that the credit risk of our portfolio is reduced by the high quality of our existing tenant base, reviews of prospective tenants’ risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants and mitigation options.

Real Estate Investments
As of December 31, 2017, omitting the Excluded Property, the Company owned 4,091 operating properties comprising 94.4 million square feet of retail and commercial space located in 49 states, Puerto Rico and Canada, which includes properties owned through consolidated joint ventures. The rentable space at these properties was 98.8% leased with a weighted-average remaining lease term of 9.5 years. There were no tenants exceeding 10% of our consolidated annualized rental income as of December 31, 2017, 2016 or 2015. As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, properties located in Texas represented 12.8%, 13.5% and 13.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2017, tenants in the casual dining restaurant and manufacturing industries accounted for 13.8% and 10.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2016, tenants in the casual dining restaurant and manufacturing industries accounted for 15.6% and 10.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. As of December 31, 2015, tenants in the casual dining restaurant and manufacturing industries accounted for 16.6% and 10.1%, respectively, of our consolidated annualized rental income. 
Financing Policies
We rely on leverage to allow us to invest in a greater number of assets and enhance our asset returns. We expect our leverage metrics to improve over time.
We intend to finance future acquisitions with the most advantageous source of capital available to us at the time of the transaction, which may include a combination of public and private offerings of our equity and debt securities, secured and unsecured corporate-level debt, property-level debt and mortgage financing and other public, private or bank debt. In addition, we may acquire properties in exchange for the issuance of common stock or OP Units and we may acquire properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. 
We also may obtain secured or unsecured debt to acquire properties, and we expect that our financing sources will include the public debt market, banks and institutional investment firms, including asset managers and life insurance companies. Although we intend to maintain a conservative capital structure, our charter does not contain a specific limitation on the amount of debt we may incur and the Board of Directors may implement or change target debt levels at any time without the approval of our stockholders.
We intend to continue to emphasize unsecured corporate-level or OP-level debt in our financing and to seek to reduce the percentage of our assets which are secured by mortgage loans. For information relating to our Credit Facility, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 
Competition 
We are subject to competition in the acquisition and disposition of properties and in the leasing of our properties. We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of retail, restaurant, office and industrial real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. We also may face new competitors and, due to our focus on single-tenant properties located throughout the United States, and because many of our competitors are locally or regionally focused, we do not expect to encounter the same competitors in each region of the United States. Our competitors may be willing to accept lower returns on their investments and may succeed in buying the properties that we have targeted for acquisition. We may also incur costs in connection with unsuccessful acquisitions that we will not be able to recover. Foreign investors may view the U.S. real estate market as being more stable than other international markets and may increase investments in high-quality single-tenant properties, especially in gateway cities.
Regulations
Our investments are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, health, safety and zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all material permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
Our properties are also subject to laws such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (“ADA”), which require that all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. Some of our properties may currently not be in compliance with the ADA. If one or more of the properties in our portfolio is not in compliance with the ADA or any other regulatory requirements, we may be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance.
Environmental Matters 
Under various federal, state and local environmental laws, a current owner of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up contaminated property. Under these laws, courts and government agencies have the authority to impose cleanup 
6
responsibility and liability even if the owner did not know of and was not responsible for the contamination. For example, liability can be imposed upon us based on the activities of our tenants or a prior owner. In addition to the cost of the cleanup, environmental contamination on a property may adversely affect the value of the property and our ability to sell, rent or finance the property, and may adversely impact our investment in that property. 
Prior to acquisition of a property, we will obtain Phase I environmental reports, or will rely on recent Phase I environmental reports. These reports will be prepared in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence based on our standards and generally include a physical site inspection, a review of relevant federal, state and local environmental and health agency database records, one or more interviews with appropriate site-related personnel, review of the property’s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property and nearby or adjoining properties. We may also obtain a Phase II investigation which may include limited subsurface investigations and tests for substances of concern where the results of the Phase I environmental reports or other information indicates possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 330 employees. Following the closing of the Cole Capital sale, approximately 100 of these employees were employed by the Cole Purchaser.

Supplemental U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations
This summary is for general information purposes only and is not tax advice. This discussion does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to particular holders of our securities in light of their personal investment or tax circumstances. 
Recent Legislation 
The recently enacted “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (the “TCJA”), generally applicable for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, made significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”), including a number of provisions of the Internal Revenue Code that affect the taxation of businesses and their owners, including REITs and their stockholders. 
Among other changes, the TCJA made the following changes:

• | For tax years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026, (i) the U.S. federal income tax rates on ordinary income of individuals, trusts and estates have been generally reduced and (ii) non-corporate taxpayers are permitted to take a deduction for certain pass-through business income, including dividends received from REITs that are not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income, subject to certain limitations.


• | The maximum U.S. federal income tax rate for corporations has been reduced from 35% to 21%, and corporate alternative minimum tax has been eliminated for corporations, which would generally reduce the amount of U.S. federal income tax payable by our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) and by us to the extent we were subject to corporate U.S. federal income tax (for example, if we distributed less than 100% of our taxable income or recognized built-in gains in assets acquired from C corporations). In addition, the maximum withholding rate on distributions by us to non-U.S. stockholders that are treated as attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a U.S. real property interest is reduced from 35% to 21%.


• | Certain new limitations on the deductibility of interest expense now apply, which limitations may affect the deductibility of interest paid or accrued by us or our TRSs. However, a taxpayer that qualifies as a real estate business may elect to be exempt from such limitations on the deductibility of interest expense. 


• | Certain new limitations on net operating losses now apply, which limitations may affect net operating losses generated by us or our TRSs.


• | A U.S. tax-exempt stockholder that is subject to tax on its unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”) will be required to separately compute its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its UBTI.

7

• | New accounting rules generally require us to recognize income items for federal income tax purposes no later than when we take the item into account for financial statement purposes, which may accelerate our recognition of certain income items.
