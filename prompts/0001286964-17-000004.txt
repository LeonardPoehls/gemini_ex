         ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
     Overview
     We were organized as a Minnesota limited liability company on April 12, 2001 under the name “Generation II, LLC”. In June 2004, we changed our name to Heron Lake BioEnergy, LLC. 
     In July 2013, Granite Falls Energy, LLC (“Granite Falls” or “GFE”) acquired a controlling interest in the Company from Project Viking, L.L.C. GFE, now a related party, owns an ethanol plant located in Granite Falls, Minnesota. As of January 30, 2017, GFE owns approximately 50.6% of our outstanding membership units.  As a result of its majority ownership, GFE has the right to appoint five (5) of the nine (9) governors to our board of governors under our member control agreement.
     We operate a dry mill fuel-grade ethanol plant in Heron Lake, Minnesota.  Since beginning operation of our ethanol plant on September 21, 2007, our primary business has been the production and sale of ethanol and co-products, including dried distillers’ grains and since February 2012, non-edible corn oil. Our plant was originally constructed as a coal fired plant but was converted to natural gas in November 2011. 
     Our ethanol plant has a nameplate capacity of 50 million gallons per year.  On July 10, 2015, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency approved a major amendment to our air emission permit which increased our permitted production capacity from 59.9 million gallons to approximately 72.3 million gallons of undenatured fuel-grade ethanol on a twelve-month rolling sum basis.  We are currently operating above our stated nameplate capacity at an annual rate of approximately 64 million gallons and intend to continue to take advantage of the additional production allowed pursuant to our permit as long as we believe it is profitable to do so.

 Several upscaling projects will be required to increase the plant’s current production capacity and take full advantage of the additional production allowed under our amended air permit. One such project includes replacing our existing regenerative thermal oxidizer (“RTO”), which was completed during our third fiscal quarter. The RTO replacement project was funded from current earnings from operations. With installation complete, management expects the new RTO will improve emissions control and allow us to continue to maintain regulatory compliance under our amended air permit. 
     In addition, we expect to continue to conduct routine maintenance and repair activities at the ethanol plant. We anticipate using cash we generate from our operations and our revolving term loan to finance these plant upgrade projects.
     In fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, we sold approximately 61.4 million, 59.3 million and 55.4 million gallons of ethanol, respectively.
     Our wholly owned subsidiary, HLBE Pipeline Company, LLC, owns 73% of Agrinatural Gas, LLC (“Agrinatural”).  Agrinatural is a natural gas pipeline company that was formed to construct, own, and operate the natural gas pipeline that provides natural gas to the Company’s ethanol production facility and other customers through a connection with the natural gas pipeline facilities of Northern Border Pipeline Company in Cottonwood County, Minnesota.  Rural Energy Solutions, LLC (“RES”) owns the remaining 27%  non-controlling interest in Agrinatural. 
     Reportable Operating Segments
     Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 280, “Segment Reporting,” establishes the standards for reporting information about segments in financial statements. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance.  Based on the related business nature and expected financial results criteria set forth in ASC 280, the Company has two reportable operating segments for financial reporting purposes.
· | Ethanol Production. Based on the nature of the products and production process and the expected financial results, the Company’s operations at its ethanol plant, including the production and sale of ethanol and its co-products, are aggregated into one financial reporting segment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Natural Gas Pipeline. The Company has majority ownership in Agrinatural, through its wholly owned subsidiary, HLBE Pipeline, LLC, and operations of Agrinatural’s natural gas pipeline are aggregated into another financial reporting segment.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Before intercompany eliminations, revenues from our natural gas pipeline segment represented 2.5%, 2.4%, and 1.8% of our total consolidated revenues in the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  After accounting for intercompany eliminations for fees paid by the Company for natural gas transportation services pursuant to our natural gas transportation agreement with Agrinatural, Agrinatural’s revenues represented 0.9%, 0.9%, and 0.6% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and have little to no impact on the overall performance of the Company. 
     We currently do not have or anticipate we will have any other lines of business or other significant sources of revenue other than the sale of ethanol, distillers’ grains, corn oil and natural gas transportation.  Refer to Note 15, “Business Segments”, of the notes to audited consolidated financial statements for financial information about our financial reporting segments.
     Financial Information
     Please refer to “ITEM 7 - MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” for information about our revenue, profit and loss measurements and total assets and liabilities and “ITEM 8 - FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA” for our consolidated financial statements and supplementary data.

 Ethanol Production Segment
     Revenues from our ethanol production segment have represented 99.1%, 99.1%, and 99.4% of our revenues in the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 respectively. 
     Principal Products
     The principal products from our ethanol production are fuel-grade ethanol, distillers’ grains, non-edible corn oil and miscellaneous sales of distillers’ syrup, a by-product of the ethanol production process.  We did not introduce any new products or services as part of our ethanol production segment during our fiscal year ended October 31, 2016.  
     The table below shows the approximate percentage of our total revenue which is attributable to each of our principal products for each of the last three fiscal years.
    
 | Fiscal Year 2016 | Fiscal Year 2015 | Fiscal Year 2014
Ethanol | 78.6% | 76.9% | 79.7% 
Distillers Grains | 15.5% | 19.4% | 17.1% 
Corn Oil | 4.4% | 2.4% | 2.1% 
Misc. Syrup Sales | 0.6% | 0.4% | 0.5% 

      Ethanol
     Ethanol is a type of alcohol produced in the U.S. principally from corn.  Ethanol is ethyl alcohol, a fuel component made primarily from corn in the U.S. but can also be produced from various other grains. Ethanol is primarily used as:
· | an octane enhancer in fuels;
--+-----------------------------


· | an oxygenated fuel additive that can reduce ozone and carbon monoxide vehicle emissions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a non-petroleum-based gasoline substitute; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | as a renewable fuel to displace consumption of imported oil.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

      Ethanol produced in the U.S. is primarily used for blending with unleaded gasoline and other fuel products as an octane enhancer or fuel additive.  Ethanol is most commonly sold as E10 (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), which is the blend of ethanol approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) for use in all American automobiles. Increasingly, ethanol is also available as E85, a higher percentage ethanol blend (85% ethanol and 15% gasoline) approved by the EPA for use in flexible fuel vehicles.
     Distillers’ Grains
     The principal co-product of the ethanol production process is distillers’ grains, a high protein and high-energy animal feed ingredient primarily marketed to the dairy and beef industries.  Dry mill ethanol processing creates three primary forms of distillers’ grains: wet distillers’ grains, modified wet distillers’ grains, and dried distillers’ grains with solubles.  Most of the distillers’ grains that we sell are in the form of dried distillers’ grains and modified/wet distillers’ grains. Modified/wet distillers’ grains are processed corn mash that has been dried to approximately 50% moisture and has a shelf life of approximately 7 days.  Modified/wet distillers’ grains are often sold to nearby markets. Dried distillers’ grains with solubles are corn mash that has been dried to approximately 10% to 12% moisture.  It has an almost indefinite shelf life and may be sold and shipped to any market and fed to almost all types of livestock.     Corn Oil
     We also extract a portion of the crude corn oil contained in our distillers’ grains which we market separately from our distillers’ grains.  The corn oil that we produce is not food grade corn oil and therefore cannot be used for human consumption. Corn oil is used primarily as a biodiesel feedstock and as a supplement for animal feed.

 Corn Syrup
     We also occasionally sell excess corn syrup in liquid syrup form to livestock feeders.  The excess syrup results from a plant upset, or when the amount of syrup produced during the drying process exceeds our distillers’ grains’ dryer capacity. Corn syrup is used primarily as a feed additive to moisten dry feed stuffs such as hay.     Principal Product Markets
     As described below in “Distribution of Principal Products”, we market and distribute all of our ethanol, distillers’ grains and corn oil through professional third party marketers. Our marketers make all decisions with regard to where our products are marketed and we have little control over the marketing decisions they make. 
     Our ethanol, distillers’ grains and corn oil are primarily sold in the domestic market; however, as markets allow, our products can be, and have been, sold in the export markets. We expect our marketers to explore all markets for our products, including export markets. We believe that there is some potential for increased international sales of our products. Nevertheless, due to high transportation costs, and the fact that we are not located near a major international shipping port, we expect our products to continue to be marketed primarily domestically.  
     Ethanol Markets
     The markets in which our ethanol is sold will depend primarily upon the efforts of Eco-Energy, Inc. (“Eco-Energy”), which buys and markets our ethanol. There are local, regional, national, and international markets for ethanol.  The principal markets for our ethanol are petroleum terminals in the continental U.S. The principal purchasers of ethanol are generally wholesale gasoline distributors or blenders.
     We believe that local markets will be limited and must typically be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.  Although local markets may be the easiest to service, they may be oversold because of the number of ethanol producers near our plant, which may depress the price of ethanol in those markets.
     Typically, a regional market is one that is outside of the local market, yet within the neighboring states.  Some regional markets include large cities that are subject to anti-smog measures in either carbon monoxide or ozone non-attainment areas, or that have implemented oxygenated gasoline programs, such as Chicago, St. Louis, Denver, and Minneapolis.  We consider our primary regional market to be large cities within a 450-mile radius of our ethanol plant.  In the national ethanol market, the highest demand by volume is primarily in the southern U.S. and the east and west coast regions.
     We expect a majority of our ethanol to continue to be marketed and sold domestically. However, as domestic production of ethanol continues to expand, we anticipate increased international sales. Ethanol export demand tends to fluctuate due to the relative strength of the U.S. dollar compared to foreign currencies and monetary and political policies in other nations. As a result, ethanol export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand and tends to fluctuate throughout the year. During our 2016 fiscal year, exports of ethanol produced in the U.S. increased with Canada as the leading importer, followed by Brazil, India, and the Philippines. However, ethanol export demand is more unpredictable than domestic demand and tends to fluctuate throughout the year as it is subject to monetary and political forces in other nations. In addition, the strong U.S. Dollar may have negatively impacted ethanol exports from the U.S. during 2016.
     We transport our ethanol primarily by rail.  In addition to rail, we service certain regional markets by truck from time to time.  We believe that regional pricing tends to follow national pricing less the freight difference.
     Distillers’ Grains Markets
     We sell distillers’ grains as animal feed for beef and dairy cattle, poultry, and hogs. Most of the distillers’ grains that we sell are in the form of dried distillers’ grains.  Currently, the U.S. ethanol industry exports a significant amount of dried distillers’ grains, which may increase as worldwide acceptance grows. During our 2016 fiscal year, the largest importers of U.S. distillers’ grains were China, Mexico, South Korea, Vietnam and Canada.

 Exports of distillers’ grains weakened towards the end of our fiscal year due to the strength of the U.S. dollar and weak economic conditions in China and Europe.  However, the largest impact on distillers’ grains exports resulted from the Chinese anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigation related to distillers’ grains imported into China from the U.S. China is the world’s largest buyer and importer of distillers’ grains, importing nearly all of its needs from U.S. exporters.  The investigation was commenced in response to claims made by Chinese producers that U.S. distillers’ grains were being sold at below normal prices, thereby damaging China’s domestic industry. On January 10, 2017, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce announced its final ruling imposing anti-dumping duties and anti-subsidy tariffs, which were significantly higher than the anti-dumping duties and anti-subsidy tariffs imposed in its preliminary rulings in September 2016. The final Chinese anti-dumping duties will range from 42.2% to 53.7%, up from the 33.8% duty imposed in its September 2016 preliminary ruling, and the final anti-subsidy tariffs imposed will range from 11.2% to 12%, up from 10% to 10.7% in the preliminary ruling. We cannot estimate the exact effect these final duties will have on the overall domestic distillers’ grains market.  However, market prices for U.S. distillers’ grains began to drop in September 2016 in response to the penalties imposed in the Chinese September 2016 preliminary ruling. Consequently, we expect further declines in distillers’ grains demand from Chinese buyers as they switch to alternative lower cost protein sources. Reduced export demand from China will likely put additional downward pressure on the domestic distillers’ grains market resulting in lower U.S. prices unless alternative export markets develop or domestic demand increases.
     We also sell modified wet distillers’ grains, which typically have a shelf life of a maximum of 7 days.  This provides for a much smaller, more local market and makes the timing of its sale critical. Further, because of its moisture content, the modified wet distillers’ grains are heavier and more difficult to handle. The customer must be close enough to justify the additional handling and shipping costs. As a result, modified wet distillers’ grains are principally sold only to local feedlots and livestock operations.
     Various factors affect the price of distillers’ grains, including, among others, the price of corn, soybean meal and other alternative feed products, the performance or value of distillers’ grains in a particular feed market, and the supply and demand within the market.  Like other commodities, the price of distillers’ grains can fluctuate significantly.
     Corn Oil Markets
     Our corn oil is primarily sold to biodiesel manufacturers and, to a lesser extent, feed lot and poultry markets. We generally transport our corn oil by truck to users located primarily in the upper Midwest.     Distribution of Principal Products
     Our ethanol plant is located in Heron Lake, Minnesota in Jackson County. We selected the plant site because of its accessibility to road and rail transportation and its proximity to grain supplies.  The ethanol plant has the facilities necessary to load ethanol and distillers’ grains onto trucks and rail cars.  It is served by the Union Pacific Railroad. Our site is in close proximity to major highways that connect to major population centers such as Minneapolis, Minnesota; Chicago, Illinois; and Detroit, Michigan.     Ethanol Distribution
     Eco-Energy is our ethanol marketer.  Pursuant to our marketing agreement with Eco-Energy, it has agreed to purchase and market the entire ethanol output of our ethanol plant.  Additionally, Eco-Energy arranges for the transportation of our ethanol.  We pay Eco-Energy a marketing fee per gallon of ethanol sold, as well as a fixed lease fee for rail cars leased from Eco-Energy.
     Our agreement with Eco-Energy was set to expire on December 31, 2016. However, on July 22, 2016, we entered into an amendment of our agreement with Eco-Energy which provides for an extension of the term of the agreement through December 31, 2019, with automatic renewals for additional consecutive terms of three years unless either party provides written notice to the other at least 90 days prior to the end of the term or the renewal term. Additionally, the amendment provides for certain negotiated changes to the marketing fee payable to Eco-Energy by us and the timing of payments by Eco-Energy to us for the ethanol Eco-Energy purchases from our plant. The changes to the marketing fee and timing of payments by Eco-Energy were negotiated based on prevailing market-rate conditions for comparable ethanol marketing services.

 Distillers’ Grains Distribution
     Gavilon Ingredients, LLC (“Gavilon”) serves as the distillers’ grains marketer for our plant pursuant to a distillers’ grains off-take agreement.  Pursuant to our agreement with Gavilon, Gavilon purchases all of the distillers’ grains produced at our ethanol plant.  We pay Gavilon a service fee for its services under this agreement. The contract commenced on November 1, 2013 with an initial term of six months, and will continue to remain in effect until terminated by either party at its unqualified option, by providing written notice of not less than 60 days to the other party.     Corn Oil Distribution
     RPMG, Inc. markets the corn oil produced at our ethanol plant pursuant to a corn oil marketing agreement.  We pay RPMG a commission based on each pound of corn oil sold by RPMG under the agreement.
     We independently market and sell the excess corn syrup occasionally produced from the distillation process at our plant to local livestock feeders.
     Dependence on One or a Few Major Customers
     As discussed above, we have exclusive ethanol marketing agreements with Eco-Energy. Additionally, we have agreements with Gavilon and RPMG to market all of the distillers’ grains and corn oil, respectively, produced at the plant. We rely on Eco-Energy, RPMG and Gavilon for the sale and distribution of all of our products, therefore, we are highly dependent on Eco-Energy, RPMG and Gavilon for the successful marketing of our products. Any loss of these companies as our marketing agents for our ethanol, distillers’ grains, or corn oil could have a negative impact on our revenues.     Seasonality of Ethanol Sales
     Since ethanol is predominantly blended with conventional gasoline for use in automobiles, ethanol demand tends to shift in relation to gasoline demand. As a result, we experience some seasonality of demand for ethanol in the summer months related to increased driving. In addition, we experience some increased ethanol demand during holiday seasons related to increased gasoline demand.
     Pricing of Corn and Ethanol
     We expect that ethanol sales will represent our primary revenue source and corn will represent our primary component of cost of goods sold.  Therefore, changes in the price at which we can sell the ethanol we produce and the price at which we buy corn for our ethanol plant present significant operational risks inherent in our business. Trends in ethanol prices and corn prices are subject to a number of factors and are difficult to predict.
     The price and availability of corn is subject to significant fluctuations depending upon a number of factors that affect commodity prices in general, including crop conditions, yields, domestic and global stocks, weather, federal policy and foreign trade. With the volatility of the weather and commodity markets, we cannot predict the future price of corn. Historically, ethanol prices have tended to correlate with corn prices, wholesale gasoline prices, with demand for and the price of ethanol increasing as supplies of petroleum decreased or appeared to be threatened, crude oil prices increased and wholesale gasoline prices increased. However, the prices of both ethanol and corn do not always follow historical trends.  
     Generally, higher corn prices will produce lower profit margins and, therefore, negatively affect our financial performance.  If a period of high corn prices were to be sustained for some time, such pricing may reduce our ability to operate profitably because of the higher cost of operating our plants.  Because the market price of ethanol is not directly related to corn prices, we, like most ethanol producers, are not able to compensate for increases in the cost of corn through adjustments in our prices for our ethanol although we do see increases in the prices of our distillers’ grains during times of higher corn prices. Given that ethanol sales comprise a majority of our revenues, our inability to adjust our ethanol prices can result in a negative impact on our profitability during periods of high corn prices.

 Ethanol prices stayed low during fiscal year 2016, partially in response to lower corn and oil prices, and the large supply of corn and oil.  High U.S. ethanol production levels that outpaced strong domestic consumption and export demand also impacted ethanol prices during fiscal year 2016. The increase in ethanol production resulted from the domestic producers responding to the consistently low corn prices during fiscal year 2016. Additionally, management believes ethanol demand and prices were negatively impacted throughout our 2016 fiscal year by the EPA’s draft proposal to reduce the amount of renewable fuels which are required to be used in the United States pursuant to the RFS. In the past, many fuel blenders used ethanol because of the difference in price between gasoline and ethanol. This voluntary use of ethanol in excess of the requirements in the RFS has decreased due to the fact that the spread between the price of ethanol and gasoline is smaller.
     Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
     The primary raw materials used in the production of ethanol at our plant are corn and natural gas.  Our ethanol plant also requires significant and uninterrupted amounts of electricity and water.  We have entered into agreements for our supply of electricity, natural gas, and water.     Corn Procurement
     Ethanol production requires substantial amounts of corn. The cost of corn represented approximately 74.4%, 74.1%, and 70.0% of our cost of sales for the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  At our current production rate of approximately 64 million gallons of ethanol per year, we need to procure approximately 22 million bushels of corn per year for our dry mill ethanol process.  We believe our facility has sufficient corn storage capacity, with the capability to store approximately 8 days of corn supply.
     We generally purchase corn through spot cash, fixed-price forward, basis only, and futures only contracts. Our fixed-price forward contracts specify the amount of corn, the price and the time period over which the corn is to be delivered.  These forward contracts are at fixed prices indexed to Chicago Board of Trade (“CBOT”) prices. Our corn requirements can be contracted in advance under fixed-price forward contracts or options. The parameters of these contracts are based on the local supply and demand situation and the seasonality of the price. For delayed pricing contracts, producers will deliver corn to us, but the pricing for that corn and the related payment will occur at a later date. We may also purchase a portion of our corn on a spot basis. For our spot purchases, we post daily corn bids so that corn producers can sell to us on a spot basis.
     Typically, we purchase our corn directly from grain elevators, farmers, and local dealers within approximately 80 miles of Heron Lake, Minnesota. We compete with ethanol producers in close proximity for the supplies of corn we will require to operate our plant.  There are 8 ethanol plants within an approximate 50 mile radius of our plant. The existence of other ethanol plants, particularly those in close proximity to our plant, increase the demand for corn and may result in higher costs for supplies of corn. We also compete with other users of corn, including ethanol producers regionally and nationally, producers of food and food ingredients for human consumption (such as high fructose corn syrup, starches, and sweeteners), producers of animal feed and industrial users.
     Since corn is the primary raw material we use to produce our products, the availability and cost of corn can have a significant impact on the profitability of our operations. Corn prices were lower during our 2016 fiscal year as a result of several consecutive years of favorable corn crops which has increased the amount of corn available to us. As a result of these favorable corn crops, we have not had difficulty securing the corn we need to operate the ethanol plant at prices that have allowed us to operate profitably. If we experience a drought or other unfavorable weather condition during our 2017 fiscal year, the price we pay for corn and the availability of corn near our plant could be negatively impacted. If we experience a localized shortage of corn, we may be forced to purchase corn from producers who are farther away from our ethanol plant which can increase our transportation costs.
     Natural Gas Procurement
     The primary source of energy in our manufacturing process is natural gas.  The cost of natural gas represented approximately 5.6%, 6.9%, and 11.4% of our cost of sales for the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

 We do not anticipate any problems securing the natural gas we require to continue to operate our plant at capacity during our 2017 fiscal year or beyond.  We have a facilities agreement with Northern Border Pipeline Company, which allows us to access to an existing interstate natural gas pipeline located approximately 16 miles north from our plant. We also have entered into a firm natural gas transportation agreement with our majority owned subsidiary, Agrinatural.  Under the terms of the firm natural gas transportation agreement, Agrinatural will provide natural gas to the plant with a specified price per MMBTU for an initial term of 10 years, with two automatic renewal options for five years periods.  On July 1, 2014, we entered into an amendment of this agreement pursuant to which we agreed on an early exercise of one of the two automatic five-year term renewals thereby extending the term of the firm natural gas transportation agreement to October 31, 2021.
     We also have a base agreement for the sale and purchase of natural gas with Constellation NewEnergy—Gas Division, LLC.  We buy all of our natural gas from Constellation and this agreement runs until March 31, 2019.
     The prices for and availability of natural gas are subject to volatile market conditions.  These market conditions often are affected by factors beyond our control such as higher prices as a result of colder than average weather conditions or natural disasters, overall economic conditions and foreign and domestic governmental regulations and relations.  Significant disruptions in the supply of natural gas could impair our ability to manufacture ethanol and more significantly, dried distillers’ grains for our customers.  Furthermore, increases in natural gas prices or changes in our natural gas costs relative to natural gas costs paid by competitors may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.
     Electricity
     Our plant requires a continuous supply of electricity. We have an agreement in place to supply electricity to our plant. We do not anticipate any problems securing the electricity that we require to continue to operate our plant at capacity during our 2017 fiscal year or beyond.     Water
     Our plant also requires a continuous supply of water, which we obtain pursuant to an industrial water supply agreement with the City of Heron Lake and Jackson County, Minnesota. We do not anticipate any problems securing the water that we require to continue to operate our plant at capacity during our 2017 fiscal year or beyond.     Risk Management and Hedging
     The profitability of our operations is highly dependent on the impact of market fluctuations associated with commodity prices.  We use various derivative instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk and to reduce the risk that our ethanol production will become unprofitable when market prices among our principal commodities and products do not correlate.  
     In order to mitigate our commodity and product price risks, we enter into hedging transactions, including forward corn, ethanol, distillers’ grains and natural gas contracts, in an attempt to partially offset the effects of price volatility for corn and ethanol.  However, we are not always presented with an opportunity to lock in a favorable margin and our plant’s profitability may be negatively impacted during periods of high grain prices. We also enter into over-the-counter and exchange-traded futures, swaps and option contracts for corn, ethanol and distillers’ grains, designed to limit our exposure to increases in the price of corn and manage ethanol price fluctuations.  
     Although we believe that our hedging strategies can reduce the risk of price fluctuations, the financial statement impact of these activities depends upon, among other things, the prices involved and our ability to physically receive or deliver the commodities involved.  Our hedging activities could cause net income to be volatile from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the change in value of the derivative instruments relative to the cost and use of the commodity being hedged.  As corn and ethanol prices move in reaction to market trends and information, our income statement will be affected depending on the impact such market movements have on the value of our derivative instruments.

 Hedging arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in situations where the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults or, in the case of exchange-traded contracts, where there is a change in the expected differential between the price of the commodity underlying the hedging agreement and the actual prices paid or received by us for the physical commodity bought or sold.  There are also situations where the hedging transactions themselves may result in losses, as when a position is purchased in a declining market or a position is sold in a rising market. Hedging losses may be offset by a decreased cash price for corn and natural gas and an increased cash price for ethanol and distillers’ grains.
     We have established a risk management committee which assists the board and our risk management manager to, among other things, establish appropriate policies and strategies for hedging and enterprise risk. We continually monitor and manage our commodity risk exposure and our hedging transactions as part of our overall risk management policy.  As a result, we may vary the amount of hedging or other risk mitigation strategies we undertake, and we may choose not to engage in hedging transactions.  Our ability to hedge is always subject to our liquidity and available capital.
     Process Improvement
     We are continually working to develop new methods of operating the ethanol plant more efficiently.  We continue to conduct process improvement activities in order to realize these efficiency improvements.     Patents, Trademarks, Licenses, Franchises and Concessions
     We do not currently hold any patents, trademarks, franchises or concessions. We were granted a license by ICM, Inc. to use certain ethanol production technology necessary to operate our ethanol plant. The cost of the license granted by ICM was included in the amount we paid to Fagen, Inc. to design and build our ethanol plant.     Competition
     Ethanol Competition
     We sell our ethanol in a highly competitive market.  Ethanol is a commodity product where competition in the industry is predominantly based on price. On a national scale, we are in direct competition with numerous other ethanol producers.  According to the RFA, as of December 1, 2016, there are approximately 213 biorefineries with a total nameplate capacity of approximately 15.8 billion gallons of ethanol per year, with an additional 237 million gallons of production under construction.  However, the RFA estimates that approximately 3% of the ethanol production capacity in the U.S. was not operating as of December 1, 2016.  
     The largest ethanol producers include: Abengoa Bioenergy Corp.; Archer Daniels Midland Company; Flint Hills Resources, LP; Green Plains, Inc.; POET, LLC and Valero Renewable Fuels, each of which are capable of producing significantly more ethanol than we produce. These producers and other large producers are, among other things, capable of producing a significantly greater amount of ethanol or have multiple ethanol plants that may help them achieve certain benefits that we could not achieve with one ethanol plant. This could put us at a competitive disadvantage to other ethanol producers. 
     The following table identifies the top five largest ethanol producers in the U.S. along with their production capacities.
    
 | Nameplate Capacity
Company | (mmgy) 
Archer Daniels Midland | 1,716 
POET Biorefining | 1,629 
Green Plains, Inc. | 1,461 
Valero Renewable Fuels | 1,400 
Flint Hills Resources LP | 820

 Larger ethanol producers may have an advantage over us from economies of scale and stronger negotiating positions with purchasers.  Large producers own multiple ethanol plants and may have flexibility to run certain facilities while shutting or slowing down production at their other facilities. This added flexibility may allow these producers to compete more effectively, especially during periods when operating margins are unfavorable in the ethanol industry. Some large producers own ethanol plants in geographically diverse areas of the U.S. and as result, may be able to more effectively spread the risk they encounter related to feedstock prices. Some of our competitors are owned subsidiaries of larger oil companies, such as Valero Renewable Fuels and Flint Hills Resources. Because their parent oil companies are required to blend a certain amount of ethanol each year, these competitors may be able to operate their ethanol production facilities at times when it is unprofitable for us to operate our ethanol plant. Further, new products or methods of ethanol production developed by larger and better-financed competitors could provide them competitive advantages over us and harm our business.
     A majority of the U.S. ethanol plants, and therefore, the greatest number of gallons of ethanol production capacity, are concentrated in the corn-producing states of Iowa, Nebraska, Illinois, Indiana, Minnesota, South Dakota, Ohio, Wisconsin, Kansas, and North Dakota.  According to the RFA, as of December 1, 2016, Minnesota is one of the top producers of ethanol in the U.S. with 21 ethanol plants producing an aggregate of approximately 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol per year. Therefore, we face increased regional and local competition because of the location of our ethanol plant.  
     Eco-Energy markets out ethanol primarily on a regional and national basis.  We compete with other ethanol producers both for markets in Minnesota and markets in other states. We believe that we are able to reach the best available markets through the use of our experienced marketer and by the rail delivery methods we use. We believe that we can compete favorably with other ethanol producers due to our proximity to ample grain, natural gas, electricity and water supplies at favorable prices.
     In addition to intense competition with domestic producers of ethanol, we have faced increased competition from ethanol produced in foreign countries. Depending on feedstock prices, ethanol imported from foreign countries may be less expensive than domestically-produced ethanol.  However, foreign demand, transportation costs and infrastructure constraints may temper the market impact on the U.S. Ethanol imports have been lower in recent years and ethanol exports have been higher. However, if demand for imported ethanol were to increase again, demand for domestic ethanol may be reduced, which could lead to lower domestic prices and lower operating margins. Large international companies with much greater resources than ours have developed, or are developing, increased foreign ethanol production capacities. Many international suppliers produce ethanol primarily from inputs other than corn, such as sugar cane, and have cost structures that may be substantially lower than U.S. based ethanol producers including us. Many of these international suppliers are companies with much greater resources than us with greater production capacities.
     Competition from Alternative Fuels and Other Fuel Additives
     Alternative fuels and alternative ethanol production methods are continually under development. New ethanol products or methods of ethanol production developed by larger and better-financed competitors could provide them competitive advantages over us and harm our business.
     We anticipate increased competition from renewable fuels that do not use corn as the feedstock. Many of the current ethanol production incentives are designed to encourage the production of renewable fuels using raw materials other than corn. One type of ethanol production feedstock that is being explored is cellulose. Cellulose is found in wood chips, corn stalks and rice straw, amongst other common plants. Several companies and researchers have commenced pilot projects to study the feasibility of commercially producing cellulosic ethanol. Additionally, a few companies have begun construction or completed commercial scale cellulosic ethanol plants. If this technology can be profitably employed on a commercial scale, it could potentially lead to ethanol that is less expensive to produce than corn based ethanol. Cellulosic ethanol may also capture more government subsidies and assistance than corn based ethanol. This could decrease demand for our product or result in competitive disadvantages for our ethanol production process.

 In addition to competing with ethanol producers, we also compete with producers of other gasoline oxygenates.  Many gasoline oxygenates are produced by other companies, including oil companies.  The major oil companies have significantly greater resources than we have to develop alternative products and to influence legislation and public perception of ethanol. Historically, as a gasoline oxygenate, ethanol primarily competed with two gasoline oxygenates, both of which are ether-based: MTBE (methyl tertiary butyl ether) and ETBE (ethyl tertiary butyl ether).  While ethanol has displaced these two gasoline oxygenates, the development of ethers intended for use as oxygenates is continuing and we will compete with producers of any future ethers used as oxygenates.
     A number of automotive, industrial and power generation manufacturers are developing alternative fuels and clean power systems using fuel cells, plug-in hybrids, electric cars or clean burning gaseous fuels. Electric car technology has recently grown in popularity, especially in urban areas. While there are currently a limited number of vehicle recharging stations, there has been increased focus on developing these recharging stations to make electric car technology more feasible and widely available in the future. Additional competition from these other sources of alternative energy, particularly in the automobile market, could reduce the demand for ethanol, which would negatively impact our profitability.
     Distillers’ Grains Competition
     The amount of distillers’ grains produced annually in North America has increased significantly as the number of ethanol plants increased.  We compete with other producers of distillers’ grains products both locally and nationally, with more intense competition for sales of distillers’ grains among ethanol producers in close proximity to our ethanol plant.  These competitors may be more likely to sell to the same markets that we target for our distillers’ grains.
     Distillers’ grains are primarily used as an animal feed, competing with other feed formulations using corn and soybean meal. As a result, we believe that distillers’ grains prices are positively impacted by increases in corn and soybean prices. In recent years the U.S. ethanol industry has increased exports of distillers’ grains which management believes has positively impacted demand and prices for distillers’ grains in the U.S. However, with the recent imposition of Chinese import duties on U.S. distillers’ grains, distillers’ grains exports have been negatively impacted, increasing the domestic supply of distillers’ grains. Increased domestic supply has had a corresponding negative impact on distillers’ grains prices and has decreased the price of distillers’ grains as compared to a comparable volume of corn. In the event these distillers’ grains exports continue to decrease, it could result in increased competition among ethanol producers for sales of distillers’ grains and could negatively impact distillers’ grains prices in the U.S.
     Government Ethanol Supports
     The ethanol industry is dependent on several economic incentives to produce ethanol, the most significant of which is the federal Renewable Fuels Standard (the “RFS”). The RFS is a national program that does not require that any renewable fuels be used in any particular area or state, allowing refiners to use renewable fuel blends in those areas where it is most cost-effective. The RFS has been, and we expect will continue to be, a significant factor impacting ethanol usage. 
     Under the RFS, the EPA is supposed to pass an annual rule that establishes the number of gallons of different types of renewable fuels that must be used in the U.S. by refineries, blenders, distributors and importers which is called the renewable volume obligations (“RVOs”). The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if one of two conditions is met: 1) there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply, or 2) implementation of the mandate requirement severely harms the economy or environment of a state, region or the U.S.
     The RFS statutory RVO for corn-based ethanol is 14.4 billion gallons in 2014, 15 billion gallons in 2015 and 15 billion gallons in 2016 and each year thereafter through 2022. However, in the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) November 2015 final rule, the RFS RVOs for corn-based ethanol for 2014, 2015 and 2016 were reduced from the statutorily mandated levels.  On May 18, 2016, the EPA released a proposed rule to set the RVO for 2017. The EPA proposed to set the total RVO at 18.8 billion gallons of which 14.8 billion gallons could be met by corn-based ethanol, a moderate increase over the 2016 volume but still below the statutory level. On November 23, 2016, the EPA announced the final rule for 2017 RVOs, which is set at 15.0 billion gallons for corn-based ethanol.  This rule is set at 100% of the original conventional biofuel requirement of 15.0 billion gallons, and is considered a favorable outcome by the industry.

 The following chart illustrates the potential U.S. ethanol demand based on the schedule of minimum usage established by the RFS program through the year 2022 (in billions of gallons):
    
 | | | | | Maximum Amount of Corn-based 
 | | Total Renewable Fuel | Cellulosic Ethanol | Advanced | Ethanol That Can Be Used to 
Year | RVO Source | RVO | Minimum Requirement | Biofuel | Satisfy Total Renewable Fuel RVO
2016 | RFS Statute | 22.25 | 4.25 | 7.25 | 15.00 
 | EPA Final Rule | 18.11 | 0.23 | 3.61 | 14.50 
2017 | RFS Statute | 24.00 | 5.50 | 9.00 | 15.00 
 | EPA Final Rule | 19.28 | 0.31 | 4.28 | 15.00 
2018 | RFS Statute | 26.00 | 7.00 | 11.00 | 15.00 
2019 | RFS Statute | 28.00 | 8.50 | 13.00 | 15.00 
2020 | RFS Statute | 30.00 | 10.50 | 15.00 | 15.00 
2021 | RFS Statute | 33.00 | 13.50 | 18.00 | 15.00 
2022 | RFS Statute | 36.00 | 16.00 | 21.00 | 15.00 

      Current ethanol production capacity exceeds the EPA’s 2016 and 2017 RVO standard which can be satisfied by corn based ethanol.  Beyond the federal mandates, there are limited markets for ethanol. Further, opponents of ethanol such as large oil companies will likely continue their efforts to repeal or reduce the RFS through lawsuits or lobbying of Congress. If such efforts are successful in further reducing or repealing the blending requirements of the RFS, a significant decrease in ethanol demand may result and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, unless additional demand from exports or discretionary or E85 blending develops.
     Many in the ethanol industry believe that it will be difficult to meet the RFS RVOs in future years without an increase in the percentage of ethanol that can be blended with gasoline for use in standard (non-flex fuel) vehicles. Most ethanol that is used in the U.S. is sold in a blend called E10. E10 is a blend of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline. E10 is approved for use in all standard vehicles. Estimates indicate that gasoline demand in the U.S. is approximately 140 billion gallons per year. Assuming that all gasoline in the U.S. is blended at a rate of 10% ethanol and 90% gasoline, the maximum demand for ethanol is 14.0 billion gallons per year.  This is commonly referred to as the “blend wall,” which represents a theoretical limit where more ethanol cannot be blended into the national gasoline pool. This is a theoretical limit because it is believed that it would not be possible to blend ethanol into every gallon of gasoline that is being used in the U.S. and it discounts the possibility of additional ethanol used in higher percentage blends such as E15 and E85. These higher percentage blends may lead to additional ethanol demand if they become more widely available and accepted by the market.
     There is growing availability of E85 for use in flexible fuel vehicles, however it is limited due to lacking infrastructure. In addition, the industry has been working to introduce E15 to the retail market since the EPA approved its use vehicles model year 2001 and newer. However, wide spread adoption of E15 is hampered by regulatory and infrastructure hurdles in many states, as well as consumer acceptance. Additionally, sales of E15 may be limited because: (i) it is not approved for use in all vehicles; (ii) the EPA requires a label that management believes may discourage consumers from using E15; and (iii) retailers may choose not to sell E15 due to concerns regarding liability. In addition, different gasoline blendstocks may be required at certain times of the year in order to use E15 due to federal regulations related to fuel evaporative emissions. This may prevent E15 from being used during certain times of the year in various states. As a result, management believes that E15 may not have an immediate impact on ethanol demand in the U.S.

 Compliance with Environmental Laws and Other Regulatory Matters
     Our business subjects us to various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, including: those relating to discharges into the air, water, and ground; the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation, and disposal of hazardous materials; and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations require us to obtain and comply with numerous permits to construct and operate our ethanol plant, including water, air, and other environmental permits.  The costs associated with obtaining these permits and meeting the conditions of these permits have increased our costs of construction and production.  Additionally, compliance with environmental laws and permit conditions in the future could require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment, as well as significant management time and expense.  A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, and/or plant shutdown, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations.  Although violations and environmental non-compliance still remain a possibility following our conversion from coal to natural gas combustion, the exposure to the company has been greatly reduced.
     In connection with the RTO replacement project, we have filed an application for a major amendment of our air emissions permit with the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (“MPCA”) to allow for the replacement under our current permit. However, on April 27, 2016, we entered into a compliance agreement with the MPCA which allowed us to proceed with replacement of our RTO prior to receiving approval of our major amendment application due to backlog in the permit approval process.  The compliance agreement requires that we operate the new RTO in compliance with our existing air emissions permit and complete certain green initiatives at the facility, including constructing a butterfly and bee garden at the plant site, installing LED lighting throughout the facility, and installing variable frequency drives on our evaporator pumps.  As of the end of our 2016 fiscal year, we had completed construction of the butterfly and bee garden, installation of LED lighting throughout the facility and installation of the variable frequency drives.  
     For the fiscal year ended October 31, 2016, we incurred costs and expenses of approximately $337,000 complying with environmental laws, including the cost of pursuing permit amendments.  Although we have been successful in obtaining all of the permits currently required, any retroactive change in environmental regulations, either at the federal or state level, could require us to obtain additional or new permits or spend considerable resources in complying with such regulations. 
     The RFS was revised by the EPA in July 2010 to adopt rules to determine which renewable fuels provided sufficient reductions in greenhouse gases, compared to conventional gasoline, to qualify under the RFS program. This approach establishes a tiered approach, where regular renewable fuels are required to accomplish a 20% greenhouse gas reduction compared to gasoline, advanced biofuels and biomass-based biodiesel must accomplish a 50% reduction in greenhouse gases, and cellulosic biofuels must accomplish a 60% reduction in greenhouse gases. Any fuels that fail to meet this standard cannot be used by fuel blenders to satisfy their obligations under the RFS program. As adopted by the EPA, the revised regulations provide that corn-based ethanol plants utilizing corn starch that commenced construction prior to December 2007 were grandfathered in and do meet the definition of a renewable fuel under the RFS program. However, the grandfathered production was limited to such plants then-permitted production capacity. As a result, our plant was grandfathered at its then permitted capacity and allowed to generate Renewable Identification Numbers (“RINs”) for 59.2 million gallons per year for compliance with the RFS.
      However, to generate RINs that qualify for compliance with the RFS program for any increased production above the grandfathered gallons, our plant must meet a threshold of a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions from a 2005 baseline measurement to produce ethanol eligible for the RFS mandate. In September 2014, the EPA announced a new expedited petition process, referred to as the “efficient producer” petition, for existing corn starch and grain sorghum ethanol producers to gain pathway approval and qualify to generate RINs for production volumes above those grandfathered under the RFS. On January 13, 2015, we submitted an efficient producer petition to the EPA which was approved by the EPA on March 12, 2015.  In the approval determination, the EPA’s analysis indicated that we achieved at least a 20.1% reduction in GHG emissions for their non-grandfathered volumes compared to the baseline lifecycle GHG emissions.

 Pursuant to the award approval, we are only authorized to generate RINs for our plant’s non-grandfathered volumes if we can demonstrate that all ethanol produced at the plant during an averaging period (defined as the prior 365 days or the number of days since the date of the EPA efficient producer pathway approval) meets the 20% GHG reduction requirement. To make this demonstration, we must comply with the compliance plan we developed and keep certain records as specified in the EPA’s approval.  Additionally, we must register with the EPA as a renewable fuel producer for the non-grandfathered volumes.  Although we believe we will be able to maintain continuous compliance with the 20% reduction in GHG emissions requirement, there is no guarantee that we will do so.  If we do not maintain continuous compliance with the 20% reduction in GHG emissions requirement, we will not be able issue RINs for the non-grandfathered volumes of ethanol produced at our plant.  As a result, we may be forced to rely on export sales for these non-grandfathered volumes of ethanol, which could adversely affect our operating margins, which, in turn could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
     The California Air Resources Board, or CARB, has adopted a Low Carbon Fuel Standard, or LCFS, requiring a 10% reduction in average carbon intensity of gasoline and diesel transportation fuels from 2010 to 2020. After a series of rulings that temporarily prevented CARB from enforcing these regulations, the federal appellate court reversed the federal district court finding the LCFS constitutional and remanding the case back to federal district court to determine whether the LCFS imposes a burden on interstate commerce that is excessive in light of the local benefits. On June 30, 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal of the federal appellate court ruling and CARB recently re-adopted the LCFS with some slight modifications. The LCFS could have a negative impact on demand for corn-based ethanol and result in decreased ethanol prices affecting our ability to operate profitably.        In February 2013, an anti-dumping tariff was imposed as a regulation by the Council of the European Union ethanol produced in the U.S. and exported to Europe. The Company does not export any ethanol to Europe at this time. However, continuation of this duty or imposition of tariffs by other countries or regions could reduce U.S. exports to Europe, and possibly other export markets. A reduction of exports to Europe could have an adverse effect on domestic ethanol prices, as the available supply of ethanol for the domestic market would increase.
     Employees
     We compete with ethanol producers in close proximity of our facility for the personnel required to operate our plant.  The existence and development of other ethanol plants will increase competition for qualified managers, engineers, operators and other personnel.  We also compete for personnel with businesses other than ethanol producers and with businesses located outside the community of Heron Lake, Minnesota.
     As of the date of this report, we have 41 full time employees, of which 7 employees are involved primarily in management and administration and the remaining employees are involved primarily in plant operations.  We do not currently anticipate any significant change in the number of employees at our plant.
     We have entered into a management services agreement with Granite Falls Energy.  Pursuant to the management services agreement, GFE provides its own provides its chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and commodity risk manager to act in those positions as part-time officers and managers of the Company.  Each person providing management services to the Company under the management services agreement is subject to oversight by our board of governors.  However, the chief executive officer is solely responsible for hiring and firing persons providing management services under the management services agreement.
     The initial term of the management services agreement expired on July 30, 2016.  However, the management services agreement automatically renewed for an additional one-year term and will continue to automatically renew for successive one-year terms until either party gives the other party written notice of termination prior to expiration of the then current term. The management services agreement may also be terminated by either party for cause under certain circumstances.
     GFE is responsible for and agreed to directly pay salary, wages, and/or benefits to the persons providing management services under the management services agreement.  Under the terms of the management services agreement, the Company pays GFE 50% of the estimated total salary, bonuses and other expenses and costs (including all benefits and tax contributions) incurred by GFE for the three management positions on a monthly basis with a “true-up” following the close of GFE’s fiscal year.

 Natural Gas Pipeline Segment
     Through our wholly owned subsidiary, HLBE Pipeline Company, LLC, we indirectly own 73% of Agrinatural Gas, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.  RES owns the remaining 27%  non-controlling interest in Agrinatural.  RES is owned by Swan Engineering, Inc. (“SEI”) and an unrelated third party.  SEI provides project management and management and operating services to Agrinatural as described below.
     Agrinatural is governed by a 7 member board of managers.  Under Agrinatural’s operating agreement, we have the right to appoint 4 of the 7 managers and RES has the right to appoint 3 managers.
     Agrinatural is a natural gas distribution and sales company located in Heron Lake, Minnesota.  Agrinatural’s natural gas pipeline originates from an interconnection with the natural gas transmission pipeline of Northern Border Pipeline Company approximately seven miles southwest of Jeffers, Minnesota in Cottonwood County. Agrinatural currently owns and operates approximately 187 miles of pipeline, including 164 miles of distribution mains and 23 miles of service lines. The Agrinatural pipeline was initially installed in 2011 to serve the Company.  Since the initial installation of the pipeline, Agrinatural has added several other commercial, agricultural and residential customers in the communities and surrounding areas of Heron Lake, Jeffers, Delft, Dundee, Storden, and Okabena, Minnesota.  As of October 31, 2016, Agrinatural has approximately 918 customers.
     On March 27, 2015, Agrinatural terminated its prior management and operating agreement with SEI and executed a new management and operating agreement with SEI.  Under the new management and operating agreement, SEI will continue to provide Agrinatural with day-to-day management and operation of Agrinatural’s pipeline distribution business.  In exchange for these services, Agrinatural will pay SEI an aggregate management fee equal to the fixed monthly base fee plus the variable customer management fee based on the number of customers served on the pipeline less the agreed monthly fee reduction of $4,500.  Under the previous management and operating agreement with SEI, Agrinatural paid SEI a monthly fee of $6,000.  The new management and operating agreement with SEI expires July 1, 2019 unless earlier terminated for cause as defined in the agreement.
     On March 27, 2015, Agrinatural also executed a new project management agreement with SEI, replacing the prior project management agreement with SEI. Pursuant to the new project management agreement, SEI will continue to supervise all of Agrinatural’s pipeline construction projects. These projects are constructed by unrelated third-party pipeline construction companies. Under the new project management agreement, Agrinatural will pay SEI a total of 10% of the actual capital expenditures for construction projects approved by Agrinatural’s Board of Directors, excluding capitalized marketing costs. The new project management with SEI expires June 30, 2019 unless earlier terminated for cause as defined in the agreement.
     On March 30, 2015, Agrinatural entered into a restructure agreement with SEI.  Pursuant to the SEI restructure agreement, Mychael Swan, the principal of SEI, resigned as the CEO of Agrinatural effective as January 10, 2015. Mr. Swan will continue to serve as the Chairman of the Agrinatural board of managers.
     On March 31, 2015, Agrinatural entered into a professional services agreement with Wildwood Technology, LLC.  Pursuant to the Wildwood Technology agreement, Wildwood Technology will act as the chief financial officer of Agrinatural through the services of its principal, Ann Tessier.  Pursuant to the Wildwood Technology agreement, Agrinatural will pay Wildwood Technology $6,000 per month for the services provided by Ms. Tessier.  The Wildwood Technology agreement may be terminated at any time upon 30 day prior written notice by either party.
     On April 2, 2015, Agrinatural entered into a professional services agreement with Woodbury Consulting, LLC. Pursuant to the Woodbury Consulting agreement, Woodbury Consulting will act as the chief executive officer of Agrinatural, effective as of January 1, 2015, through the services of its principal, John Sprangers.  Pursuant to the Woodbury Consulting agreement, Agrinatural will pay Woodbury Consulting $150 per hour for the services provided by Mr. Sprangers plus travel expenses.  The Woodbury Consulting agreement may be terminated at any time upon 30 day prior written notice by either party.
     The Company has entered into two intercompany credit facilities with Agrinatural, the July 2014 credit facility (the “Original Credit Facility”) and the March 2015 credit facility (the “Additional Credit Facility”). Under the Original Credit Facility, the Company made a five-year term loan in the principal amount of $3.05 million and pursuant to the Additional Credit Facility, made a four-year term loan in the principal amount of $3.5 million to Agrinatural.

 
  17

 

 On May 19, 2016, the Company amended the Additional Credit Facility, entering into amendment to the loan agreement dated March 30, 2015 and an allonge to the negotiable promissory note dated March 30, 2015 issued by Agrinatural to the Company. Under the terms of the amendment and allonge, the Company agreed to increase the amount of the capital expenditures allowed by Agrinatural during the term of the facilty and defer a portion of the principal payments required for 2016 and capitalize the deferred principal to the balloon payment due at maturity.  
     Details of the Agrinatural credit facilities are provided below in the section below entitled “PART II - ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS - Credit Arrangements”.
     Assets from our natural gas pipeline segment have represented 19.9%, 19.5%, and 18.6% of our consolidated total assets in the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  Agrinatural’s assets consist of distribution main pipelines and service pipelines, together with the associated easement and land rights, a town border station, meters and regulators, office and other equipment and construction in process.
     Agrinatural’s revenues are generated through natural gas distribution fees and sales, including distribution fees paid by the Company pursuant to our firm natural gas transportation agreement with Agrinatural.  Before intercompany eliminations, revenues from our natural gas pipeline segment represented 2.5%, 2.4%, and 1.8% of our total consolidated revenues in the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  After accounting for intercompany eliminations for fees from the Company for natural gas transportation services, Agrinatural’s revenues represented 0.9%, 0.9%, and 0.6% of our consolidated revenues for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively, and have little to no impact on the overall performance of the Company. 
     Financial Information about Geographic Areas
     All of our operations are domiciled in the U.S., including those of Agrinatural, our majority owned subsidiary.  All of the products sold to our customers for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were produced in the U.S. and all of our long-lived assets are domiciled in the U.S. 
     For the principal products of our ethanol production segment, we have engaged third-party professional marketers who decide where our products are marketed and we have no control over the marketing decisions made by our third-party professional marketers.  These third-party marketers may decide to sell our products in countries other than the U.S. However, we anticipate that our products will primarily be sold in the U.S.
