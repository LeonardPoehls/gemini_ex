   ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Corporate History
 
Zenosense, Inc. was incorporated on August 11, 2008 in the State of Nevada. Our authorized common stock currently consists of 500,000,000 authorized shares of common stock, with par value of $0.001.
   The original purpose of the company was to acquire and to develop mineral properties and to engage in the exploration for gold and other mineral properties.  On May 15, 2013, our mining lease expired and we lost our right to explore the mining property.  We then became a shell company, as defined under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, until December 4, 2013, when we entered into the transaction with Sgenia described below.
   In the summer of 2013, we started to look for a new business opportunity.  We became interested in sensory technology devices for use in hospitals and health care environments.  During the latter part of that year, we began to negotiate a license agreement with the developers of such technology (the “Sgenia Technology”), and in December 2013, we entered into a Development and Exclusive License Agreement (the “License Agreement”) with Sgenia Industrial, S.L. (“Sgenia”) and its subsidiaries Sgenia Soluciones, S.L. (“Sgenia Subsidiary”) and ZENON Biosystem, S.L. (“Zenon”), all of which are formed under the laws of Spain. Under the License Agreement product development to date include one to be used in the detection of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus/Staphylococcus aureus (“MRSA/SA”) in the healthcare environment and another for use to detect lung cancer in patients. Under the terms of the License Agreement, we have provided Zenon with capital for the development of the devices that utilizes the Sgenia Technology (the “Sgenia Products”), in exchange for a worldwide, exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell the resulting products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis. The License Agreement gives us additional rights to improvements and developments to the Sgenia Products and future products using the Sgenia Technology. The Company is not currently funding any further development of the Sgenia Technology as certain milestones set forth in the License Agreement have not yet been achieved. Currently, we cannot estimate if and when those milestones will be met, and we have not sought financing for our funding obligations under the License Agreement at this time.
   In May 2016, we were presented with the opportunity to participate with a third party in the development of a novel Point of Care medical diagnostic device targeting cardiac markers with the aim of developing a device for the rapid diagnosis of heart attack and cardiac related illnesses. On June 20, 2016, the Company entered into a joint venture arrangement by way of a Subscription and Shareholders’ Agreement (“MML SSA”) with a third party medical detection device developer (“Partner”) utilizing a joint venture vehicle, MIDS Medical Ltd (“MML”), a UK Limited company of which the Company owns a 40% interest awarded on July 1, 2016, in exchange for our participation in management and funding obligation to support MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively during a Phase 2 development of the Partner’s MIDS universal immunoassay detection technology platform  (“MIDS”) and the development of  a cardiac device (“MIDS Cardiac”) for use at the Point of Care (“POC”).
   To date, our principal operations have been the management of our obligations under the MML SSA and the License Agreement, including the product review, budget determination and capital funding of the development of the MML and Sgenia Products.
   In December 2013, we filed an amendment to our charter to change our name from “Braeden Valley Mines, Inc.” to “Zenosense, Inc.” and to increase the number of our authorized shares of Common Stock from 50,000,000 shares to 500,000,000 shares.  The amendments were approved by our stockholders in November 23, 2013 at the annual meeting of the stockholders. We also entered into capital contribution agreements to reduce the number of outstanding shares held by our prior management, converted some outstanding debt and raised initial working capital, in part to be able to finalize the License Agreement and make the initial development payment.
   As a result of the change of our corporate name to Zenosense, Inc., the trading symbol of the company changed to “ZENO.”
   Business
   During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we actively were engaged in the development of our Point of Care medical diagnostic business. Our core focus, through our joint venture entity, MML, is the development of a novel Point of Care medical diagnostic device targeting cardiac markers which can deliver a high sensitivity assay for the rapid diagnosis of heart attack and cardiac related illnesses.  The trend toward greater POC testing is driven by the faster diagnostic benefits it provides.  Other reasons have also emerged for the high demand of POC testing, including clinical staff shortages, an ageing population, long-term healthcare cost savings and a decrease in reliance on conventional laboratory services.

MML SSA
   We entered into the MML SSA with the Partner, effective June 20, 2016, as subsequently amended on September 28, 2016 and January 31, 2017. These amendments primarily reflected changes in the timings of funds required under the development budget which included a change to the original plan to allow MML to explore a potential enhancement to the MIDS nanoparticle detection method and the exploration of the potential development of a “Magnetic Bridge” detection technique based on the MIDS technology. On January 19, 2017 MML submitted a patent application for this new detection method: "Device and method for accurate measurement of magnetic particles in assay apparatus". Under the terms of the SSA, we were was awarded a 40% equity interest in MML in exchange for management participation and providing funding to support MML during a Phase 1 and prospectively during a Phase 2 development of the Partner’s MIDS universal immunoassay detection technology. MML will have the right, under license, to use the MIDS Intellectual Property (“MIDS IP”) during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party. At no time prior to a sale will the Company’s ownership interest in MML be an equity interest of less than 30%, unless the Company is in default. As a condition of the SSA, MML has entered into a Supply of Services Agreements under which it receives the services of key personnel related to the MIDS development.
   Provided that each Phase 1 Payment is made within 14 days of falling due, the Company also has additional control rights over MML including representation on the board of directors, rights over the appointment and employment of senior management persons, indebtedness, major transactions, budget approval rights, accounting practices and general operational management supervisory rights. The SSA also provides for a Phase 1 contingency funding (the “Contingency”) to be available after March 31, 2017 in an aggregate amount of up to £45,000 (approximately $64,000) to be paid by the Company within 20 days of receiving a written notice from MML.
   The SSA contains various provisions to govern the funding obligations of the Company: if any Phase 1 Payment is not made within 14 days of it falling due (“Default”), the Company’s shareholding in MML may be reduced to zero; if no Contingency is drawn during Phase 1 the Partner will be awarded an enduring 2.5% profit after tax right in MML (“Override”) which will increase to a 15% Override if the Company declines to fund Stage 2; if the Company declines to fund Phase 2 and any Contingency has been drawn, the Partner will be awarded a 15% Override decreased by 0.5% for each £7,500 tranche of Contingency drawn down during Phase 1. Any Override will convert on a ratio of 1% Override to 1% of ordinary shares in the event of a sale of MML.
   The Company’s funding obligation for product development under Phase 1 is subject to an approved budget under the SSA, as amended.  Through December 31, 2016, the Company has provided funding for the MML development of $292,500, and as of that date it has a potential future current obligation to fund approximately $357,500 through the remainder of 2017 for Phase 1 development. The budget may be modified, but only after agreement between us and our Partner. A Phase 2 development is envisaged and subject to the successful conclusion of Phase 1, the Company and the Partner will formulate a new budget at which point MML may independently elect to obtain funding for Phase 2 at MML’s option.
   The License Agreement is governed by English law, and the venue for actions based on the SSA will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.
   Background of MML
   MML has licensed in (from the Partner) a Point of Care (POC), universal immunoassay reader platform (“MIDS”) that intends to deliver gold standard laboratory analyzer levels of precision and sensitivity in a hand held device. The MIDS platform will initially be developed to read high sensitivity assays for the main cardiac biomarker troponin I (cTnI, and Troponin T, cTnT), a critical marker for myocardial infarction (“MI”, “Heart Attack”). A further aim is to create a system capable of testing a panel of up to three cardiac biomarkers from the same sample.
   MML comprises of a small technical team with deep expertise and knowledge in the application of magnetism and electronics into immunoassay POC testing.

Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Markers
   There are over 175,000 heart attacks in the UK each year, equating to one every three minutes1. This means that each day, approximately 480 people will go to hospital after suffering a heart attack - equivalent to one person every three minutes2.

· | The number of heart attack survivors has doubled in the last 40 years as research and healthcare continues to improve.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A 2012 NHS report showed the mortality rate in England during 2002-10 fell by 50% in men and 53% in women3.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Time is of the essence when someone has had or is having a heart attack. Immediate action is critical to limit damage and optimize a better recovery for the patient4. Health care professionals refer to this time frame as the “Golden Hour,“5 which described the critical one hour from the onset of a heart attack. Most deaths occur during this period if not treated properly6.
   Clinical guidelines on chest pain of recent onset recommend taking a blood sample for troponin I or T measurement on initial assessment in hospital as the preferred biochemical markers to diagnose acute MI7. The guideline further recommends a second troponin measurement to be taken 10 to 12 hours after the onset of symptoms8.
   This guidance offers the following guidelines for assessment in hospital for people with suspected ACS;
    
· | Take a resting 12-lead ECG and a blood sample for troponin I or T measurement on arrival in hospital
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Carry out a physical examination
--+---------------------------------


· | Take a detailed clinical history unless ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction is confirmed from the resting 12-lead ECG
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    However, the diagnostic sensitivity of an ECG has been reported as only 55 – 75% for acute myocardial infarction9.
   Cardiovascular diseases represent more than 30% of all deaths globally, which is larger than the combined deaths of other diseases such as cancer, diabetes, respiratory diseases and digestive diseases10.
   Cardiac markers are biomarkers measured to evaluate heart function. They are used in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with chest pain and suspected acute coronary syndrome11.
    
· | A troponin test measures the levels troponin T or troponin I proteins in the blood12. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as occurs with a heart attack13.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Troponins are preferred over traditional markers, such as CK-MB or myoglobin, due to their greater specificity and sensitivity14.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Death from cardiovascular diseases can be preventable with accurate early-stage diagnosis and subsequent proper treatment15.

Troponin tests
   Due to their increased sensitivity and specificity compared with CK-MB and other conventional biomarkers, troponins have been the preferred choice for the diagnosis of heart attacks16. The financial pressure on the NHS of patients occupying beds and requiring monitoring during a traditional 12–24 hour troponin test window is clear17.
   Large cost savings can be made by reducing amount of time a patient would normally spend in A&E waiting for the results of a laboratory troponin test.
   If MIDS Medical’s rapid POCT was introduced many patients could avoid undergoing further tests, and beds could be cleared faster. It is estimated it could save the NHS around £200 million a year18, notwithstanding that a MIDS POC troponin test would command a substantial premium in price over a standard laboratory troponin test.
   Proposed MML Product Development
   MML’s immunoassay diagnostic platform is being developed into a novel POC cardiac device, MIDS Cardiac, which aims to detect extremely low levels (nano-Tesla) of magnetic field disturbance caused by assay test particles. This is expected to enable high sensitivity assays, previously only available on central laboratory analyzers, in a POC setting, on a small, hand-held device. The system is fully automated from the point of application of a small finger-stick blood sample to a test strip - encompassing sample collection, pre-treatment, analyte specific reaction, signal production, signal reaction and final result.
   The technology will incorporate microfluidic strip design, displacement flow immunoassay, magnetic nanoparticle manipulation and a double detection technique comprised of bespoke ‘Hall Effect’ sensors and an optical sensor, which, when combined, will increase the sensitivity and accuracy of the result. The platform’s microfluidic strip will include a sample deposition area, where antibody coated magnetic nanoparticles will be bonded onto the surface. These nanoparticles will only be dislodged if a biomarker is present within the patient’s sample. Upon displacement, the fluid containing the nanoparticles and biomarker will move downstream along the strip’s adapted channels towards collection/sensing areas. These areas will be placed into an external bias magnetic field, which will enable the Hall Effect sensors to detect any magnetic field disturbances caused by the nanoparticles. The level of displacement, and hence the biomarker’s presence, will also be quantified using an optical sensor at the sample deposition surface by taking a reading before and after the progression of the assay.
   MIDS Cardiac will initially be developed using the main cardiac biomarker troponin I (cTnI), a critical marker for myocardial infarction. The aim is to create a system capable of testing a range of cardiac biomarkers from the same sample.
    The MIDS technology’s aims to deliver certain key USPs as follows:
 
 
· | Improve the accuracy of immunoassay biomarker detection to provide quantitative measurements of samples, effectively combining the accuracy of high sensitivity cardiac biomarker assays performed on central laboratory analyzers (“CL”) with the speed and convenience of a POC, hand held device;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rapid analytical time; 3 minutes for a single assay test, much faster than existing, less sensitive POC tests19 and very much faster than CL analyzer tests;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Accuracy and sensitivity will permit the use, for the first time, of rapid HS cTnI tests able to rule / in rule out MI, at the POC;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to use just a 5 ul (a small drop) of finger-stick blood for a single assay test on an easy to use microfluidic test strip, no other POC cTnI device can do this as they require venous draw20;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ability to multiplex up to three assays on a single test strip using a <15ul finger stick blood sample in under 8 minutes; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Very simple operation by relatively untrained operative - can be used very easily at first contact with patient delivering fully automated results with no requirement for expert interpretation by a highly skilled operative.

Market need

  Emergency department
   Patients presenting symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) represent a sizable proportion of total attendees in the emergency department21.
    
· | In the UK, around 700,000 patients attend hospital emergency departments each year with chest pains22.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The current standard policy for dealing with patients admitted in these circumstances is to take a troponin measurement on admission and then again 12 hours afterwards to rule out acute myocardial infarction23.
    
· | A typical district general hospital will see around 6,500 patients present with chest pain of suspected cardiac origin each year24.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NHS Glasgow had reported a lower number of 3,000 patients every year who come to the hospital as an emergency with chest pain25.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Approximately 70% of patients who are admitted to A&E with suspicion of ACS are later ruled out after further investigation26. Conversely, a significant number of patients with ACS are mistakenly discharged home from the emergency department, resulting in avoidable patient mortality27.
    
· | Approximately 2 to 4% of patients with an ACS are mistakenly discharged28.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Around 14,000 and 50,000 patients a year are wrongly sent home by doctors having suffered a mild heart attack that has been missed by current testing methods29.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Subsequently, medical litigation arising from missed diagnosis is increasing at the rate of 20%30.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A way of rapidly and accurately assessing risk status in suspected patients with ACS would benefit efficiency of the emergency department, patient care, and outcomes31.
   Many of the existing practices, including current POC technologies available, lack the required sensitivity and accuracy to provide fully quantitative measurements; a pre requisite now demanded by healthcare professionals of future POC devices. Many use lateral flow systems that limit the ability of the technology to quantify and detect biomarkers requiring multiple reagents.
   Cardiac Biomarker Market
   The global market for in vitro diagnostic tests (both lab based and POC) for cardiac biomarkers was estimated at $3.1 billion in 2012 and nearly $4 billion in 2013. This market is predicted to reach $7.2 billion by 2018, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.8% over the five-year period from 2013 to 201832. The main growth drivers will be new congestive heart failure (CHF) biomarkers, approvals of stroke biomarkers, the growing market in point-of-care testing and the rising awareness of medical care in China and other developing countries33.
   The cardiac marker market is expected to be the fastest growing point of care market segment through to 201834.
   The U.S. has the largest share of the cardiac biomarker market, estimated at roughly $2.0 billion in 2013 with a CAGR of 9.6% forecast from 2013–2018, which will help the U.S. maintain its leading position in the market35.
   In 2013, the European market was valued at about $800 million barely beating out China as the second-largest market behind the U.S.

Development stage
   Initial development has commenced on the MIDS project, including the specification of a bench rig designed to support first stage testing of a sample of Hall Effect Sensors already supplied to MML in order to examine their behavior in the detection of magnetic nanoparticles – the core MIDS technology – and to determine how these Hall Effect Sensors should be optimized prior to integration in a micro fluidic test strip.
   Initial testing of 15.2 nm magnetite nanoparticles in 5 mg/ml aqueous solution has shown excellent linearity of average system output signal against sample drop volume and high levels of output signal, even at sample volumes down to 15 nanolitre size.
   The next stage of the Phase 1 development program will be to develop a “Hybrid Strip” to be used in conjunction with a newly designed test rig, to simulate a final Lab-on-Chip design which is expected to result in greatly improved detection of low numbers of nano-particles.
   Under our arrangement with MML, either MML or our Partner currently is responsible for determining the commercialization strategy. Therefore, they will be the primary party responsible for the regulatory approval process, other aspects of licensing, manufacturing or other production and marketing. The Company will have a secondary management and oversight role in the aspects of commercialization.
   Sgenia License Agreement
   We entered into the License Agreement, effective December 4, 2013, which was subsequently amended, with Sgenia, Sgenia Subsidiary and Zenon that was initially oriented towards the development of a MRSA/SA detection device.  Because the License Agreement covered improvements and variations to the device and other devices based on the Sgenia Technology for use in the hospital and health care environments, the License Agreement was amended and specifically extended to include an additional product to be used for the detection of lung cancer in patients.  In exchange for our funding the development of the Sgenia Products, we obtain a worldwide, exclusive license to manufacture, market and sell the resulting products, subject to certain limitations and a royalty arrangement on a revenue sharing basis.
   Under the License Agreement, as amended, based on our capital resources and the success of the research activities, we will fund the development of the Sgenia Products pursuant to a research and development plan proposed by Sgenia. Development includes the testing of a potential device. The funding will be provided on an advance basis, per month, based on three development stages during the period to be funded.  In return, we will have the exclusive right to manufacture, formulate, package, market and sell the Sgenia Products world-wide, for 40 years, subject to a limitation on the inclusion of Spain.  All intellectual property developed by Sgenia and/or Zenon at any time during the term related to the manufacturing, formulating and/or packaging processes shall be shared ownership and licensed to us on a royalty-free basis.  Sgenia will also supply to us, at a negotiated price based on quantity, all of the requirements for the integrated circuits on microchips that are necessary for the operation of the Sgenia Products.  Sgenia, Zenon and the Company will also work together to research and develop the Sgenia Products and establish written plans and reviewing committees for the management of the overall development project and commercialization of the Sgenia Products.
   The Company’s funding obligation for product development is subject to an approved budget and achieving each stage of development.  Through December 31, 2016, the Company provided funding for the Sgenia Products of approximately $769,787, and as of that date it has a potential future current obligation to fund approximately €656,000 euros through the remainder of 2016 and early part of 2017. The budget may be modified, but only after collaboration and approval by us in our sole discretion. As future products are determined, the Company will formulate new budget obligations and funding requirements.
   In light of our current inability to fund our operations and fund the Sgenia license and the fact that the Sgenia research is delayed, we reviewed with Sgenia the development schedule and funding requirements for the initial products and requirements to develop the cancer sensory devices, and have agreed in principle to an alternative development schedule which would result in the lengthening of the developmental schedule for these products and an increase of the budget requirements. The schedule and funding will be finalized once we have obtained sufficient funding, for which we cannot give any assurance that we will be able to obtain.
   Sgenia and Zenon are responsible for regulatory filings in jurisdictions selected by the Company, subject to the collaborative process and any regulatory approvals are jointly owned by the parties to the License Agreement.
 The expenses of meeting the regulatory requirements will be borne by the Company, subject to its right to approve the regulatory budget, which is separate from the development funding budget.
   In addition to providing the development and regulatory funding, the Company will also pay Zenon royalties for completed sales of the Sgenia Products, payable 60 days after each fiscal quarter of the Company (the “Royalties”).  The Royalties will be 20% of net sales, which is calculated based on gross sales of the device and the installation and training for the Sgenia Products, less various expenses, including manufacturing, components acquired from Sgenia, commissions, refunds and discounts and sales taxes.  If the Sgenia Products are sold by Sgenia or Zenon in Spain for original use in Spain, then the Royalties will be reduced. The Company also has the right to sublicense to other parties throughout the world, except in Spain if and when, if at all, Sgenia or Zenon seek to act as the distributor in that territory.
   Sgenia and Zenon have granted the Company the first right to negotiate for a license to any improvements and variations of the Sgenia Products that are not currently included in the license or other commercial uses of the sensory technology that is based on the Sgenia patents for use in relation to hospital acquired infections, which currently are not licensed under the License Agreement, and for products developed for any other commercial uses for the sensory technology based on the patents held by Sgenia Soluciones and its affiliates.
 
The License Agreement may be terminated by either party if a party commits a material breach that is not cured in 90 days after the non-breaching party provides a notice of the breach.  Upon the termination of the License Agreement for any reason other than the Company’s failure to cure a material breach, the Company has the right to dispose of any of the Sgenia Products then on hand, and to complete orders for Sgenia Products then on order.
 
All the parties have agreed to various collaboration obligations to assure and maintain the quality of the Sgenia Products, to oversee manufacturing, marketing and pricing and achieving marketing objectives. The obligations extend to the budgeting and expense of development of the Sgenia Products.

   The Sgenia Products, once manufactured and distributed, may only be sold under the limited warranties of having been manufactured in accordance with specifications, practices and procedures established by the parties, to be free of material defects and free from contamination and to be manufactured and labeled in accordance with applicable health laws and regulations.
   Sgenia is responsible for prosecuting, maintaining and protecting its patents and patent applications on which the Sgenia Products are based.  The Company may request Sgenia to take action to stop competitive infringement of the Sgenia Products, and take over the responsibility for such action if Sgenia does not act, and retain any award achieved by Company action.
 
The License Agreement is governed by New York law, and the venue for actions based on the License Agreement is to be in New York.
 
Background of Sgenia
   Sgenia and its subsidiaries are known for its sensor development and is a supplier of sensors related to the control of the Tokamak device used in a nuclear fusion research project. The Tokamak is one of several types of magnetic confinement devices, and is one of the most-researched candidates for producing controlled thermonuclear fusion power. Sgenia is a developer and supplier of the sensors, as well as the sensor technology, applied to the control system. Sgenia has also produced an algal contamination detector for use in water supply applications. The algal sensor scans for the volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) emitted by the target algae. The VOCs form a unique “chemical signature” which may be detected to rapidly and effectively determine the presence or absence of the algae. The Sgenia detector is effectively an electronic “nose” that can “smell” this signature. This algae sensor system underwent a successful eighteen month trial and is under contract with a Madrid area water supplier in Spain. It is likely to be rolled out as a networked solution across the water company’s operations.
 
The Sgenia team of engineers and scientists are considered very skilled and have years of experience.  The team that will be employed in the development of our product will include Mr. J. Lama, MBA, BSc, a materials engineer, Ms. M. I. Gil, a specialist in sensor technologies and advanced technical and software development and Mr. G. Roman Perez, a physicist.  In addition, the team requires several biologists contracted to Zenon, including molecular biologists and biochemists specializing in bacterial physiology and genetics, clinical microbiology and molecular biology. The team’s combined skillset includes deep knowledge of the clinical genetics to be addressed in order to program and refine the sensory technology so that it can detect SA and ideally discriminate between MRSA and SA in the health care delivery environment and so that it can be used to detect lung cancer in patients. Variously, members of the team are business (biotechnology) management qualified, have co-authored numerous scientific publications, taught as professor, have experience of the practical clinical setting in hospital and have co-invented patents for others.
   Lung Cancer
   Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer in both men and women in the United States, with an estimated 226,160 new cases and 164,770 deaths in 2012. The five year survival rate for lung cancer is 16%36, killing more people than breast, prostate and colon cancer combined37.  The primary reason lung cancer is so deadly is that only 30% of diagnoses are made in the early stages (Stages I and II). Stage I lung cancer has a 70% cure rate, but by Stage III or later fewer than 25% of cases can be cured.
   Consequently there is a huge need to find a solution to detect lung cancer at an early stage. In 2002 the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) was launched, using Computed Tomography (CT) for rapid screening at low dose38. The study looked at 53,454 current or former heavy smokers from 33 medical centers in the US. Results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine on August 4, 2011 which reported that low-dose CT scanning was associated with a 20% decrease in deaths from lung cancer. However, there are a number of uncertainties and apparent limits of lung CT screening. These include39:

· | High rates of false positives – a non-calcified nodule of any size will be found in 50% of those screened and 98% of those will be false positives
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Over diagnosis – cancers identified and treated which, if left alone, would not have impacted long-term morbidity or mortality
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Radiation Risks – concern over the risks of radiation exposure associated with serial CT imaging and its role in the development of future lung or other cancer
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Cost-effectiveness – the NLST found that the number of high-risk patients needed to be screened with CT to save one life from lung cancer was 320. Consequently, estimates of the cost of CT screening vary from as low as $19,000 up to about $169,000 per life-year saved

Healthcare –Associated Infections (HAI’s) and MRSA
   HAI’s or infections acquired in healthcare settings are the most frequent adverse event in healthcare delivery worldwide, with hundreds of millions of patients affected by healthcare-associated infections, leading to significant mortality and financial losses for health systems. Of every 100 hospitalized patients at any given time, 7 in developed and 10 in developing countries will acquire at least one HAI40.
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), part of the US Department of Health and Human Sciences, estimate that one in every 20 patients treated in U.S. hospitals develop an HAI. Approximately 2 million HAIs are associated with nearly 100,000 deaths each year and directly responsible for at least 23,000 deaths per year in the United States alone (http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/threat-report-2013/pdf/ar-threats-2013-508.pdf#page=11).
 The CDC takes the view that advanced molecular detection technologies, which can identify threats much faster than current practice, are not being used as widely as necessary in the United States, and that developing better diagnostic tools to rapidly and accurately find sources of contamination will improve antibiotic use41.
   Recent studies suggest that implementing prevention practices can lead to up to a 70 per cent reduction in certain HAIs42 43. The financial benefit of using these prevention practices is estimated in a report released by CDC to be as high as $25.0 billion to $31.5 billion in medical cost savings in the United States44.
   MRSA continues to account for a significant proportion of HAIs and is regarded as one of the most important causes of antimicrobial-resistant HAIs worldwide45.Furthermore, MRSA is becoming resistant to a growing number of antibiotics46.
 
Proposed Zenosense MRSA/SA Product
   Under our license agreement, Sgenia will develop a MRSA/SA device for Zenosense based on the sensor platform already developed by Sgenia, but with modifications so that it can use a single low cost sensor to sample the air and continuously monitor for the airborne the VOC signatures emitted by MRSA/SA. The MRSA/SA VOC signatures are emitted when the bacteria has infected and expressed itself as a disease in the patient. We believe that MRSA/SA can be detected prior to the patient being obviously symptomatic, enabling an earlier intervention to contain and control its effect and spread.
   Our MRSA/SA detection device is intended to be low cost because it will employ standard components, with the only proprietary elements being the Sgenia chip with its pre-loaded processing software. Essentially, the device is intended to work by utilizing a single standard sensor to continuously scan for the MRSA/SA signature spectrum of the VOC. In the proposed Sgenia developed MRSA/SA device a single sensor will perform the entire VOC spectrum scan, as Sgenia’s adaptive processing software enables it to perform an effectively infinite number of scans, creating tens of thousands of “virtual sensors” from a single sensor. The proposed product is being designed to eliminate the need for 8 to 32 sensors (as in competitor devices) with all the supporting processors, circuit boards and power supply, where each sensor is pre-set to detect a certain part of the MRSA/SA spectrum of VOCs. It is expected that our product will result in a huge cost saving compared to a product requiring an array of individual sensors.
 
At the detection stage the VOC detection will be electronically processed and will be pattern processed in a neural network on the patented applied for Sgenia hardware. The patent application was made on the January 17, 2013, under the reference P201330048with the title (translated from Spanish) “Method of Analysis of a gas and artificial nose”.
   The patent application description refers to: a method that allows the use of a single sensor to act as an unlimited number of sensors: a method of analysis of a gas through an artificial bio-inspired “nose” of general application that uses strategies for adaptive modulation of the sensor's parameters to fit the detection purpose of the nose. This enables an artificial nose of smaller dimensions than one with multiple sensors resulting in good portability, a wide range of applicability and reduced production costs.
   The proposed device will also be designed to effectively “learn” to identify the MRSA/SA VOC signature. The VOC signature is referenced to parameters in Sgenia’s software so as to enable continual scanning across the MRSA/SA VOC spectrum to recognize the VOC patterns and contamination positioning - the system will be designed to be able to discriminate between bacterial VOCs and contamination. The algorithmic software will be protected as an Industrial Secret by FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) “lock and key” encryption on Sgenia’s chip.
   The device is intended to be produced in two forms: 1) a low cost wearable / bed positioned device, powered by a rechargeable battery to be positioned on the person; patients and medical staff, and in the event of any infection, the MRSA device will detect the VOCs produced by the infected person and express an audio/visual alarm; and 2) an adapted, fixed device positioned in the room, mains powered, with culture-amplification of any MRSA/SA presence, to monitor the room volume, which would be network monitored.
   The device is intended to detect MRSA or SA. In the event of a positive detection further personal, conventional tests would be used to discriminate between MRSA and SA, as both infections require specific treatment. The MRSA/SA VOC detection range is estimated to correlate to an approximate 3 meter “bubble” around an infected patient, ideal for a wearable device. However, it is our intention to explore during the development program whether MRSA versus SA VOC signatures can be discriminated by the device. The Sgenia detection technology is very sensitive. If the VOC signature of the genetically different MRSA can be separated from the signature of SA, there is a prospect that such a discriminatory device can be developed.
 
A prototype device was created, which in the laboratory setting successfully achieved a sensibility detection rate greater than 95% on cultured headspace in a series of tests over a two week period in a clinical setting.  The next major developmental step is to progress to Quartz Crystal Microbalance sensor testing, sensitivity testing against VOC biomarkers, assessment of accuracy and repeatability, and review the sensitivity to temperature, humidity and gas interference factors. This developmental step will be difficult to achieve in a technical sense, and if this is not successful, the design of the device may have to be altered or it may be determined that the device cannot be manufactured and used on a commercial scale.  At this time it is early to formulate a conclusion about the device.

Proposed Zenosense Cancer Detection Product
   As a result of the work performed by Zenon for the MRSA/SA product and based on the Sgenia Technology, an additional product has been developed intended for use in detecting lung cancer in patients. The Company believes that a cost-effective lung cancer detector that analyzes exhaled breath could meet or exceed the accuracy of low dose Computed Tomography (CT) scanning.  The Company further believes that such a device will have wide appeal and be in significant demand for the early detection of lung cancer.
   The lung cancer detection device incorporates components designed to filter out the VOCs that must be excluded for optimized detection of target VOC biomarkers found in exhaled breath and associated with the incidence of lung cancer. These components and their elements include molecular sieves incorporated in complementary layered and mixed sensor structures to screen incoming VOCs, and a nanometric sensing mesh to maximize the detective area. Zenon has developed new metal oxide materials and combinations of metal oxides, a complementary quartz crystal sensor employing a gas sorbent substrate and a micro gas chromatography chip for pre-detection screening. All components are of a relatively low cost consistent with the Company's intent to create cost effective products.
   Zenon manufactured prototype devices and, thereafter, entered into a collaboration agreement for a lung cancer detection trial in December 2015. The agreement for the trial is with a large university hospital and several associated hospitals located in the region of Madrid, Spain. The trial aims to identify certain distinctive volatile organic compounds in exhaled breath, using standard laboratory instruments and techniques, alongside the Zenon lung cancer detection devices. Standard techniques will be used to identify lung cancer biomarkers previously determined to be of interest, and the Zenon devices will be tested as to their ability to detect those biomarkers. The results will be analyzed to determine the relative efficacy of the devices to detect lung cancer.
   The initial trial is expected to take nine months and was scheduled for 2016.  However, the trial commenced only in a limited capacity primarily due to Zenon failing to complete certain milestones in Stage One of the development plan. The Company believes this has impacted its ability to raise further funds to progress the development. We have received confirmation from Zenon that they can still proceed as planned once we secure adequate funding however this will be subject to cooperation and agreement from certain relevant hospitals which at this time cannot be relied upon. The trial is designed to examine samples from a 400 subject population split into four groups to cover apparently healthy smokers, non-smokers, and those with diagnosed lung cancer and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. Initially a total of three hospitals will be involved in the trial, the collaborating university hospital and two hospitals associated with it; the trial has been approved by the ethics committee of the university hospital which allows participation by any public hospital in Spain without further approvals. The intention, given this opportunity, is to considerably increase the size of the trial beyond the 400 subject population, subject to positive initial results. The costs to the Company associated with the 400 subject trial are expected to be lower than the amount set out in its development budget previously approved by the Company in July 2015 due to several factors. First, as a result of the hospital collaboration and the use of their equipment, there will no longer be a requirement to purchase SIFT/MA (or PTRMS) equipment resulting in a saving of approximately $269,000 as set out in the July budget. Secondly, there has been a significant strengthening of the United States Dollar which at this point also results in a significant reduction in the budget due to costs being paid in Euros.
   During 2016 the Company only provided minimal development funding to Zenon under the Company’s License Agreement with Sgenia because of Zenon’s not completing Stage One of the development plan. The funds provided were to maintain the development project, and to assist Zenon in its efforts to complete Stage One and to begin work on Stage Two, in the expectation that the development project would progress once full funding was available. During 2016, the Company focused much of its efforts on trying to raise those funds.
   Highlights of the development work in 2014 and 2015 included:
    
· | A new sensor for MRSA was manufactured and tested (in-vivo) with 20 selected subjects, half of whom were carrying MRSA. There was no improvement of results and the target of 95% sensibility has not been achieved.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A series of ten new nanosensors for the lung cancer device were manufactured and a final prototype of the lung cancer device was finished and two devices were manufactured. These two devices are intended to be used in the testing of patients during the hospital trial.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Development of the algorithms to improve pattern recognition.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Approval of the Ethical Committee to allow testing in three national hospitals in Spain.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Preparation for and assessment of applying for intellectual property protection.

Potential Revenue Lines
   The Company currently does not generate any revenue.  The potential for any revenue is dependent on the development of the MML and Sgenia Products, for which no assurance can be given. If the development of the MML and Sgenia Products is successful, the Company believes that its principal sources of revenues will be from sales of the Sgenia Products and service fees from the training of personnel in the use of the Sgenia Products. There is no assurance that a marketable product will be developed, approved by regulatory authorities, manufactured or successfully distributed and sold.  There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to generate any revenues in the future.  The Company will need substantial funding for all the phases of its business plan before it is able to generate any revenues.  The Company has no identified sources of capital for all aspects of its financial needs under the current business plan.

Sgenia Manufacturing and Supplies
   Under the License Agreement, the Company has the right to manufacture the Sgenia Products.  The development plan of the Sgenia Products includes the obligation of the developer to create the manufacturing design and provide it to the Company for use by the selected product manufacture. The manufacturing design is to be provided on a royalty free basis. The Company and Sgenia and Zenon will collaborate on the manufacturing design, process and selection of manufacturer. Neither the Company nor Sgenia and Zenon have manufactured devices similar to the proposed Sgenia Products, therefore there can be no assurance that they will be successful in their designing of a product that can be manufactured on a commercial scale.
 
One of the essential components in the Sgenia Products is a microchip that carries the integrated circuits necessary for their operation. Sgenia and Zenon will provide the necessary microchip integrated circuit with the required microprocessing circuitry, which will be imprinted by Sgenia and Zenon at their facilities with the circuitry based on the intellectual property of Sgenia.  Sgenia and Zenon will supply the chip to the Company on an as required basis, from time to time, at fixed, negotiated prices depending on the quantities ordered.  Sgenia and Zenon have only obtained microchips on a test basis, to date, and therefore there can be no assurance of their ability to obtain the necessary quantities of the microchips and imprint them at their facilities in commercial quantities at the necessary quality level. While we believe Sgenia and Zenon will be able to adequately supply the Company requirements for this component, if they fail in their obligation, then under the terms of the License Agreement the Company has the right to obtain the microchip component from other suppliers and obtain the design of the circuitry from Sgenia and Zenon for our own manufacture of the microchips. No assurance can be given that in the event of a default by Sgenia and Zenon that the Company will be able to obtain the circuitry and to be able to continue to produce the Sgenia Products.
   The Company plans to subcontract commercial manufacturing of the Sgenia Products. It is anticipated that a number of the parts will be standard electronic components that are readily available in the manufacturing market.  For those components that are not obtained from open sources and not obtained from Sgenia and Zenon, the Company believes that there are numerous manufacturers throughout the world that are capable of producing the necessary additional parts that will comprise the Sgenia Products and that are capable of assembling the Sgenia Products, at a high quality level and efficient rate of production for prices that will work commercially within the projected pricing of the Sgenia Products.  Notwithstanding this belief, there is no assurance that the Company will be able to locate all the necessary parts or be able to locate a competent manufacturer to assemble the devices at prices and quality levels to ensure product acceptance in the market.
   MML Manufacturing and Sales
   The MML technology is in development, design having taken place in mind for manufacturing, but with no manufacturing planned as yet. With the exception of the Sgenia specific microchip supply, any MML manufactured products will be subject to broadly the same risks as above. In addition, MML will rely on the supply of a bespoke nano-magnetic sensor from a particular chosen manufacturer. If required, there is no assurance a suitable alternative supplier can be found, as there are a limited number of suppliers in this field.
   Regulation
   The Company expects that both the MML and Sgenia Products (together the “Products”) will be subject to differing levels of regulation in each of their intended markets. Regulation will be oriented towards the efficacy of the Products for their intended purpose, in the healthcare environment and safety. Currently, the first market being contemplated for the MML Products is outside of the United States, followed by the United States and for the Sgenia products the United States.  This will require obtaining approvals from the U.S. Federal Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) in advance of the manufacture and marketing and sale of the Sgenia Products.  The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FD&C Act”) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the research, design, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, approval or clearance, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, servicing, promotion, import and export, and distribution of medical devices.
   In respect of the MRSA/SA device, because it is not based on in vitro analysis, the Company does not believe it will be subject to the FDA guidance relating to the analytical and clinical performance of nucleic acid-based in vitro diagnostic devices (“IVDs”) intended for the detection and differentiation of MRSA and SA, which was issued in 2011. That regulation is oriented to culture based, blood sample based analytics in laboratory settings. Notwithstanding that, we anticipate that our Sgenia Products will be regulated as a medical device.
   Under the License Agreement, Sgenia and Zenon are responsible for obtaining the required regulatory approvals for the Sgenia Products.  We have the right of notice and to participate in the regulatory process, and we will be responsible for funding the associated expenses.  Sgenia and Zenon, as well as ourselves, have not ever before sought regulatory approval from the FDA or any other agency for any medical devices, including those in Europe. We plan to engage professionals to help or take over the regulatory process, which will add expense to our development costs that we cannot estimate at this time. There is no assurance that we will be able to pursue regulatory approval or obtain the necessary licensing.
   Under the SSA, MML will be solely responsible for obtaining the required regulatory approvals for the MML Products.
   FDA Regulation
   Unless an exemption applies, we believe that each medical device that we plan to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require prior pre-market notification and 510(k) clearance from the FDA.  Although we cannot determine with certainty at this time because the Products are still in the development stage, we believe that they will be categorized as either a Class I or Class II device.
   The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices being placed in Class I or II require fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, pre-market notification, and adherence to the FDA’s Quality System Regulation (a set of current good manufacturing practice requirements put forth by the FDA, which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of finished devices) (“QSR”). Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, as well as general controls. Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the premarket notification, or 510(k), clearance requirement or the requirement of compliance with certain provisions of the QSR. Devices will be placed in Class III and will require approval of a PMA application (i) if insufficient information exists to determine that the application of general controls or special controls of the device are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, or (ii) if they are life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or (iii)  if the FDA deems these devices to be “not substantially equivalent” either to a previously 510(k) cleared device or to a “pre-amendment” Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which PMA applications have not been required.
   Clinical trials are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) to the FDA. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as laboratory testing results, and a testing protocol that is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and effectiveness, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria.
     
 12
 
 
Any clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators.
   The withdrawal of previously received approvals or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
   After a device is approved or cleared and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
    
· | establishment registration and device listing;
--+-----------------------------------------------


· | QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The FDA enforces regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance. Inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. Thus, we must continue to spend time, money, and effort to maintain compliance.
   Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions:
  
· | warning letters;
--+-----------------


· | fines and civil penalties;
--+---------------------------


· | unanticipated expenditures;
--+----------------------------


· | delays in approving or refusal to approve our applications, including supplements;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | withdrawal of FDA approval;
--+----------------------------


· | product recall or seizure;
--+---------------------------


· | interruption of production;
--+----------------------------


· | operating restrictions;
--+------------------------


· | injunctions; and
--+-----------------


· | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

  
Contract manufacturers, specification developers, and some suppliers of components will be required to manufacture the Segnia and MML's Products in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. We expect that subcontractors’ manufacturing facilities will be subject to domestic and international regulatory inspection and review. If the FDA believes contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down the manufacturing operations of contract manufacturers, require recall of products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you that we or MML will be able to comply with all applicable FDA regulations.
   Non-FDA United States Government Regulation
   The advertising of our products will be subject to both FDA and Federal Trade Commission regulations. In addition, the sale and marketing of medical devices are subject to a complex system of federal and state laws and regulations intended to deter, detect, and respond to fraud and abuse in the healthcare system. These laws and regulations restrict and may prohibit pricing, discounting, commissions and other commercial practices that may be typical outside of the healthcare business. In particular, anti-kickback and self-referral laws and regulations will limit our flexibility in crafting promotional programs and other financial arrangements in connection with the sale of our products and related services, especially with respect to customers seeking reimbursement, if available, through Medicare or Medicaid and other government programs. Sanctions for violating federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, money penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or both. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on those receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs.
     
 13
 
 
Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These state laws typically impose criminal and civil penalties similar to the federal laws.
   In the ordinary course of their business, medical device manufacturers and suppliers have been and are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Federal and state legislation has increased funding for investigations and enforcement actions, which have increased dramatically over the past several years. This trend is expected to continue. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased, due in large part to amendments to the Civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private persons to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by private persons, known as qui tam relaters, may be filed by almost anyone, including physicians and their employees and patients, our employees, and even competitors.
   International Device Regulation
   The medical device regulatory process for international distribution is subject to government regulations that will vary by country from those having few or no regulations to those having extensive pre-market controls and pre-market acceptance.
   In the EU, for example, medical devices require a Conformité Européenne (“CE”) Mark in order to be placed in the market. The CE Mark certifies that a product has met EU consumer safety, health and environmental requirements. CE marking requires meeting the conditions of the European Directive which relates to the medical device to be approved. These directives generally regulate the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling, and post-market surveillance reporting activities for medical devices. Once the CE mark has been duly applied to a device, the manufacturer may commercially distribute the product in all countries that are members of the European Union, and in several other countries that recognize the CE Mark, such as Switzerland and Turkey. Similar to the US, once the device has received the CE mark, companies are required to report certain serious adverse events, are required to conduct post-market surveillance, and in some countries are required to register or list the products.
   The CE mark allows manufacturers to place products on the market and permits free movement of goods. The manufacturer/product owner and its authorized representative in the EU are responsible for all aspects of the product assessment, testing, documentation, declaration of conformity and CE marking, even where a formal processing agent, the notified body, is required, as in the case of non-European based manufacturers. In all cases the manufacturer and representative assume the full responsibility and liability even when using the services of a consultant or test laboratory. Liability is not transferrable to third parties, including the notified body which is required for processing the certification. Generally, there is strict liability applied to medical devices subject to the CE marking by directive 85/374/EEC, and testing and reporting does not change or reduce this liability.
   The European Commission has proposed a new regulatory scheme for medical devices. The proposals, which are currently being discussed by the Council of the European Union, will impose significant additional obligations on medical device companies. The changes being proposed will increase from the current regulation stricter requirements for clinical evidence and pre-market assessment of safety and performance, new classifications to indicate risk levels, requirements for third party testing by government accredited groups for some types of medical devices, and tightened and streamlined quality management system assessment procedures.  Additionally, the new regulations will require clinical evidence as well as analytical performance levels, the details of which are yet to be provided. If additional provisions proposed by the European Parliament are included in the new regulatory scheme, then there will be involvement of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in regulation of some types of medical devices, in the qualification and monitoring of notified bodies (NBs), and enhancing the roles of other bodies, including a new Medical Devices Coordination Group (MDCG).  The European Parliament’s proposed revisions would impose enhanced competence requirements for NBs and “special notified bodies” (SNBs) for specific categories of devices. Although the extent of the proposed regulations is currently uncertain the medical device industry anticipates that there will be significant changes under these initiatives to the regulation of medical devices which will increase the time and costs for obtaining CE marking.
   To facilitate CE Mark approval, it may be beneficial or necessary to complete the International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) certification process for the Company’s comprehensive management system for the design and manufacture of medical devices.
   Sgenia Marketing and Customers
   We intend to seek as our first customers the distributors of medical devices and hospitals.  The use of medical device distributors is an efficient way to market and to place our device into the mix of products available to health care providers and to gain immediate exposure to the end users based on a distributor’s network of clients.  We also will seek entry directly with hospitals, hospital medical clinical chains and cancer centers, as they are the most likely to be interested in our products.  The Company currently does not have any distribution agreements or other arrangements of any kind in place and has not done any marketing to any distributors or specific end users. There can be no assurance given that the Company will be able to establish any distribution agreements or arrangements, or that health care providers will be interested in our products.
   As a supplement to the use of distributors, we plan to use other forms of direct sales, presentations and appointments with healthcare associations and distributors in the healthcare industry to generate recognition and acceptance of our products. We also plan to use print media and brochures in conjunction with our distribution and sales efforts.
   We plan to use trade shows, demonstration opportunities and similar venues to increase brand awareness and product understanding and recognition. These venues can also foster valuable business partnerships. Generally, these trade shows are held on a regular annual basis and attract the important companies and users within the industry, which will provide a valuable venue for the Company to showcase the company and its products.
 
We also plan to offer training in the use of the Sgenia Products.  We believe that this will be necessary not only at the initial installation of the devices but on an ongoing basis as personnel at the health care facilities in which our products are being used changes over time.  We anticipate being able to charge for the initial and on-going training, and anticipate it being an important, supplemental revenue source.
 
For our MRSA/SA product, we also anticipate having to provide certain consulting services with respect to the environment design and installation of our products.  Although installation will be the responsibility of the end user, the placement of a device can be important in its efficiency to detect MRSA/SA.  We plan on charging separately for this service.
 
Being able to offer training on an ongoing basis and installation consulting will be an additional marketing tool because most medical device users do not want to be unable to obtain training for their personnel on a regular basis or mis-install a device so as to get the full benefit of their capital commitment in medical devices. The assurance that we will be able to help them get the full benefits of their devices, in terms of placement and use, will provide the end user comfort in that they will have the necessary support from the device manufacturer and seller.

Competition
   The Company is aware of a number of companies attempting to develop lung cancer detection devices and other detection technologies that are based similar “electronic nose” principles to the Sgenia Products. At this time there are a number of producers of MRSA/SA detection devices that rely on blood, swab and DNA testing rather than e-nose technologies.  Because hospital acquired infections are such a growing problem and deadly in many instances, it is likely that there will be other entrants into the market for developing and selling detection systems, whether based on in vitro or other technologies.  We anticipate that many of these companies, including those identified above, will be better capitalized, have established market presence and have internal development teams able to develop new and different products in competition with the product anticipated to be developed under the License Agreement.  Moreover, such companies have an established market presence with products that have received FDA approval and are perceived by health care providers to be working to solve the problem.  Therefore, the Company, in marketing its product, will have to overcome the established positions of then current products and establish a reputation among its customers that the Sgenia Product is reliable, cost effective and problem solving.
   The POC cardiac testing market proposed to be addressed by the MML MIDS technology, particularly POC troponin testing in the first instance, is serviced by a number of international companies which have devices in the market. However, in the Company’s considered view, none of these products achieve the levels of sensitivity and accuracy that are required to conduct true high sensitivity troponin tests at the POC. As far as the Company is aware a nano-magnetic detection technology as embodied in the MIDS system and proposed to achieve the required levels of sensitivity and accuracy to perform high sensitivity troponin tests is not available in the market.
   Intellectual Property
   MIDS Technology
   The MIDS technology platform, which MML has under license, is protected by patent applications that are now in the national phase in key geographic areas and already granted in China.
   • PCT application number PCT/GB2011/050749
   • EP application number 11724436.8
   • USA application number 13809367
   • China application number 201180025701.5 (Granted)
   • India application number 9624/CHENP/2012
   MML will have the right, under license, to use the MIDS Intellectual Property (“MIDS IP”) during the development and the MIDS IP will be transferred to MML in the event MML concludes a commercial deal for MIDS with a third party.
   In January, 2017 MML submitted a UK Intellectual Property Office patent application for an additional MIDS detection method: "Device and method for accurate measurement of magnetic particles in assay apparatus". The method is a variation of the magnetic detection method whereby the magnetic detection is carried out by a Hall Sensor in a "Magnetic Bridge" structure.
   Sgenia License Agreement
   The Company will not have any ownership rights in the underlying technology on which the Sgenia Product relies, but will only have a license agreement with respect to the products derived therefrom and within the scope of the license.  If Sgenia or Zenon ceases operations, then under the terms of the License Agreement, the Company will have the right to copies of the underlying technology to use for the term of the license arrangement for the manufacture and marketing of the Sgenia Products. The Company will have joint ownership in the manufacturing designs and processes and in the regulatory permits. In the future, the Company may develop trademarks and service marks in connection with its business, which it will own and which it will seek to protect by usage and registration.
