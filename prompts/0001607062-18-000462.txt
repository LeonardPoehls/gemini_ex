Item 1. Business
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 24, 2008 as JB Clothing Corporation. Until July 10, 2009, our principal business objective was the offering of active/leisure fashion design clothing.
 
On July 10, 2009 we abandoned our efforts in the field of active/leisure fashion design clothing when we acquired 100% of the share capital of Entest BioMedical, Inc., a California corporation, (“Entest CA”) from Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. (“BMSN”) for consideration consisting of 10,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company and the cancellation of 10,000,000 shares of the Company owned and held by Mr. Rick Plote.
 
As a result of this transaction, the former stockholder of Entest CA held approximately 70% of the voting capital stock of the Company immediately after the transaction. For financial accounting purposes, this acquisition was a reverse acquisition of the Company by Entest CA under the purchase method of accounting, and was treated as a recapitalization with Entest CA as the acquirer..
 
Upon acquisition of Entest CA, we abandoned our efforts in the field of active/leisure fashion design clothing. On July 12, 2009 we adopted the name of Entest CA when we changed our name to Entest BioMedical, Inc. On June 18, 2015 Entest established Zander Therapeutics, Inc., a then wholly owned subsidiary. Zander was established to engage primarily in the development and commercialization of veterinary medical therapies which we intend to license from other entities as well as develop internally

Competitive business conditions and Entest's competitive position in the industry and methods of competition
 
The Company will face vast competition from other shell companies that desire to seek a potential business combination with a private company seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. The Company will be in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do; consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business
 combination.
