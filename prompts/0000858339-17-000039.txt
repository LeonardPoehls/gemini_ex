ITEM 1. | Business

Overview 
Caesars Entertainment is a casino-entertainment and hospitality services provider. CEC is primarily a holding company with no independent operations of its own. It owns Caesars Entertainment Resort Properties, LLC (“CERP”) and an interest in Caesars Growth Partners, LLC (“CGP”). CEC also holds a majority interest in Caesars Entertainment Operating Company, Inc. (“CEOC”); however, as described in Note 2, the results of CEOC and its subsidiaries are no longer consolidated with Caesars subsequent to CEOC and certain of its United States subsidiaries (the “Debtors”) voluntarily filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) on January 15, 2015.
The Caesars portfolio of properties, including the properties owned and operated by CEOC, represents the world’s most diversified casino-entertainment portfolio with entertainment facilities in more areas throughout the United States than any other participant in the gaming industry. We have established a rich history of industry-leading growth and expansion since we commenced operations in 1937. Our facilities typically include gaming offerings, food and beverage outlets, hotel and convention space, and non-gaming entertainment options. In addition to our brick and mortar assets, we operate an online gaming business that provides real money games in certain jurisdictions.
Announced Merger and CEOC Plan of Reorganization
In 2014, CEC and Caesars Acquisition Company (“CAC”) entered into a merger agreement, which was amended and restated on July 9, 2016 (the “Merger Agreement”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, among other things, CAC will merge with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company (the “Merger”). See Note 1.
On January 13, 2017, the Debtors filed an amended plan of reorganization (the “Third Amended Plan”) with the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Illinois in Chicago (the “Bankruptcy Court”) that replaces all previously filed plans. CEC, CAC, the Debtors, and CEOC’s major creditor groups have agreed to support the Third Amended Plan. The Bankruptcy Court confirmed the Third Amended Plan on January 17, 2017. Although the Third Amended Plan has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, we must still obtain regulatory approval in all of the jurisdictions in which we have gaming operations in order for CEOC to successfully emerge from bankruptcy, and we are unable to determine when all necessary requirements will be satisfied. In addition, the Third Amended Plan remains subject to completion of the Merger, certain financing transactions, and various other closing conditions. See Note 1.

(5) | Our reportable segments currently include CERP and CGP. See Note 1. CEOC remained a reportable segment until its deconsolidation effective January 15, 2015. See Note 2.

As of December 31, 2016, through our consolidated entities, we owned 12 casinos in the United States, with over one million square feet of gaming space and approximately 24,000 hotel rooms. Our properties are concentrated in Las Vegas, where eight of the twelve are located. See Item 2 for more information about our properties.
CERP owns six casinos in the United States and The LINQ promenade along with leasing Octavius Tower at Caesars Palace Las Vegas (“Octavius Tower”) to CEOC and gaming space at The LINQ promenade to CGP.
CGP owns six casinos in the United States and, through its subsidiary Caesars Interactive Entertainment, Inc. (“CIE”), owns and operates a regulated online real money gaming business and the World Series of Poker (“WSOP”) tournaments and brand. As discussed in Note 17, on September 23, 2016, CIE sold its social and mobile games business (“SMG Business”) for approximately $4.4 billion in cash.
CES provides certain corporate and administrative services for the Members’ casino properties, including substantially all of the casino properties owned by CEOC and casinos owned by unrelated third parties. CES also manages certain enterprise assets and the other assets it owns, licenses or controls, and employs certain of the corresponding employees. See Note 1.

Business Operations
Our consolidated business is composed of four complementary businesses that reinforce, cross-promote, and build upon each other: casino entertainment, food and beverage, rooms and hotel, and entertainment and other business operations.
Casino Entertainment Operations
Our casino entertainment operations include revenues from approximately 15,000 slot machines and 1,200 table games, as well as other games such as keno, poker, and race and sports books, all of which comprised approximately 49% of our total net revenues in 2016. Slot revenues generate the majority of our gaming revenue and are a key driver of revenue, particularly in our properties located outside of the Las Vegas market. We are testing a number of skill-based games as we implement product offerings intended to appeal to all demographics, and expect to expand these offerings as required regulatory approvals are obtained.
Food and Beverage Operations
Our food and beverage operations generate revenues primarily from over 50 buffets, restaurants, bars, nightclubs, and lounges located throughout our casinos, as well as banquets and room service, and represented approximately 18% of our total net revenues in 2016. Many of our properties include several dining options, ranging from upscale dining experiences to moderately-priced restaurants and buffets.
Rooms and Hotel Operations
Rooms and hotel operations revenue comprised approximately 21% of our total net revenues in 2016 and is primarily generated from hotel stays at our casino properties and our approximately 24,000 guest rooms and suites.
Our properties operate at various price and service points, allowing us to host a variety of casino guests who are visiting our properties for gaming and other casino entertainment options and non-casino guests who are visiting our properties for other purposes, such as vacation travel or conventions.
We have engaged in large capital reinvestment projects in recent years focusing primarily on room product across the United States. In the Las Vegas market, nearly 6,000 rooms have been renovated since 2014, across properties such as The LINQ Hotel & Casino, Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino, Paris Las Vegas, and Harrah’s Las Vegas. In addition, we plan to continue the roll out of self-check-in kiosks in Las Vegas in order to help reduce customer wait times and improve labor efficiencies.
Entertainment and Other Business Operations
We provide a variety of retail and entertainment offerings in our casinos and The LINQ promenade. We operate several entertainment venues across the United States, including The AXIS at Planet Hollywood, which was ranked as one of the top theater venues in the United States in 2016 based on ticket sales. This award winning theater hosts several prominent headliners, such as Jennifer Lopez, Lionel Richie, and Britney Spears. We recently announced that the Backstreet Boys will have performances starting in early 2017.
The LINQ promenade and our retail stores offer guests a wide range of options from high-end brands and accessories to souvenirs and decorative items. The LINQ promenade is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail development located between The LINQ Hotel and the Flamingo Las Vegas, and also features The High Roller, our 550-foot observation wheel at The LINQ promenade.
In addition, CIE operates a regulated online real money gaming business in Nevada and New Jersey and owns the WSOP tournaments and brand, and also licenses WSOP trademarks for a variety of products and businesses related to this brand.
Sales and Marketing
We believe the Caesars portfolio of properties (including the CEOC properties) that operate under the Total Rewards program enable us to capture a larger share of our customers’ entertainment spending when they travel among markets versus that of a standalone property, which is core to our cross-market strategy. We believe that our high concentration of properties in the center of the Las Vegas Strip generates increased revenues and enables us to capture more of our customers’ gaming dollars than would be generated if the properties were operated separately. 
We believe the Total Rewards program, in conjunction with this distribution system, allows us to capture a growing share of our customers’ entertainment spending and compete more effectively. Members earn Reward Credits at all Caesars-affiliated properties in the United States and Canada for on-property entertainment expenses, including gaming, hotel, dining, and retail shopping. Members may also earn Reward Credits through the Total Rewards Visa credit card and can redeem Reward Credits with our many partners, including Atlantis Paradise Island Resort and Norwegian Cruise Line. Total Rewards members can redeem Reward Credits

for amenities or other items such as merchandise, gift cards, and travel. Total Rewards is structured in tiers (designated as Gold, Platinum, Diamond or Seven Stars), each with increasing member benefits and privileges.
Members are also provided promotional offers and rewards based on their engagement with Caesars-affiliated properties, aspects of their casino gaming play, and their preferred spending choices outside of gaming. Member information is also used for marketing promotions, including direct mail campaigns, electronic mail, our website, mobile devices, social media, and interactive slot machines.
Intellectual Property
The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy. We regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one patent, trademark, copyright or combination of several of our intellectual property rights, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws. We file applications for and obtain patents, trademarks, and copyrights in the United States and foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate, including United States and foreign patent applications covering certain proprietary technology of CEOC. We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. CEOC’s United States patents have varying expiration dates, the last of which is 2031.
We have not applied for the registration of all of our trademarks, copyrights, proprietary technology or other intellectual property rights, as the case may be, and may not be successful in obtaining all intellectual property rights for which we have applied. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe upon our intellectual property and use information that we regard as proprietary, and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property.
We own or have the right to use proprietary rights to a number of trademarks that we consider, along with the associated name recognition, to be valuable to our business, including the following:

• | CEOC’s marks include Caesars, Harrah’s, Horseshoe, Bally’s, and Total Rewards;


• | CERP’s marks include Rio, Flamingo, and Paris;


• | CIE’s marks include WSOP; and


• | CGP holds a license for the Planet Hollywood mark used in connection with the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas.

Omnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement
The Members of CES entered into an Omnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement (the “Omnibus Agreement”) in 2014, which granted various licenses to the Members through CES and allowed the Members to continue to use the intellectual property each of the properties owned or managed by the Members used in their associated businesses, including Total Rewards. See Note 1 for a complete discussion of CES and the Omnibus Agreement. Under the terms of the CES joint venture and the Omnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement, we believe that Caesars and its other operating subsidiaries will continue to have access to the services historically provided to us by CEOC and its employees, trademarks, and programs despite the CEOC bankruptcy filing.
Competition 
Casinos
The casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. In most markets, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. Our Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos also compete, in part, with each other. We also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on-and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals, and card parlors. Our non-gaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues.
In recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing facilities, developing new casino or complementary facilities, and acquiring established facilities. These reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many markets.
4

The expansion of casino properties and entertainment venues into new markets also presents competitive issues for us that have had a negative impact on our financial results. Atlantic City, in particular, has seen a decline of more than 50% compared with 2006 levels primarily due to the addition of gaming capacity associated with the expansion of gaming in Maryland, New York, and Pennsylvania. This has resulted in several casino closings in recent years, including CEOC’s Showboat Atlantic City casino and four competitor casinos since 2014. More recently, our property in Baltimore has also experienced competitive pressure.
See Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See also Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming Overview,” to this Form 10-K. In addition, for a summary of key developments in 2016, see “Summary of 2016 Events and Key Drivers of Annual Performance” in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Governmental Regulation
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules, and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules, and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability, and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. A more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming Overview,” to this Form 10-K.
Our businesses are subject to various foreign, federal, state, and local laws and regulations, in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, construction, land use, and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors” for additional discussion.
Employee Relations
We have approximately 31,000 employees throughout our organization. Approximately 17,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries, relating to certain casino, hotel, and restaurant employees. The majority of these employees are covered by the following agreements: 

Employee Group | Approximate Number of Active Employees Represented | Union | Date on which Collective Bargaining Agreement Becomes Amendable
Las Vegas Culinary Employees | 8,700 | Culinary Workers Union, Local 226 | Various up toJuly 31, 2018 
Atlantic City Food & Beverage and Hotel employees | 1,600 | UNITE HERE, Local 54 | February 28, 2020 
Las Vegas Bartenders | 1,200 | Bartenders Union, Local 165 | Various up toJuly 31, 2018 
Las Vegas Dealers | 1,800 | Transport Workers Union of America and UAW | Various up toSeptember 30, 2019 

Corporate Citizenship, Social Responsibility and Sustainability
Caesars Entertainment’s Board of Directors and senior executives are committed to maintaining our position as an industry leader in corporate citizenship, corporate social responsibility, and sustainability. In 2016, we continued to engage with our CEO-level external environmental sustainability advisory board with experts representing non-governmental organizations, business strategy, academia, and investors and used their advice to modify our citizenship priority focus for 2016 and 2017. In 2016, we published our seventh annual Citizenship Report in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative G4 framework. 
Code of Commitment
For more than 15 years, our Code of Commitment has guided our approach to responsible and ethical business, compliance and anti-corruption. Training events reinforce our expectations of all employees. 
5

For the second year running, we were recognized on the Civic 50, an initiative organized by Points of Light and Bloomberg that recognizes companies for their commitment to improving the quality of life in their home communities. Caesars was the first company to develop responsible gaming programs informed by science, evaluated objectively and created in conjunction with leading researchers. In 2016, we confirmed our support for the UN Sustainable Development Goals and identified eight goals where we can make the most significant contribution and expand our impact in coming years. 
Environmental Stewardship
Since 2007, we have advanced a strategy to contribute to global climate change and sustainability initiatives that reduce our impact on the environment. Our structured, data-driven CodeGreen program leverages the passion of our employees and engages our guests and suppliers. Between 2007 and 2015, we reduced energy consumption across our properties by 23.4% per air-conditioned sq. ft. and greenhouse gas emissions by 28.3%. Since 2008, we have reduced water consumption by 20.4%. In 2015, 38% of our total waste was recycled in addition to an overall 28% reduction in waste across our operations.
In 2016, Caesars surpassed its Green Key certification goal of having 90% of owned or managed North American hotel resort properties achieve a 4 Key rating or higher. Including the properties owned and operated by CEOC, thirty of our hotel resort properties are rated 4 Keys - more than any other casino-entertainment company in the world. Recently recognized by the Global Sustainable Tourism Council, Green Key is a rigorous program that ranks, certifies, and inspects hotels and resorts based on their commitment to sustainable operations. Green Key uses a rating system of 1 to 5 Keys, with 5 being the highest possible attainment.
For our work in 2016, Caesars Entertainment received “A” scores for carbon (A) and water (A-) impact and supplier engagement (A-) from the formerly named Carbon Disclosure Project (“CDP”), the international not-for-profit that drives sustainable economies. Thousands of companies submit annual climate disclosures to CDP for independent assessment against its scoring methodology. Caesars is one of 193 "A Listers" on its carbon disclosure, which has been produced at the request of 827 investors with assets of $100 trillion. Just 9% of the corporations participating in CDP’s climate change program are awarded a position on the Climate “A List.”
Diversity, Inclusion, and Employee Wellbeing
We create a dynamic and innovative working culture where individual growth is rewarded, recognized, and celebrated. Caesars is the only company in the casino entertainment industry to receive perfect scores on the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index for ten consecutive years, including 2016. We encourage diversity and the advancement of women, and in 2015, 34% of our managers belonged to minority groups and 42% of our managers were women. We continue to fund more than $15 million each year to support our Employee Wellness Program, including 29 nurses and coaches across our properties. The program proves itself year after year with improved health metrics for participating employees, more than $2,500 annual saving per employee on healthcare and insurance savings for Caesars due to lower health risk. 
Community Investment
Established in 2002, the Caesars Foundation (the “Foundation”) is a private charitable foundation funded by a portion of operating income from our resorts. Since its inception, the Foundation has gifted more than $72 million to support vibrant communities. In 2015, our total community investment (including Caesars Foundation, corporate, mandated and discretionary giving, and the value of employee volunteering hours) amounted to $67.2 million. Employee volunteering in 2015 reached 260,000 hours - our highest annual level of volunteering on record.
