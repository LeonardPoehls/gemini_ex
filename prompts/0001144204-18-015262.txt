Item 1. | Business

     Corporate Overview
     We own a portfolio of consumer brands in the home, active and fashion categories, including Martha Stewart, Jessica Simpson, AND1, Avia, Joe’s Jeans, GAIAM and Heelys. We aim to maximize the value of our brands by promoting, marketing and licensing the brands through various distribution channels, including to retailers, wholesalers and distributors in the United States and in certain international territories. Our core strategy is to enhance and monetize the global reach of our existing brands, and to pursue additional strategic acquisitions to grow the scope of and diversify our portfolio of brands.
     Our business is designed to maximize the value of our brands through license agreements with partners that are responsible for manufacturing and distributing our licensed products and, with the exception of our Martha Stewart brand, primarily responsible for the design of such licensed products. Our brands are licensed for a broad range of product categories, including apparel, footwear, eyewear, fashion accessories and home goods, as well as, with respect to our Martha Stewart brand, food, wine and a variety of media related assets, such as magazines, books and other print and digital content. We seek to select licensees who have demonstrated the ability to produce and sell quality products in their respective licensed categories and have the capability to meet or exceed the minimum sales thresholds and guaranteed minimum royalty payments that we generally require.
     We license our brands to both wholesale and direct-to-retail licensees. In a wholesale license, a wholesale supplier is granted rights (typically on an exclusive basis) to a single or small group of related product categories for a particular brand for sale to multiple accounts within an approved channel of distribution and territory. In a direct-to-retail license, a single retailer is granted the right (typically on an exclusive basis) to sell branded products in a broad range of product categories through its brick and mortar stores and e-commerce sites. As of December 31, 2017, we had more than one-hundred fifty licensees, with wholesale licensees comprising a significant majority.
     Strategy
     We own, manage, and maximize the long-term value of a diversified portfolio of global consumer brands. We aim to acquire well-known consumer brands with high potential for growth and strong brand awareness. We additionally seek to diversify our portfolio by evaluating the strength of targeted brands and the expected viability and sustainability of future royalty streams. Upon the acquisition of a brand, we partner with leading wholesalers and retailers to drive incremental value and maximize brand equity. We focus on certain key initiatives in our licensing and brand management business. These initiatives include:
﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | Maximizing the value of our existing brands by creating efficiencies, adding additional product categories, expanding distribution and retail presence and optimizing sales through innovative marketing that increases consumer brand awareness and loyalty;
 |  | Expanding through ecommerce channels; 

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | Developing international expansion through additional licenses, partnerships and other arrangements with leading retailers and wholesalers outside the United States; and

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | Acquiring consumer brands (or the rights to such brands) with high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a wide range of product categories.

  ﻿
 Licensing Relationships
      Our license agreements typically require a licensee to pay us royalties based upon net sales and, in most cases, contain guaranteed minimum royalties. Our license agreements also require licensees to support the brands by either paying or spending contractually guaranteed minimum amounts for the marketing and advertising of the respective licensed brands. As of February 28, 2018, we had contractual rights to receive an aggregate of $379.5 million in minimum royalty and marketing and advertising revenue from our licensees through the balance of the current terms of such licenses, excluding any renewals.
     Our license agreements stipulate specific geographical territories and distribution channels in which the licensed products may be sold. Currently, the majority of our revenues are from license agreements with stipulated distribution territories in the United States. As we grow our existing brands and acquire new brands, we intend to increase the share of our international revenue, primarily through additional licenses, partnerships and other arrangements.

We believe our business model enables us to use our brand management expertise to continue to grow our portfolio of brands and generate new revenue streams without significantly changing our infrastructure. We believe our business model provides numerous benefits, including:
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | Potential for financial upside without the investment and management risks and capital demands associated with traditional wholesale operating companies;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | Diversification resulting from both broad demographic appeal and distribution through a range of distribution channels;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | Growth opportunity through expansion of existing brands into new categories and geographic areas and through acquisitions; and

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | Reduced operational risks because inventory and other typical wholesale operating functions are the responsibilities of our licensees.

  ﻿
 Our licensing revenues are concentrated with certain licensees and retail partners. During the year ended December 31, 2017, three licensees represented at least 10% of net revenue, each accounting for 11% of the Company’s net revenue. For additional information, see “Risk Factors Risks Related to our Business - A substantial portion of our licensing revenue is concentrated with a limited number of licensees and retail partners, such that the loss of a licensee or retail partner could materially decrease our revenue and cash flows” in Item 1A.
     Description of Our Brands
     Martha Stewart
     In December 2015, we acquired the Martha Stewart brand through the acquisition of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia (“MSLO”).

Millions of people rely on Martha Stewart as a source of useful "how-to" information for all aspects of everyday living - cooking, entertaining, gardening, home renovating, collecting, organizing, crafting, holidays, healthy living and pets. The Martha Stewart brand reaches approximately 100 million consumers across all media and merchandising platforms each month. Her branded products are found in over 70 million households and have a growing retail presence in thousands of locations. We currently license the Martha Stewart brand to various licensees, including retailers such as Macy's, The Home Depot, Staples and Michaels. In the third quarter of 2017, we launched the Martha Stewart brand on QVC in four categories—apparel, skin care, garden, and food—with several additional categories planned for 2018.  Additionally, we initiated our direct-to-retail partnership with Michaels in the fourth quarter of 2017 beginning with Halloween products, followed by the development of the full line planned to be in stores for spring 2018.

     We have a single operating and reportable segment, as described more fully in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Reportable Segment” in Item 7. See Item 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for measures of our net revenues, consolidated net income (loss) and total assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
     Corporate Organization/Information
     We were formed on June 5, 2015, for the purpose of effecting the merger of Singer Merger Sub, Inc. with and into SQBG, Inc. (previously known as Sequential Brands Group, Inc.) (SEC File No. 001-36082) (“Old Sequential”) and the merger of Madeline Merger Sub, Inc. with and into MSLO (SEC File No. 001-15395), with Old Sequential and MSLO each surviving the merger as wholly owned subsidiaries of us (the “Mergers”). Prior to the Mergers, we did not conduct any activities other than those incidental to its formation and the matters contemplated in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of June 22, 2015, as amended, by and among MSLO, Old Sequential, us, Singer Merger Sub, Inc. and Madeline Merger Sub, Inc. (the “Merger Agreement”). On December 4, 2015, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Old Sequential and MSLO completed the strategic combination of their respective businesses and became wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company. Old Sequential was the accounting acquirer in the Mergers; therefore, the historical consolidated financial statements for Old Sequential for periods prior to the Mergers are considered to be the historical financial statements of Sequential Brands Group, Inc. and thus, our consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2015 reflect Old Sequential’s consolidated financial statements for period from January 1, 2015 through December 4, 2015, and Sequential Brand Group Inc.’s thereafter.
     Old Sequential’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker “SQBG” on September 24, 2013, and we succeeded to Old Sequential’s listing on December 7, 2015.
     Old Sequential was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware in 1982. In the second half of 2011, Old Sequential transitioned its business model to focus on licensing and brand management. Prior to this, Old Sequential designed, marketed and provided, on a wholesale basis, branded apparel and apparel accessories, as well as operated retail stores to sell our branded products. In the second half of 2011, Old Sequential discontinued its wholesale distribution of branded apparel and apparel accessories, liquidated its existing inventory and closed its remaining retail stores. To reflect its business transition, in March 2012, Old Sequential changed its corporate name from People’s Liberation, Inc. to Sequential Brands Group, Inc.

    Competition
     We operate in a highly competitive market, both for our individual brands and for the Company as a whole.
     Our brands are subject to extensive competition from various domestic and foreign brands. Each of our brands has a number of competitors within its specific product categories and distribution channels that compete with the product categories and distribution channels in which our brands’ products are sold. Our brands also compete within the retail stores and other distribution channels that carry such brand’s product lines with other products offered by these retail stores and distribution channel in the respective product categories, including with products sold under our partners' private labels. We also compete with the e-commerce businesses of these stores and other websites that sell similar retail goods. Competitive factors include design, style, quality, price, name recognition, service and advertising.
     In addition, we face competition in establishing and maintaining licensee relationships for our existing brands. Competitors may seek to enter into brand licensing arrangements with our current or potential licensees, which may inhibit our ability to enter into or maintain licensing arrangements. In addition, the retailers that currently sell our branded products may develop their own brands or acquire brands rather than purchase products from our licensees, which could make it more difficult for our licensees to achieve their sales targets.
     We also compete with traditional apparel and consumer brand companies, as well as other brand management companies, for acquisitions of accretive brands, particularly brands with high consumer awareness, broad appeal and applicability to a wide range of product categories.
     Trademarks
     Our trademarks and associated marks are registered or pending registration with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in block letter and/or logo formats, as well as in combination with a variety of ancillary marks for use with respect to a broad range of product categories, including footwear, eyewear, apparel, fragrance, handbags, backpacks, watches, home goods and various other goods and services. We intend to renew these registrations as appropriate prior to their expiration. In addition, we register our trademarks in other countries and regions around the world. We also have domestic, foreign and international intellectual property coverage for the technology and designs for several brands, for Heelys wheeled footwear and certain Gaiam yoga-related products.  We own the rights to 62 U.S. issued patents and 57 foreign issued patents within 24 territories, along with several pending U.S. and foreign patent applications and industrial designs.  Further, in connection with the acquisition of the Martha Stewart brand, we are also the owners of domestic and international design and utility patents covering certain Martha Stewart Crafts paper punches.
     We monitor on an ongoing basis unauthorized use and filings of our trademarks and patents and rely primarily upon a combination of federal, state and local laws, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property rights, both domestically and internationally.
     Seasonality
     Our business is affected by seasonality in the businesses of many of our licensees. Historically, this can result in higher revenues during our third and fourth quarters, which includes the holiday retail season in the United States. We recognized 23% and 27% of our annual revenues during the third quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. We recognized 28% and 29% of our annual revenues during the fourth quarter of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our seasonality may change as we continue to grow our business.     Employees
     As of February 28, 2018, we had a total of 144 employees and area-specific consultants working to support our continuing operations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our relationship with our employees to be satisfactory.

﻿Item 1A. | Risk Factors

  ﻿
     Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospects and/or the trading price of our common stock. Although the risks and uncertainties listed below are those that we consider significant, material risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us may also adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In evaluating our business and an investment in our securities, you should consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information presented in this report, as well as the other reports we file from time to with the SEC:
     Risks Related to Our Acquisitions
     If we are unable to identify and successfully acquire additional brands or to finance the acquisition of such brands, our rate of growth may be reduced and, even if additional trademarks are acquired, we may not realize anticipated benefits due to integration or licensing difficulties.
     A key component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of additional brands. In 2016, we acquired GAIAM, and in 2015, we acquired Jessica Simpson, Joe’s Jeans, Martha Stewart and Emeril Lagasse and are continually exploring new acquisition opportunities. However, we face extensive competition for new brand acquisitions, both from other brand management companies as well as traditional consumer brand companies, retailers and private equity groups, which could increase the price of the acquisitions and make it more difficult for us to find suitable acquisition targets. In addition, even if we successfully acquire additional brands or the rights to use additional brands, we may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability levels that justify our investment in, or realize planned benefits with respect to, those additional brands.
     Although we seek to temper our acquisition risks, all acquisitions, whether they are of additional intellectual property assets or of the companies that own them, entail numerous risks, any of which could detrimentally affect our results of operations and/or the value of our equity. These risks include, among others:
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | unanticipated costs associated with the target acquisition;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | negative effects on reported results of operations from acquisition related charges and amortization of acquired intangibles;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | the challenges of maintaining focus on, and continuing to execute, core strategies and business plans as our brand and license portfolio grows and becomes more diversified;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | inability to find suitable licensees for our newly acquired brands;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | adverse effects on our existing licensing relationships, including our existing licensees terminating their license agreements with us;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | potential difficulties associated with the retention of key employees and the assimilation of any other employees, who may be retained by us in connection with or as a result of our acquisitions; and

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | risks of entering new domestic and international markets (whether it be with respect to new licensed product categories or new licensed product distribution channels) or markets in which we have limited prior experience.

  ﻿

In the event we acquire intellectual property assets or the companies that own them, our due diligence reviews are subject to inherent uncertainties and may not reveal all potential risks.  We may therefore fail to discover or inaccurately assess undisclosed or contingent liabilities, including liabilities for which we may have responsibility as a successor to the seller or the target company.  In addition, as a successor, we may be responsible for any past or continuing violations of law by the seller or the target company.  Although we generally attempt to seek contractual protections through representations, warranties and indemnities, we cannot be sure that we will obtain such provisions in our acquisitions or that such provisions will fully protect us from all unknown, contingent or other liabilities or costs.  Finally, claims against us relating to any acquisition may necessitate our seeking claims against the seller for which the seller may not, or may not be able to, indemnify us or that may exceed the scope, duration or amount of the seller’s indemnification obligations.
     Acquiring additional brands could also have a significant effect on our financial condition and could cause substantial fluctuations in our liquidity, cash balances and quarterly and yearly results of operations. Acquisitions could result in the recording of significant goodwill and intangible assets on our financial statements, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce our reported earnings in subsequent years. We cannot make assurances with respect to the timing, likelihood or financial or business effect of any possible transaction. Moreover, our ability to grow through the acquisition of additional brands will also depend on the availability of capital to complete the necessary acquisition arrangements. We may elect to pursue acquisitions through debt financing or the issuance of shares of our common stock or convertible securities. The use of equity as transaction consideration could dilute our common stock, reduce our earnings per share or reduce the market price of our common stock. We cannot guarantee that our stockholders will achieve greater returns as a result of any future acquisitions we complete.
     We may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our completed acquisitions or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.
     Our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions depends, to a large extent, on our ability to implement changes to acquired businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes anticipated synergies. We will be required to devote significant management attention, resources and costs to realigning the business practices and operations of acquired businesses to our brand management model. We generally expect to benefit from operational synergies from our acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of capabilities and elimination of redundancies, as well as greater efficiencies from increased scale and market integration. However, this process may preclude or impede realization of the benefits expected from acquisitions and could adversely affect current revenues and investments in future growth, which could adversely affect our results of operations. We cannot be certain that we will not be required to implement further realignment activities, make additions or other changes to our workforce based on other cost reduction measures or changes in the markets and industry in which we compete. In addition, future business conditions and events may impact our ability to continue to realize any benefits of these initiatives. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions, including the Mergers, may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.
     The failure to successfully integrate certain businesses and operations as a result of our acquisitions in the expected time frame may adversely affect our future results.
     Historically, our acquired businesses have operated as independent companies. We may face significant challenges in consolidating certain businesses and functions of these businesses, integrating their organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in the business cultures and retaining key personnel. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the business combinations mentioned above may also disrupt each company’s ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with employees, business partners, customers and others with whom we have business or other dealings, or limit our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Mergers. In addition, difficulties in integrating the businesses mentioned above could harm our reputation.
     If we are not able to successfully combine our businesses in an efficient, effective and timely manner, the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisitions may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may be affected adversely.
     Our success depends in part on the continued success of the Martha Stewart brands and the reputation and popularity of Ms. Martha Stewart. Any adverse reactions to publicity relating to Ms. Stewart, or the loss of her services, could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations as well as our ability to maintain or generate a consumer base.
     We believe that maintaining and enhancing the Martha Stewart brand is critical to our business, financial condition and results of operations. The Martha Stewart brand may be negatively impacted by a number of factors, including the reputation of its content and products, the uniqueness and relevance of Martha Stewart branded content, and the reputation and popularity of Ms. Stewart. If we fail to maintain and enhance the Martha Stewart brand, or if excessive expenses are incurred in an effort to do so, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

    Moreover, we believe Ms. Stewart’s image, reputation, popularity and talent are material to our success. While Ms. Stewart is a member of our board of directors, has been named Chief Creative Officer and has entered into an employment agreement and certain license agreements with us, we cannot assure that she will be able to, or will continue to, serve in those capacities for any specific period. An extended or permanent loss of her services or any repeated or sustained negative shifts in public or industry perceptions of her could have a material adverse effect on our business.
     We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant transaction costs in connection with our acquisitions.
     In connection with our acquisitions, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs and expenses, including financial advisory, legal, accounting, consulting and other advisory fees and expenses, reorganization and restructuring costs, litigation defense costs, severance/employee benefit-related expenses, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges. There are also a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with our acquisitions. While we assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred in connection with the acquisitions, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or timing of the integration and implementation expenses. There may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with acquisitions that we may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the benefits and income we expect to achieve from our acquisitions.
      Risks Related to Our Business
     The failure of our licensees to fulfill their financial obligations with respect to royalty payments under their license agreements or to otherwise adequately produce, market and sell products bearing our brand names in their license categories could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
     Our revenues are almost entirely dependent on royalty payments made to us pursuant to license agreements entered into with licensees of our brands. These license agreements often require that licensees advance payment to us of a portion of the sales royalty payments due thereunder and, in most cases, provide for guaranteed minimum royalty payments. The failure of our licensees to satisfy their financial obligations under these agreements, or their inability to operate successfully or at all, could result in a breach of an agreement, early termination of an agreement, non-renewal of an agreement or an amendment of an agreement to reduce the guaranteed minimum royalty payments or sales royalties due thereunder, each of which could eliminate some or all of that revenue stream. A decrease or elimination of revenue could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operation and cash flows.
     During the term of a license agreement, our revenues and the value of our brands substantially depend upon our licensee’s ability to maintain the quality and marketability and market acceptance of the branded products licensed to such licensee and their failure to do so could negatively affect consumer perception of our brands and harm our future growth and prospects. Further, the failure of our licensees to meet their production, manufacturing and distribution requirements, or a weak economy or softness in the retail, apparel or home goods sectors, could cause our licensees to default on their obligations to make guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us or cause a decline in their sales and potentially decrease the amount of royalty payments in excess of guaranteed minimum royalty payments due to us. In addition, our licensees’ inability to maintain market acceptance of our brands or our failure to monitor our licensees’ compliance with their license agreements or take appropriate corrective action when necessary may subject our intellectual property assets to cancellation, loss of rights or devaluation and any devaluation of our trademarks or other intellectual property could cause a material impairment in the carrying value of such intellectual property, potentially resulting in a charge as an expense to our results of operations. If such developments occur or our licensees are otherwise not successful, the value and recognition of our brands, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations, could be materially adversely affected.
     Our business depends on continued market acceptance of our brands and the products bearing these brands.
     The retail industry is highly susceptible to changes in consumer preferences and continued market acceptance of our brands and our licensees’ products, as well as market acceptance of any future products bearing our brands and is subject to a high degree of uncertainty. In order to generate revenues and profits, our licensees must develop product offerings that appeal to consumers. We generally retain rights to monitor the products our licensee’s design and produce and may retain the right to preview and approve such products, we cannot assure you that licensees will develop, market and sell products that appeal to consumers. Any significant changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our licensees’ part to anticipate or react to such changes could reduce demand for our branded products and erode the competitiveness of such products, which would negatively affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
    

 
12


 

 The continued success of our brands and branded products and market acceptance of new products and product categories also depend on our ability to continually improve the effectiveness of our marketing efforts. We devote significant resources and expenditures to promoting our brands and new product launches, but there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to effectively execute our marketing programs. To the extent our licensees misjudge the market for our brands and branded products, or our marketing efforts are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations and prospects will be adversely affected.
     We have incurred a substantial amount of indebtedness in connection with our acquisitions, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. 
     As of December 31, 2017, we had outstanding net indebtedness of $630.6 million, as described more fully in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.  
     Our high level of indebtedness increases the possibility that we may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay when due the principal of, interest on or other amounts due in respect of such indebtedness. In addition, we may incur additional debt from time to time to finance strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents that govern our indebtedness. If we incur additional debt, the risks associated with our leverage, including our ability to service debt, would increase.
     Our increased level of indebtedness could have other important consequences, which include, but are not limited to, the following:
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations could be required to pay principal and interest on our debt;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | our interest expense could increase if interest rates increase because our borrowings generally bear interest at floating rates;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | our leverage could increase our vulnerability to general economic downturns and adverse competitive and industry conditions, placing us at a disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that are less leveraged;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | our debt service obligations could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and in the brand licensing industry;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | our failure to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants in the documents governing our indebtedness could result in an event of default that, if not cured or waived, results in foreclosure on substantially all of our assets; and

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | our level of debt may restrict us from raising additional financing on satisfactory terms to fund strategic acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and other general corporate requirements.

  ﻿
     We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations. If we do not have sufficient earnings, we may be required to seek to refinance all or part of our then existing debt, sell assets, make additional borrowings or sell more securities, none of which we can guarantee that we will be able to do and which, if accomplished, may adversely affect us.
     We are subject to a number of restrictive covenants under our debt arrangements, including customary operating restrictions and customary financial covenants. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain compliance with such covenants.
     Our outstanding debt is generally guaranteed jointly and severally by each of our domestic subsidiaries. Our and our subsidiaries’ obligations under the July 2016 Debt Facilities (as defined in Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements) and the associated guarantees are secured, in each case, by first priority liens (subject, in the case of the Amended GSO Credit Agreement, to the liens under the Amended BoA Credit Agreement on, and security interests in, substantially all of the present and after acquired assets of us and each of our subsidiaries, subject to certain customary exceptions). The July 2016 Debt Facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants, representations and warranties, including representations relating to the intellectual property owned by us and our subsidiaries and the status of our material license agreements. In addition, the July 2016 Debt Facilities include covenants and events of default, including, in the case of the Amended BoA Credit Agreement, requirements that we (i) maintain a positive net income, (ii) satisfy a maximum loan to value ratio (as calculated pursuant to the Amended BoA Credit Agreement) and (iii) satisfy a maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio (as calculated pursuant to the Amended BoA Credit Amendment), and, in the case of the Amended GSO Credit Agreement, to satisfy (i) a maximum consolidated total leverage ratio (as calculated pursuant to the Amended GSO Credit Agreement) and (ii) a maximum consolidated first lien leverage ratio (as calculated pursuant to the Amended GSO Credit Agreement).

If our business, financial condition or results of operations are adversely affected by one or more of the risk factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, we may be unable to maintain compliance with these financial covenants. If we fail to comply with such covenants, our lenders could demand immediate payment of amounts outstanding. Under such circumstances, we would need to seek alternative financing sources to fund our ongoing operations and to repay amounts outstanding and satisfy our other obligations under our existing borrowing and financing arrangements. Such financing may not be available on favorable terms, or at all. Consequently, we may be restricted in how we fund ongoing operations and strategic initiatives and deploy capital and in our ability to make acquisitions. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be further adversely affected if we are unable to maintain compliance with our debt covenants.
     We may require additional capital to finance the acquisition of additional brands, and our inability to raise such capital on beneficial terms or at all could limit our growth.
     We may, in the future, require additional capital to help fund all or part of potential acquisitions. If, at the time required, we do not have sufficient cash to finance those additional capital needs, we will need to raise additional funds through equity and/or debt financing. We cannot guarantee that, if and when needed, additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If additional capital is needed and is either unavailable or cost prohibitive, our growth may be limited as we may need to change our business strategy to slow the rate of, or eliminate, our expansion plans. In addition, any additional financing we undertake could impose additional covenants upon us that restrict our operating flexibility, and, if we issue equity securities to raise capital, our existing stockholders may experience dilution or the new securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock.
     We have experienced rapid growth in recent years. If we fail to manage this or any future growth, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected. 
     We have grown dramatically in recent years, principally as a result of acquisitions. For example, our revenues were $88.3 million in 2015, $155.5 million in 2016 and $167.5 million in 2017. During this period, we have acquired several brands (or rights to use those brands and trademarks) and increased our total number of licensees to over one-hundred fifty. Furthermore, we continue to evaluate and pursue appropriate acquisition opportunities to the extent we believe that such opportunities would be in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. This significant growth has placed considerable demands on our management and other resources and continued growth could place additional demands on such resources. Our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth, if any, will depend on the sufficiency and adequacy of our current resources and infrastructure and our ability to continue to identify, attract and retain personnel to manage our brands and the businesses we may acquire. We cannot assure you that our personnel, systems, procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations and properly oversee our brands. The failure to support our operations effectively and properly oversee our brands could cause harm to our brands and have a material adverse effect on our brands’ fair values and our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be unable to leverage our core competencies in managing apparel brands to managing brands in new product categories or other businesses we may acquire.
     We or our licensees may not be able to continue to compete successfully because of intense competition within our licensees’ markets, the strength of some of their competitors or other factors.
     Our trademark licenses are for products primarily in the apparel, footwear, eyewear, fashion and home accessories markets, in which our licensees face intense competition. Competitive factors in these markets include design, quality, price, style, name recognition, service and advertising. Changing customer preferences and the limited availability of shelf space can adversely affect the competitive position of our licensees’ products. Many of our licensees’ competitors have greater financial, distribution, marketing and other resources than our licensees and have achieved significant name recognition for their brands. Our licensees may be unable to successfully compete in the markets for their products, which would adversely affect our revenues and cash flows, and we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with respect to our licensing arrangements.

 We and our licensees are subject to risks and uncertainties relating to operating outside of the United States, foreign manufacturing and the price, availability and quality of raw materials, which could result in interruptions to their operations or increase their operating costs, thereby affecting their ability to deliver goods to the market, reducing or delaying their sales and decreasing our revenues.
     We market and license our brands outside the United States, and many of our licensees operate outside the United States. We face numerous risks in doing business outside the United States, including: (i) unusual or burdensome foreign laws or regulatory requirements or unexpected changes to those laws or requirements; (ii) tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, trade embargoes, sanctions and other trade barriers; (iii) competition from foreign companies; (iv) less effective and less predictable protection and enforcement of our intellectual property; (v) changes in the political or economic condition of a specific country or region (including, without limitation, as a result of political unrest), particularly in emerging markets; (vi) fluctuations in the value of foreign currency versus the U.S. dollar and the cost of currency exchange; (vii) potentially adverse tax consequences; and (viii) cultural differences in the conduct of business. Any one or more of such factors could impact current or future international sales of our brands or inhibit our ability to expand internationally. In addition, our business practices in international markets are subject to the requirements of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and all other applicable anti-bribery laws, any violation of which could subject us to significant fines, criminal sanctions and other penalties.
     Further, a significant portion of the products sold by our licensees are manufactured overseas. There are substantial risks associated with foreign manufacturing, including (i) changes in laws relating to quotas, and the payment of tariffs and duties, (ii) fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, (iii) shipping delays and (iv) international political, regulatory and economic developments. Further, our licensees may experience fluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics and raw materials used by them in their manufactured apparel or purchased finished goods.  Any of these risks could increase our licensees’ operating costs. Our licensees also import finished products and assume all risk of loss and damage with respect to these goods once they are shipped by their suppliers. If these goods are destroyed or damaged during shipment, the revenues of our licensees could be reduced as a result of our licensees’ inability to deliver or their delay in delivering their products. A reduction in the revenues generated by our licensees would reduce the amount of our royalty revenues in excess of guaranteed minimum royalty payments and, in extreme circumstances, result in failures to make guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us.
     A substantial portion of our licensing revenue is concentrated with a limited number of licensees and retail partners, such that the loss of a licensee or retail partner could materially decrease our revenue and cash flows. 
     Our licensing revenues are concentrated with a limited number of licensees and retail partners. During the year ended December 31, 2017, three licensees represented at least 10% of net revenue, each accounting for 11% of the Company’s net revenue. During the year ended December 31, 2016, one licensee represented at least 10% of net revenue, accounting for 11% of the Company’s net revenue. Our revenue and cash flows would be materially and adversely affected if any of them were to have financial difficulties affecting their ability to make payments, elected not to renew or extend any existing license agreements or arrangements with us or significantly reduced their sales of these licensed products under any of these license agreements or arrangements, and we were not able to replace the revenue generated by such licensees.
     We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, which could compromise our competitive position and decrease the value of our brands.
     We own, through our wholly-owned and majority-owned subsidiaries, U.S. federal trademark registrations and foreign trademark registrations for our brands that are vital to the success and further growth of our business. In addition, we own domestic, foreign and international intellectual property registrations for the technology and designs incorporated into Martha Stewart Crafts paper punches, Heelys wheeled footwear, Gaiam yoga products and Revo eyewear. The loss of or inability to enforce our proprietary rights could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition. For instance, if any third party independently develops similar products to those marketed and distributed by our licensees or manufactures knock-offs of such products, it may harm the reputation of our brands, decrease their value or cause a decline in our licensees’ sales and thus our revenues. Additionally, the laws of foreign countries may provide inadequate protection for intellectual property rights, making it difficult to enforce such rights in those countries.
    

 
15


 

 We may need to bring legal claims to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs and diversions of resources and negatively impact our business operations. In addition, notwithstanding the rights we have secured in our intellectual property, third parties may bring claims against us or our licensees alleging that we or our licensees have infringed on their intellectual property rights or that our or our licensees’ intellectual property rights are not valid. Any claims against us or our licensees, with or without merit, could be time consuming and costly to defend or litigate and therefore could adversely affect our business. In addition, to the extent that any of our intellectual property assets is deemed to violate the proprietary rights of third parties in any litigation or proceeding or as a result of any claim, then we and our licensees may be prevented from using it, which could cause a breach or termination of license agreements. If our licensees are prevented from using the intellectual property we have licensed to them, the revenues of our licensees will be reduced with respect to those intellectual property assets, and the related royalty payments we receive could be reduced. Litigation with respect to our intellectual property or breaches of our license agreements could result in a judgment or monetary damages.
     We depend upon the services of our key executives, including our Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Karen Murray. If we lose the services of Ms. Murray or other key executives, we may not be able to fully implement our business plan and future growth strategy, which would harm our business and prospects.
     Our success is largely dependent upon the expertise and knowledge of our Chief Executive Officer, Ms. Karen Murray, and other key members of the executive team, whom we rely upon to formulate our business strategies. Our key executives leadership and experience in the licensing industry is important to the successful implementation of our business and marketing strategy. We do not carry key person life insurance covering our key executives, with the exception of Ms. Martha Stewart. The loss of the services of our key executives could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.        Our results of operations may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult to predict our performance and result in volatility in our stock price.
     We have in the past experienced substantial variations in our revenue and results of operations from quarter to quarter, and we expect to continue to experience such substantial variations. This variability is affected by numerous factors, including:
    
﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | the timing of the introduction of new licensed products by our licensees;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+----------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | the level of consumer acceptance of our brands and licensed products;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | seasonality resulting in higher revenues in our third and fourth quarters, in part because of the holiday retail season;

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
﻿ |  | general economic and industry conditions that affect consumer spending and retailer purchasing;

  ﻿

﻿ |  | the availability of viable licensees that meet our brand criteria; and

  ﻿

﻿ | | 
--+---+--------------------------------------
﻿ |  | the timing of marketing expenditures.

      Because of these fluctuations in our revenues, operating expenses and cash flows it may be difficult to make period-to-period comparisons of our result of operations and liquidity and it may be difficult for securities analysts and investors to predict our performance. As a result, our results of operations in any particular quarter may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors. Fluctuations in our performance and the failure to meet analyst expectations could cause declines or volatility in our stock price.
     Demand for our brands and branded products may be materially and adversely affected by reductions in disposable income, which in turn depends on general economic conditions and the global economy.
     Our performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also retailers and distributors, who license our brands. Consumer spending has fluctuated significantly and may become depressed or be subject to deterioration in the near future. The worldwide apparel and consumer products industries are heavily influenced by general economic cycles. Purchases of apparel, footwear, eyewear and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income declines. During periods of recession or economic uncertainty, our licensees may not be able to maintain or increase sales of our branded products to existing customers, make sales to new customers, open or operate new retail stores or maintain sales levels at existing stores. As a result, our results of operations may be adversely and materially affected by downward trends in the United States or global economy.

 The market price of our common stock has declined significantly and may be volatile, which could reduce the demand for our common stock.
     The publicly traded shares of our common stock have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant price fluctuations, ranging between $9.14 and $1.36 during our last two fiscal years. Due to the continued, sustained decline in our stock price, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $304.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.  See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our goodwill impairment.  Future decreases or volatility in our stock price could reduce demand for our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. The trading price of our common stock could also change significantly over short periods of time in response to write-downs or actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations, announcements by us, our licensees or our respective competitors, factors affecting our licensees’ markets generally or changes in national or regional economic conditions.
     Our largest stockholders control a significant percentage of our common stock and are represented on our board of directors, which may enable such stockholders, alone or together with our other significant stockholders, to exert influence over corporate transactions and other matters affecting the rights of our stockholders.
     As of February 28, 2018, Tengram Capital Partners Gen2 Fund, L.P. (“Tengram”) beneficially owns approximately 12.0%, Carlyle Galaxy Holdings, L.P. (“Carlyle”) beneficially owns approximately 10.1% and Ms. Martha Stewart beneficially owns approximately 12.7% of our outstanding shares of common stock. Mr. William Sweedler, chairman of our board of directors, is a principal of Tengram, Mr. Rodney Cohen is a director and managing director of Carlyle, and Ms. Martha Stewart became a director in connection with the closing of the Mergers. As a result, each of Tengram, Carlyle and Ms. Martha Stewart, individually or collectively, are able to exercise substantial influence over our board of directors and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate actions, such as mergers and other business combination transactions.
     Circumstances may occur in which the interests of these stockholders could conflict with the interests of our other stockholders. The voting power of these stockholders also could discourage others from seeking to acquire control of us, which may reduce the market price of our common stock.
     We may be deemed a former shell company and therefore resales of shares of our restricted common stock in reliance on Rule 144 may be subject to additional requirements and Rule 144 may be unavailable at all if we fail to comply with our reporting obligations.
     From time to time we have issued shares of our common stock in transactions exempt from registration requirements, and such shares are “restricted securities” within the meaning of Rule 144.  Rule 144 generally permits the resale, subject to various terms and conditions, of restricted securities after they have been held for six months.  However, one of our predecessors was a former shell company and, as a result, securities laws also might deem us to be a former shell company.  If we are deemed a former shell company, Rule 144 may be unavailable for resales of our restricted common stock unless we have satisfied certain reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), for the twelve months preceding the time of sale.  However, we cannot assure you that future reports or other materials will be filed as necessary to maintain the availability of the exemption under Rule 144. If we are deemed a former shell company and we fail to comply with our reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, Rule 144 will be unavailable to holders of our restricted common stock, which may limit the holders’ ability to sell such restricted shares.  In addition, because of the on-going reporting requirements under Rule 144, restrictive legends on certificates for shares of our common stock cannot be removed except in connection with an actual sale that is subject to an effective registration statement under, or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of, the Securities Act.
     While we audit our licensees from time to time in the ordinary course, we otherwise rely on the accuracy of our licensees’ retail sales reports for reporting and collecting our revenues, and if these reports are untimely or incorrect, our revenue could be delayed or inaccurately reported.
     Under our existing agreements, our licensees pay us licensing fees based in part on the retail value of products sold. We rely on our licensees to accurately report the retail sales in collecting our license fees, preparing our financial reports, projections, budgets, and directing our sales and marketing efforts. All of our license agreements permit us to audit our licensees. If any of our licensee reports understate the retail sales of products they sell, we may not collect and recognize revenue to which we are entitled, or may endure significant expense to obtain compliance.
 ﻿
 We do not foresee paying dividends in the foreseeable future.
     We have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Instead, we plan to retain any earnings to maintain and expand our existing licensing operations, further develop our brands and finance the acquisition of additional brands.

 We have a significant amount of intangible assets, including our trademarks, recorded on our balance sheet. As a result of changes in market conditions and declines in the estimated fair value of these assets, we have been required to write-down all of our goodwill and a portion of our other intangible assets and may be required to record impairments of our intangible assets in the future which could adversely affect our results of operations.
     As of December 31, 2017, intangible assets represented $1.0 billion, or 90.7% of our total consolidated assets. Under current accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but instead are subject to impairment evaluation based on related estimated fair values, with such testing to be done at least annually. Our trademarks are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Any write-down of intangible assets resulting from future periodic evaluations would, as applicable, either decrease our net income or increase our net loss and those decreases or increases could be material. We recorded non-cash impairment charges of $36.5 million for indefinite-lived intangible assets for certain brands in the third quarter of 2017; the impairments arose due to reduced contractual minimums or reduced sales forecasts in key distribution channels for these brands. Due to the continued, sustained decline in our stock price, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $304.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017.  See Note 7 and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on these impairment charges.
     Our use of certain tax attributes may be limited.
     We have significant net operating losses (“NOLs”). A valuation allowance has been provided as of December 31, 2017 which primarily relates to state net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards. As of December 31, 2017, we have federal NOLs available to carryforward to future periods of $195.6 million which begin expiring in 2024 and we have state NOLs available to carryforward to future periods of $205.7 million which begin expiring in 2018. We have foreign tax credits available to carryforward to future periods of $1.6 million as of December 31, 2017 which began expiring in 2017. We have experienced several changes of ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) which place various limitations on the use of NOLs. The limitation on NOLs is based upon a formula provided under Section 382 of the Code that utilizes the fair market value of us and prevailing interest rates at the time of the ownership change. An “ownership change” is generally a 50% increase in ownership over a three-year period by stockholders who directly or indirectly own at least five percent of a company’s stock. The limitations on the use of the NOLs under Section 382 could affect our ability to offset future taxable income.        We may be a party to litigation in the normal course of business, which could affect our financial position and liquidity.
     From time to time, we may be made a party to litigation in the normal course of business. For example, as the owner of a trademark, we may be named as a defendant in a lawsuit relating to a product designed and manufactured by a licensee of that trademark. If we are alleged to have infringed the intellectual property rights of another party, any resulting litigation could be costly and could damage our reputation. Litigation also diverts the time and resources of management, regardless of the merits of the claim. In most cases, our licensees under the existing license agreements are obligated to defend and indemnify us, as licensor, and our affiliates with respect to such litigation. We also maintain insurance for certain risks, but it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all possible liabilities. Although historically the litigation involving us has not been material to our financial position or our liquidity, any litigation has an element of uncertainty and if any such litigation were to be adversely determined and/or a licensee were to fail to properly indemnify us and/or we did not have appropriate insurance coverage, such litigation could affect our financial position and liquidity.
     Our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer in the event of security breaches, cyber-attacks or unauthorized disclosures of personal information.
     In conducting their business, including their e-commerce business, our licensees and retail partners obtain and transmit confidential information about their customers, including credit card information, through their websites and their information technology systems. To the best of our knowledge, our licensees and retail partners have not experienced any material misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information as a result of a security breach or cyber-attack. If our licensees or retail partners experience such a security breach or cyber-attack, it could adversely affect their business and operations, including damaging their reputation and their relationships with their customers, exposing them to risks of litigation and liability, all of which could have a material adverse effect on their ability to meet their minimum net sales requirements and to make guaranteed minimum royalty payments to us in accordance with the terms of their respective license agreements. We cannot assure you that our licensees and retail partners will not experience any future security breaches, cyber-attacks or unauthorized disclosures. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become more uncertain. As a result, our licensees and retail partners may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information, which could also negatively affect their ability to generate sales and make royalty payments to us, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
