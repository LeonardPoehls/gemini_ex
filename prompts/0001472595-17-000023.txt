Item 1. | Business

Overview
R1 is a leading provider of revenue cycle management, or RCM, services and physician advisory services, or PAS, to healthcare providers. We help healthcare providers generate sustainable improvements in their operating margins and cash flows while also enhancing patient, physician and staff satisfaction for our customers.
We achieve these results for our customers by managing healthcare providers’ revenue cycle operations, which encompass processes including patient registration, insurance and benefit verification, medical treatment documentation and coding, bill preparation and collections from patients and payers. We do so by deploying a unique operating model that leverages our extensive healthcare site experience, innovative technology and process excellence. We assist our RCM customers in managing their revenue cycle operating costs while simultaneously increasing the portion of the maximum potential services revenue they receive. Together, these benefits can generate significant and sustainable improvements in operating margins and cash flows for our customers. 
Our primary service offering consists of end-to-end RCM, which we deploy through a co-managed relationship or an operating partner relationship. Under a co-managed relationship, we leverage our customers’ existing RCM staff and processes, and supplement them with our infused management, subject matter specialists, proprietary technology and other resources. Under an operating partner relationship, we provide comprehensive revenue cycle infrastructure to providers, including all revenue cycle personnel, technology, and process workflow. We also offer modular services, allowing customers to engage us for only specific components of our end-to-end RCM service offering. Our PAS offering assists hospitals in complying with payer requirements regarding whether to classify a hospital visit as an in-patient or an out-patient observation case for billing purposes. This offering consists of both concurrent review and retrospective chart audits to help our customers achieve compliant and accurate billing. We also provide customers with retrospective appeal management service support for both governmental and commercial payers. Our physicians conduct detailed retrospective reviews of medical records to identify medical necessity for hospital services and the required documentation to appropriately support an appeal. We employ trained physicians to deliver these services.
Once implemented, our technology applications, processes and services are deeply embedded in our customers’ day-to-day operations. We believe our service offerings are adaptable to meet an evolving healthcare regulatory environment, technology standards and market trends. 
Segment
All of our significant operations are organized around the single business of providing management services of revenue cycle operations for U.S.-based hospitals and other medical services providers.
We view our operations and manage our business as one operating and reporting segment. All of our net services revenue and trade accounts receivable are derived from healthcare providers domiciled in the United States. The information about our business should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 18, Segments and Customer Concentrations, to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our segment and customer concentrations.

Our Services
Drawing on our combination of our extensive healthcare-site expertise, innovative technology and process excellence, we seek to deliver measurable economic value to our customers across our RCM and PAS solutions.
Revenue Cycle Management Offering
Our primary RCM service offering consists of comprehensive end-to-end RCM services, which address the full spectrum of revenue cycle challenges faced by healthcare providers. Our approach to deliver value for our customers is built on the R1 Performance StackSM, a holistic operating model designed to fit into a healthcare provider’s revenue cycle operations.
The R1 Performance StackSM consists of seven components:
Comprehensive Gains - By leveraging the customer’s data and operating within a health system’s virtual and physical environment, our services are designed to help ensure client economics are significantly improved while enhancing patient experience and improving client revenue predictability as payment models shift. 
Assured Standardization - Our diagnostics and tools are designed to ensure delivery consistency and enable economic gains and enhanced patient experience. Continual measurement and assessment help us achieve these standards. 
Dimensional Visibility - We enable timely defect intervention and recovery workflow by providing a clear window into revenue operations through frequent and comprehensive reporting. 
Analytics & Accountability - We use hundreds of measurement methods to drive comprehensive daily accountability designed to identify and correct small issues before they become organizational problems. 
Proprietary Technologies - Our R1 Hub Technologies integrate across multiple host and payer systems. They are designed to scale and perform in the largest, most complex systems to enable end-to-end process integration.
Proven Process - Our technology, model and processes have been developed through years of experience working with healthcare organizations on their most challenging implementations. The approach and technology are based on standard structures and rigorous methods, tested and proven in multiple organizations and environments. 
Experienced Talent - Our teams understand the missions and unique needs of non-profit organizations. Team members are trained, certified and then continuously developed and supported to ensure they are equipped to deliver on customer revenue cycle management goals. 
Our RCM service offering is designed to adapt to a provider's organizational structure. We seek to integrate our technology, personnel, our accumulated body of knowledge and our culture within each customer’s revenue cycle activities, with the expectation that we will enjoy a long-term collaborative relationship with each customer. We deliver technology and operational support in the form of both on-site management and centralized staffing to deliver improved efficiency and quality across all RCM functions.
Our end-to-end RCM agreements generally provide us with the opportunity to earn net operating fees and incentive fees. Net operating fees represent the gross base fees we charge our customers for operating the revenue cycle processes included in our agreements less corresponding costs of customers’ revenue cycle operations which we undertake to pay pursuant to our RCM agreements. We have modified a portion of our RCM agreements to replace the gross base fees along with our financial obligation to pay our customers' revenue cycle operations expenses with a fee that approximates such difference. We help our customers reduce their revenue cycle costs by implementing new operational practices, optimizing their technology suite and deploying more efficient processes. 
2

In certain cases, we work with our customers to transfer aspects of their revenue cycle operations to our shared services centers, which typically results in lower operating costs than operating those aspects of the revenue cycle at the customers’ site.
Incentive fees are performance-based fees related to agreed-upon improvements in financial or operating metrics at our customers. When using these metrics to calculate this improvement, we typically utilize metrics that are already being tracked by, or easily calculated from, our customers’ respective accounting systems and compare the results of those metrics against the results for the same metrics for a defined prior period.
We seek to improve our customers’ processes using a variety of techniques including:

• | Gathering Complete Patient and Payer Information. We focus on gathering complete patient information and validating insurance eligibility and benefits so patient care services can be recorded and billed to the appropriate parties. For scheduled healthcare services, we educate patients as to their potential financial responsibilities before receiving care. Through our systems, we maintain an automated electronic scorecard which measures the efficiency of up-front data capture, authorization, billing and collections throughout the life cycle of any given patient account. These scorecards are analyzed in the aggregate, and the results are used to help improve work flow processes and operational decisions for our customers.


• | Improving Claims Filing and Payer Collections. Through our proprietary technology and process expertise, we identify, for each patient encounter, the amount our customer should receive from a payer if terms of the applicable contract with the payer and patient policies are followed. Over time, we compare these amounts with the actual payments collected to help identify which payers, types of medical treatments and patients represent various levels of payment risk for a customer. Using proprietary algorithms and analytics, we consider actual reimbursement patterns to predict the payment risk associated with a customer’s claims to its payers, and we then direct increased attention and time to the riskiest accounts.


• | Identifying Alternative Payment Sources. We use various methods to find payment sources for uninsured patients and reimbursement for services not covered by payers. Our patient financial screening technology and methodologies often identify federal, state or private grant sources to help pay for healthcare services. These techniques are designed to ease the financial burden on uninsured or underinsured patients, increase the percentage of patient bills that are actually paid, and improve the total amount of reimbursement received by our customers.


• | Employing Proprietary Technology and Algorithms. We employ a variety of proprietary data analytics and algorithms. For example, we identify patient accounts with financial risk by applying proprietary analysis techniques to the data we have collected. Our systems are designed to streamline work processes through the use of proprietary algorithms that focus revenue cycle staff effort on those accounts deemed to have the greatest potential for improving net revenue yield or charge capture. We adjust our proprietary predictive algorithms to reflect changes in payer and patient behavior based upon the knowledge we obtain from our entire customer base. As new customers are added and payer and patient behavior changes, the information we use to create our algorithms expands, increasing the accuracy, reliability and value of such algorithms.


• | Using Analytical Capabilities and Operational Excellence. We draw on the experience that we have gained from working with some of the best healthcare provider systems in the United States to train our customers’ staff about new and innovative RCM practices. We use sophisticated analytical procedures to identify specific opportunities to improve business processes.


• | Increasing Charge Capture. We are able to help our customers increase their charge capture by implementing optimization techniques and related processes. We use sophisticated analytics software to help improve the accuracy of claims filings and the resolution of disputed claims from payers. We also overlay a range of capabilities designed to reduce missed charges, improve the clinical/reimbursement interface and produce bills that comply with payer requirements and applicable healthcare regulations.

3


• | Leveraging our Shared Services Centers. We help our customers increase their revenue cycle efficiency by implementing improved practices, streamlining work flow processes and outsourcing aspects of their revenue cycle operations to our shared services centers. Examples of services that can be completed at our shared services centers in the United States and India include pre-registration, medical transcription, cash posting, reconciliation of payments to billing records, and patient and payer follow-up. By leveraging the economies of scale and experience of our shared services centers, we believe that we offer our customers better quality services at a lower cost.

We believe that these techniques are enhanced by our proprietary and integrated technology, management experience and well-developed processes. Our proprietary technology applications include workflow automation and direct payer connection capabilities that enable revenue cycle staff to focus on problem accounts rather than on manual tasks, such as searching payer websites for insurance and benefits verification for all patients. We employ technology that identifies and isolates specific cases requiring review or action, using the same interface for all users, to automate a host of tasks that otherwise can consume a significant amount of staff time. Our proprietary technology enhances the ability of our customers' revenue cycle staff to improve their interaction with patients. We use real-time feedback from our customers to improve the functionality and performance of our technology and processes and incorporate these improvements into our service offerings on a regular basis. We strive to apply operational excellence throughout our customers' entire revenue cycle.
In 2016, we integrated our value-based reimbursement capabilities into our RCM offering. These capabilities include a secure web-based workflow application that utilizes data analytics designed to enable patient engagement staff, revenue cycle analysts, and physician/hospital care teams to monitor and manage gaps identified by our proprietary rules engines. 
Physician Advisory Services Offering
Our PAS offering provides concurrent level of care billing classification reviews, as well as retrospective chart audits to assist hospitals in properly billing payers for selected services. These services complement our RCM offering and our ability to provide our customers end-to-end management services, and, accordingly, some of our RCM customers are also customers of our PAS offering. According to the policies of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the decision to classify a patient as an in-patient or out-patient observation case for billing purposes is based on complex medical judgment that can only be made after the physician has considered a number of factors, including the patient’s medical history and current medical needs, the severity of signs and symptoms, the medical predictability of adverse events and the patient’s anticipated length of stay. Using our secure web portal, hospital customers transmit pertinent data about the case at hand to our trained physicians, who then leverage our proprietary diagnosis guidelines and the extensive information within our knowledge database to reach an informed billing classification judgment, which we then provide to our customers as a recommendation.
We also provide customers with retrospective appeal management service support for both governmental and commercial payers. Our physicians conduct detailed retrospective reviews of medical records to identify medical necessity for hospital services and the required documentation to appropriately support an appeal.
We believe that our PAS offering provides our customers with a number of operational benefits, such as

• | direct physician to physician contact,


• | improved service levels, and


• | real-time reporting and analytics.

Relationship with Ascension
On February 16, 2016, we entered into a long-term strategic partnership with Ascension Health Alliance, the parent of our largest customer and the nation’s largest Catholic and non-profit health system, and TowerBrook Capital Partners, or TowerBrook, an investment management firm. As part of the transaction, we amended and 
4

restated our Master Professional Services Agreement, or A&R MPSA, with Ascension Healthcare, or Ascension, effective February 16, 2016 with a term of ten years. Pursuant to the A&R MPSA and with certain limited exceptions, we are the exclusive provider of revenue cycle management services and PAS with respect to acute care services provided by the hospitals affiliated with Ascension that execute supplement agreements with us. In addition, at the close of the transaction, we issued to TCP-ASC ACHI Series LLLP, a limited liability limited partnership jointly owned by Ascension Health Alliance and investment funds affiliated with TowerBrook, or the Investor: (i) 200,000 shares of our 8.00% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share, or the Series A Preferred Stock, for an aggregate price of $200 million and (ii) a warrant with a term of ten years to acquire up to 60 million shares of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share, or common stock, at an exercise price of $3.50 per share, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant Agreement, or the Warrant. The Series A Preferred Stock is immediately convertible into shares of common stock. We refer herein to the foregoing transactions consummated on February 16, 2016 with the Investor and Ascension as the "Transaction".
This long-term strategic partnership has expanded our relationship with Ascension, and we expect that it will continue to expand that relationship, help us to grow our overall business and improve our ability to win customers outside of the Ascension hospital base. We have made significant progress in the phased implementation of our services for those Ascension hospitals that we did not previously service which we intend to service under the A&R MPSA. Our RCM services for both Ascension hospitals that we previously serviced under our prior Master Professional Services Agreement with Ascension and those Ascension hospitals that we have begun to service or intend to begin to service under the A&R MPSA will be based on our operating partner service offering model, whereby a significant number of Ascension's revenue cycle employees at those hospitals have become, or in the case of those hospitals we intend to begin servicing in the future, will become our employees. As a result of the implementation of our operating partner model under the A&R MPSA, we expect to expand our operations in the United States and off shore and intend to continue to invest in technology, facilities and talent to support our anticipated growth. This operating partner model includes the transition of the non-payroll related expenses supporting Ascension's revenue cycle operations to direct expenses of R1. We anticipate that this new in-house capability of managing these non-payroll related expenses will allow us to pursue new business opportunities which require an operating partner business model. We believe the ten year term of the A&R MPSA, together with the significant investment in R1 by Ascension, our largest customer, provides our business with stability and growth. In addition, our management team continues to benefit from the oversight provided by having TowerBrook involved as a strategic investor.
Customers
Our customers typically are single or multi-hospital healthcare systems, including faith-based healthcare systems, community healthcare systems, academic medical centers and their respective affiliated ambulatory clinics and physician practice groups, certain of which have common affiliations to larger umbrella healthcare organizations that are also parties to our customer contracts with their respective affiliates. We seek to develop strategic, long-term relationships with our customers and focus on providers that we believe understand the value of our operating model and have demonstrated success in both the provision of healthcare services and the ability to achieve financial and operational results.
Hospital systems affiliated with Ascension have accounted for a significant portion of our net services revenue each year since our formation. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, net services revenue from hospitals affiliated with Ascension accounted for 78%, 45% and 12% of our total net services revenue, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Intermountain Healthcare accounted for 15% of our total net services revenue. 
Customer Agreements
We generally provide our RCM offering pursuant to managed services agreements with our customers. In rendering our services, we must comply with customer policies and procedures regarding charity care, personnel, data security, compliance and risk management, as well as applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. 
5

Our end-to-end RCM agreements typically span three to five years (subject to the parties' respective termination rights). In general, our RCM agreements provide that:

• | we are required to staff a sufficient number of our own employees commensurate with the service offering and provide the technology necessary to implement and manage our services;


• | in our co-managed relationship model, our management and staff work cooperatively with our customers’ management and staff to achieve mutually specified objectives, and in our operating partner relationship model, we are responsible for providing all revenue cycle personnel, technology and process workflow;


• | a portion of our fees are tied to the achievement of certain financial or operating metrics; and


• | the parties provide representations and indemnities to each other.

Our agreements for PAS and modular RCM services generally vary in length between one and three years. Customers pay a contractually negotiated fee for this service on a per-use basis or, in the case of certain modular RCM services, a fixed fee arrangement.
Sales and Marketing
Our new business opportunities are generated through a combination of high-level industry contacts engaged by our commercial services team and other members of our senior management team. Our sales and marketing process generally begins by engaging senior executives of the prospective hospital or healthcare system, typically followed by our assessment of the prospect’s existing operations, and a review of the findings. We begin negotiations with a standardized contract that is customized as necessary after collaborative discussions of operational and management issues and our proposed working relationship. Our sales process for RCM managed services agreements typically lasts six to 18 months from the introductory meeting to the agreement’s execution, while our sales process for our physician advisory services offering typically lasts three to four months.
Technology
Technology Development
Our technology development organization operates out of various facilities in the United States and India. We continue to invest in the improvement of our technology in order to enhance the services that we provide our customers. All customer sites run the same base set of code. We use a beta-testing environment to develop and test new technology offerings at one or more customers, while keeping the rest of our customers on production-level code.
Our applications are deployed on a highly-scalable architecture based upon Microsoft and other industry leading platforms. We offer a common experience for end-users and believe the consistent look and feel of our applications allows our customers and staff to use our software suite quickly and easily.
We devote substantial resources to our development efforts and plan at an annual, bi-annual and quarterly release level. We employ a structured system to assess the impact that potential new technologies or enhancements will have on net services revenue, costs, efficiency and customer satisfaction. The results of this analysis are evaluated in conjunction with our overall corporate goals when making development decisions. In addition to our technology development team, our operations personnel play an integral role in setting technology priorities in support of their objective of keeping our software operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
Technology Operations and Security
Our applications are hosted in data centers located in Alpharetta, Georgia and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and our internal financial application suite is hosted in various locations in a U.S. based cloud model. These data centers 
6

are operated for us by third parties and are compliant with the Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements, or SSAE, No. 16, Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization (Service Organization Controls 1). Our development, testing and quality assurance environments are operated from the third-party data centers in Alpharetta, Georgia and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. We have agreements with our hardware and system software suppliers for support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our operations personnel also use our resources located in our other U.S. facilities, as well as our India facilities.
Customers use high-speed internet connections and private network connections to access our business applications. We utilize commercially available hardware and a combination of custom-developed and commercially available software. We designed our primary application in this manner to permit scalable growth. For example, database servers can be added without adding web servers, and vice versa. 
Databases are backed-up frequently by automatically shipping data files with accumulated changes to separate sets of back-up servers. In addition to serving as a back-up, these data files update the data in our online analytical processing engine, enabling the data to be more current than if only refreshed overnight. Data and information regarding our customers’ patients is encrypted when transmitted over the internet or traveling off-site on portable media such as laptops or backup tapes.
Our software interacts with our customers’ software through a series of real-time and batch interfaces. We do not require changes to the customer’s core patient care delivery or financial systems. Instead of installing hardware or software in customer locations or data centers, we specify the information that a customer needs to extract from its existing systems in order to interface with our systems. This methodology enables our systems to operate with many combinations of customer systems, including custom and industry-standard implementations. 
When these interfaces are in place, we provide a holistic application suite across the hospital revenue cycle. For our purposes, the revenue cycle starts when a patient registers for future service or arrives at a hospital or clinic for unscheduled service, and ends when the hospital has collected all the appropriate revenue from all possible sources. Thus, we provide eligibility, address validation, skip tracing, charge capture, patient and payer follow-up, analytics and tracking, charge master management, contract modeling, contract "what if" analysis, collections and other functions throughout the customer’s revenue cycle. 
In the event that a combination of events causes a system failure, we would follow planned and tested process steps designed to isolate the failure. We believe that no combination of failures by our systems can impact a customer’s ability to deliver patient care because our systems run parallel to the client’s host system, which is the system of record for all patient related information.
Our third-party data centers are designed to withstand many catastrophic events such as blizzards, hurricanes and power grid anomalies. To protect against a catastrophic event in which our primary data center is destroyed and service cannot be fully restored within a few days, we store backups of our systems, applications and databases off-site. Our secondary data center would become the primary data center until restoration at the primary site. We would re-establish operations by provisioning new servers, restoring data from the off-site backups and re-establishing connectivity with our customers’ host systems. Because our systems are web-based, no changes would need to be made on customer workstations, and customers would be able to reconnect as our systems became available again.
We dedicate significant resources to protecting our customers’ confidential and protected health information, or PHI. Our security strategy employs various practices and technologies to control, audit, monitor and protect access to sensitive information. We received, and have maintained since January 2013, a certification status from the Health Information Trust Alliance, or HITRUST. HITRUST is a healthcare industry group focused on identifying a prescriptive set of information technology controls that are based on standards and regulations relevant to the healthcare industry. HITRUST certification is aligned with ISO 27001 and ISO 27002. Our HITRUST certification validates our continued commitment to compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, and the regulations that have been issued under it, such as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH Act, or HITECH, and OMNIBUS regulations, which we collectively refer to as HIPAA, and to various states’ security and privacy laws regarding the creation, access, storage or 
7

exchange of personal health and financial information. Our HITRUST certification status also signifies that we exhibit and are able to maintain high security standards for the management and protection of electronic PHI.
Proprietary Software Suites
Revenue Cycle Management. Our integrated suite of RCM technology provides a layer of analytics, rules processing and workflow capabilities that interface with provider systems to optimize process efficiency and effectiveness. These technologies power the detection of defects on patient accounts and enable staff workflow at point of service areas, customer sites and our shared service centers.

• | "R1 Access" powers workflow in customer central business offices and at our scaled shared service centers for pre-registration, financial clearance, and financial counseling. The platform processes patient accounts through proprietary rules engines tuned to identify defects in demographic data, authorization processes, insurance benefits and eligibility and medical necessity. Our rules engines in R1 Access are also used to calculate patient cost estimates and prior balance accounts receivables. For the uninsured, the platform helps staff triage patients to find coverage for their visit. Our technology enables staff to work on an exception basis eliminating the need for manual intervention on accounts with no exceptions identified.


• | "R1 Link" delivers all of the insight and defect detection capabilities of our proprietary rules engines in real-time to point of service emergency department and registration areas within the hospitals and clinics. When defects or inconsistent data are detected in the data entry or registration process, users receive targeted messages alerting them to resolve the issue while the patient is still in front of them.


• | "R1 Contact," our patient contact application, provides the workflow and data for patient contact center representatives. It enables effective financial discussions with patients on outstanding balances. The platform is integrated into our call center, call-routing, and auto-dialer capabilities and facilitates improved outcomes through propriety process and technology approaches.


• | "R1 Contract," our proprietary contract modeling platform, is used to accurately calculate the maximum allowed reimbursement for each claim based upon models of our customer's contract with each payer. This platform is used to provide insight into the health of payer contracts and to power portions of the workflow tools described above.


• | "R1 Analytics," our web-based reporting and analytics platform, produces over 300 proprietary reports derived from the financial, process and productivity data that we accumulate as a result of our services, which enable us to monitor and identify areas for improvement in the efficacy of our RCM services.


• | "R1 Decision," classifies defects in a proprietary nomenclature and distributes data to back end teams for follow up and resolution according to standard operating processes. Defects are identified and noted on accounts as they occur. The platform, along with our "Yield-Based Follow Up" application, is designed to power customer patient financial services departments and our shared services.

These propriety technology applications run on an integrated platform built on a modern event driven architecture and rules engines that enhances integration of systems and operational workflows.
Physician Advisory Services. Our proprietary PAS tools are designed to assist our customers in the initiation of a service request by our physician advisory team. Our platform allows for the electronic submission, tracking, reviewing and auditing of patient cases referred to us. The PAS portal environment is established as a secure site that enables us to receive patient records from customer case managers and route them to our physicians for review. This workflow is supported by an analytics engine within the web portal that provides our customers the ability to improve their compliance and workflow with our real time reporting, dashboards and worklists.

Competition
The market for our solutions is highly competitive and we expect competition to intensify in the future. We believe that competition for the services we provide is based primarily on the following factors:

• | knowledge and understanding of the complex healthcare payment and reimbursement system in the United States;


• | a track record of delivering revenue improvements and efficiency gains for hospitals and healthcare systems;


• | predictable and measurable results;


• | the ability to deliver a solution that is fully-integrated along each step of a hospital’s revenue cycle operations;


• | cost-effectiveness, including the breakdown between up-front costs and pay-for-performance incentive compensation;


• | reliability, simplicity and flexibility of technology platforms;


• | understanding of the healthcare industry’s regulatory environment; and


• | sufficient and scalable infrastructure and financial stability.

We believe that we compete effectively based upon all of these criteria, although our ability to acquire new customers has been and may continue to be adversely effected by the restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements, or the Restatement.
We face competition from various sources, including other end-to-end RCM providers and the internal RCM departments of healthcare organizations. Hospitals that previously have made internal investments in their RCM departments sometimes choose to continue to rely on their own internal RCM staff.
We also compete with several categories of external market participants, most of which focus on specific components of hospital revenue cycle. External market participants include:

• | software vendors and other technology-supported RCM business process outsourcing companies;


• | traditional consultants; and


• | information technology outsourcers.

These types of external participants also compete with us in the field of physician advisory services. 
Although we believe that there are barriers to replicating our end-to-end RCM solution, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Other companies may develop superior or more economical service offerings that healthcare providers could find more attractive than our offerings. Moreover, the regulatory landscape may shift in a direction that is more strategically advantageous to existing and future competitors.
Government Regulation
The customers we serve are subject to a complex array of federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations may change rapidly and unpredictably, and it is frequently unclear how they apply to our business. 
9

We devote significant efforts, through training of personnel and monitoring, to establish and maintain compliance with all regulatory requirements that we believe are applicable to our business and the services we offer.
Government Regulation of Health Information
Privacy and Security Regulations. HIPAA contains substantial restrictions and requirements with respect to the use and disclosure of an individual's PHI. HIPAA prohibits a covered entity from using or disclosing an individual’s PHI unless the use or disclosure is authorized by the individual or is specifically required or permitted under HIPAA. Under HIPAA, covered entities must establish administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI maintained or transmitted by them or by others on their behalf.
HIPAA applies to covered entities such as healthcare providers that engage in HIPAA-defined standard electronic transactions, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses. In February 2009, HIPAA was amended by the HITECH Act to impose certain of the HIPAA privacy and security requirements directly upon "business associates" that perform functions on behalf of, or provide services to, certain covered entities. Most of our customers are covered entities and we are a business associate to many such customers under HIPAA as a result of our contractual obligations to perform certain functions on behalf of, and provide certain services to, those customers. As a business associate, we sometimes also act as a clearinghouse in performing certain functions for our customers. In order to provide customers with services that involve the use or disclosure of PHI, HIPAA requires our customers to enter into business associate agreements with us.
Such agreements must, among other things, provide adequate written assurances:

• | as to how we will use and disclose the PHI;


• | that we will implement reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information from misuse;


• | that we will enter into similar agreements with our agents and subcontractors that have access to the information;


• | that we will report security incidents and other inappropriate uses or disclosures of the information; and


• | that we will assist the customer with certain of its duties under HIPAA.

Transaction Requirements. In addition to privacy and security requirements, HIPAA also requires that certain electronic transactions related to healthcare billing be conducted using prescribed electronic formats. For example, claims for reimbursement that are transmitted electronically to payers must comply with specific formatting standards, and these standards apply whether the payer is a government or a private entity. We are contractually required to structure and provide our services in a way that supports our customers’ HIPAA compliance obligations. 
Data Security and Breaches. In recent years, there have been well-publicized data breach incidents involving the improper dissemination of personal health and other information of individuals, both within and outside of the healthcare industry. Many states have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to data breach incidents, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and government authorities. In many cases, these laws are limited to electronic data, but states are increasingly enacting or considering stricter and broader requirements. Under the HITECH Act and its implementing regulations, business associates are also required to notify covered entities, which in turn are required to notify affected individuals and government authorities of data security breaches involving unsecured PHI. In addition, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, has prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act, or FTC Act. We have implemented and maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards intended to protect all personal 
10

data, and have processes in place to assist us in complying with applicable laws and regulations regarding the protection of this data and properly responding to any security incidents.
State Laws. In addition to HIPAA, most states have enacted patient confidentiality laws that protect against the unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information, and many states have adopted or are considering further legislation in this area, including privacy safeguards, security standards and data security breach notification requirements. Such state laws, if more stringent than HIPAA requirements, are not preempted by the federal requirements, and we must comply with them even though they may be subject to different interpretations by various courts and other governmental authorities.
Other Requirements. In addition to HIPAA, numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of individually identifiable health and other information and healthcare provider information. The FTC has issued guidance for, and several states have issued or are considering new regulations to require, holders of certain types of personally identifiable information to implement formal policies and programs to prevent, detect and mitigate the risk of identity theft and other unauthorized access to or use of such information. Further, federal and state legislation has been proposed, and through rule making or executive action, several states have taken action, to restrict or discourage the disclosure of medical or other personally identifiable information to individuals or entities located outside of the United States.
Government Regulation of Reimbursement
Our customers are subject to regulation by a number of governmental agencies, including those that administer the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Accordingly, our customers are sensitive to legislative and regulatory changes in, and limitations on, the government healthcare programs and changes in reimbursement policies, processes and payment rates. During recent years, there have been numerous federal legislative and administrative actions that have affected government programs, including adjustments that have reduced or increased payments to physicians and other healthcare providers and adjustments that have affected the complexity of our work. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, or ACA, may reduce reimbursement for some healthcare providers while increasing reimbursement for others including primary care physicians. In addition, the ACA mandates the implementation of various programs and value and quality-based reimbursement incentives that may impact the amount of reimbursement for our customers. For example, the adjustment related to the Medicare Value-Based Purchasing Program will increase from 1.5% in 2015 to 2.0% in 2017 and the adjustment related to the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program increased from 1.0% in 2013 to 3.0% in 2015 and applies to an increased number of conditions. It is possible that the federal or state governments will implement additional reductions, increases or changes in reimbursement in the future under government programs that adversely affect our customer base or increase the cost of providing our services. Any such changes could adversely affect our own financial condition by reducing the reimbursement rates of our customers.
Fraud and Abuse Laws
A number of federal and state laws, generally referred to as fraud and abuse laws, apply to healthcare providers, physicians and others that make, offer, seek or receive referrals or payments for products or services that may be paid for through any federal or state healthcare program and in some instances any private program. Given the breadth of these laws and regulations, they may affect our business, either directly or because they apply to our customers. These laws and regulations include:
Anti-Kickback Laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that govern patient referrals, physician financial relationships, and inducements to healthcare providers and patients. The federal healthcare anti-kickback law prohibits any person or entity from offering, paying, soliciting or receiving anything of value, directly or indirectly, for the referral of patients covered by Medicare, Medicaid and certain other federal healthcare programs or the leasing, purchasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the lease, purchase or order of any item, good, facility or service covered by these programs. Courts have construed this anti-kickback law to mean that a financial arrangement may violate this law if any one of the purposes of an arrangement is to induce referrals of federal healthcare programs, patients or business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the 
11

arrangement. There are several limited exclusions known as safe harbors that may protect certain arrangements from enforcement penalties although these safe harbors tend to be quite narrow. Penalties for federal anti-kickback violations can be severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties with triple damages and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Anti-kickback law violations also may give rise to a civil False Claims Act, or FCA, action, as described below. Many states have adopted similar prohibitions against kickbacks and other practices that are intended to induce referrals, and some of these state laws are applicable to all patients regardless of whether the patient is covered under a governmental health program or private health plan.
False or Fraudulent Claim Laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with the submission and payment of provider claims for reimbursement. In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment, for example, by systematic over treatment or duplicate billing of the same services to collect increased or duplicate payments.
In particular, the federal FCA prohibits a person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a civil false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval by an officer, employee or agent of the United States. The FCA also prohibits a person from knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to such a claim. The FCA was amended on May 20, 2009 by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, or FERA. Following the FERA amendments, the FCA’s "reverse false claim" provision also creates liability for persons who knowingly conceal an overpayment of government money or knowingly and improperly retain an overpayment of government funds. In addition, the ACA requires providers to report and return overpayments and to explain the reason for the overpayment in writing within 60 days of the date on which the overpayment is identified, and the failure to do so is punishable under the FCA. Violations of the FCA may result in treble damages, significant monetary penalties, and other collateral consequences including, potentially, exclusion from participation in federally funded healthcare programs. In 2016, penalties for FCA violations doubled and can now range from $10,781 to $21,563 per claim (up from $5,000 to $11,000). The scope and implications of the FCA amendments have yet to be fully determined or adjudicated and as a result it is difficult to predict how future enforcement initiatives may impact our business.
In addition, under the Civil Monetary Penalty Act of 1981, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to impose administrative penalties and assessments against any person, including an organization or other entity, who knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to a state or federal government employee or agent certain false or otherwise improper claims.
Stark Law and Similar State Laws. The Ethics in Patient Referrals Act, known as the Stark Law, prohibits certain types of referral arrangements between physicians and healthcare entities and thus potentially applies to our customers. Specifically, under the Stark Law, absent an applicable exception, a physician may not make a referral to an entity for the furnishing of designated health service, or DHS, for which payment may be made by the Medicare program if the physician or any immediate family member has a financial relationship with that entity. Further, an entity that furnishes DHS pursuant to a prohibited referral may not present or cause to be presented a claim or bill for such services to the Medicare program or to any other individual or entity. Violations of the statute can result in civil monetary penalties and/or exclusion from federal healthcare programs. Stark Law violations also may give rise to a civil FCA action. Any such violations by, and penalties and exclusions imposed upon, our customers could adversely affect their financial condition and, in turn, could adversely affect our own financial condition.
Laws in many states similarly forbid billing based on referrals between individuals and/or entities that have various financial, ownership or other business relationships. These laws vary widely from state to state.
Laws Limiting Assignment of Reimbursement Claims
Various federal and state laws, including Medicare and Medicaid, forbid or limit assignments of claims for reimbursement from government funded programs. Some of these laws limit the manner in which business service companies may handle payments for such claims and prevent such companies from charging their provider customers on the basis of a percentage of collections or charges. We do not believe that the services we provide our 
12

customers result in an assignment of claims for the Medicare or Medicaid reimbursements for purposes of federal healthcare programs. Any determination to the contrary, however, could adversely affect our ability to be paid for the services we provide to our customers, require us to restructure the manner in which we are paid, or have further regulatory consequences.
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act
The federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, or EMTALA, was adopted by the U.S. Congress in response to reports of a widespread hospital emergency room practice of "patient dumping." At the time of EMTALA’s enactment, patient dumping was considered to have occurred when a hospital capable of providing the needed care sent a patient to another facility or simply turned the patient away based on such patient’s inability to pay for his or her care. EMTALA imposes requirements as to the care that must be provided to anyone who seeks care at facilities providing emergency medical services. In addition, CMS of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has issued final regulations clarifying those areas within a hospital system that must provide emergency treatment, procedures to meet on-call requirements, as well as other requirements under EMTALA. Sanctions for failing to fulfill these requirements include exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and civil monetary penalties. In addition, the law creates private civil remedies that enable an individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a violation of the law to sue the offending hospital for damages and equitable relief. A hospital that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another participating hospital’s violation of the law also has a similar right.
EMTALA generally applies to our customers, and we assist our customers with the intake of their patients. Although we believe that our customers’ medical screening, stabilization and transfer practices are generally in compliance with the law and applicable regulations, we cannot be certain that governmental officials responsible for enforcing the law or others will not assert that we or our customers are in violation of these laws nor what obligations may be imposed by regulations to be issued in the future.
Regulation of Debt Collection Activities
The federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, or FDCPA, regulates persons who regularly collect or attempt to collect, directly or indirectly, consumer debts owed or asserted to be owed to another person. Certain of our accounts receivable activities may be deemed to be subject to the FDCPA. The FDCPA establishes specific guidelines and procedures that debt collectors must follow in communicating with consumer debtors, including the time, place and manner of such communications. Further, it prohibits harassment or abuse by debt collectors, including the threat of violence or criminal prosecution, obscene language or repeated telephone calls made with the intent to abuse or harass. The FDCPA also places restrictions on communications with individuals other than consumer debtors in connection with the collection of any consumer debt and sets forth specific procedures to be followed when communicating with such third parties for purposes of obtaining location information about the consumer. In addition, the FDCPA contains various notice and disclosure requirements and prohibits unfair or misleading representations by debt collectors. Finally, the FDCPA imposes certain limitations on lawsuits to collect debts against consumers.
Debt collection activities are also regulated at the state level. Most states have laws regulating debt collection activities in ways that are similar to, and in some cases more stringent than, the FDCPA. In addition, some states require companies engaged in the collection of consumer debt to be licensed. In all states where we operate, we believe that we currently hold all required state licenses or are exempt from licensing.
We are also subject to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, or TCPA. In the process of communicating with our customers’ patients, we use a variety of communications methods. The TCPA places certain restrictions on companies that place telephone calls to consumers.
The FTC has the authority to investigate consumer complaints relating to the FDCPA and the TCPA, and to initiate or recommend enforcement actions, including actions to seek monetary penalties. State officials typically have authority to enforce corresponding state laws. In addition, affected consumers may bring suits, including class 
13

action suits, to seek monetary remedies (including statutory damages) for violations of the federal and state provisions discussed above.
Regulation of Credit Card Activities
We process, on behalf of our customers, credit card payments from their patients. Various federal and state laws impose privacy and information security laws and regulations with respect to the use of credit cards. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations or experience a credit card security breach, our reputation could be damaged, possibly resulting in lost future business, and we could be subjected to additional legal or financial risk as a result of non-compliance.
ICD-10
On October 1, 2015, the International Classification of Diseases 9, or ICD-9, which was used to report medical diagnoses and in-patient procedures was replaced by International Classification of Diseases 10, or ICD-10. ICD-10 affects coding for all covered entities, is significantly more complex than ICD-9, and has required system and business changes throughout the healthcare industry.
Foreign Regulations
Our operations in India are subject to additional regulations that govern the creation, continuation and winding up of companies, as well as the relationships between the shareholders, the company, the public and the government.
Intellectual Property
We rely upon a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws and contractual terms and conditions to protect our intellectual property rights, and have sought patent protection for aspects of our key innovations.
We have been issued three U.S. patents, which expire in 2028, 2030 and 2031, and have filed three additional U.S. patent applications that relate to key domains of our R1 Access software suite: improving efficiency of client claims' reimbursement, follow-up and measurement. Legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patents can be uncertain. We do not know whether any of our pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. Our patent applications may not result in the grant of patents with the scope of the claims that we seek, if at all, or the scope of the granted claims may not be sufficiently broad to protect our products and technology. Our three granted patents or any patents that may be granted in the future from pending or future applications may be opposed, contested, circumvented, designed around by a third party or found to be invalid or unenforceable. Third parties may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies, duplicate or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary technologies or design around patents owned or licensed by us. If our technology is found to infringe any patent or other intellectual property right held by a third party, we could be prevented from providing our service offerings and/or subjected to significant damage awards.
We also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. We control access to and the use of our application capabilities through a combination of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, customers, contractors and business partners. We license some of our software through agreements that impose specific restrictions on our customers’ ability to use the software, such as prohibiting reverse engineering and limiting the use of copies. We also require employees and contractors to sign non-disclosure agreements and invention assignment agreements to give us ownership of intellectual property developed in the course of working for us.
Consistent with common industry practices, we sometimes utilize open source software or third party software products to meet our clients' needs.
