ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
------------------

History and Organization 
 

Santa Fe Gold Corporation (“Santa Fe”, "the Company”, “our” or “we”) is a U.S. mining company, incorporated in 1991 in the state of Delaware. Our general business strategy is to acquire explore, develop and to create shareholder value. The Company acquired the Summit project in 2006 and in subsequent years completed engineering studies, raised capital financing, built a process mill, partially developed an underground mine, and began processing mineralized material in 2010. The operation was consistently under-capitalized and on November 8, 2013, the Company suspended all mining and milling operations and placed its Summit mine and mill on care and maintenance for lack of working capital. 
 

As a consequence of chronic underfunding, constrained liquidity, an overly-leveraged balance sheet, operational and management challenges and declining precious metals prices, for the past several years Santa Fe have pursued a strategic or financial partner. In this regard, Santa Fe has entered into three strategic transactions, all of which were subject to certain customary conditions, but unfortunately, they all failed in resolving the issues of Santa Fe Gold. 
 

At this time, each of the projects is non-operational, because of the lack the funding to conduct additional technical work, including drilling and sampling, to reclassify some of the mineralized material at the Summit Project as “reserves,” and to restart any mining, milling, or processing activities. Consequently, there was no way of generating income. With no available cash or even the prospect of generating cash flow, we faced multiple threats, including, without limitation, litigation with the Summit Mine 
 royalty holder for past due royalties, collection efforts of a judgment creditor, and defaults under numerous debt instruments including, without limitation, the Pre-Petition Credit Agreement and the Sandstorm Gold Supply Agreement. In light of these challenges, along with their failed restructuring efforts to date, Santa Fe have determined that they have no choice but to aggressively pursue and consider all possible transaction scenarios. Most recently, Santa Fe began working with Canaccord Genuity, Inc. (“Canaccord”) as their investment banker to assist with these efforts. Their role has included negotiating with interested parties, preparing for and initiating marketing efforts, and facilitating due diligence requests for the sale of all assets.
 

In August 2015 the Company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in Delaware in order to secure the existing assets from creditor actions. Case No. 15-11761 (MFW). In the declaration of our CEO on the petition he states: “On the date hereof (the “Petition Date”), the Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code, 11 U.S.C. §§ 101-1532 (the “Bankruptcy Code”). As discussed, the Debtors’ primary objective in commencing these Chapter 11 cases is to pursue an expedited sale of their assets in order to maximize value for all shareholders.” See NOTE 19 – CHAPTER 11 and 363 ASSET SALE to the financial statements for more information. 
 Recent Developments 
 

On July 15, 2014, we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the "Share Exchange Agreement") with Canarc Resource Corp., a British Columbia, and a Canada corporation whose common shares are listed on the TSX Exchange under the symbol CCM ("Canarc"). Under the terms of the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company will issue 66,000,000 shares of its common stock to 

5

Canarc and, in exchange, Canarc will issue 33,000,000 of its common shares to the Company (the "Share Exchange"). Upon consummation of the Share Exchange, the Company will own approximately 17 percent of Canarc’s outstanding common shares and Canarc will own approximately 34 percent of Santa Fe's outstanding common shares. The Share Exchange Agreement contains representations, warranties, conditions and covenants of the parties customary for transactions of this type.
 

 The purpose of the Share Exchange is to facilitate a significant turnaround for Santa Fe and a material new opportunity for Canarc driven by the appointment of Canarc nominees to the Santa Fe management team and Board of Directors, the re-capitalization of Santa Fe, the re-structuring of Santa Fe secured debt and re-development of its Summit gold-silver mine in New Mexico to production while preserving Santa Fe’s net operating loss carry-forwards totaling in excess of $88 million. The Agreement contains representations, warranties, conditions and covenants of the parties customary for transactions of this type. 
 

In connection with the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company entered into a “best efforts” placement agency agreement with Euro Pacific Capital, Inc. ("Euro Pacific") pursuant to which Euro Pacific agreed to act as placement agent for the Company and use its "best-efforts" to complete the proposed private placement of 8% Subordinated Secured Redeemable GLD Share Delivery Notes and a Detachable Common Stock Purchase Warrant in the aggregate principal amount between $20 million to $22 million. Euro Pacific did not place any securities or raise any capital for the Company. The Euro Pacific best efforts placement agency agreement expired by its terms on September 30, 2014. 
 

Because Euro Pacific failed to raise any capital pursuant to its best-efforts placement agreement, and because the gold and silver prices have declined sharply in recent months, the Company changed its operational strategy from a mine restart plan to a resource drilling and engineering program. Presently, in light of recent historical operational results, combined with lower metal prices, the Company is reporting no reserves for the Summit property. As such, the Company’s strategy was to conduct additional technical work, including drilling and sampling, to reclassify some of the mineralized material at the Summit project as reserves. 
 

Santa Fe’s management and independent special committee have both discussed this change in strategy with Santa Fe’s senior secured creditor, Waterton Global Value, L.P. (“Waterton”). Waterton has indicated support for the Company’s resource drilling strategy. In this regard, Santa Fe is attempting to generate and evaluate several term sheets to provide necessary funding for its revised work program. No assurances can be given that funding for the program will be secured or that the program will be successful. 
 
The Share Exchange Agreement provided that it would terminate, unless a closing of the transactions contemplated occurred on or before October 15, 2014. Since the transactions did not close, the Share Exchange Agreement terminated pursuant to its terms on October 15, 2014.       
 In connection with the strategic Share Exchange: 
 

Santa Fe’s senior secured creditors, Waterton, Sandstorm Gold Ltd. and Sandstorm Gold (Barbados) Ltd. (“Sandstorm”) entered into respective agreements that demonstrate that they are supportive of the share exchange transaction and that they are amenable to restructuring collectively approximately $20 million of Santa Fe indebtedness. These restructuring agreements are conditional upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement by October 15, 2014. Since Euro Pacific did not raise any funds for Santa Fe pursuant to the terms of the best-efforts placement agency agreement, the transactions contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement will not likely be consummated by October 15, 2014. Santa Fe has informed Waterton of this development and its revised operation strategy to complete a resource drilling and engineering program at its Summit mine. Waterton has expressed its support for such a program. However, Waterton can revoke its support at any time and notice Santa Fe in default. 
 

Mr. Bradford Cooke, Chairman and Founder of Canarc and Founder and CEO of Endeavour Silver Corp. (NYSE:EXK TSX:EDR) was appointed as Chairman of Santa Fe and Santa Fe’s board of directors. 
 

Canarc CEO, Catalin Chiloflischi has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer and Director of Santa Fe and Canarc Chief Operating Officer, Garry Biles has been appointed Chief Operating Officer of Santa Fe. 
 

If the transaction contemplated by the Share Exchange Agreement is not consummated and a superior strategic relationship is not available to Santa Fe, or if the Company fails to restructure or refinance its secured indebtedness with Waterton and Sandstorm (the “Debt Restructurings”), or should any of such indebtedness be accelerated, the Company will not have adequate liquidity to fund its operations, meet its obligations (including its debt payment obligations) and continue as a going concern, and will be forced to seek relief under Chapters 11 or 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (or an involuntary petition for bankruptcy relief or similar creditor action may be filed against it). See Item 1A, “Risk Factors - In the event that we are unable to raise additional capital to satisfy the terms and conditions of the negotiated restructuring of our senior secured indebtedness, we may be forced to seek reorganization or liquidation under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.”

On July 17, 2014, in connection with the Share Exchange Agreement, the Company filed a Form 8-K, which disclosed the Company’s agreement with Canarc that “until the closing of the proposed gold bond financing Messrs. Cooke, Chiloflischi and Biles will be serving without any cash compensation.” On October 3, 2014, Canarc sent an invoice for payment of “allocated” Canarc salaries and expenses for Messrs. Cooke, Chiloflischi, Biles management and expenses fees in the amount of $98,782. After consultation with the Company’s corporate counsel, the Audit Committee determined that Canarc’s demand for payment of such fees was without any valid basis and contradicts the Company’s public disclosures. The Company informed Canarc that the Company cannot accept such invoice from Canarc. In response, Mr. Cooke, Chairman of both the Company and Canarc, demanded that unless the Company accepts Canarc’s invoice, Canarc will terminate the share exchange agreement now and litigate. The Company has informed Canarc that it cannot accept Canarc’s invoice. Subsequently, Canarc has withdrawn the invoice as well as its litigation and termination threats. However, conflicts of interests exist among Canarc affiliated members of the board of directors, on the one hand, and Santa Fe and its stockholders, on the other hand. See Risk Factors -- Conflicts of interest exist among the Company, members of our management team and directors affiliated with Canarc. Canarc affiliated members of our management team and two of our directors owe fiduciary duties to both the Company and Canarc, which may permit them to favor Canarc’s interests to the detriment of Santa Fe and its stockholders.” Canarc and its management were unable to secure the promised funding and they all resigned from their respective positions at Santa Fe Gold and our agreement was terminated on October 15, 2014
Competitive Business Conditions 
 
Many companies are engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and mining of mineral properties. We are at a disadvantage with respect to those competitors whose technical staff and financial resources exceed our own. Although the Company made appointments to management and the Board of Directors in 2014 to enhance our technical capabilities and experience, our lack of revenues and limited financial resources further hinder our ability to acquire and develop mineral interests. 
Government Regulations and Permits 
 
In connection with mining, milling and exploration activities, we are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment, including laws and regulations relating to protection of air and water quality, hazardous waste management and mine reclamation as well as the protection of endangered or threatened species. 
 See Item IA. “Risk Factors” for more information. 
 Reclamation

We generally will be required to mitigate long-term environmental impacts by stabilizing, contouring, re-sloping and revegetating various portions of a site after mining and mineral processing operations are completed. These reclamation efforts would be conducted in accordance with detailed plans, which must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory agencies. 
 Government Regulation

Our mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in the United States, and the State of New Mexico, which govern mining, milling, prospecting, development, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, and waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters. For our Summit Project, we have obtained or have pending applications for those licenses, permits or other authorizations currently required conducting our exploration and other programs. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable mining, health, safety and environmental statutes and regulations in all of the jurisdictions in which we operate. There are no current orders or directions relating to us with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations. 
 Environmental Regulation

Our projects are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations governing protection of the environment. These laws are continually changing and, in general, are becoming more restrictive. Our policy is to conduct business in a way that safeguards public health and the environment. We believe that our operations are conducted in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations. 
 
Changes to current local, state or federal laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we operate could require additional capital expenditures and increased operating and/or reclamation costs. Although we are unable to predict what additional legislation, if any, might be proposed or enacted, additional regulatory requirements could impact the economics of our projects.

During our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, none of our project sites had any material non-compliance occurrences with any applicable environmental regulations. 
Significant Developments in Fiscal 2015 
 Suspension of Mining Operations. 
 
On November 8, 2013, the Company suspended all mining operations and placed its Summit mine and mill on a care and maintenance program due to significant operating losses and a lack of working capital and remained that way for fiscal 2015. 
Proposed Tyhee Merger
 

On January 23, 2014, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Tyhee Gold Corp. (TSX Venture: TDC) (“Tyhee”), and Tyhee Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Tyhee (“Merger Sub”). In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, each of Santa Fe’s three senior secured creditors, Waterton, Sandstorm and International Goldfields Limited (“IGS”), entered into respective preliminary agreements to restructure collectively more than $23.1 million of Santa Fe indebtedness (collectively, the “Debt Restructurings”). 
 
In connection with the Merger, Tyhee advanced only $1,745,092 under a $3 million bridge loan agreement, which is presently due and payable. On March 23, 2014, the Company announced that it had terminated the Merger Agreement as a result of Tyhee’s failure to close the Qualified Financing of $20 million and that it demanded payment from Tyhee of a $300,000 break-fee that Tyhee was obligated to pay. Tyhee has not paid $300,000 the break-fee. Tyhee has not advanced any additional funds under Bridge Loan and has given notice to Santa Fe that Santa Fe in default under the Bridge Loan. Tyhee has demanded that Santa Fe repay the amounts advanced $1,745,082 to Santa Fe together with accrued interest and other costs. Tyhee has not paid the $300,000 break fee to Santa Fe as required by the Merger Agreement. Also, Tyhee has failed to return Santa Fe’s confidential information pursuant to the terms of a Confidentiality Agreement between Santa Fe and Tyhee. Santa Fe has commenced legal action against Tyhee and its chief executive officer for injunctive relief and conversion of Santa Fe’s confidential information. 
 Amendment and Restated Mogollon Option Agreement

Due to lack of funding Santa Fe Gold did elect not making the final payment on or before June 30, 2015 and let the agreement with the last amendment from June 28, 2013 expire without further payments or obligations. 
Waterton
 

 On June 30, 2013, the Company signed a Waiver of Default Letter (the “Letter”) with Waterton Global Value, L.P. (“Waterton”) wherein the Company agreed to sell, convey, assign and transfer certain accounts receivable as consideration for a waiver for non-payment to Waterton under the Credit Agreement. Waterton may revoke the waiver at any time and note the Company in default under the Credit Agreement. The transfer of the accounts receivable to Waterton were to be treated as payment towards outstanding interest payable amounts with any remaining transfer of receivables to be treated as a payment towards other indebtedness under the Credit Agreement, including principal on the note. The measurement of receivables transferred is subject to revaluation in accordance with mark-to-market price adjustments and final settlement of the invoices. The valuation of receivables under the Letter was $1,053,599 at June 30, 2013. Under terms of the Letter, interest payable was reduced by $116,693 and the principal portion of the note was reduced by $768,263, while the remaining $168,643 has been recorded as financing costs in interest expense at June 30, 2013. On September 30, 2013, the valuation of receivables sold under the Letter was finalized at $1,018,056. Accordingly, final valuation adjustments were made to increase the principal portion of the note outstanding by $29,145 and to decrease financing costs by $6,398. During the current fiscal year ended additional adjustments were made to the outstanding obligation by Waterton which included various Agreement penalties. The outstanding principal balance after these adjustments at June 30, 2015 was $7,755,685 and accrued interest was $4,565,466. See ITEM 7: Liquidity and Capital Resources; Plan of Operation.
