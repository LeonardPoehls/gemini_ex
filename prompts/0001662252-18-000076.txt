ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Business Overview 
 
The Company is developing RP-323 for the treatment of Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL), Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML), and to cause elevation of white blood cells (WBC) in patients depleted of these elements due to various conditions.
The Technology
 
The priority drug development efforts of the Company are focused on the use of RP-323, a naturally occurring compound that has a number of properties that are uniquely suited for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL), and Acute Myelocytic Leukemia (AML). Company scientists had worked with RP-323 in the laboratory for many years studying its ability to convert cancer cells to normal cells, a process called differentiation. It was also observed in some instances to cause cancer cell death. These observations were the basis of the proposal to test RP-323 in relapsed AML patients in China and later in the US and resulted in findings that were sufficiently encouraging to support further interest in this drug to treat AML. During the course of these preliminary clinical studies RP-323 was found to be extremely potent in causing a marked and favorable increase in white blood cells (WBC) in blood, key elements in fighting infections. These results were also observed in cancer patients whose WBC were depleted due to the toxic effects of chemotherapeutic drugs used during the course of their therapy. Later, in a US phase I safety study conducted at Cancer Institute of NJ (CINJ), it was discovered the use of RP-323 in HL when a patient’s tumor was reduced by 2 cm.
Clinical Studies in Acute Myelocytic Leukemia
 
Based on the known properties of RP-323, it was first administered in a pilot study in China, either alone or in combination with standard drugs, and caused temporary remission of AML in some patients’ refractory to standard therapy. Several patients recovered sufficiently with RP-323 treatment to return to their normal occupations, symptom-free. Interest in these findings led to a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored trial in 35 patients by a leading oncologist at a leading cancer hospital in New Jersey, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ). This study determined the maximum tolerated dose of RP-323 and described its relatively mild side effects. The results of this Phase 1 trial led to interest by the same investigator to initiate a Phase 2 study. The use of RP-323 in treatment of refractory AML is expected to qualify for a “fast track” designation at the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the Company expects to apply for “orphan drug” status. An “orphan drug” is a pharmaceutical agent that has been developed specifically to treat a rare medical condition, the condition itself being referred to as an orphan disease. The Company’s clinical plans are to complete the required clinical studies and provide a basis for market approval for the treatment of AML. The Company estimates the budget for reaching market approval for the treatment of AML to be $40 million. However, should the Company be able to obtain “orphan drug” status from the FDA, that timeline could be accelerated and budget reduced to $20 million. All plans are subject to the Company obtaining adequate financing, or partnering with a third party, to fund the cost of the studies. The Company cannot provide any assurances that it will be able to obtain such financing or partnering arrangement.
Clinical Results in Elevation of White Blood Cells
 
Clinical studies in over 100 cancer patients demonstrated the potent ability of RP-323 to stimulate the production of white blood cells (WBC) and neutrophils. Both the treatments for various diseases and the disease themselves can result in extremely low numbers of these elements. Their elevation is essential to prevent post-treatment infections common to these patients. In comparative studies in animals, RP-323 is significantly more potent than marketed drugs used for this purpose. The effect of RP-323 on the elevation of these and other blood elements will be measured during treatment of AML.
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma 
 
Hodgkin’s lymphom is a cancer that is found most frequently in two different age groups: 15 – 35 and over 55, and occurs in both sexes although it is more common in males and individuals with HIV. The overall incidence of Hodgkin’s lymphoma is approximately 2.7 per 100,000 persons. Malignant Reed Sternberg cells invade and destroy the architecture of the lymph nodes and infiltrate major organs such as the liver and spleen. Radiation and chemotherapy are used routinely but these treatments can later result in morbidity and mortality as a result of causing second malignancies. More effective and safer treatments are needed for this disease.

Market Opportunities
 
AML 
 
It is estimated that 40,000 people in the US have AML and an additional 14,000 are diagnosed annually with a yearly death rate of over 10,000. Based on this incidence, the potential market for RP-323 for the treatment of AML is approximately $1 to 2 billion peak sales annually in the US and more than $5 billion worldwide.
White Blood Cell
 
Currently marketed drugs for elevating key infection-fighting blood elements are used in supportive cancer care, inflammation, nephrology and bone disease. In 2012, this market exceeded $3 billion. The clinical use of RP-323 for these purposes is expected to have several key therapeutic advantages over marketed drugs, along with a clean safety profile and observed high efficacy is expected to result in a 15 to 30 percent market share and peak annual sales of $0.5 to $1 billion. Amgen would be the Company’s largest competitor in this market.
HL
 
In the U.S. 185,793 suffer from Hodgkin's lymphoma (2011); the worldwide market potential for Hodgkin's lymphoma is estimated to be $1-2 billion. 
 
Patent 
 
The Company has been assigned United States Patent No. 6,063,814, entitled “Phorbol esters as anti-neoplastic and white blood cell elevating agents,” and utility patent application titled “Compositions and Methods of Use Of Phorbol Esters For The Treatment of Neoplasms (Acute Myeloid Leukemia).” The patent is intended to provide the Company with exclusive rights to the use of intravenous RP-323 for therapeutic purposes. Provided that the Company can obtain additional funding, the Company intends to expand its patents through the addition of indications for use and adding protection in appropriate countries.
Government Regulations
 
The research, pre-clinical development, clinical trials, product manufacturing and marketing which may be conducted by the Company is subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. The proposed products and technologies of the Company also may be subject to certain other federal, state and local government regulations, including, without limitation, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and their state, local and foreign counterparts. Although there can be no such assurance, the Company does not believe that compliance with such laws and regulations has, nor is presently expected to have, a material adverse effect on the business of the Company. However, the Company cannot predict the extent of the adverse effect on its business or the financial and other cost that might result from any government regulations arising out of future legislative, administrative or judicial action.
 
Generally, the steps required before a pharmaceutical or therapeutic biological agent may be marketed in the United States include: (i) pre-clinical laboratory tests, in vivo pre-clinical studies in animals, toxicity studies and formulation studies; (ii) the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, that must become effective before human clinical trials commence; (iii) adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug; (iv) the submission of a marketing application to the FDA; and (v) FDA approval of the marketing application prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the drug.
 
Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the product, conducted under Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations, and animal studies to assess the pharmacological activity and the potential safety and effectiveness of the drug. The results of the pre-clinical studies are submitted to the FDA in the IND. Unless the FDA objects to an IND, it becomes effective 30 days following submission and the clinical trial described in the IND may then begin.
 
Every clinical trial must be conducted under the review and oversight of an institutional review board (IRB) at each institution participating in the trial. The IRB evaluates, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution.

Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap. Phase I represents the initial introduction of the drug to a small group of healthy subjects to test for safety, dosage tolerance, and the essential characteristics of the drug. Phase II involves studies in a limited number of patients to test the safety and efficacy of the drug at different dosages. Phase III trials involve large-scale evaluation of safety and effectiveness, usually (though not necessarily) in comparison with placebo or an existing treatment.
 
The results of the pre-clinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an application to market the drug. The marketing application also includes information pertaining to the chemistry, formulation, manufacture of the drug and each component of the
 final product. The FDA review of a marketing application takes from one to two years on average to complete, though reviews of treatments for cancer and other life-threatening diseases may be accelerated. However, the process may take substantially longer if the FDA has questions or concerns about a product. Following review, the FDA may ultimately decide that an application does not satisfy regulatory and statutory criteria for approval. In some cases, the FDA may approve a product but require additional clinical tests following approval (i.e., Phase IV).
 
In addition to obtaining FDA approval for each product, each domestic drug manufacturing establishment must be registered with, and approved by, the FDA. Domestic manufacturing establishments are subject to inspections by the FDA and must comply with Good Manufacturing Practice ("GMP"). To supply products for use in the United States, foreign manufacturing establishments must comply with GMP and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA or by corresponding regulatory agencies in such countries under reciprocal agreements with the FDA.
 
If marketing approval of any Company product is granted, the Company must continue to comply with FDA requirements not only for manufacturing, but also for labeling, advertising, record keeping, and reporting to the FDA of adverse experiences and other information. In addition, the Company must comply with federal and state health care anti-kickback laws and other health care fraud and abuse laws that affect the marketing of pharmaceuticals. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the Company to administrative or judicial enforcement actions, including but not limited to product seizures, injunctions, civil penalties, criminal prosecution, refusals to approve new products or withdrawal of existing approvals, as well as increased product liability exposure, any of which could have a material adverse effect on tile company's business, financial condition, or results of operations.
 
For clinical investigation and marketing outside the United States, the Company also is subject to foreign regulatory requirements governing human clinical trials and marketing approval for drugs. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary widely for European countries both within and outside the European Community ("EU"). Outside the United States, the Company's ability to market a product is contingent upon receiving a marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authority. At present, foreign marketing authorizations are applied for at a national level, although within the EU certain registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market their products in more than one EU member state. If the regulatory authority is satisfied that adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy has been presented, a marketing authorization will be granted. The system for obtaining marketing authorizations within the EU registration system is a dual one in which certain products, such as biotechnology and high technology products and those containing new active substances, will have access to a central regulatory system that provides registration throughout the entire EU. Other products will be registered by national authorities in individual EU member states, operating on a principle of mutual recognition. This foreign regulatory approval process includes, at least, all of the risks associated with FDA approval set forth above. The Company could possibly have greater difficulty in obtaining any such approvals and also might find it more difficult to protect its intellectual property abroad.
 
Compliance with Environmental Laws
 The Company's business may be subject to regulation under federal, state, local, and foreign laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substance control. The Company believes that its compliance with these laws will have no adverse impact upon its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Federal, state and foreign agencies and legislative bodies have expressed interest in the further environmental regulation of the biotechnology industry. The Company is unable to estimate the extent and impact of such, if any, future federal, state, local legislation or administrative environmental action.
