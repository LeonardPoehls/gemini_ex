Product Diversity; Target Customer Appeal. The Company stocks its stores/shops with a combination of the leading and newest brand name merchandise, including in-line offerings and unique products offered exclusively by the Company. The focus is on the Company’s stores/shops maintaining their status as a leader in premium athletic shoes, apparel, and accessories for men, women, and kids. Product diversity, in combination with the Company’s store/shop formats and commitment to customer service, is intended to attract a core customer (typically age 18-29 for Finish Line and age 30-50 for shops within department stores with a greater focus on females) as well as other key demographics. The Company is focused on offering premium product, which includes the best brands, on-trend styles, and most relevant selection.
Merchandise
The following table sets forth net sales along with the percentage of net sales for the Company attributable to the categories of footwear and softgoods during the fiscal years indicated. These amounts and percentages fluctuate substantially during the different consumer buying seasons. To take advantage of this seasonality, the Company’s stores/shops have been designed to allow for a shift in emphasis in the merchandise mix between footwear and softgoods items throughout the year.

All merchandising decisions for Finish Line and shops within department stores, including merchandise mix, pricing, promotions, and markdowns, are made at the Company’s Customer Central corporate headquarters (“Customer Central”). The merchandising management at Customer Central, along with store/shop sales managers and district sales managers, review the merchandise mix to adapt to trends in the marketplace.
Technology
The Company continues to update its digital sites to enhance their quality and functionality. The Company has committed capital and other resources specifically for its growing digital channel, which includes design and content upgrades, mobile and tablet applications, expanded presence on social media, and platform enhancements. Finishline.com and related mobile sites are collectively the Company’s most visited store/shop with approximately 540,000 visitors per day.
To support the Company’s omnichannel commitment as a customer-centric organization, the Company also continuously evaluates and implements improvements to technological platforms, which affect stores/shops, merchandising, planning, allocation, warehouse management, order management, and customer relationship management. These improvements allow the Company to more effectively engage the customer, remain flexible and scalable to support growth, provide integrated service, and have information for real-time decision making.
In fiscal 2015, Finish Line launched a new mobile app and made enhancements to its mobile web experience - all of which continue to be critical to winning with the customer. In fiscal 2016, the Company replaced its existing warehouse and order management system, which has allowed the Company to deliver its products more quickly to its stores/shops and customers, further enhancing the customer experience in store and online. Additionally, during fiscal 2016, the Company made enhancements to its customer data and analytics systems, which will help improve customer engagement by allowing the Company to develop customized communications based on individual preferences.

Marketing
Finish Line attempts to reach its target audience by using a multifaceted approach to marketing on national, regional, and local levels. Finish Line utilizes its store windows, e-mail, social media, search engine optimization, key word searches, and affiliate programs in its marketing efforts. Shops within department stores collaborate with Macy’s on specific marketing approaches, which are generally similar to the marketing approaches utilized by Finish Line.
The Company benefits from advertising and promotional assistance from many of its suppliers. This assistance takes the form of cooperative advertising programs, in-store sales incentives, point-of-purchase materials, product training for employees, and other programs. The Company’s total net advertising expense was 2.1% and 2.0% of net sales after deducting cooperative reimbursements in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. These percentages fluctuate substantially throughout the year during the different consumer buying seasons. The Company believes that it benefits from the multi-million dollar advertising campaigns of its key suppliers, such as Nike, adidas, and Under Armour.
Finish Line has a customer loyalty program called “Winners Circle.” Customers earn a $20 reward certificate for every $200 they spend at Finish Line within a 12 month period, in addition to receiving special member offers on footwear and softgoods. Finish Line maintains a Winners Circle database with information that it uses to communicate with members regarding key initiatives, product offerings, and promotions. At year-end, the Winners Circle program had 10.5 million active members. Finish Line continues to improve the marketing effectiveness of the Winners Circle program to strengthen Finish Line’s relationship with its most loyal customers in order to drive sales.
Merchandising and Distribution
In addition to merchandise procurement for both footwear and softgoods, the merchandising department for the Company is responsible for determining pricing and working with the planning and allocation department to establish appropriate stock levels and product mix. Additionally, the merchandising department is responsible for communicating with store/shop and digital operations to monitor shifts in customer preferences and market trends.
The planning and allocation department is responsible for merchandise allocation, inventory movements, and the automated replenishment system. The department acts as the central processing intermediary between the merchandising department, the distribution center, and stores/shops and also tracks the effectiveness of each marketing effort to allow the merchandising and marketing departments to determine the relative success of each promotional program. In addition, the department also manages the implementation of price changes, creation of vendor purchase orders, and determination of inventory levels for each store/shop.
The Company believes that its ability to buy in large quantities directly from suppliers enables it to obtain favorable pricing and trade terms. Currently, the Company purchases product from approximately 60 suppliers and manufacturers of athletic and fashion products, the largest of which (Nike) accounted for approximately 71% and 73% of total Company purchases in fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company purchased approximately 93% and 89% of its total merchandise in both fiscal 2017 and 2016, respectively, from its five largest suppliers. The Company and its suppliers use EDI technology to streamline purchasing and distribution operations.
Nearly all of the Company’s merchandise is shipped directly from suppliers to the Company’s distribution center in Indianapolis, Indiana, where the Company processes and ships the merchandise by contract and common carriers to its stores/shops or directly to customers. Each day shipments are made to approximately one-third of the Company’s stores/shops. In any three-week period, each store/shop will receive approximately five shipments. A shipment is normally received by the store/shop one to four days from the date that the order is filled depending on the store/shop’s distance from the distribution center.
Store Operations
The Company’s corporate and regional senior management visit the stores/shops regularly to review and receive feedback from the stores/shops related to the implementation of the Company’s customer service model, plans, and policies, to monitor operations, and to review inventories and the presentation of merchandise. Accounting and general financial functions for the stores/shops are conducted at Customer Central. Each store/shop has a sales manager, co-sales managers, or team lead that is responsible for supervision and overall operations, one or more assistant sales managers, and additional full and part-time sales associates.
Regional, district, and store sales managers receive a fixed salary (except store managers in California) and are eligible for bonuses, based primarily on sales, payroll, inventory shrink, and other performance goals of the stores/shops for which they are responsible. All store sales managers in California, team leads, assistant store sales managers, and sales associates are paid on an hourly basis.

Competition
The athletic shoe, apparel, and accessory business is highly competitive. Many of the products the Company sells are also sold in department stores, national and regional full-line sporting goods stores, athletic footwear specialty stores, athletic footwear superstores, discount stores, traditional shoe stores, mass merchandisers, and e-tailers. Some of the Company’s primary competitors are large national chains that have substantially greater financial and other resources than the Company. Additionally, the Company’s competition also includes stores and/or e-commerce sites that are owned by major suppliers to the Company. To a lesser extent, the Company competes with local sporting goods and athletic specialty stores. The majority of brick and mortar stores and shops within department stores are located in enclosed malls or shopping centers in which one or more competitors also operate. Typically, the leases that the Company enters into do not restrict the opening of stores by competitors.
The Company seeks to differentiate itself from its competition by operating more attractive, well-stocked stores/shops in high retail traffic areas, with competitive prices and knowledgeable and courteous customer service. The Company keeps its prices competitive with athletic specialty and sporting goods stores in each trade area, including competitors that are not necessarily located inside malls. The Company believes it accomplishes this by effectively assorting its stores/shops with the most relevant premium brands and products in the market.
Seasonal Business
The Company’s business follows a seasonal pattern, peaking over a total of approximately 12 weeks during the back-to-school (mid July through early September) and holiday (Thanksgiving through Christmas) seasons. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, these seasons collectively accounted for approximately 32% and 31%, respectively, of the Company’s annual sales.
Employees
As of February 25, 2017, the Company employed a total of approximately 12,700 persons, 3,700 of whom were full-time and 9,000 of whom were part-time. Of this total, approximately 1,100 were employed at Customer Central, the Company’s distribution center, and the Company’s digital team office in Boulder, Colorado, and approximately 60 were employed as regional vice presidents and district sales managers. Additional part-time employees are typically hired during the back-to-school and holiday seasons. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a union, and employee relations are good.
Retirement Plan
The Company sponsors a qualified defined contribution profit sharing plan that has a 401(k) feature. The Company matches 100 percent of employee contributions to the 401(k) plan on the first three percent of an employee’s wages and matches an additional 50 percent of employee contributions to the 401(k) plan on the next two percent up to five percent of their wages (maximum of four percent Company match).
Intellectual Property
The Company has registered, in the United States and other countries, trademarks, service marks, and domain names relating to its business. The Company believes its registrations are valid. It intends to be vigilant with regard to infringing or diluting uses by other parties, and to enforce vigorously its rights in its trademarks, service marks, and domain names.
