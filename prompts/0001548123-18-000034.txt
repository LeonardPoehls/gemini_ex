Item 1. Business.
OVERVIEW

Founded in 2012, Future Healthcare of America (FHA, the Company, we, or us and words of similar import), a Wyoming corporation, provides services in the Healthcare Industry through its wholly-owned subsidiary Future Healthcare Services Corp., a Wyoming corporation (FHS), and Interim Healthcare of Wyoming, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (Interim) that is a wholly-owned operating subsidiary of FHS. FHAs consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of FHS and Interim. FHAs core focus is on our Healthcare business, which consists of home health services and staffing in the Western part of the United States. 
 
Our corporate offices consist of approximately 3,000 square feet of office space located at 5001 Baum Blvd, Suite 770, Pittsburgh, PA 15213. Our telephone number is (412) 621-0902. We also maintain offices in Casper, Wyoming, and Billings, Montana.

BUSINESS

Based in Casper, Wyoming, and Billings, Montana, FHSs wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Interim, is an independent franchisee of Interim HealthCare that has been serving its community for over 20 years and is part of the home health segment of the healthcare industry, providing a wide range of visiting nurse services to the elderly, wounded and sick. It is one of the 300 independent home health agencies that comprise the Interim HealthCare network. Our business consists of providing healthcare services for those in need. We record all revenue and expenses and provide all services under one umbrella. Below is a description of our Home Healthcare and Staffing operations.

Interim Healthcare of Wyoming, Inc., is a corporation started in September 1991. In March of 2007, Interim acquired the assets of Professional Nursing Personal Pool, which is now our Billings, Montana location.

Home Healthcare

Through trained health care professionals, the Company provides home care services including senior care and pediatric nursing; physical, occupational and speech therapy. The Company offices deliver quality home care and treat each patient with genuine compassion, kindness and respect. The Company provides health care professionals at all skill levels, including registered nurses, therapists, LPN's and certified home health aides. FHA derives its revenue from multiple payer sources. These include Medicare, Medicaid, Insurance, Medicaid LTW, and Private Payers. Because our offices are located in areas that do not contain a large population base (less than 200,000 residents), we continually explore opportunities to increase our revenue with our current payer sources and expand through new sources of revenue. The healthcare team is utilized across all payer sources, including staffing services. Our customer base comes from referrals from hospitals, rehab facilities, nursing homes, assisted living facilities and previous patients.

In additional to our professional team, we employ a management team at each facility to handle the day to day operations of the office. This is completed by our Administrators in each location. We also have a Director of Nursing in each location. This person is responsible for the day to day oversight of the service providers and ensuring the certified professionals obtain the necessary training to maintain their certificates as well as the training necessary to be in compliance with all regulating organizations. 

Staffing

Interim offices provide nurses, nurse aides and management services to hospitals, prisons, schools, corporations and other health care facilities. Interims success is based on our ability to recruit the best health care professionals and the responsiveness of our local managers to fill the needs of our clients in a timely manner. Additionally, we work with our clients should they decide they would like to hire our service professional on a full time basis. Another key to our success is the personal relationship that our management and sales team build with each of our existing and new clients. As noted previously, in order to reduce turnover of our service team by providing as many hours as possible, similar to the hours of a full-time employee, we utilize the same service team members across all payer sources.

As each of our businesses is located in smaller based population areas of the country, the competition is significantly heightened and the relationships maintained with our clients become very critical to the continued success of our operations.

As we provide diversified services and accept payments from multiple payer sources, we are not heavily dependent on a few clients in order for our business to be successful.

Governmental Regulations

Third-Party Coverage and Reimbursement 

We are dependent on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, such as governmental programs including Medicare and Medicaid, and private insurance plans. Reimbursement is contingent on established coding for a given procedure, coverage of the codes by the third-party payers and adequate payment for the resources used. 

Coding for procedures is established by the American Medical Association. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency responsible for administering Medicare and the National Center for Health Statistics, are jointly responsible for overseeing changes and modifications to billing codes used by home healthcare agencies for reporting procedures, and many private payers use coverage decisions and payment amounts determined by CMS for Medicare as guidelines in setting their coverage and reimbursement policies. All coding is subject to change which could impact coverage and reimbursement. Each year however, CMS re-examines the reimbursement rates for our services and could either increase or decrease the reimbursement rates. We are unable to predict when legislation or regulation that affects our business may be proposed or enacted in the future or what effect any such legislation or regulation would have on our business.

For some governmental programs, such as Medicaid, coverage and reimbursement differ from state to state, and some state Medicaid programs may not pay an adequate amount for the procedures performed, if any payment is made at all. As the portion of the U.S. population over the age of 65 and eligible for Medicaid continues to grow, we may be more vulnerable to coverage and reimbursement limitations imposed by CMS. National and regional coverage policy decisions are subject to unforeseeable change. 

Third-party payers carefully review, and increasingly challenge, the prices charged for procedures. In addition, an increasing percentage of insured individuals are receiving their medical care through managed care programs, which monitor and often require pre-approval or pre-authorization of the services that a member will receive. The percentage of individuals covered by managed care programs is expected to grow in the United States over the next decade. 

We believe that the overall escalating cost of medical products and services has led to, and will continue to lead to, increased pressures on the healthcare industry to reduce the costs of products and services. There can be no assurance that third-party coverage and reimbursement will be available or adequate, or that future legislation, regulation, or coverage and reimbursement policies of third-party payers will not adversely affect the demand for our services or our ability to provide these services on a profitable basis. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party payer coverage or reimbursement could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.

Healthcare Fraud and Abuse 

Healthcare fraud and abuse laws apply to our business when a customer submits a claim for an item or service that is reimbursed under Medicare, Medicaid or most other federally-funded healthcare programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Law prohibits unlawful inducements for the referral of business reimbursable under federally-funded healthcare programs, such as remuneration provided to induce clients to use our services reimbursable by Medicare or Medicaid. The Anti-Kickback Law is subject to evolving interpretations. 

The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions that may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers. Further, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, collectively, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. 

If a governmental authority were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws and regulations, we and our officers and employees could be subject to severe criminal and civil penalties including, for example, exclusion from participation as a supplier of services to beneficiaries covered by Medicare or Medicaid.

Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigations of healthcare providers and suppliers throughout the country for a wide variety of Medicare billing practices.

We filed a Form 8-A with the SEC in March 2013. This filing obligates us to comply with the proxy rules of the SEC, including the requirement that we provide an annual report containing audited financial statements to our stockholders in connection with annual stockholder meetings at which directors are elected. We do not intend to voluntarily send annual reports containing audited financial statement to our stockholders.

The public may read and copy any materials filed with the SEC at the its Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549, on official business days during the hours of 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the Commission at 1800SEC0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the Commission at http://www.sec.gov.

Employees

FHA and FHS do not conduct any material operations of their own. Our operations are conducted through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Interim. We currently have a total of 150 employees, of which 45 are full-time employees. There are no employees that are represented by employee union(s).  Interim believes its relations with all of its employees are good.
