ITEM 1. Business
 
Forward-Looking Statements
 
This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. For a discussion of forward-looking statements, see the section captioned “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 
Overview
 
STR Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) commenced operations in 1944 as a plastics and industrial materials research and development company. Based upon our expertise in polymer science, we evolved into a global provider of encapsulants to the solar industry. Encapsulant is a critical component used to protect and hold solar modules together.
Strategic Developments
 
Wind-down of China Manufacturing Operations. Our business unit in China (“STR China”) incurred a loss of approximately $5.8 million during 2016, including a bad debt expense of $1.5 million. In October 2016, a fire destroyed one of our two China-based production lines and caused substantial damage to our building and some of our ancillary equipment. In light of continued poor financial results of STR China, as well as the effects of the fire, we conducted an orderly wind down of our China manufacturing operations to reduce operating losses related to this business unit. By the close of 2017, we effectively completed the wind down process, with only a small administrative team remaining in an office under short-term lease.
India Tolling Plan. A review of our production in China revealed that roughly half of our sales volume was being exported to our customers in India. Moreover, our customers in India have generally been more reliable in terms of payment and pricing than our customers in China. In conjunction with our wind down of manufacturing operations in China, we have entered into an agreement with a tolling partner in that country. We sold our undamaged production line from STR China to this tolling partner and it is now in commercial operation making STR-formulated encapsulant products. By using a tolling partner, our goal is to continue to serve and grow our customer base in India without having to make a significant direct capital investment. We have not worked with our tolling partner in India prior to 2017 and we cannot ensure that the tolling partner will provide us with the support we anticipate or that we can otherwise successfully manage our collaboration with our tolling partner. If problems develop in our relationship with our India tolling partner, or if such party fails to perform as expected, it could lead to product defects, manufacturing and shipping delays, significant cost increases, changes in our strategies, and even failure of our initiatives, each of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We cannot assure you that the India tolling plan will continue to be successful or that it is sustainable in the long term. We are in discussions to sell an additional production line we own to our tolling partner to enable the tolling partner to further increase its capacity.
 
We continue to reorganize our encapsulant business to better align with customer geography, to reduce the cash burn related to unprofitable locations, to convert assets to cash for potential redeployment into more profitable endeavors and possible business opportunities in potentially more profitable parts of the solar supply-chain, and to evaluate other strategic alternatives.
 
High-End Food Packaging. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a significant investment through our wholly-owned subsidiary in Spain to enter the high-end food packaging business. This investment, which leverages our plastics expertise, includes the purchase of new, state-of-the-art plastics processing equipment and related building improvements, along with the addition of experienced staff to pursue manufacturing and sales of high-end food packaging products. As anticipated, we have received, and applied, certain conditional insurance proceeds to this project, helping to offset our net capital investment. These insurance proceeds are available to us only if we invest in new plastics manufacturing equipment. We have been advised by our insurer that our investment qualifies for reimbursement under the terms of our policy and, accordingly, they paid our U.S. entity the amount of $0.8 million in October 2017 to cover the cost of the deposit for the primary capital equipment. We expect them to reimburse our U.S. entity for an additional approximately $1.8 million during 2018 as we continue to make qualifying capital investment under the packaging project. We have also applied for loans of up to €2.0 million (approximately $2.4 million as of December 31, 2017) from the regional government of Asturias, Spain to further support the project. Subject to the timely purchase and installation of equipment, we expect to begin production by 2019. The food packaging business is highly competitive having market participants with substantially more resources and experience than us. We will be a new entry into this market and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in this new endeavor. In particular, we cannot assure that we will be able to successfully complete our investment in this new business on a timely basis or within budget, if at all, or that we will be able to achieve our anticipated revenue or earnings from this new investment. Nor can we assure that we will be able to timely collect the full amount of the insurance proceeds that we anticipate to support this project, or that we will be able to obtain the loan(s) we have applied for from the regional government on favorable terms if at all.

Alternative Transactions. In the event that we are not successful in restructuring our encapsulant business, entering into the high-end food packaging business, or in completing other strategic transactions, we also intend to consider alternatives, including without limitation, the acquisition of another business, the divestiture of all or certain of our assets, joint ventures and other transactions outside the ordinary course of business.
 
If we are unsuccessful in executing on our strategic plans to ultimately achieve profitability by reorganizing our encapsulant business and entering the high-end packaging business, we may also decide to wind down or cease any or all of our operations.
 
In addition, any wind-down or dissolution may be a lengthy and complex process, yield unexpected results and delay any potential distributions to our stockholders. Such process may also require the further expenditure of our resources, such as legal, accounting and other professional fees and expenses and other related charges, which would decrease the amount of assets available for distributions to our stockholders.
 
Manufacturing Facility Fire.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, we recorded a $0.9 million loss on disposal of fixed assets attributable to our Chinese manufacturing facility fire. During 2017, STR China received interim payments totaling RMB12.7 million (approximately $1.9 million as of December 31, 2017) from our local China insurance carrier related to the existing fire insurance claim. During 2017, we also received $0.8 million in the U.S. under the master property insurance plan related to the same claim. These payments do not represent a final settlement, and we continue to work with our agents and the carrier to finalize the claim.
2014 Transaction with Zhenfa
 
In 2014, we entered into certain definitive agreements with Zhenfa Energy Group Co., Ltd., a Chinese limited liability company (“Zhenfa”), and its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, Zhen Fa New Energy (U.S.) Co., Ltd., a Nevada corporation (“Zhenfa U.S.”). Certain provisions of these agreements ended upon our 2016 Annual Meeting of the Shareholders, which was held on December 5, 2017.
Purchase Agreement 
 
On August 11, 2014, we entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with Zhenfa U.S., pursuant to which Zhenfa U.S. acquired approximately 51% of our then outstanding shares of common stock on December 15, 2014 (the “Closing Date”).
 
Sales Service Agreement 
 
In connection with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, Specialized Technology Resources, Inc., our wholly owned subsidiary, entered into a sales service agreement (the "Sales Service Agreement") with Zhenfa, whereby Zhenfa agreed, among other things, to assist us in a number of endeavors, including, without limitation, marketing and selling our products in China, acquiring local raw materials, hiring and training personnel in China, and complying with Chinese law. The Sales Service Agreement became effective on the date of Closing, for an initial term of two years, and automatically renews for one year periods unless terminated earlier. The Sales Service Agreement may also be terminated by either party at such time as Zhenfa and its affiliates own less than 10% of our outstanding common stock.
 
As we have substantially discontinued operations in China, Zhenfa is not currently providing us with any material services under this agreement. However, we continue to interact with Zhenfa to assess whether there may be projects of interest to us to pursue in China. Our activities with Zhenfa under the Sales Service Agreement are subject to the oversight of our Special Committee of Continuing Directors.
 
Solar Energy Systems
 
Solar electricity is primarily generated by PV systems comprised of solar modules, mounting structures and electrical components. PV systems are either grid-connected or off-grid. Grid-connected systems are tied to the transmission and distribution grid and feed electricity into the end-user’s electrical system and/or the grid. Such systems are commonly mounted on the rooftops of buildings, integrated into building facades or installed on the ground using support structures, and range in size from a small number of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts. Off-grid PV systems are typically much smaller and are frequently used in remote areas where they may be the only source of electricity for the end-user.

Solar Modules
 
PV cells are semiconductor devices that convert sunlight directly to electricity by a process known as the photovoltaic effect. A solar module is an assembly of PV cells that are electrically interconnected, laminated and framed in a durable and weatherproof package.
 
There are two primary commercialized categories of solar cells: crystalline silicon and thin-film. PV devices can be manufactured using different semiconductor materials, including mono-and poly-crystalline silicon for silicon cells, and amorphous silicon, gallium arsenide, copper indium gallium selenide and cadmium telluride, among others, for thin-film cells. Crystalline silicon cells typically operate at higher conversion efficiency, though this is no longer always the case. Historically, crystalline silicon cells have been higher in cost due to a more complex production process and the need for more expensive raw materials. In recent years, the price of polysilicon has declined rapidly, eroding the cost advantage of thin-film cells, while the gap in conversion efficiency narrows due to more rapid improvements in the thin-film sector.
 
Encapsulants
 
Regardless of the technology used to create solar energy from a PV system, the core component of the solar cell is the semiconductor circuit. To protect and preserve that circuit, solar module manufacturers typically use an encapsulant. Encapsulants are critical to the function of solar modules, as they protect cells from the elements, bond the multiple layers of a module together and provide electrical isolation. Encapsulants must incorporate high optical transparency, stability at high temperatures and high levels of ultraviolet radiation, good adhesion to different module materials, adequate mechanical compliance to accommodate stresses induced by differences in thermal expansion and contraction between glass and cells, good dielectric properties (electrical isolation) and resistance to potential induced degradation. Even slight deterioration of any of these properties over time could significantly impair the electrical output of the solar module, which is of critical importance in the solar industry, where solar module manufacturers typically provide 20 to 25-year warranties for their products.
 
Over the years, various encapsulant materials have been used in solar modules, including EVA, polyvinyl butyral (“PVB”), polyolefin elastomer (“POE”) and poly dimethyl siloxane or silicone. We currently use EVA to make most of our encapsulant products, but also offer and manufacture a range of POE encapsulants. Our encapsulants are modified with additives to increase stability for long-term outdoor applications, such as solar modules. We have also begun selling EVA interlayer to the laminated glass market to further expand our product offering and end-markets.
 
During solar module assembly, encapsulation is typically accomplished by vacuum lamination, wherein a “pre-lam” stack (as depicted in the following diagram) is fashioned into a singular part comprising multiple layers. Thin sheets of EVA are positioned on either side of the PV cells, top and bottom. Heating the “sandwich” then causes the EVA to melt and then to cure, or crosslink, bonding the module into one piece. This step occurs towards the end of the manufacturing process and is critical to the entire solar module, as there is only one opportunity to laminate correctly.

Excessive shrinkage or inadequate adhesion (associated with improperly formulated encapsulants) can occur during lamination and may result in voids or holes in the encapsulant, which are considered defects and cause for rejection of the entire panel. Upon direct exposure to the elements, encapsulants are susceptible to several performance failures, which may jeopardize the integrity and performance of the entire solar module and lead to significant warranty costs for solar module manufacturers. The most significant failures include:
 

• | Loss of clarity - the propensity of an encapsulant to “brown” after long-term exposure to ultraviolet (“UV”) light, leading to a permanent loss of transparency. If an encapsulant positioned above the cells loses its transparency, the power output of the module will be reduced.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Module delamination - the loss of adhesion between the encapsulant and other module layers. Delamination in the field could occur in cases where the encapsulant was improperly cured or where incompatibilities between the encapsulant and other module components exist. Most delamination observed in the field has occurred at the interface between the encapsulant and the front surface of the solar cells. Delamination is more frequent and more severe in hot and humid climates, sometimes occurring after less than five years of exposure. Delamination first causes a performance loss due to optical de-coupling of the encapsulant from the cells. Of greater concern from a module lifetime perspective is the likelihood that the void resulting from the delamination will provide a preferential location for moisture accumulation, greatly increasing the possibility of corrosion failures in metallic contacts and resulting in module failure.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential Induced Degradation (“PID”) - the loss of electrical output caused by sodium ion migration from the cover glass, through the encapsulant to the cell, is a factor that could adversely impact the energy yield of crystalline silicon solar modules. PID can occur in some solar module installations where a transformerless inverter is used in combination with a high negative voltage bias applied to the solar cells. The magnitude of the power loss depends upon many factors, including the applied voltage bias and the type of surface coatings on the solar cells. Specific encapsulant chemistry, such as in our recent product introductions, has been demonstrated to help inhibit power loss due to PID.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Despite the critical nature of encapsulant to solar cell applications, the encapsulant represents a small percentage of the total manufacturing cost of the solar module.
 
We typically sell our encapsulants in square meters. However, because the solar industry’s standard measurement for production volume and capacity is watts, megawatts (“MW”), or gigawatts (“GW”), we convert our capacity and production volume from square meters to approximate MW depending on the applicable conversion efficiencies specific to our customers. The conversion rate is approximately 12,500 square meters of encapsulant per MW. This rate is based on our calculations using publicly available information, our industry experience and assumptions that our management believes to be appropriate and reasonable. Certain production capacity and market metrics included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are based on these calculations. Our calculations may not be accurate, and we may change the methodology of our calculations in the future as new information becomes available. In that case, period-to-period comparisons of such metrics may not be perfectly comparable.
 
Financial Information About Our Segment and Geographic Areas
 
Financial information about our segment and geographical areas of operation is included in Item 7,-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Note 18-Reportable Segment and Geographical Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Products
 
Drawing upon our considerable experience, we develop our solar encapsulant formulations internally and work in conjunction with our customers to meet their varying requirements. Our formulations offer a range of properties and processing attributes, including various curing times and temperatures that align with the requirements of our customers’ individual lamination processes and module constructions. Our formulations can be used in both crystalline silicon and thin-film modules.
Our Markets and Customers
 
Our customers are primarily solar module manufacturers located primarily in Asia, Europe and North America. We typically sell our encapsulants on a purchase order basis that specifies price and delivery parameters, but can be cancelled or postponed prior to production. We also provide technical support and assist our customers when they are qualifying solar modules that utilize our products, which can take from two months to more than two years. Historically, our sales strategy has focused on developing long-term relationships with solar module manufacturers and working collaboratively during their product development efforts.

Over the past several years, many of our Western customers continued to lose market share to lower-cost Chinese module manufacturers, with many being forced into bankruptcy or exiting the solar business as module production migrated rapidly to Asia, primarily China. We established our own manufacturing plant in China and also engaged tolling manufacturers to augment our capacity there, but in light of the obstacles detailed herein relating to the Chinese market, we conducted an orderly wind down of our China-based manufacturing operations, which was effectively completed as of the end of 2017. Given that our China factory has been manufacturing encapsulants for sale outside of China, increasingly India, we have decided to serve the market in India with production through a tolling partner in that country.
 
Global Wedge, Inc. and Heckert Solar, each accounted for at least 10% of our net sales, and in the aggregate accounted for approximately 33% of our net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Our top five customers accounted for approximately 49% and 51% of our net sales in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 
Our Operations
 
Facilities and Equipment
 
We currently operate a production facility in Llanera, Asturias, Spain. This production facility is augmented by our research, development and testing laboratory in Enfield, Connecticut, which is co-located with our corporate headquarters and our pilot production facility.
 
We currently have total annual production capacity of approximately 2.6 GW at our Spain location, approximately 0.3 GW in Connecticut and approximately 0.5 GW in India with our tolling partner.
 
Our production lines incorporate our proprietary technology and processes. We rely on third-party equipment manufacturers to produce our manufacturing lines to our specifications, which we then further customize in-house. Most of our production lines are functionally equivalent, having the ability to manufacture all of our formulations and providing us with flexibility in meeting shifting trends in global demand.
 
We also own a dormant production facility in Johor, Malaysia, for which we had an executed Purchase and Sale Agreement effective November 18, 2016. The completion of the sale was subject to the approval of the Johor Port Authority (the “JPA”). On July 31, 2017, we received a notice from Tiong Nam Logistics Solutions SDN BHD (“Tiong Nam”) purporting to terminate the agreement, alleging that the JPA was seeking to impose certain conditions on the approval of the transfer of the facility to Tiong Nam that it found unacceptable. We were not successful in removing those conditions, and our agreement with Tiong Nam terminated. We have since re-launched the sale process for our Malaysia facility.
 
Encapsulant Production Process
 
Our production process typically begins by mixing EVA or POE pellets with several additives to give the encapsulant its desired properties. The mixture is then melted, homogenized, pressurized and forced through a die to create a “polymer curtain,” forming a continuous encapsulant sheet. The sheet then progresses downstream in a proprietary process and is ultimately wound into rolls, slit to the desired width, and packaged for shipment to customers.
 
Our manufacturing quality program is ISO 9001 certified. We have a high level of automation at each of our owned facilities that includes real-time computerized monitoring of the manufacturing process. Such automation provides consistency across our facilities so we can satisfy customer orders at all of our manufacturing locations. In addition, our enterprise resource planning system allows us to efficiently plan our production by location with global, real-time visibility.
 
We test our products in real-time and at a high frequency after production. The Quality Department at all of our owned manufacturing facilities and our tolling partner follow our global quality assurance program and has a mandate to disposition products that do not meet required standards.
 
Raw Materials
 
Resin is the primary raw material used in our process, accounting for more than half of our manufacturing costs. A number of additives as well as packaging materials represent the remainder of our raw material costs.

-



We have multiple vendors for resin. Our objective has been to carry at least a five-week supply of resin to provide protection against supply interruptions resulting from inclement weather, natural disasters and strikes. The stock is distributed among our production facilities and warehouses so that a disruptive event at one location would not affect our ability to continue production. We have qualified resin suppliers local to each of our manufacturing facilities and continue to pursue qualification of additional resin suppliers.
 
Seasonal Trends
 
Our business could be adversely affected by seasonal trends, holiday seasons and weather patterns. See Item 1A,-Risk Factors for more information.
 
Our Competition
 
We face intense competition in the solar encapsulant market and have experienced a significant decline in our global market share from approximately 30% in 2010 to 1% in 2017. We compete with a number of encapsulant manufacturers, including Bridgestone Corporation, Hangzhou First PV Material Co., Ltd., Mitsui Chemicals Group, Inc. and SK Chemical Ltd. We have also had to compete in the past with upstream plastic resin manufacturers moving into downstream markets. These resin manufacturers have included Dow Chemical Corporation, Dow Corning Corporation and E.I. DuPont De Nemours and Company (“DuPont”). We have also had to compete with other very large conglomerates such as 3M Company. Over the years, various alternative encapsulant materials have been used in solar modules, including POE, PVB and silicone. Many of our competitors are large, global companies with substantially more financial, manufacturing and logistical resources. Also, low-cost solar module manufacturers have emerged in Asia, primarily in China, who compete with our legacy customers in Western markets. As the China solar market matures, additional encapsulant providers from China and the greater Asian markets may compete with us. We compete on the basis of various factors, including:

• | price;
--+-------


• | product performance, including quality and technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | product innovations;
--+---------------------


• | customer service and technical support; and
--+--------------------------------------------


• | delivery timing and logistics.
--+-------------------------------

 
We expect competition in the encapsulant space to continue to be intense.
 
Qualification and Certification
 
Design certification programs for solar modules measure performance under simulated or advanced environmental conditions. In certifying their solar modules, our customers must qualify the encapsulant utilized within their product. The certification and qualification tests related to solar modules are defined in the following standards: IEC 61215 (crystalline silicon), IEC 61646 (thin-film) and UL 1703.
 
A successful qualification test program typically means that the tested models/types of solar modules have been subjected to and have passed the minimum requirements of the relevant standards. In addition, many PV module manufacturers often use internal validation tests that are beyond the scope and requirements of IEC and UL. These tests require suppliers to spend more time and investment to become approved suppliers for the module manufacturer’s bill of materials. Qualification or certification does not guarantee any performance, but is designed to provide reasonable assurance that the solar modules of the tested model or type will perform reliably under field conditions.
 
Under guidelines developed by the IEC/TC82/WG2 committee in 2000, modifications to the encapsulation system for solar modules can require retesting of the solar module. Such guidelines call for various retesting if there is any change in the chemistry of the encapsulant used in the solar module.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 90 people on a full or part-time basis. We maintain a non-unionized workforce, with the exception of some employees in our manufacturing facility in Spain, where unions are statutory. We have not experienced any significant work stoppages during the past five years.

Executive Officers
 
The following table sets forth the names and ages, as of March 1, 2017, of our executive officers. The descriptions below include each such person’s service as a board member or an executive officer of STR Holdings, Inc. and our predecessor.

Name | Age | | Position
--------------------+-----+----+---------
Robert S. Yorgensen | | 54 | | Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer 
Thomas D. Vitro | | 57 | | Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Accounting Officer

Robert S. Yorgensen. Mr. Yorgensen has been our Chairman since December 2014 and our President and Chief Executive Officer and a director of our board since January 2012. Prior to becoming our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Yorgensen was Vice President of STR Holdings, Inc., and President of our Solar Division since 2007, and has been employed with us for over 32 years. Mr. Yorgensen has held a variety of positions with us, including Extruded Products Manager and Senior Technical Specialist of Materials RD&E and Specialty Manufacturing, Technical Specialist of Materials RD&E and Specialty Manufacturing and Project Leader of Development Engineering and Specialty Manufacturing. He holds a Bachelor of Technology, Mechanical Engineering degree from the University of Connecticut and an A.S. from Hartford State Technical College.
Thomas D. Vitro. Mr. Vitro has been our Vice President and Chief Financial Officer since December 2015 and is responsible for all finance and accounting functions of the Company. Previously, Mr. Vitro served in various positions with us between 1982 and 2013, most recently as Vice President, Finance from 2009 to 2013. Prior to that, he was the Corporate Controller from 1988 to 2009. Mr. Vitro has a Bachelor of Science in Accountancy from Bentley University and is a Certified Management Accountant.
 
Each executive officer holds office for a term of one year and until his successor is duly elected and qualified, in accordance with our bylaws.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property consists of multiple encapsulant formulations, as well as several processes and sub-processes, and our trademarks “STR®”, “PhotoCap®” and “STR Protected®.” As appropriate, we require employees, suppliers and customers to execute confidentiality agreements.
 
We own a number of trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights that relate to our products. We typically rely on trade secrets rather than patents to protect our proprietary manufacturing processes, proprietary encapsulant formulations, methods, documentation and other technology, as well as certain other business information. Patent protection requires a costly and uncertain federal registration process that would place our confidential information in the public domain. While we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property rights, such confidentiality provisions related to our trade secrets could be breached and may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets. Also, others may independently develop technologies or products that are similar or identical to ours. In such case, our trade secrets would not prevent third parties from competing with us. See Item 1A.-Risk Factors and Item 3,-Legal Proceedings.
 
We have granted a third party manufacturer of PV modules the right to use the formula for one of our encapsulant products and certain of our production techniques to make or have another party make the encapsulant for us in PV modules manufactured by the third party manufacturer. The license is exclusive with respect to specified types of PV modules, and nonexclusive as to all other types of PV modules. The third party manufacturer may also sublicense its rights under the technology license agreement to licensees of its PV module manufacturing processes.
 
Environmental Regulation
 
We are subject to a variety of environmental, health and safety and pollution-control laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations is not material and we do not believe the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations will be material. We use, generate and discharge hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes at some of our facilities in connection with our product development and manufacturing activities. Any failure by us to restrict adequately the discharge of such substances, chemicals or wastes could subject us to potentially significant liabilities, clean-up costs, monetary damages, fines or suspensions in our business operations. In addition, some of our facilities are located on properties with a history of use involving hazardous substances, chemicals and wastes and may be contaminated. For example, our 10 Water Street, Enfield, Connecticut location was found to contain a presence of volatile organic compounds, and we have removed contaminated soil to remediate these conditions. The estimated remaining cost we expect to pay to monitor the property is approximately $0.1 million. If we elect to sell, transfer or change the use of the facility, additional environmental testing would be required. We cannot assure that we will not discover further environmental contamination or that we would not be required to incur significant expenditures for environmental remediation in the future.
