ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
We are an emerging growth company as defined in Section 2(a)(19) of the Securities Act. We will continue to be an emerging growth company until: (i) the last day of our fiscal year during which we had total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 or more; (ii) the last day of our fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous 3-year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Section 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.
 
As an emerging growth company, we are exempt from:
 
Section 14A (a) and (b) of the Exchange Act, which requires companies to hold stockholder advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute compensation;
 
The requirement to provide in any registration statement periodic report or other report to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, certain modified executive compensation disclosure under Item 402 of Regulation S-K or selected financial data under Item 301 of Regulation S-K for any period before the earliest audited period presented in our initial registration statement;
 
Compliance with new or revised accounting standards until those standards are applicable to private companies;
 
The requirement under Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to provide auditor attestation of our internal controls and procedures; and
 
Any Public Company Accounting Oversight Board ("PCAOB") rules regarding mandatory audit firm rotation, or an expanded auditor report and any other PCAOB rules subsequently adopted, unless the Securities and Exchange Commission determines the new rules are necessary for protecting the public.
 
We have elected to use the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards under Section 102(b)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.
 
Vitalibis, Inc. (the “Company”) was formed on April 11, 2014 as a Nevada corporation, under the name of Crowd 4 Seeds, Inc. On January 9, 2017, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to change its name to "Sheng Ying Entertainment Corp." On December 16, 2017, new management took over control of the Company and, on February 5, 2018, the Company filed a certificate of amendment to its Certificate of Incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada in order to change its name to “Vitalibis, Inc”.
 
As of December 31, 2017, and through current date, most of our resources and work have been devoted to adopting and integrating our new business plan, research and development, seeking capital to finance our operations and complying with our obligations under applicable securities laws, rules and regulations.
 
We are a public company and, as such, we have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses for legal, accounting and related services. As a public entity, subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act of 1934, we incur ongoing expenses associated with professional fees for accounting, legal and a host of other expenses including annual reports and proxy statements, if required. We estimate that these costs will range up to $80,000 per year over the next few years and may be significantly higher if our business volume and transactional activity increases but should be lower for this year in 2017 because our overall business volume (and financial transactions) will be lower, and we will not yet be subject to the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 until we exceed $75 million in market capitalization (if ever). These obligations will certainly reduce our ability and resources to expand our business plan and activities. We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to increase our ability to use noncash means of settling outstanding obligations (i.e. issuance of restricted shares of our common stock) and compensate independent contractors who provide professional services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of these efforts. We will also reduce compensation levels paid to management (if we attract or retain outside personnel to perform this function) if there is insufficient cash generated from operations to satisfy these costs.

We hope to be able to use our status as a public company to enable us to use non-cash means of settling obligations and compensate persons and/or firms providing services to us, although there can be no assurances that we will be successful in any of those efforts. However, these actions, if successful, will result in dilution of the ownership interests of existing shareholders, may further dilute common stock book value, and that dilution may be material. Such issuances may also serve to enhance existing management’s ability to maintain control of the Company because the shares may be issued to parties or entities committed to supporting existing management. The Company may offer shares of its common stock to settle a portion of the professional fees incurred in connection with its registration statement. No negotiations have taken place with any professional and no assurances can be made as to the likelihood that any professional will accept shares in settlement of obligations due to them.
 
Other than as set out herein, we have not been involved in any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings, nor have we been a party to any material reclassification, merger, consolidation or purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of our business.
 
We do not have any subsidiaries.
 
Going Concern
 
Our auditor has issued a “going concern” qualification as part of its opinion in the Audit Report for the year ending December 31, 2017 disclosing that our ability to continue as a going concern is contingent on us being able to raise working capital to grow our operations and generate revenue. There can be no assurance we will be able to do so.
Previous Business
 
The Company initially, under the management of Itzhak Ostashinsky, planned to operate in the field of crowd funding and to run an online platform for investments in Israeli startup companies. Those plans never materialized, and there were no operations by the Company during the tenure of Mr. Ostashinsky.
 
On December 30, 2016, in a change-of-control transaction (“2106 Change of Control”), Tycoon Luck Global Limited acquired 65.72% of the equity interest of the Company from Itzhak Ostashinsky, the major shareholder and sole officer of the Company at the time, for $220,152 in cash, and both parties agreed all the net liabilities of the Company as of the acquisition date would be assumed by Itzhak Ostashinsky. On the same day, the new management team was appointed. The new management then decided to transition the Company’s business plan to provide sub-junket services to main junkets based in Cambodia.
 
In furtherance of that new plan, the Company was intending to acquire Sheng Ying Investments Limited, a BVI company incorporated on January 5, 2017, and wholly-owned by Kok Chee LEE, the then-CEO of the Company; however, that plan never materialized and was abandoned due to the change in control and management in October 2017. There were no operations by the Company during the tenure of Kok Chee LEE.
 
On October 24, 2017, in furtherance of a change-of-control transaction (“2017 Change of Control”), Kok Chee LEE resigned from his positions as CEO and director of the Company, and the Board of Directors of the Company appointed Thomas Raack as a director of the Company. On October 25, 2017, Siew Heok Ong resigned from his positions as director and CFO of the Company, and Sreyneang Jin resigned from her positions as director and COO of the Company. On October 26, 2017, Thomas Raack, the sole remaining director of the Company, appointed himself as the CEO, president and treasurer of the Company, and also terminated David E. Price as secretary and appointed himself as secretary of the Company.
 
Current Business
 
Commencing in December 2017, the Company changed its business to focus on the development of technologies and products related to CBD-based personal care products.
 
The CBD Market
 
Our proposed business plan has nothing whatsoever to do with THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, and instead, is focused exclusively on non-medicinal cannabidiol ("CBD"), a component of hemp.

CBD can be produced from hemp, which, for all practical purposes, is devoid of THC, and can be grown far more efficiently than marijuana. Hemp is also a legal crop in many U.S. states.
 
Scientific research is now bringing to light the many health benefits of CBD. CBD is non-toxic and appears to exhibit few side effects, and none life-threatening.
 
Asset Purchase Agreement
 
On December 16, 2017, Sheng Ying Entertainment, Inc. (the “Registrant”), as Buyer, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Steven Raack, an individual; Thomas A. Raack, an individual; and Larry McNabb, an individual, as Sellers, whereby the Registrant acquired certain intangible assets from Sellers relating to non-medicinal cannabidiol ("CBD")-based personal care technologies that include: (a) certain proprietary technology and intellectual property; (b) certain proprietary ideas, know-how, proposed business plans and concepts; and (c) a proposed marketing plan combined with related experiential marketing strategies (the “Technology”), together, the “Assets”. The Assets consist of plans and intellectual property, only, and do not include fixed assets or tangible property or products, and constitute the intangible personal property developed solely by Sellers. Each of the Sellers own 33.33% of the Assets and Sellers together own 100%of all rights, titles and interests in and to the Assets.
 
As full consideration for the Assets, the Registrant issued 22,500,000 restricted shares of the Company’s Common Stock, par value $.001, with each Seller receiving 7,500,000 shares. Due to the change of control and related party nature of the transaction a carry-over basis was applied. There is no historical book value for the asset purchased so the Company assigned a value of $0 to the assets.
 
Steven Raack and Thomas A. Raack are brothers, and Thomas A. Raack was, on the date of the Agreement, a Director, CEO, President, Secretary and Treasurer of the Company. Subsequent to the acquisition, Steven Raack was appointed as a Director, Thomas A. Raack resigned as CEO and President, and Steven Raack was appointed as the CEO and President.
 
Operations
 
We plan to focus on the development, sale and distribution of hemp oil-based products that contain naturally occurring cannabinoids, including cannabidiol ("CBD") and other products containing CBD-rich hemp oil (“Legal Hemp”). We intend to use third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our proposed products, using proprietary formulations we plan to create.
 
We also plan to focus on products that are formulated for the nutraceutical and cosmeceutical industries, including skin care products. The Company is not in the business of engaging in either recreational or medical marijuana, directly or indirectly. The Company's plans focus only on products that contain only those substances that are derived from the part of the cannabis plant that is excluded from the definition of “marijuana” under the Controlled Substances Act and are both federally legal and outside of the purview of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
 
We plan to offer our anticipated customers and affiliates high-quality products, exclusive experiences and referral-based income. Our business plan is based on the anticipated growth of the regulated cannabis / Cannabidiol (CBD) market, along with the trends in digital media and experiential lifestyles.
 
Our proposed products are planned to be formulated with health and safety in mind. We intend to sell branded CBD oils, personal care, body care and nutritional products. CBD oils we plan to include in our proposed products are planned to contain less than .3% THC and are planned to be extracted using a third-party vapor distillation process to retain cannabinoid and terpene benefits, without using hexane or butane.
 
We plan to enable our anticipated customers to purchase our proposed products directly from our planned website and they will also be eligible to receive benefits for referring other customers to us. We plan to offer additional surprise and delight offers to loyal customers. Those who join our proposed marketing system as an Affiliate will receive the opportunity to earn income on each referred sale. We are not a multi-level marketing company.
 
We intend to be a digital marketplace which utilizes technology as a massive differentiator within the regulated cannabis industry. We anticipate that this technology may be able to leverage the best strategies and frameworks of eCommerce, peer-to-peer selling and experiential marketing.

We believe that the expanding cannabis marketplace may include many fragmented and under-resourced businesses. We will attempt to operate our planned business with our proprietary technology, proposed high-quality products, anticipated excellent customer care and planned exclusive experiences in an effort to become an iconic brand.
 
Market, Customers and Distribution Methods
 
The market for CBD-related products is an emerging market.
 
In order to have a chance for our anticipated success in the market, we must formulate our proposed products in a manner that will appeal to the market and customers; we must test and sample consumer reaction to/acceptance of our proposed products; and we must also identify and establish distribution methods. If and when we obtain financing for our proposed business and operations, of which there can be no assurance, we intend to formulate our proposed products; test and sample such products; and identify and establish distribution methods.
 
We plan to initially market our proposed products via internet sales, direct sales and trade show sales.
 
Competition
 
We are a new business with no history of operations or current operations. Rather, we are just starting activities to engage in our proposed business, as well as seek necessary financing, as we currently have no financial resources, and as such, we have a weak competitive position in the industry. We intend to compete with independent manufacturers and institutional and individual investors who are actively seeking to develop and market CBD-based products.
 
There are several companies developing and utilizing cannabinoid for a range of products. The cannabinoid area currently includes formulated extracts of the Cannabis plant and synthetic formulations. These formulations include CBD and THC, or a combination of CBD/THC as the active pharmaceutical ingredient. Certain companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals, PLC, have focused on plant-based CBD formulations; while other companies, such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Insys Therapeutics Inc., have focused on synthetic CBD formulations.
 
The CBD-based consumer product industry is highly fragmented with numerous companies, many of which may be under-capitalized. We plan to routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities in an effort to seek optimize value for shareholders through new product development or by asset acquisitions or sales. There are also large, well-funded companies that currently do not offer hemp-based consumer product.
 
We may also compete with other CBD-related technology and product companies for financing from a limited number of investors that may be prepared to invest in such companies. The presence of competing companies in our field of endeavor may impact our ability to raise initial, needed capital in order to fund our proposed business and operations. If investors perceive that investments in our competitors are more attractive, based on the merit of their technologies, their products, the advanced stage of their marketing or development, or the price of the investment opportunity, we may not obtain our needed financing.
 
Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources, experience in conducting research, experience in developing and manufacturing their products, operating experience, research and development and marketing capabilities, name recognition and production capabilities. We will face competition from companies marketing existing products or developing new products which may render our technologies (and proposed products) obsolete.
 
These companies may have numerous competitive advantages, including:
 

• | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


• | established distribution networks;
--+-----------------------------------


• | more advanced technologies and product development;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates, higher discounts or incentives
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater experience in conducting research and development, manufacturing, obtaining regulatory approval for products, and marketing approved products; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | greater financial and human resources for product development, sales and marketing, and patent litigation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our commercial success, if any, will depend on our ability to compete effectively in product development areas such as, but not limited to, safety, price, marketing and distribution.
 
There can be no assurance that competitors will not succeed in developing products that are more effective than our current technology, therefore rendering our proposed products obsolete and noncompetitive.
 
Accordingly, in addition to our proposed research and development efforts, we may need to create a public relations/advertising program designed to establish our “brand” name recognition early on in our proposed business development; we intend to develop and market our brand name pending our proposed commercialization of products, if any, we may derive from our proposed research and development efforts. 
 
Intellectual Property
 
We currently own intellectual property which we obtained from Mssrs. Steve Raack, Tom Raack and Larry McNabb in the Asset Purchase Agreement, described in the section of this Report entitled “Asset Purchase Agreement”, above.
 
We have also filed a registration with the US Patent and Trademark Office for the mark:
 VITALIBIS TM.
 
Research and Development
 
We did not incur any research and development expenses during the period from April 11, 2014, (inception) through our year ended December 31, 2017.
 
Reports to Security Holders
 
We are subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act and we intend to furnish our shareholders annual reports containing financial statements audited by our independent registered public accounting firm and to make available quarterly reports containing unaudited financial statements for each of the first three quarters of each year. After the effectiveness of this Registration Statement we will begin filing Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Current Reports on Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to meet our timely and continuous disclosure requirements. We may also file additional documents with the Commission if they become necessary in the course of our company’s operations.
 
The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is www.sec.gov.
 
Government Regulations
 
We are not yet aware of any direct government regulations relating to the marketing of CBD-related products containing less than .03 parts THC, which are the only products we intend to include in our proposed products and business plan.
Environmental Regulations
 
We expect to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations relating to our business, and at this time, we do not anticipate incurring any material capital expenditures to comply with any environmental regulations or other requirements. While our proposed business activities do not currently violate any laws, any regulatory changes that impose additional restrictions or requirements on us or on our anticipated potential customers could adversely affect us by increasing our operating costs or decreasing demand for our proposed products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any employees. Steve Raack and Tom Raack each intend to devote about 20 hours per week on our proposed operations. The Company will consider employing staff in the future, but only if the new business is growing and cash flow will support such staff.

Litigation
 
We are not party to any pending, or to our knowledge, threatened litigation of any type.
