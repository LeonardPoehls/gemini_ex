ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
GENERAL
Business Overview
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30. Fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015 ended on September 30, October 1, and October 3, respectively, and are referred to in this annual report as fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 for convenience. Fiscal years 2017 and 2016 included 52 weeks and fiscal year 2015 included 53 weeks.
We are one of the world's leading providers of lasers, laser-based technologies and laser-based system solutions in a broad range of commercial, industrial and scientific applications. We design, manufacture, service and market lasers and related accessories for a diverse group of customers. Since inception in 1966, we have grown through internal expansion and through strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies, intellectual property, manufacturing processes and product offerings.
As a result of the acquisition of Rofin-Sinar Technologies Inc. ("Rofin") in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 (see discussion below), we reorganized our prior two reporting segments (Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components) into two new reporting segments for the combined company: OEM Laser Sources (“OLS”) and Industrial Lasers & Systems (“ILS”). This segment reorganization was based upon the organizational structure of the combined company and how the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions. Accordingly, our segment information was restated retroactively for all periods presented. This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies and synergies for our broad portfolio of laser technologies and products. While both segments deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, the OLS business segment is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research. Our ILS business segment delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing.
Income from operations is the measure of profit and loss that our chief operating decision maker ("CODM") uses to assess performance and make decisions. Income from operations represents the sales less the cost of sales and direct operating expenses incurred within the operating segments as well as allocated expenses such as shared sales and manufacturing costs. We do not allocate to our operating segments certain operating expenses, which we manage separately at the corporate level. These unallocated costs include stock-based compensation and corporate functions (certain advanced research and development, management, finance, legal and human resources) and are included in Corporate and other. Management does not consider unallocated Corporate and other costs in its measurement of segment performance. 
We were originally incorporated in California on May 26, 1966 and reincorporated in Delaware on October 1, 1990. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and we are a member of the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Index and the Russell 1000 Index.
Additional information about Coherent, Inc. (referred to herein as the Company, we, our, or Coherent) is available on our web site at www.coherent.com. We make available, free of charge on our web site, access to our annual report on Form 10-K, our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, our current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish them electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").

RECENT EVENTS
On November 7, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Rofin pursuant to the Merger Agreement dated March 16, 2016. Rofin is one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components. The acquisition was an all-cash transaction at a price of $32.50 per share of Rofin common stock. The aggregate consideration paid by us to the former Rofin stockholders was approximately $904.5 million, excluding related transaction fees and expenses. We also paid $15.3 million due to the cancellation of options held by employees of Rofin. We funded the payment of the aggregate consideration with a combination of our available cash on hand and the proceeds from the Euro Term Loan described below. As a condition of the acquisition, we were required to hold separate and divest Rofin’s low power CO2 laser business based in Hull, United Kingdom (the “Hull Business”) and have reported this business separately as a discontinued operation in this Form 10-K for the year ending September 30, 2017. We completed the divestiture of the Hull 
 4

Business on October 11, 2017, after receiving approval for the terms of the sale from the European Commission. See Note 3, “Business Combinations” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
On November 7, 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Barclays Bank PLC ("Barclays"), Bank of America, N.A. ("BAML") and MUFG Union Bank, N.A. ("MUFG"). The Credit Agreement provided for a 670.0 million Euro senior secured term loan facility (the “Euro Term Loan”) and a $100.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility. On November 7, 2016, the Euro Term Loan was drawn in full and its proceeds were used to finance our acquisition of Rofin and pay related fees and expenses. Also, on November 7, 2016, we used 10.0 million Euros of the capacity under the revolving credit facility for the issuance of a letter of credit.
On May 8, 2017, we entered into Amendment No. 1 and Waiver (the "Repricing Amendment") to the Credit Agreement. See Note 9, “Borrowings” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
During fiscal 2017, we made payments on our Euro Term Loan of a total of 156.7 million Euros, including voluntary payments of a total of 150.0 million Euros.
In relation to our acquisition of Rofin, we paid Barclays, our financial advisor, a fee of approximately $9.5 million, $1.0 million of which was paid upon delivery of the fairness opinion in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, and the remaining portion of which was paid upon consummation of the acquisition in the first quarter of fiscal 2017; these fees were recorded in selling, general and administrative expense in our consolidated statements of operations. We also paid Barclays, BAML and MUFG together approximately $17.0 million and $5.6 million for underwriting and upfront fees, respectively, upon the close of the financing on November 7, 2016; these fees are recorded as debt issuance costs on our consolidated balance sheets.
INDUSTRY BACKGROUND
The word "laser" is an acronym for "light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation." A laser emits an intense coherent beam of light with some unique and highly useful properties. Most importantly, a laser is orders of magnitude brighter than any lamp. As a result of its coherence, the beam can be focused to a very small and intense spot, useful for applications requiring very high power densities including cutting and other materials processing procedures. The laser's high spatial resolution is also useful for microscopic imaging and inspection applications. Laser light can be monochromatic—all of the beam energy is confined to a narrow wavelength band. Some lasers can be used to create ultrafast output—a series of pulses with pulse durations as short as attoseconds (10-18 seconds).
There are many types of lasers and one way of classifying them is by the material or medium used to create the lasing action. This can be in the form of a gas, liquid, semiconductor, solid state crystal or fiber. Lasers can also be classified by their output wavelength: ultraviolet, visible, infrared or wavelength tunable. We manufacture all of these laser types. There are also many options in terms of pulsed output versus continuous wave, pulse duration, output power, beam dimensions, etc. In fact, each application has its own specific requirements in terms of laser performance. The broad technical depth at Coherent enables us to offer a diverse set of product lines characterized by lasers targeted at growth opportunities and key applications. In all cases, we aim to be the supplier of choice by offering a high-value combination of superior technical performance and high reliability.
Photonics has taken its place alongside electronics as a critical enabling technology for the twenty-first century. Photonics based solutions are entrenched in a broad array of industries that include microelectronics, flat panel displays, machine tool, automotive and medical diagnostics, with adoption continuing in ever more diverse applications. Growth in these applications stems from two sources. First, there are many applications where the laser is displacing conventional technology because it can do the job faster, better or more economically (e.g. sheet metal cutting). Second, there are new applications where the laser is the enabling tool that makes the work possible, as in the conversion of amorphous silicon into poly crystalline silicon at low temperatures, where lasers are used in the manufacturing of high resolution flexible OLED displays found in the latest smart phones, tablet and laptop computers.
Key laser applications include: semiconductor inspection; manufacturing of advanced printed circuit boards ("PCBs"); flat panel display manufacturing; solar cell production; medical and bio-instrumentation; materials processing; metal cutting and welding; industrial process and quality control; marking; imaging and printing; graphic arts and display; and research and development. For example, ultraviolet (“UV”) lasers are enabling the continuous move towards miniaturization, which drives innovation and growth in many markets. In addition, the advent of industrial grade ultrafast lasers continues to open up new applications for laser processing.
Coherent occupies a unique position in the industry thanks to the breadth and depth of our product and technology portfolio, which includes lasers, optics, laser beam delivery components and laser systems. Working closely with our customers we have developed specialized solutions that include lasers, delivery and process optics in complete assemblies (sub-systems or 
 5

“rails”), and for certain applications and markets we have also developed parts handling and automation to build complete laser production tools.
OUR STRATEGY
We strive to develop innovative and proprietary products and solutions that meet the needs of our customers and that are based on our core expertise in lasers and optical technologies. In pursuit of our strategy, we intend to:

• | Leverage our technology portfolio and application engineering to lead the proliferation of photonics into broader markets—We will continue to identify opportunities in which our technology portfolio and application engineering can be used to offer innovative solutions and gain access to new markets. We plan to utilize our expertise to increase our market share in the mid to high power material processing applications.

Microelectronics
Nowhere is the trend towards miniaturization and higher performance more prevalent than in the Microelectronics market where smart phones, tablets, personal computers ("PC's"), televisions ("TV's") and "wearables" are driving advances in displays, integrated circuits and PCBs. In response to market demands and consumer expectations, semiconductor and device manufacturers are continually seeking to improve their process and design technologies in order to manufacture smaller, more powerful and more reliable devices at lower cost. New laser applications and new laser technologies are a key element in delivering higher resolution and higher precision at lower manufacturing cost.
We support three major markets in the microelectronics industry: (1) flat panel display ("FPD") manufacturing, (2) advanced packaging and interconnects ("API") and (3) semiconductor front-end ("SEMI").
Microelectronics—flat panel display manufacturing
The high-volume consumer market is driving the production of FPDs in applications such as mobile phones, tablets, laptop computers, TVs and wearables. There are several types of established and emerging displays based on quite different technologies, including liquid crystal ("LCD") and organic light emitting diodes ("OLED"). Each of these technologies utilize laser applications in their manufacturing process to enable improved yields, higher process speed, improved battery life, lower cost and/or superior display brightness, resolution and refresh rates.
Several display types require a high-density pattern of silicon thin film transistors ("TFTs"). If this silicon is polycrystalline as opposed to amorphous, the display performance is greatly enhanced. In the past, these polysilicon layers could only be produced on expensive special glass at high temperatures. However, excimer-based processes, such as excimer laser annealing ("ELA") have allowed high-volume production of low-temperature polysilicon ("LTPS") on conventional glass substrates as well as flexible displays based on plastic substrates. Our excimer lasers provide a unique solution for LTPS because they are the only industrial-grade excimer lasers optimized for this application. The current state-of-the-art product for this application is our excimer Vyper laser and LineBeam systems. These systems deliver power ranges of 1200W to 3600W, depending on the system, enabling a critical manufacturing process step with Generation 4, 5, 5.5 and 6 substrates. These systems are integral to the manufacturing process on all leading LTPS-based smart phone displays, with the highest commercially available pixel densities of greater than 300 pixels per inch (ppi), with the current trends going to even higher ppi (>500 ppi) for high end smart phones, and hold the potential for deployment in tablet, laptop and OLED TV displays. Excimer based LTPS is also enabling a new generation of flexible OLED displays which are currently undergoing rapid growth as their adoption into smart phones accelerates.
A modern flat panel display incorporates a number of different layers, some of which are thin films that need to be cut or structured. As film thicknesses decrease over time, lasers are becoming the tool of choice to process these materials. Our DIAMOND CO2 and Rapid series ultrafast lasers are used for cutting FPD films.
We have developed a proprietary technology for cutting of brittle materials such as glass and sapphire without debris and with zero kerf called SMART CleaveTM, which is used for cutting brittle materials used in displays. This technology uses ultrafast lasers coupled with proprietary optics.
Our AVIA, Rapid, Monaco and DIAMOND CO2 and CO lasers are also used in other production processes for FPDs. These processes include drilling, cutting, patterning, marking and yield improvement.
Microelectronics—advanced packaging and interconnects
After a wafer is patterned, there are then a host of other processes, referred to as back-end processing, which finally result in a packaged encapsulated silicon chip. Ultimately, these chips are then assembled into finished products. The advent of high-speed logic and high-memory content devices has caused chip manufacturers to look for alternative technologies to improve performance and lower process costs. This search includes new types of materials, such as low-k and thinner silicon. Our AVIA, Rapid, Monaco and Matrix lasers provide economical methods of cutting and scribing these wafers while delivering higher yields than traditional mechanical methods. 
There are similar trends in chip packaging and PCB manufacturing requiring more compact packaging and denser interconnects. In many cases, lasers present enabling technologies. For instance, lasers are now the only economically practical method for drilling microvias in chip substrates and in both rigid and flexible PCBs. These microvias are tiny interconnects that are essential for enabling high-density circuitry commonly used in smart phones, tablets and advanced computing systems. Our DIAMOND CO2 and AVIA diode pumped solid state ("DPSS") lasers are the lasers of choice in this application. The ability of these lasers to operate at very high repetition rates translates into faster drilling speeds and increased throughput in microvia processing applications. In addition, multi-layer circuit boards require more flexible production methods than conventional 
 7

printing technologies can offer, which has led to widespread adoption of laser direct imaging ("LDI"). Our Paladin laser is used for this application.
Lasers have also become a valuable tool in high-brightness ("HB") light-emitting diode ("LED") manufacturing, improving LED performance and yield. LEDs have enjoyed widespread adoption as the light source in all categories of LCD displays, from phones to full size TVs and are also moving into general lighting. Our lasers are used in back-end processing of HB-LEDs.
Microelectronics—semiconductor front-end
The term "front-end" refers to the production of semiconductor devices which occurs prior to packaging.
As semiconductor device geometries decrease in size, devices become increasingly susceptible to smaller defects during each phase of the manufacturing process and these defects can negatively impact yield. One of the semiconductor industry's responses to the increasing vulnerability of semiconductor devices to smaller defects has been to use defect detection and inspection techniques that are closely linked to the manufacturing process. 
Detecting the presence of defects is only the first step in preventing their recurrence. After detection, defects must be examined in order to identify their size, shape and the process step in which the defect occurred. This examination is called defect classification. Identification of the sources of defects in the lengthy and complex semiconductor manufacturing process has become essential for maintaining high yield production. Semiconductor manufacturing has become an around-the-clock operation and it is important for products used for inspection, measurement and testing to be reliable and to have long lifetimes. Our Azure, Paladin, Excimer and ion lasers are used to detect and characterize defects in semiconductor chips.
Materials processing
The materials processing segment is comprised of four major markets: (1) automotive, (2) machine tool, (3) medical device and (4) consumer goods, as well a number of smaller markets. It is the most diverse of all the segments we serve and a large cross section of our products are used in this segment. Our sales in this segment include laser sources, laser rails, beam delivery components, laser diagnostic equipment and complete laser tools. At a high level, the drivers for laser deployment within the materials processing segment are faster processing with higher yields, processing of new and novel materials, more environmentally friendly processes and higher precision. With the broadest product portfolio in the laser industry, we offer solutions for almost any application on any material to our customers. The most common applications include cutting, welding, joining, drilling, perforating, scribing, engraving and marking.
Lasers are used in a number of applications in the automotive industry, from fine processing of high precision parts to marking, as well as cutting of metals and welding large components such as gear boxes and car bodies. We serve this industry with a number of our products including ultrafast, DPSS, CO2, diode and fiber lasers as well as rails and tools in the areas of marking, scribing, cutting and welding. 
In the machine tool industry lasers have been the solution of choice for cutting metal for some time. Traditionally this was a market for high power CO2 lasers, but with the advent of high power fiber lasers, a transition away from CO2 took place in many applications. That transition is substantially done since fiber lasers are used in the majority of metal cutting applications. We serve this market with our high power fiber and CO2 lasers. We are vertically integrated with active fiber manufacturing and are executing plans to be integrated with world class diodes, which makes us very well positioned to succeed in the high power fiber laser market in the intermediate and long term. We have a complete line of high power fiber lasers in power levels up to 10 kW. We offer lasers with different performance points in terms of power levels and beam profiles to address specific applications, including single mode lasers and advanced beam shaping options. Additive manufacturing or 3D printing is another growing market where lasers have seen rapid growth. We serve this market with CO2 and DPSS lasers. 
The medical device market is characterized by its need for high precision manufacturing with high levels of quality control which lends itself very well to laser manufacturing. Applications include fine cutting and welding in addition to corrosive resistant marking. We serve this market with lasers as well as tools.
In the consumer goods market, we serve a large variety of applications in packaging, digital printing, jewelry, textiles, security and consumer electronics. We serve these industries with almost all of our products from lasers to laser tools. As a consequence, this broad segment represents a stable and growing market for us.
In summary, we serve the materials processing segment with a very broad product portfolio. Laser sources include the Diamond series mid-power CO and CO2 lasers; the DC and PRC series of high power CO2 lasers; high power fiber lasers; the DF series of high power diode laser systems; the StarFiber mid-power fiber lasers; the NuQ Q-switched fiber lasers; the COMPACT, MINI and EVOLUTION series of low and mid power diode lasers; the AViA, Matrix, Flare, Helios and LDP 
 8

DPSS lasers; the Monaco and Rapid series of ultrafast lasers; and the SLS, KLS, FLS and NA series of lamp pumped lasers. Laser tools include the Performance, Tool, Open, and Integral series of manual welding systems; the UW and MPS series of modular and highly configurable laser processing systems; the EasyMark, EasyJewel, LabelMarker Advanced and Combiline laser marking systems; the META laser cutting tools; and the PWS mini welding system. Laser rails include the PowerLine series for marking; the PWS welding system; the QFS laser scribing system; and the PerfoLas and StarShape CO2 laser based systems.
OEM components and instrumentation
Instrumentation is one of our more mature commercial applications. Representative applications within this market include bio-instrumentation, medical OEMs, graphic arts and display, machine vision and defense applications. We also support the laser-based instrumentation market with a range of laser-related components, including diode lasers and optical fibers. Our OEM component business includes sales to other, less integrated laser manufacturers participating in OEM markets such as materials processing, scientific, and medical.
Bio-instrumentation
Laser applications for bio-instrumentation include bio-agent detection for point source and standoff detection of pathogens or other bio-toxins; confocal microscopy for biological imaging that allows researchers and clinicians to visualize cellular and subcellular structures and processes with an incredible amount of detail; DNA sequencing where lasers provide automation and data acquisition rates that would be impossible by any other method; drug discovery—genomic and proteomic analyses that enable drug discovery to proceed at very high throughput rates; and flow cytometry for analyzing single cells or populations of cells in a heterogeneous mixture, including blood samples. Our OBIS, Flare, Galaxy, Sapphire, BioRay and Genesis lasers are used in several bio-instrumentation applications.
Medical Therapy
We sell a variety of components and lasers to medical laser companies for use in end-user applications such as ophthalmology, aesthetic, surgical, therapeutic and dentistry. Our DIAMOND series CO2 lasers are widely used in ophthalmic, aesthetic and surgical markets. We have a leading position in Lasik and photorefractive keratectomy surgery methods with our ExciStar XS excimer laser platform. We also provide ultrafast lasers for use in cataract surgery and optical fibers for surgical applications.
The unique ability of our optically pumped semiconductor lasers ("OPSL") technology to match a wavelength to an application has led to the development of a high-power yellow (577nm) laser for the treatment of eye related diseases, such as Age Related Macular Degeneration and retinal diseases associated with diabetes. The 577nm wavelength was designed to match the peak in absorption of oxygenated hemoglobin thereby allowing treatment to occur at a lower power level, and thus reducing stress and heat-load placed on the eye with traditional green-based (530nm) solid state lasers. Other applications where our OBIS, Genesis and Sapphire series of lasers are used include the retinal scanning market in diagnostic imaging systems as well as new ground breaking in-vivo imaging.
Scientific research and government programs
We are widely recognized as a technology innovator and the scientific market has historically provided an ideal "test market" for our leading-edge innovations. These have included ultrafast lasers, DPSS lasers, continuous-wave ("CW") systems, excimer gas lasers and water-cooled ion gas lasers. Our portfolio of lasers that address the scientific research market is broad and includes our Chameleon, Chameleon Discovery, COMPexPro, Astrella, Revolution, Fidelity, Legend, Libra, Monaco, Vitara, Mephisto, Mira, Genesis and Verdi lasers. Many of the innovations and products pioneered in the scientific marketplace have become commercial successes for both our OEM customers and us.
We have a large installed base of scientific lasers which are used in a wide range of applications spanning virtually every branch of science and engineering. These applications include biology and life science, engineering, physical chemistry and physics. Most of these applications require the use of ultrafast lasers that enable the generation of pulses short enough to be measured in femto- or attoseconds (10-15 to 10-18 seconds). Because of these very short pulse durations, ultrafast lasers enable the study of fundamental physical and chemical processes with temporal resolution unachievable with any other tool. These lasers also deliver very high peak power and large bandwidths, which can be used to generate many exotic effects. Some of these are now finding their way into mainstream applications, such as microscopy or materials processing. The use of ultrafast lasers such as the Chameleon, Fidelity and Monaco in microscopy is now a common occurrence in bio-imaging labs, and they have become a crucial tool in modern neuroscience research. 
FUTURE TRENDS
Microelectronics
 9

Lasers are widely used in mass production microelectronics applications largely because they enable entirely new application capabilities that cannot be realized by any other known means. These laser-based fabrication and testing methods provide a level of precision, typically on a micrometer and nanometer level, that are unique, faster, are touch free, deliver superior end products, increase yields, and/or reduce production costs. We anticipate this trend to continue, driven primarily by the increasing sophistication and miniaturization of consumer electronic goods and their convergence via the internet, resulting in increasing demand for better displays, more bandwidth and memory, and all packaged into devices which are lighter, thinner and consume less power. Although this market follows the macro-economic trends and carries inherent risks, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on the current market trends and that we will see continued increased adoption of our solid-state, CO2, fiber, direct diode and excimer laser systems, as all these lasers enable entirely new applications, performance improvements and reduced process costs. 
Excimer laser based LTPS is a key technology for producing high resolution OLED displays in general and flexible OLED displays in particular. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of the rapid growth that is projected for OLED displays in smart phones and other mobile devices over the next several years with our Vyper and LineBeam systems.
CO2, Avia, Matrix, Rapid, Monaco, Helios and direct diode lasers all seem aligned with the need for related FPD touch panel, film cutting, light guide technology, repair and frit welding.
The trend for thinner and lighter devices is impacting the glass substrates used in today’s mobile devices requiring thinner glass with higher degrees of mechanical strength and scratch resistance. Mechanical means of cutting these glass and sapphire pieces are no longer adequate to meet future requirements and we expect lasers to play an increased role. Our CO, CO2, Monaco and Rapid lasers together with our proprietary SmartCleave technology are well positioned to take advantage of this trend.
Semiconductor devices look set to continue Moore's Law, shrinking device geometries for at least another decade, as well as expanding vertically into new 3D structures. As a result we believe our many UV laser sources (such as Azure, Paladin, Avia, Rapid, ExiStar and Matrix) will continue to find increasing adoption, since their unique optical properties align well with the process demands of a nanometer scale world. 
These same lasers, plus Monaco, Rapid, CO and CO2 are also widely adopted for back end Advanced Packaging and Interconnect (API) applications. With dimension roadmaps showing a decade of dimension shrink on PCBs, interconnects, Silicon & LED scribe widths and wafer thickness, we believe that our portfolio of lasers aligns well with these demands as well as new processes that seem likely to be enabled by our lasers, to meet the increasing demands and decreasing tolerances of these markets.
Materials processing
The materials processing segment is the most diverse of all the segments we serve and a large cross section of our products are used in this segment. We sell laser sources, laser rails, beam delivery components, laser diagnostic equipment and complete laser tools. There are many drivers at play, but at a high level they involve faster processing with higher yields, processing of new materials, more environmentally friendly processes and higher precision.
The automotive industry is undergoing rapid changes that present opportunities for further use of lasers. Trends such as reduction in emissions from lighter cars and electric vehicles require new materials and new processes for welding, cutting and drilling. We believe this will lead to further adoption of lasers and tools based on high power fiber and diode lasers, as well as ultrafast and CO2 laser. 
We expect to see continued growth for high power fiber lasers in the machine tool industry used in metal cutting applications continues. In addition, we see additional opportunities in newer applications such as laser cladding, heat treatment and 3D printing.
In the consumer goods market, we serve a large variety of applications in packaging, digital printing, jewelry, textiles, security and consumer electronics. We serve these industries with almost all of our products from lasers to laser tools. As a consequence, this broad segment represents a stable and growing market for us. 
We supply the medical device market with a variety of lasers and laser tools in applications such as fine cutting and welding as well as marking. This market is set to continue to grow in the foreseeable future as the population becomes older and advanced medical procedures spread outside the traditional markets in US, Europe and Japan.
OEM components and instrumentation
The bio instrumentation market is on a steady path in the most important areas: microscopy, flow cytometry and DNA sequencing, which all are enjoying solid research funding on a worldwide basis with some local variations. In this field, our OPSL technology gives us differentiated products at a number of important wavelengths. This advantage coupled with strong 
 10

focus on meeting our customers’ demands for more compact and cost effective sources has resulted in growth for us in this market and we expect that to continue. Our OPSL technology resulted in the first truly continuous wave solid-state UV laser which enables the use of UV in a clinical as well as a research environment. 
In the medical therapeutic area, we see stable business with several opportunities for growth. We supply excimer lasers used in refractive eye surgery and are actively involved in further developments in laser vision correction including the use of ultrafast lasers in applications such as laser cataract surgery where higher precision and use of advanced implants enable better and more reliable patient outcomes. We also have opportunities in dental procedures for both hard and soft tissue ablation, with greatly improved patient comfort and outcome. In the area of photocoagulation, our Genesis OPSL yellow lasers are being used since the wavelength is particularly suitable for the treatment of blood vessels. In aesthetic laser procedures, we are an OEM supplier of CO2 and semiconductor lasers to the major manufacturers of equipment used in the latest aesthetic procedures. 
Scientific research and government programs
Worldwide scientific funding seems stable overall, with some regions growing and others just holding their current level. Bright spots include the strong push in neuroscience to better understand how the brain functions. Lasers play a very important role in imaging brain structure as well as tracking activity in animal brains using techniques such as optogenetics. We believe that our current and upcoming products are well positioned to take advantage of this exciting opportunity. In physics and chemistry applications, our recent product introductions of high performance and industrially hardened ultrafast products have been very well received. While this is a very competitive market, we expect that our new products will position us for growth.

Our semiconductor, crystal, fiber and large form factor optics facilities all maintain an external customer base providing value-added solutions. We direct significant engineering efforts to produce 
 12

unique solutions targeted for internal consumption. These investments, once integrated into our broader product portfolio, provide our customers with uniquely differentiated solutions and the opportunity to substantially enhance the performance, reliability and capability of the products we offer.
TECHNOLOGIES
Diode-pumped solid-state lasers
DPSS lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a crystal to produce a laser beam. By changing the energy, optical components and the types of crystals used in the laser, different wavelengths and types of laser light can be produced.
The efficiency, reliability, longevity and relatively low cost of DPSS lasers make them ideally suited for a wide range of OEM and end-user applications, particularly those requiring 24-hour operations. Our DPSS systems are compact and self-contained sealed units. Unlike conventional tools and other lasers, our DPSS lasers require minimal maintenance since they do not have internal controls or components that require adjusting and cleaning to maintain consistency. They are also less affected by environmental changes in temperature and humidity, which can alter alignment and inhibit performance in many systems.
We manufacture a variety of types of DPSS lasers for different applications including semiconductor inspection; advanced packaging and interconnects; laser pumping; spectroscopy; bio-agent detection; DNA sequencing; drug discovery; flow cytometry; forensics; computer-to-plate printing; entertainment lighting (display); medical; rapid prototyping and marking, welding, engraving, cutting and drilling.
Fiber lasers
Fiber lasers use semiconductor lasers to pump a doped optical fiber to produce a laser beam. The unique features of a fiber laser make them suitable for producing high power, continuous wave laser beams. Our fiber laser design has several unique features including a modular design for improved serviceability and diode bar based pumping. Due to packaging efficiency, diode bars reduce the overall cost of a fiber laser. Some of the most critical components inside a fiber laser include the gain fiber itself and the diodes providing the pump power. We plan to continue to drive cost reduction in our diode laser pumps and demonstrate the scalability of the platform and as a result, expect to be well positioned as a fiber laser supplier. This platform addresses the large growing high power metal cutting and joining market.
Gas lasers (CO, CO2, Excimer, Ion)
The breadth of our gas laser portfolio is industry leading, encompassing CO, CO2, excimer and ion laser technologies. Gas lasers derive their name from the use of one or more gases as a lasing medium. They collectively span an extremely diverse and useful emission range, from the very deep ultraviolet to the far infrared. This diverse range of available wavelengths, coupled with high optical output power, and an abundance of other attractive characteristics, makes gas lasers extremely useful and popular for a variety of microelectronics, scientific, medical therapeutic and materials processing applications.
Optically Pumped Semiconductor Lasers ("OPSL")
Our OPSL platform is a surface emitting semiconductor laser that is energized or pumped by a semiconductor laser. The use of optical pumping circumvents inherent power scaling limitations of electrically pumped lasers, enabling very high powered devices. A wide range of wavelengths can be achieved by varying the semiconductor materials used in the device and changing the frequency of the laser beam using techniques common in solid state lasers. The platform leverages high reliability technologies developed for telecommunications and produces a compact, rugged, high power, single-mode laser.
Our OPSL products are well suited to a wide range of applications, including the bio-instrumentation, medical therapeutics and graphic arts and display markets. 
Semiconductor lasers
High power edge emitting semiconductor diode lasers use the same principles as widely-used CD and DVD lasers, but produce significantly higher power levels. The advantages of this type of laser include smaller size, longer life, enhanced reliability and greater efficiency. We manufacture a wide range of discrete semiconductor laser products with wavelengths ranging from 650nm to over 1000nm and output powers ranging from 1W to over 100W, with highly integrated products in the kW range. These products are available in a variety of industry standard form factors including the following: bare die, packaged and fiber coupled single emitters and bars, monolithic stacks and fully integrated modules with microprocessor controlled units that contain power supplies and active coolers.
Our semiconductor lasers are used internally as the pump lasers in DPSS, fiber and OPSL products that are manufactured by us, as well as a wide variety of external medical, OEM, military and industrial applications, including aesthetic (hair 
 13

removal, cosmetic dentistry), graphic arts, counter measures, rangefinders, target designators, cladding, hardening, brazing and welding.
Ultrafast ("UF") Lasers
Ultrafast lasers are lasers generating light pulses with durations of a few femtoseconds (10-15 seconds) to a few tens of picoseconds (10-12 seconds). These types of lasers are used for medical, advanced microelectronics and materials processing applications as well as scientific research. UF laser oscillators generate a train of pulses at 50-100 MHz, with peak powers of tens of kilowatts, and UF laser amplifiers generate pulses at 1-2000 kHz, with peak powers up to several Terawatts.
The extremely short duration of UF laser pulses enables temporally resolving fast events like the dynamics of atoms or electrons. In addition, the high peak power enables so-called non-linear effects where several photons can be absorbed by a molecule at the same time. This type of process enables applications like multi-photon excitation microscopy or ablation of materials with high precision and minimal thermal damage. The use of our ultrafast lasers in applications outside science has been growing rapidly over the last several years, particularly in microelectronics and materials processing applications. 
SALES AND MARKETING
We primarily market our products in the United States through a direct sales force. We sell internationally through direct sales personnel located in Canada, France, Finland, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, China, South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore, Spain and the United Kingdom, as well as through independent representatives in certain jurisdictions around the world. Our foreign sales are made principally to customers in South Korea, China, Germany, Japan and other European and Asia-Pacific countries. Foreign sales accounted for 83% of our net sales in fiscal 2017, 76% of our net sales in fiscal 2016 and 73% of our net sales in fiscal 2015. Sales made to independent representatives and distributors are generally priced in U.S. dollars. A large portion of foreign sales that we make directly to customers are priced in local currencies and are therefore subject to currency exchange fluctuations. Foreign sales are also subject to other normal risks of foreign operations such as protective tariffs, export and import controls and political instability. 
We had one customer, Advanced Process Systems Corporation, who contributed more than 10% of revenue during fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015. We had another major customer, Japanese Steel Works, Ltd., who contributed more than 10% of revenue during fiscal 2016.
To support our sales efforts we maintain and continue to invest in a number of applications centers around the world, where our applications experts work closely with customers on developing laser processes to meet their manufacturing needs. The applications span a wide range, but are mostly centered around the materials processing and microelectronics markets. Locations include several facilities in the US, Europe and Asia.
We maintain customer support and field service staff in major markets within the United States, Europe, Japan, China, South Korea, Taiwan and other Asia-Pacific countries. This organization works closely with customers, customer groups and independent representatives in servicing equipment, training customers to use our products and exploring additional applications of our technologies.
We typically provide parts and service warranties on our lasers, laser-based systems, optical and laser components and related accessories and services. Warranties on some of our products and services may be shorter or longer than one year. Warranty reserves, as reflected on our consolidated balance sheets, have generally been sufficient to cover product warranty repair and replacement costs. The weighted average warranty period covered in our reserve is approximately 15 months.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
We are constantly developing and introducing new products as well as improving and refining existing products to better serve the markets we participate in. Our development efforts are focused on designing and developing products, services and solutions that anticipate customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends. Our efforts are also focused on identifying the areas where we believe we can make valuable contributions. Research and development expenditures for fiscal 2017 were $119.2 million, or 6.9% of net sales compared to $81.8 million, or 9.5% of net sales for fiscal 2016 and $81.5 million, or 10.2% of net sales for fiscal 2015. We work closely with customers, both individually and through our sponsored seminars, to develop products to meet customer application and performance needs. In addition, we are working with leading research and educational institutions to develop new photonics based solutions.
MANUFACTURING
Since the acquisition of Rofin in November 2016, we have integrated Rofin into our organizational structure and both organizations are operating as one company with common objectives, goals and processes. Strategies are being implemented to improve operating leverage, to execute synergies and to enhance our customers' experience. Common policies and guidelines 
 14

have been communicated, key management and operating processes have been implemented and ERP systems at some of Rofin’s sites have been integrated onto our Oracle ERP and Agile planning platforms, consistent with the rest of Coherent. This integration process will continue into fiscal 2018 and beyond. 
Strategies
One of our core manufacturing strategies is to tightly control our supply of key parts, components, sub-assemblies and outsourcing partners. We primarily utilize vertical integration when we have proprietary internal capabilities that are not cost-effectively available from external sources. We believe this is essential to maintaining high quality products and enable rapid development and deployment of new products and technologies. We provide customers with 24-hour technical expertise and quality that is International Organization for Standardization ("ISO") certified at our principal manufacturing sites.
Committed to quality and customer satisfaction, we design and produce many of our own components and sub-assemblies in order to retain quality and performance control. We have also outsourced certain components, sub-assemblies and finished goods where we can maintain our high quality standards while improving our cost structure. 
As part of our strategy to increase our market share and customer support in Asia as well as our continuing efforts to manage costs, we have transferred the production of additional products into both of our Singapore and Malaysia factories. With the acquisition of Rofin, we now have a manufacturing footprint in Nanjing, China. We are transferring additional products and volume to Nanjing as well as consolidating our China repair activities in that facility. We continue to expand our tube refurbishment capacity and footprint in our South Korea operations, which has allowed us to reduce service response time and inventories, providing benefits to us and to our customers. We have also established an International Procurement Office in Singapore and have been increasing our sourcing of materials from Asia to reduce material costs on a global basis. In fiscal 2015, we increased our vertical integration capabilities with the asset acquisition of the Tinsley Optics business from L-3 Communications Corporation.
We have designed and implemented proprietary manufacturing tools, equipment and techniques in an effort to provide products that differentiate us from our competitors. These proprietary manufacturing techniques are utilized in a number of our product lines including our gas laser production, crystal growth, beam alignment as well as the wafer growth for our semiconductor and optically pumped semiconductor laser product family.
Raw materials or sub-components required in the manufacturing process are generally available from several sources. However, we currently purchase several key components and materials, including exotic materials, crystals and optics, used in the manufacture of our products from sole source or limited source suppliers. We also purchase assemblies and turnkey solutions from contract manufacturers based on our proprietary designs. We rely on our own production and design capability to manufacture and specify certain strategic components, crystals, fibers, semiconductor lasers, lasers and laser based systems.
For a discussion of the importance to our business of, and the risks attendant to sourcing, see "Risk Factors" in item 1A — "We depend on sole source or limited source suppliers, both internal and external, for some of our key components and materials, including exotic materials, certain cutting-edge optics and crystals, in our products, which make us susceptible to supply shortages or price fluctuations that could adversely affect our business."

Our diode laser products are manufactured and tested in Mainz and Freiburg, Germany; Tucson, Arizona; and Nanjing, China. Coating of our Slab laser electrodes is performed in Overath, Germany. Our fiber optics and beam delivery systems are manufactured and tested in Molndal, Sweden, and power supplies are manufactured and tested in Starnberg-Munich, Germany. The Company’s active and passive fibers and amplifiers are manufactured and tested in East Granby, Connecticut. Optical engines for fiber lasers, fiber lasers modules and wafer material are designed and manufactured in Tampere, Finland.
We have transferred several products and subassemblies for manufacture and repairs to our Singapore, Malaysia and Nanjing, China facilities and are continuing to transfer additional product manufacturing to these facilities as part of our worldwide manufacturing cost reduction strategy.
Coherent is committed to meeting internationally recognized manufacturing standards. All of our legacy Coherent facilities are ISO 9001 certified and several facilities are ISO 13485, ISO 14001, ISO 17025 and/or ISO 50001 certified depending on the products designed and manufactured at that facility. Substantially all of our legacy Rofin facilities are either ISO 9001 certified or are in the process of being certified.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. As of September 30, 2017, we held approximately 700 U.S. and foreign patents, which expire in calendar years 2017 through 2035 (depending on the payment of maintenance fees) and we have approximately 275 additional pending patent applications that have been filed. The issued patents cover various products in all of the major markets that we serve.
Some of our products are designed to include intellectual property licensed from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to aspects of our products, processes and services. While we have generally been able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained on reasonable terms in the future or at all.
For a discussion of the importance to our business of, and the risks attendant to intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors" in Item 1A — "We may not be able to protect our proprietary technology which could adversely affect our competitive advantage" and "We may, in the future, be subject to claims or litigation from third parties, for claims of infringement of their proprietary rights or to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of competitors or other rights holders. These claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel. Adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition."
COMPETITION
Competition in the various photonics markets in which we provide products is very intense. We compete against a number of large public and private companies including Novanta Inc., IPG Photonics Corporation, Lumentum Holdings Inc., MKS Instruments, Inc., and TRUMPF GmbH, as well as other smaller companies. In addition, from time to time our customers may also decide to vertically integrate and build their own photonics products. We compete globally based on our broad product offering, reliability, cost, and performance advantages for the widest range of commercial and scientific research applications. Other considerations by our customers include warranty, global service and support and distribution.
BACKLOG
At fiscal 2017 year-end, our backlog of orders scheduled for shipment (within one year) was $1,040.0 million compared to $605.3 million at fiscal 2016 year-end. By segment, backlog for OLS was $801.4 million and $558.6 million, respectively, at fiscal 2017 and 2016 year-ends. Backlog for ILS was $238.6 million and $46.7 million, respectively, at fiscal 2017 and 2016 year-ends. The increase in OLS backlog from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 year-end is primarily due to the timing of large excimer laser annealing system orders, net of shipments, for the flat panel display market. The increase in ILS backlog from fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2017 year-end is primarily due to the acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 and is primarily concentrated on orders in the materials processing and high power fiber laser markets. Orders used to compute backlog are generally cancelable and, depending on the notice period, are subject to rescheduling by our customers with penalties. Historically, we have not experienced a significant rate of cancellation or rescheduling, though we cannot guarantee that the rate of cancellations or rescheduling will not increase in the future.
 16

SEASONALITY
We have historically experienced decreased revenue in the first fiscal quarter compared to other quarters in our fiscal year due to the impact of time off and business closures at our facilities and those of many of our customers due to year-end holidays. For example over the past 10 years, excluding certain recovery years, our first fiscal quarter revenues have ranged 2%-12% below the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal years. With the acquisition of Rofin in fiscal 2017, we expect a more pronounced decrease in revenues in the first quarter of the fiscal year as Rofin has historically experienced more pronounced seasonality, particularly in materials processing applications, than Coherent historically has experienced. This historical pattern should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance.
EMPLOYEES
As of fiscal 2017 year-end, we had 5,218 employees. Approximately 666 of our employees are involved in research and development; 3,382 of our employees are involved in operations, manufacturing, service and quality assurance; and 1,170 of our employees are involved in sales, order administration, marketing, finance, information technology, general management and other administrative functions. Our success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain employees. We face competition in this regard from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
ACQUISITIONS
On November 7, 2016, we acquired Rofin, one of the world's leading developers and manufacturers of high-performance industrial laser sources and laser-based solutions and components, for approximately $936.3 million. Rofin's operating results have been included primarily in our Industrial Lasers & Systems segment. See "Recent Developments" for further discussion of the acquisition and the Credit Agreement. 
In July 2015, we acquired certain assets of Raydiance, Inc. ("Raydiance") for approximately $5.0 million, excluding transaction costs. Raydiance manufactured complete tools and lasers for ultrafast processing systems and subsystems in the precision micromachining processing market. The Raydiance assets have been included in our OEM Laser Sources segment.
In July 2015, we acquired the assets and certain liabilities of the Tinsley Optics ("Tinsley") business from L-3 Communications Corporation for approximately $4.3 million, excluding transaction costs. Tinsley is a specialized manufacturer of high precision optical components and subsystems sold primarily in the aerospace and defense industry. Tinsley manufactures the large form factor optics for our excimer laser annealing systems. The Tinsley assets have been included in our OEM Laser Sources segment.
Please refer to "Note 3. Business Combinations" of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report for further discussion of recent acquisitions completed.
RESTRUCTURINGS AND CONSOLIDATION
In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we began the implementation of planned restructuring activities in connection with the acquisition of Rofin. These activities to date primarily have related to exiting our legacy high power fiber laser product line, change of control payments to Rofin officers, the exiting of two product lines acquired in the acquisition of Rofin, realignment of our supply chain due to segment reorganization and consolidation of sales and distribution offices. These activities resulted in charges primarily for employee termination, other exit related costs associated with the write-off of property and equipment and inventory and early lease termination costs.
The current year severance related costs are primarily comprised of severance pay for employees being terminated due to the transition of activities out of Rofin including change of control payments to Rofin officers and the exit from certain product lines as well as the consolidation of sales and distribution offices. The current year asset write-offs are primarily comprised of write-offs of inventory and equipment due to exiting our legacy high power fiber laser product line and inventory write-offs due to the exit of other Rofin product lines. We plan to continue additional restructuring activities in fiscal 2018 related to our acquisition of Rofin.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Environmental regulation
Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated materials, chemicals, various radioactive materials and certain waste products. In the United States, we are subject to the federal regulation and control of the Environmental Protection Agency. Comparable authorities are involved in other countries. Such rules are subject to change by the governing agency and we monitor those 
 17

changes closely. We expect all operations to meet the legal and regulatory environmental requirements and believe that compliance with those regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive and financial position.
Although we believe that our safety procedures for using, handling, storing and disposing of such materials comply with the standards required by federal and state laws and regulations, we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of such an accident involving such materials, we could be liable for damages and such liability could exceed the amount of our liability insurance coverage and the resources of our business.
We face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations due to the evolving nature of environmental compliance regulations and standards, as well as specific customer compliance requirements. These regulations and standards have an impact on the material composition of our products entering specific markets. Such legislation has gone into effect at various time across the worldwide markets. For example, in the European Union ("EU"), the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) went into effect in 2006, and was subsequently revised in 2011 and again in 2015 (as RoHS 2). Another material revision will be in effect in 2019. The Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) went into effect in 2007, and is amended with additional substances every 6 months. China enacted the Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products Regulation (China-RoHS) in 2007, which was revised and renamed in 2016 as the Administrative Measures for the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products (known as China RoHS 2). Another example is the US Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Conflict Minerals Act) which requires manufacturers to provide disclosures about the use of specified conflict minerals emanating from the DRC and nine adjoining countries (Covered Countries). In addition to these regulations and directives, we may face costs and liabilities in connection with product take-back legislation. For example, beginning in 2006 (with several subsequent revisions), the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive 2012/19/EU made producers of electrical goods financially responsible for specified collection, recycling, treatment and disposal of past and future covered products. Similar laws are now pending in various jurisdictions around the world, including the United States.
Environmental liabilities
Our operations are subject to various laws and regulations governing the environment, including the discharge of pollutants and the management and disposal of hazardous substances. As a result of our historic as well as on-going operations, we could incur substantial costs, including remediation costs. The costs under environmental laws and the timing of these costs are difficult to predict. Our accruals for such costs and liabilities may not be adequate because the estimates on which the accruals are based depend on a number of factors including the nature of the matter, the complexity of the site, site geology, the nature and extent of contamination, the type of remedy, the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies and other Potentially Responsible Parties (PRPs) at multi-party sites and the number and financial viability of other PRPs.
We further discuss the impact of environmental regulation under "Risk Factors" in Item 1A — "Compliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense."
Regulatory Compliance
Certain of our lasers sold in the United States are classified as Class IV Laser Products under the applicable rules and regulations of the Center for Devices and Radiological Health ("CDRH") of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). A similar classification system is applied in the European markets. 
CDRH regulations require a self-certification procedure pursuant to which a manufacturer must submit a filing to the CDRH with respect to each product incorporating a laser device, make periodic reports of sales and purchases and comply with product labeling standards, product safety and design features and informational requirements. The CDRH is empowered to seek fines and other remedies for violations of their requirements. We believe that our products are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to the manufacture of laser devices.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
As a result of the acquisition of Rofin in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we reorganized our prior two reporting segments (Specialty Laser Systems and Commercial Lasers and Components) into two new reporting segments for the combined company based upon the organizational structure of the combined company and how the chief operating decision maker ("CODM") receives and utilizes information provided to allocate resources and make decisions: OEM Laser Sources (“OLS”) and Industrial Lasers & Systems (“ILS”). Accordingly, our segment information was restated retroactively for all periods presented. This segmentation reflects the go-to-market strategies and synergies for our broad portfolio of laser technologies and products. While both segments deliver cost-effective, highly reliable photonics solutions, the OLS business segment is focused on high performance laser sources and complex optical sub-systems, typically used in microelectronics manufacturing, medical 
 18

diagnostics and therapeutic medical applications, as well as in scientific research. Our ILS business segment delivers high performance laser sources, sub-systems and tools primarily used for industrial laser materials processing, serving important end markets like automotive, machine tool, consumer goods and medical device manufacturing. Rofin's operating results have been included primarily in our Industrial Lasers & Systems segment.
We have identified OLS and ILS as operating segments for which discrete financial information was available. Both units have dedicated engineering, manufacturing, product business management and product line management functions. A small portion of our outside revenue is attributable to projects and recently developed products for which a segment has not yet been determined. The associated direct and indirect costs are presented in the category of Corporate and other, along with other corporate costs.
FINANCIAL INFORMATION ABOUT FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES
Financial information relating to foreign and domestic operations for fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, is set forth in Note 15, "Segment and Geographic Information" of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 15 of this annual report.
