Item 1. Business
Worldpay, Inc., formerly Vantiv, Inc., a Delaware corporation, is a holding company that conducts its operations through its majority-owned subsidiary, Vantiv Holding, LLC (“Vantiv Holding”). Worldpay, Inc., Vantiv Holding and their subsidiaries are referred to collectively as the “Company,” “Worldpay,” “we,” “us” or “our,” unless the context requires otherwise.
Recent Acquisition
On January 16, 2018, we completed the previously announced acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of Worldpay Group Limited, formerly Worldpay Group plc, a public limited company (“Legacy Worldpay”). Following the acquisition, we changed our name from “Vantiv, Inc.” to “Worldpay, Inc.” (“Worldpay”), by amending our Second Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation. The effective date of the name change was January 16, 2018.
Business and Client Description
Worldpay is a leading payment processor differentiated by a technology platform in the U.S., breadth of distribution and superior cost structure. According to the Nilson Report, we are the largest merchant acquirer and the largest PIN debit acquirer by number of transactions in the United States. Our U.S. technology platform is differentiated from our competitors’ multiple platform architectures. It enables us to efficiently provide a comprehensive suite of services to merchants and financial institutions of all sizes as well as to innovate, develop and deploy new services, while providing us with significant economies of scale. Our broad and varied distribution includes multiple sales channels, such as our direct and indirect sales forces and referral partner relationships, which provide us with a growing and diverse client base of merchants and financial institutions. We believe this combination of attributes provides us with competitive advantages that generate strong growth and profitability by enabling us to efficiently manage, update and maintain our technology, to utilize technology integration and value-added services to expand our new sales and distribution, and to realize significant operating leverage.
We offer a broad suite of payment processing services that enable our clients to meet their payment processing needs through a single provider, including in omni-channel environments that span point-of-sale, ecommerce and mobile devices. We enable merchants of all sizes to accept and process credit, debit and prepaid payments and provide them supporting value-added services, such as security solutions and fraud management, information solutions, and interchange management. We also provide mission critical payment services to financial institutions, such as card issuer processing, payment network processing, fraud protection, card production, prepaid program management, ATM driving and network gateway and switching services that utilize our proprietary Jeanie PIN debit payment network. 
Merchant Services
We have a broad and diversified merchant client base. Our merchant client base includes merchant locations across the United States. In 2017, we processed approximately 23 billion transactions for these merchants. Our merchant client base has low client concentration and is heavily weighted in non-discretionary everyday spend categories, such as grocery and pharmacy, and includes large national retailers, including eleven of the top 25 national retailers by revenue in 2016. We provide a comprehensive suite of payment processing services to our merchant services clients. We authorize, clear, settle and provide reporting for electronic payment transactions, as further discussed below.
Acquiring and Processing. We provide merchants with a broad range of credit, debit and prepaid payment processing services. We give them the ability to accept and process Visa, Mastercard, American Express, Discover and PIN debit network card transactions originated at the point of sale as well as for ecommerce and mobile transactions. This service includes all aspects of card processing, including authorization and settlement, customer service, chargeback and retrieval processing and network fee and interchange management. 
Value-added Services. We offer value-added services that help our clients operate and manage their businesses including omni-channel acceptance, prepaid services and gift card solutions. We also provide security solutions such as point-to-point encryption and tokenization both at the point of sale and for ecommerce transactions.
4
Financial Institution Services
Our financial institution client base is also generally well diversified and includes regional banks, community banks, credit unions and regional PIN debit networks. In 2017, we processed approximately 3.5 billion transactions for these financial institutions. We generally focus on small to mid-sized institutions with less than $15 billion in assets. Smaller financial institutions generally do not have the scale or infrastructure typical of large institutions and are more likely to outsource their payment processing needs. We provide integrated card issuer processing, payment network processing and value-added services to our financial institutions clients. These services are discussed further below.
Integrated Card Issuer and Processing. We process and service credit, debit, ATM and prepaid transactions. We process and provide statement production, collections and inbound/outbound call centers. Our card processing solution includes processing and other services such as card portfolio analytics, program strategy and support, fraud and security management and chargeback and dispute services. We provide authorization support in the form of online or batch settlement, as well as real-time transaction research capability and archiving and daily and monthly cardholder reports for statistical analysis.
Value-added Services. We provide additional services to our financial institution clients that complement our issuing and processing services. These services include fraud protection, card production, prepaid cards, ATM driving, portfolio optimization, data analytics and card program marketing. We also provide network gateway and switching services that utilize our Jeanie PIN network. Our Jeanie network offers real-time electronic payment, network bill payment, single point settlement, shared deposit taking and customer select PINs. 
Technology Platform
Our U.S. technology platform provides our merchant and financial institution clients with differentiated payment processing solutions and provides us with significant strategic and operational benefits. Small and mid-sized merchants are able to easily connect to our U.S. technology platform using our application process interfaces, or APIs, software development kits, or SDKs, and other tools we make available to technology partners, which we believe enhances our capacity to sell to such merchants. Our U.S. technology platform allows us to collect, manage and analyze data across both our Merchant Services and our Financial Institution Services segments that we can then package into information solutions for our clients. It provides insight into market trends and opportunities as they emerge, which enhances our ability to innovate and develop new value-added services, including security solutions and fraud management, and it allows us to easily deploy new solutions that span the payment processing value chain, such as ecommerce and mobile services, which are high growth market opportunities. It is highly scalable, which enables us to efficiently manage, update and maintain our technology, increase capacity and speed, and realize significant operating leverage. We believe our U.S. technology platform is a key differentiator from payment processors that operate on multiple technology platforms and provides us with a significant competitive advantage.
Sales and Marketing
Our U.S. technology platform enables us to provide a comprehensive suite of services to merchants and financial institutions of all sizes. We distribute our services through multiple sales channels that enable us to efficiently and effectively target a growing and diverse client base of merchants and financial institutions. Our sales channels include direct and indirect sales forces as well as referral partner relationships within our Merchant Services and Financial Institution Services segments as described below.
Merchant Services. We distribute our comprehensive suite of services to a broad range of merchants, including large, mid-sized and small merchants, through multiple sales channels as further discussed below.

• | Direct: Includes a national sales force that targets large national merchants, a regional and mid-market sales team that sells solutions to merchants and third-party reseller clients, and a telesales operation that targets small and mid-sized merchants.


• | Indirect: Includes Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) that target small and mid-sized merchants.


• | Merchant Bank: Includes referral partner relationships with financial institutions that target their financial services customers as merchant referrals to us.


• | Integrated Payments (IP): Includes referral partner relationships with independent software vendors (ISVs), value-added resellers (VARs), and payment facilitators that target their technology customers as merchant referrals to us.


• | eCommerce: Includes a sales force that targets internet retail, online services and direct marketing merchants.

 These sales channels utilize multiple strategies and leverage relationships with referral partners that sell our solutions to small and mid-sized merchants. We offer certain of our services on a white-label basis which enables them to be marketed 
5
under our partners' brand. We select referral partners that enhance our distribution and augment our services with complimentary offerings. We believe our sales structure provides us with broad geographic coverage and access to various industries and verticals.
Financial Institution Services. We distribute our services by utilizing direct sales forces as well as a diverse group of referral partner relationships. These sales channels utilize multiple strategies and leverage relationships with core processors that sell our solutions to small and mid-sized financial institutions. We offer certain of our services on a white-label basis which enables them to be marketed under our client’s brand. We select resellers that enhance our distribution and augment our services with complementary offerings. Our relationships with core processors are necessary for developing the processing environments required by our financial institution clients. Many of our core processing relationships are non-contractual and continue for so long as an interface between us and the core processor is needed to accommodate one or more common financial institution customers.
Our sales teams in both Merchant Services and Financial Institution Services are paid a combination of base salary and commission. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 1,000 full-time employees participating in sales and marketing, including sales support personnel. Commissions paid to our sales force are based upon a percentage of revenue from new business and cross-selling to existing clients. Residual payments to our referral partners are based upon a percentage of revenues earned from referred business. For the year ended December 31, 2017, combined sales force commissions and residual payments represent approximately 79% of total sales and marketing expenses, or $528.0 million.
Our History
We have a 40 year history of providing payment processing services. We operated as a business unit of Fifth Third Bank (“Fifth Third”) until June 2009 when we separated as a stand-alone company, established our own organization, headquarters, brand, growth strategy and completed our initial public offering (“IPO”) in March 2012.
As a result of us acquiring Legacy Worldpay on January 16, 2018, below is a description of Legacy Worldpay’s business as well as the rationale for the acquisition.
Legacy Worldpay Business Description
Legacy Worldpay is a leader in global payments. Legacy Worldpay provides a broad range of technology-led solutions to its merchant customers to allow them to accept payments of almost any type, across multiple payment channels, nearly anywhere in the world. The fast growth of eCommerce and its increasingly international nature is making payments more complex for merchants in a number of ways, including in complying with local market regulations and practices, in minimizing the costs inherent in cross-border trade, in managing cash flows and reporting in many different currencies, in taking a large number of different payment types, and in dealing with greater threats of fraud.
Legacy Worldpay is one of the few global businesses able to address these complexities. It does so by offering functionality in most aspects of payment acceptance, whether in-store, online or on a mobile device, and granting access to a global payments network through an agile, integrated, secure, reliable and highly scalable proprietary global payments platform. Legacy Worldpay deploys this platform to optimize business outcomes for its customers, including by providing for acceptance of a greater number of payment types and opening access to new geographic markets, enabling its customers to reduce the chances of losing a potential sale, allowing them to get a single view of key customer data, and increasing transaction acceptance while protecting against fraud. Legacy Worldpay can also leverage the data gained as a result of its core payment solutions to offer payment analytics, insights on peers, industry benchmarking and additional functionality to its customers, allowing them to, for example, run loyalty schemes, guide their consumers to preferred payment types and improve their performance.
Legacy Worldpay serves a diverse set of merchants across a variety of end-markets, sizes and geographies. Globally, Legacy Worldpay also partners with innovative and fast-growing eCommerce businesses including many of the world’s most renowned and dynamic online brands.
Legacy Worldpay serves its customers through:

• | Global eCom - Global eCom provides a wide range of online and mobile multi-currency payment acceptance, validation and settlement services for its customer which include large and fast growing Internet-led multinationals. The vast majority of Global eCom’s customers sit within five priority industry verticals: Digital Content, Global Retail, Airlines, Regulated Gambling and Travel.

6

• | Traditional Merchant - Legacy Worldpay serves a broad and diversified group of merchants. Legacy Worldpay’s client base primarily consists of merchant locations in the United Kingdom and the United States. Legacy Worldpay provides a comprehensive set of payment processing services to their merchants.

Our acquisition of Legacy Worldpay is consistent with our strategy of investing in high growth segments of the payments market. Legacy Worldpay is a leader in the fast growing global and cross-border eCommerce segments. By combining with Legacy Worldpay, we have expanded from our number one position in the U.S. to become the number one global acquirer with leading global and cross-border eCommerce capabilities. Together, we will be uniquely positioned to become a global payment solutions provider, powering integrated omni-commerce worldwide. 
Industry Background
Electronic Payments
Electronic payments in the United States have evolved into a large and growing market with favorable secular trends that continue to increase the adoption and use of card-based payment services, such as those for credit, debit and prepaid cards. 
This growth is driven by the shift from cash and checks towards card-based and other electronic forms of payment due to their greater convenience, security, enhanced services and rewards and loyalty features. We believe changing demographics and emerging trends, such as the adoption of new technologies and business models, including ecommerce, mobile commerce and prepaid services, will also continue to drive growth in electronic payments.
Payment Processing Industry
The payment processing industry is comprised of various processors that create and manage the technology infrastructure that enables electronic payments. Payment processors help merchants and financial institutions develop and offer electronic payment solutions to their customers, facilitate the routing and processing of electronic payment transactions and manage a range of supporting security, value-added and back office services. In addition, many large banks manage and process their card accounts in-house. This is collectively referred to as the payment processing value chain.
Many payment processors specialize in providing services in discrete areas of the payment processing value chain, which can result in merchants and financial institutions using payment processing services from multiple providers. A limited number of payment processors have capabilities or offer services in multiple parts of the payment processing value chain. We provide solutions across the payment processing value chain as a merchant acquirer, payment network, and as an issuer processor, primarily by utilizing our U.S. technology platform to enable our clients to easily access a broad range of payment processing services as illustrated below:
The payment processing value chain encompasses three key types of processing:

• | Merchant Acquiring Processing. Merchant acquiring processors sell electronic payment acceptance, processing and supporting services to merchants and third-party resellers. These processors route transactions originated by 

7
consumer transactions with the merchant, including in omni-channel environments that span point-of-sale, ecommerce and mobile devices, to the appropriate payment networks for authorization, known as “front-end” processing, and then ensure that each transaction is appropriately cleared and settled into the merchant’s bank account, known as “back-end” processing. Many of these processors also provide specialized reporting, back office support, risk management and other value-added services to merchants. Merchant acquirers charge merchants based on a percentage of the value of each transaction or on a per transaction basis. Merchant acquirers pay the payment network processors a routing fee per transaction and pass through interchange fees to the issuing financial institution.

• | Payment Network Processing. Payment network processors, such as Visa, Mastercard and PIN debit payment networks, sell electronic payment network routing and support services to financial institutions that issue cards and merchant acquirers that provide transaction processing. Depending on their market position and network capabilities, these providers route credit, debit and prepaid card transactions from merchant acquiring processors to the financial institution that issued the card, and they ensure that the financial institution’s authorization approvals are routed back to the merchant acquiring processor and that transactions are appropriately settled between the merchant’s bank and the card-issuing financial institution. These providers also provide specialized risk management and other value-added services to financial institutions. Payment networks charge merchant acquiring processors and issuing financial institutions routing fees per transaction and monthly or annual maintenance fees and assessments. 


• | Issuer Card Processing. Issuer card processors sell electronic payment issuing, processing and supporting services to financial institutions. These providers authorize transactions received from the payment networks and ensure that each transaction is appropriately cleared and settled from the originating card account. These companies also provide specialized program management, reporting, outsourced customer service, back office support, risk management and other value-added services to financial institutions. Card processors charge issuing financial institutions fees based on the number of transactions processed and the number of cards that are managed. 

Emerging Trends and Opportunities in the Payment Processing Industry
The payment processing industry will continue to adopt new technologies, develop new products and services, evolve new business models and experience new market entrants and changes in the regulatory environment. In the near-term, as merchants and financial institutions seek services that help them enhance their own offerings to consumers, including acceptance and issuance of Europay-Mastercard-Visa (EMV) chip-based cards, other security and fraud management services, information services, and support for omni-commerce environments, we believe that payment processors may seek to develop additional capabilities and expand across the payment processing value chain to meet these demands and capture additional data and provide additional value per transaction. To facilitate this expansion and deliver more robust service offerings, we believe that payment processors will need to develop greater control over and integration of their technology platforms, to enable them to deliver and differentiate their offerings from other providers.
We believe that emerging, alternative electronic payment technologies will be adopted by merchants and other businesses. As a result, non-financial institution enterprises, such as mobile payment providers, internet, retail and social media companies, could become more active participants in the development of these alternative electronic payment technologies and facilitate the convergence of retail, online, mobile and social commerce applications, representing an attractive growth opportunity for the industry. We believe that payment processors that have an integrated business, provide solutions across the payment processing value chain and utilize broad distribution capabilities will be best positioned to provide processing services for emerging alternative electronic payment technologies and to successfully partner with new market entrants.

Competition
Merchant Services
Our competitors include financial institutions and well-established payment processing companies, including Bank of America Merchant Services, Chase Paymentech Solutions, Elavon Inc. (a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp), First Data Corporation, Global Payments, Inc., and Total System Services, Inc. in our Merchant Services segment. Furthermore, we are facing new competitive pressure from non-traditional payments processors and other parties entering the payments industry, such as PayPal, Google, Apple, Alibaba, Amazon, Square, Stripe and Adyen who may compete in one or more of the functions performed in processing merchant transactions. The most significant competitive factors in this segment are price, breadth of features and functionality, data security, system performance and reliability, scalability, service capability and brand.
Financial Institution Services
In our Financial Institution Services segment, competitors include Fidelity National Information Services, Inc., First Data Corporation, Fiserv, Inc., Total System Services, Inc. and Visa Debit Processing Service. In addition to competition with direct competitors, we also compete with the capabilities of many larger potential clients to conduct their key payment processing applications in-house. The most significant competitive factors in this segment are price, system performance and reliability, breadth of services and functionality, data security, scalability, flexibility of infrastructure and servicing capability.
Our Strategy
We plan to grow our business over the course of the next few years, depending on market conditions, by continuing to execute on the following four key strategies:

• | Invest in and leverage our integrated business model and technology platform to strengthen and protect our core business;


• | Broaden and deepen our distribution channels to grow our merchant and financial institutions client base;


• | Differentiate through value-added services that address evolving client demands and provide additional cross-selling opportunities, including security and fraud management, information services, ease of connection and delivery, and support for omni-channel environments; and


• | Enter new geographic markets through strategic partnerships or acquisitions that enhance our distribution channels, client base, and service capabilities.

Refer to “Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for more details.
Regulation
The financial services regulatory regime affects our operations and costs. The financial services industry is highly regulated under U.S. and non-U.S. law. Federal, state, local and foreign statutes, regulations, policies and guidance are continually under review by governmental authorities. Changes in the regulatory regime, including changes in how they are interpreted, implemented or enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business. Violations or perceived weaknesses in compliance or internal controls may result in civil or criminal enforcement action; suspension or revocation of licenses or registrations; limitation, suspension or termination of services; civil or criminal penalties, such as fines; and reputational harm. In addition to governmental regulation, certain of our services are subject to rules set by various payment networks, such as Visa and Mastercard. Many of these aspects of the regulatory regime are described in more detail below.
Licensing and Registration in Multiple Jurisdictions
Our regulatory environment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. In some U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions, we are required to obtain and maintain various licenses and registrations to conduct our business. For example, in the United States, we are authorized in multiple U.S. states to engage in debt administration and debt collection activities on behalf of some of our card issuing financial institution clients through calls and letters to the debtors in those states. Our international operations and subsidiaries are subject to a range of licensing, registration and regulatory requirements under U.K., Dutch, European Union and other non-U.S. regulatory regimes. We may seek, or be required to obtain, licenses or registrations in other jurisdictions based on changes in our business or the applicable regulatory regime.
As a licensed or registered provider of financial services, we are subject to the exercise of discretionary supervisory, regulatory and enforcement powers by numerous U.S. and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Licensing and regulatory authorities can require, among other things, the provision of detailed information covering our management, business plan, products and services, compliance, internal controls, ownership structure and financial performance. Regulators and other governmental authorities have a range of enforcement powers in the event that we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations or do not meet their guidance or supervisory expectations. 
Dodd-Frank Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act) made significant structural and other changes to the regulation of the U.S. financial services industry. Those changes included important provisions affecting credit card and debit transactions.
The Dodd-Frank Act allows merchants to set minimum dollar amounts (not to exceed $10) for the acceptance of a credit card (and allows federal governmental entities and institutions of higher education to set maximum amounts for the acceptance of credit cards). The Dodd-Frank Act also allows merchants to provide discounts or incentives to entice consumers to pay with cash, checks, debit cards or credit cards, as the merchant prefers. 
In addition, the “Durbin Amendment” to the Dodd-Frank Act provided that interchange fees that a card issuer or payment network receives or charges for debit transactions are now regulated by the Federal Reserve and must be “reasonable 
10
and proportional” to the cost incurred by the card issuer in authorizing, clearing and settling the transaction. The Durbin Amendment also contains prohibitions on network exclusivity and merchant routing restrictions.
Consumer Protection Laws and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
Our business is subject to a wide range of consumer protection laws. For example, we are also subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and similar state laws in connection with our credit card processing business. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to regulate consumer financial services, including many of the types of services offered by our clients. We are subject to regulation and enforcement by the CFPB because we are a service provider to insured depository institutions with assets of $10 billion or more in connection with their consumer financial products and to entities that are larger participants in markets for consumer financial products and services such as prepaid cards. CFPB rules, examinations and enforcement actions may require us to adjust our activities and may increase our compliance costs. In addition to rulemaking authority over several enumerated federal consumer financial protection laws, the CFPB is authorized to issue rules prohibiting unfair, deceptive or abusive acts or practices by persons offering consumer financial products or services and those, such as us, who are service providers to such persons, and has authority to enforce these consumer financial protection laws and CFPB rules.
Banking Regulation
Although we are not a bank, the U.S. bank regulatory regime affects our business because we provide services to banks. Banking regulators are authorized to examine, supervise and bring enforcement action against nonbank companies that perform services for U.S. banks. Because we provide data processing and other services to U.S. banks and financial institutions, we are subject to regular oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC). The FFIEC is an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (Federal Reserve), the National Credit Union Administration and the CFPB. We are also subject to review under state laws and rules governing the provision of services to U.S. banks and other financial institutions, including electronic data processing, back-office services, and use of consumer information. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients’ auditors and regulators. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to meet supervisory expectations, may result in adverse action against us by regulators or by the financial institutions to which we provide services.
Our business may also be affected by banking regulation because Fifth Third Bank is an investor in us. Fifth Third Bank is a state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve System. Fifth Third Bank is regulated, examined and supervised by the Ohio Division of Financial Institutions (ODFI) and the Federal Reserve. Fifth Third Bank is an indirect subsidiary of Fifth Third Bancorp, which is a bank holding company regulated, examined and supervised by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (BHC Act). Depending on the facts and circumstances, a company in which a bank or bank holding company owns equity securities may be subject to banking regulation, supervision, examination and enforcement.
Following our acquisition of Legacy Worldpay, Fifth Third Bank owns less than 5% of our voting securities. At this ownership level, Fifth Third Bank is presumed not to "control" us under the statutory terms of the BHC Act. Neither the ODFI nor the Federal Reserve required us to obtain any approval, or otherwise acted to prevent, our acquisition of Legacy Worldpay. Nevertheless, in the future or in connection with other initiatives, the ODFI or Federal Reserve could assert that Fifth Third Bank's investment in, or other relationships with, us impose limitations, conditions or approval requirements under banking laws that affect our activities, investments or acquisitions. The imposition of such limitations, conditions or approval requirements could have an adverse impact on our business, such as by preventing us from pursuing an otherwise attractive acquisition or business opportunity. 
In connection with our acquisition of Legacy Worldpay, we agreed with Fifth Third Bank and Fifth Third Bancorp to amend the prior framework by which we would address such circumstances. That agreed framework is set forth in the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of Vantiv Holding, LLC, as amended by that certain Transaction Agreement, dated August 7, 2017, by and among the Company, Vantiv Holding, Fifth Third Bank and Fifth Third Bancorp (the Vantiv Holding LLC Agreement). Among other things, we must notify Fifth Third Bank before we engage in any business activity (by acquisition, investment, organic growth or otherwise) that may reasonably require Fifth Third Bank or an affiliate of Fifth Third Bank to obtain regulatory approval, so that Fifth Third Bank can consider the legal permissibility of the activity and any required regulatory approvals, and we and Fifth Third Bank must use our respective reasonable best efforts to obtain any such regulatory approvals if we determine to pursue the business activity. The Vantiv Holding LLC Agreement also includes provisions to address circumstances where any such required regulatory approval is not obtained.
11
Association and Network Rules
We are subject to the network rules of Visa, Mastercard and other payment networks. The payment networks routinely update and modify their requirements. On occasion, we have received notices of non-compliance and fines, which have typically related to excessive chargebacks by a merchant or data security failures. Although these network rules are not government regulations, our failure to comply with the networks’ requirements or to pay the fines they impose could cause the termination of our registration and require us to stop providing payment processing services.
Privacy and Information Security Regulations
We provide services that may be subject to privacy laws and regulations of a variety of U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions. These laws and regulations restrict the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information, require notice to individuals of privacy practices and provide individuals with certain rights to prevent the use and disclosure of protected information. These laws also impose requirements for safeguarding and proper destruction of personal information through the issuance of data security standards or guidelines. For example, relevant U.S. federal privacy laws include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999, which applies directly to a broad range of financial institutions and indirectly, or in some instances directly, to companies that provide services to financial institutions. In addition, there are state laws restricting the ability to collect and utilize certain types of information such as Social Security and driver’s license numbers. U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws also impose privacy and data security requirements, which can include obligations to provide notification of security breaches of computer databases that contain personal information to affected individuals, officers and consumer reporting agencies and businesses and governmental agencies that own data.
Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorist Regulation
Our business is subject to U.S. and non-U.S. laws governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing. For example, U.S. federal anti-money laundering laws include the Bank Secrecy Act, as amended by the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, which we refer to collectively as the BSA. The BSA requires, among other things, money services businesses to develop and implement risk-based anti-money laundering programs, report large cash transactions and suspicious activity and maintain transaction records. We are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, that prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments and, in certain circumstances, their nationals, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations, as well as similar anti-money laundering, counter terrorist financing and proceeds of crime laws applicable to movements of currency and payments through electronic transactions and to dealings with certain specified persons. We continually develop new compliance programs and enhance existing ones to monitor and address legal and regulatory requirements and developments, including with respect to anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing.
Federal Trade Commission Act and Other Laws Impacting Our and our Customers’ Business
All persons engaged in commerce, including, but not limited to, us and our merchant and financial institution customers are subject to Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act prohibiting unfair or deceptive acts or practices, or UDAP.  In addition, there are other laws, rules and or regulations, including the Telemarketing Sales Act and the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006, that may directly impact the activities of our merchant customers and in some cases may subject us, as the merchant’s payment processor, to litigation, investigations, fees, fines and disgorgement of funds in the event we are deemed to have aided and abetted or otherwise provided the means and instrumentalities to facilitate the illegal activities of the merchant through our payment processing services. Various federal and state regulatory enforcement agencies including the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, and the states’ attorneys general have authority to take action against nonbanks that engage in UDAP or violate other laws, rules and regulations.
Prepaid Services
Prepaid card programs managed by us are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations, which may include laws and regulations related to consumer and data protection, licensing, consumer disclosures, escheat, anti-money laundering, banking, trade practices and competition and wage and employment. For example, most states require entities engaged in money transmission in connection with the sale of prepaid cards to be licensed as a money transmitter with, and subject to examination by, that jurisdiction’s banking department. In the future, we may have to obtain state licenses to expand our distribution network for prepaid cards, which licenses we may not be able to obtain. Furthermore, the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 and the Federal Reserve’s Regulation E impose requirements on general-use prepaid cards, store gift cards and electronic gift certificates. These laws and regulations are sometimes inconsistent 
12
and subject to judicial and regulatory challenge and interpretation, and therefore the extent to which these laws and rules have application to, and their impact on, us, financial institutions, merchants or others could change. Prepaid services may also be subject to the rules and regulations of Visa, Mastercard and other payment networks with which we and the card issuers do business. The programs in place to process these products generally may be modified by the payment networks in their discretion and such modifications could also impact us, financial institutions, merchants and others. We are also registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the U.S. Department of the Treasury, or FinCEN, as a “money services business-provider of prepaid access.”
Other
We are subject to the Housing Assistance Tax Act of 2008, which requires information returns to be made for each calendar year by merchant acquiring entities. In addition, we are subject to U.S. federal and state unclaimed or abandoned property (escheat) laws in the United States which require us to turn over to certain government authorities the property of others we hold that has been unclaimed for a specified period of time such as account balances that are due to a merchant following discontinuation of its relationship with us.
The foregoing list of laws and regulations to which we are subject is not exhaustive, and the regulatory framework governing our operations changes continuously. The enactment of new laws and regulations may increasingly affect the operation of our business, directly and indirectly, which could result in substantial regulatory compliance costs, litigation expense, adverse publicity, the loss of revenue and decreased profitability.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of intellectual property laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We have registered, and applied for the registration of, U.S. and international trademarks, service marks, and domain names. Additionally, we own U.S. patents and have filed U.S. patent applications covering certain of our proprietary technology relating to payment solutions, transaction processing and other matters. Over time, we have assembled and continue to assemble a portfolio of patents, trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain names and trade secrets covering our products and services. Intellectual property is a component of our ability to be a leading payment services provider and any significant impairment of, or third-party claim against, our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 3,661 employees. As of December 31, 2017, this included 928 Merchant Services employees, 85 Financial Institution Services employees, 931 IT employees, 1,117 Operations employees, and 600 general and administrative employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
