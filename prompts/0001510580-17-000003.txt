Overview
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel cancer immunotherapy products designed to harness the power of a patient’s own immune system to target and kill cancer cells. We do this using our engineered autologous cell therapy, which we believe is a transformational approach to the treatment of cancer. Our therapy involves modifying a patient’s T cells outside the patient’s body, or ex vivo, causing the T cells to express chimeric antigen receptors, or CARs, or T cell receptors, or TCRs, and then reinfusing the engineered T cells back into the patient. CARs can recognize native cancer antigens that are part of an intact protein presented on the cancer cell surface. TCRs broaden the therapeutic approach by recognizing fragments on the cancer cell surface derived from intracellular proteins. By combining both CAR and TCR approaches, we have generated and advanced a broad portfolio of product candidates to target both solid and hematological tumors.
Our lead product candidate, KTE-C19, is a CAR-based therapy that targets the CD19 antigen, a protein expressed on the cell surface of B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. Since the second half of 2015, we have been conducting a registrational Phase 2 clinical trial (ZUMA-1) of KTE-C19 in patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive diffuse large B cell lymphoma, or DLBCL, primary mediastinal B cell lymphoma, or PMBCL, or transformed follicular lymphoma, or TFL. DLBCL, PMBCL and TFL are types of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma, or NHL. We recently announced results from the primary analysis of this clinical trial. As further described below under "Recent Developments," KTE-C19 met the primary endpoint of objective response rate, or ORR, p <0.0001, with an ORR of 82%.
Based on the results from the primary analysis of ZUMA-1, we plan to submit a Biologics License Application, or BLA, in the first quarter of 2017 to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the accelerated approval of KTE-C19 as a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL, who are ineligible for autologous stem cell transplant, or ASCT. We plan to commercially launch KTE-C19 in 2017, if approved. The United States Adopted Name, or USAN, for KTE-C19 is axicabtagene ciloleucel.
We are conducting other clinical studies of KTE-C19 for additional hematological indications. We are also advancing other CAR- and TCR-based product candidates, including KITE-718, a TCR-based therapy targeting a MAGE A3/A6 antigen for the treatment of MAGE A3/A6 positive cancers including non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, and bladder cancer. We filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of KITE-718 at the end of 2016 and plan to open the clinical trial for patient enrollment in the first half of 2017.
Our Pipeline
Our clinical trials and those being conducted with our collaborators, the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, and Amgen Inc., or Amgen, are summarized below. Other than for KTE-C19 and KITE-718, the NCI filed INDs with the FDA in order to conduct ongoing clinical trials of CAR- and TCR-based product candidates. As a result, we will have to submit separate INDs to conduct our own clinical trials relating to the product candidates in clinical trials at the NCI.

Recent Developments
ZUMA-1 Primary Analysis of KTE-C19
On February 28, 2017, we announced positive data from the primary analysis of ZUMA-1. The study met the primary endpoint of ORR, p<0.0001, with an ORR of 82% recorded after a single infusion of KTE-C19. 
ZUMA-1 Phase 2 enrolled patients with chemorefractory aggressive NHL into two cohorts. The first cohort included patients with DLBCL, and the second cohort enrolled patients with TFL and PMBCL. The primary analysis was planned to include 72 patients with DLBCL from the first cohort and 20 patients with PMBCL or TFL from the second cohort with at least six months of follow-up. Since an additional nine patients were enrolled but not dosed with KTE-C19 at the time the 92nd patient was treated, these additional patients were treated in ZUMA-1 and included in safety and efficacy results. The table below summarizes the response rates, ORR and rate of complete response, or CR, from the 101 treated patients.

 | DLBCL (n=77) | TFL/PMBCL (n=24) | Combined (n=101)
 | ORR (%) | CR (%) | ORR (%) | CR (%) | ORR (%) | CR (%)
ORR | 82 | 49 | 83 | 71 | 82 | 54 
Month 6 | 36 | 31 | 54 | 50 | 41 | 36 

At month 6, five of the 101 patients continued to experience highly significant and durable partial responses, or PRs, with minimal abnormalities in positron emission tomography, or PET, scans. One of these PRs converted to a CR at month 9. 
Four of the 101 patients in ongoing CR did not have a month 6 tumor assessment prior to the data cut-off and are therefore categorized as non-responders for month 6 in the table above. These patients have an opportunity to be counted as a month 6 CR in a follow-up analysis, which may increase the month 6 response and month 6 CR rate. 
With a median follow-up of 8.7 months for this primary analysis, the median overall survival has not yet been reached. Findings from SCHOLAR-1 (Retrospective Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Research), showed that in a similar patient population, median overall survival was 6.6 months.
The most common grade 3 or higher adverse events included anemia (43%), neutropenia (39%), decreased neutrophil count (32%), febrile neutropenia (31%), decreased white blood cell count (29%), thrombocytopenia (24%), encephalopathy (21%) and decreased lymphocyte count (20%). As compared to the interim analysis, grade 3 or higher cytokine release syndrome, or CRS, decreased from 18% to 13% and neurologic events decreased from 34% to 28%. There were no cases of cerebral edema. 
6

As previously reported at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, Annual Meeting in 2016, there were three deaths not due to disease progression in the study. Two events, one hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and one cardiac arrest in the setting of CRS, were deemed related to KTE-C19. The third case, a pulmonary embolism, was deemed unrelated. Between the interim analysis that included 62 patients, and this primary analysis which now includes all 101 patients, there were no additional deaths due to adverse events. 
2017 American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation Meeting
On February 26, 2017, Dr. James N. Kochenderfer, M.D., an investigator in the Experimental Transplantation and Immunology Branch of the NCI Center for Cancer Research, presented results from two NCI clinical trials funded pursuant to our CRADAs at the 2017 American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation Meeting. 
The first study involved 22 patients with relapsed/refractory NHL who received a single dose of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy after a low-dose, optimized chemotherapy conditioning regimen of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine. Objective responses were seen in 73% of patients, and CRs were observed in 55% of patients. Overall, duration of response ranged from seven months to 24+ months, and 11 of the 12 CRs were ongoing. Reversible grade 3 or 4 neurologic events, including confusion, dysphasia, encephalopathy, and gait disturbances, were observed in 55% of treated patients. 
In the second study, of a fully-human anti-CD19 CAR T cell, 12 patients with relapsed/refractory NHL received low-dose chemotherapy followed by administration of the engineered CAR T cells. Repeat doses of CAR T cells were administered to patients who achieved stable disease or partial response to the first infusion. Objective responses were seen in 75% of patients, and CRs were observed in 50% of patients. Duration of CRs ranged from two to 8+ months. Reversible grade 3 adverse events included CRS and were observed in 25% of patients, and one of 12 patients experienced grade 3 or 4 neurologic events. 
Strategic Partnerships in China and Japan 
On January 10, 2017, KP EU C.V., our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, entered into a cooperative joint venture agreement with Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical Industrial Development Co., Ltd., or Fosun Pharma, pursuant to which the parties will establish a joint venture for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing KTE-C19 in the mainland of the People’s Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administration Region and the Macau Special Administration Region. 
On January 5, 2017, Kite Pharma EU B.V., our wholly owned indirect subsidiary, entered into a collaboration and license agreement with Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited, or Daiichi Sankyo, pursuant to which we have granted to Daiichi Sankyo an exclusive license to develop and commercialize KTE-C19 in Japan. Pursuant to the agreement, we received a $50.0 million upfront payment from Daiichi Sankyo in January 2017.
For additional details on the Fosun Pharma and Daiichi Sankyo agreements, see Note 13 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to be the leader in immuno-oncology across multiple therapeutic indications. To achieve this, we plan to commercialize our lead product candidate, KTE-C19, if approved, by the end of 2017 and continue to advance a pipeline of CAR- and TCR-based product candidates for the treatment of advanced solid and hematological malignancies. Key elements of our strategy are to:
Complete the BLA submission and prepare for potential commercial launch of KTE-C19. 
We initiated a rolling submission of our BLA in December 2016 and expect to complete the submission in the first quarter of 2017 seeking accelerated approval of KTE-C19 as a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL, who are ineligible for ASCT. At the time of submission, we will request priority review of the BLA. After a 60-day filing review period, if accepted for FDA review, the FDA’s priority review goal of six months for reviewing and responding to the BLA would begin. If approved, we expect to commercially launch KTE-C19 in 2017. 
We have a comprehensive commercial strategy that focuses on commercial operations, marketing and account management, and access. With respect to operations, we have established a manufacturing facility in El Segundo, which is adjacent to Los Angeles International Airport, that we expect will commercially manufacture KTE-C19. In addition, we are developing our Kite Konnect technology platform to enable commercial-scale logistics for KTE-C19. Kite Konnect, in combination with other IT solutions, will track orders electronically from patient enrollment to the collection of the patient’s cells to infusion of KTE-C19. 
7

Kite Konnect will also provide a user-friendly interface and information platform for both healthcare providers prescribing KTE-C19 and for patients receiving KTE-C19. 
Our marketing and account management strategy is designed to leverage the top-tier hospitals that have experience with autologous T cell therapies and that treat the largest number of patients with aggressive NHL. We plan to target our educational and commercial outreach to more than 70 key transplant and lymphoma centers over a 12-month period post-launch, which we believe has the potential to reach almost 90% of patients with DLBCL who are ineligible for ASCT. Most of these centers have experience with autologous T cell therapies, and include approximately 40 of our KTE-C19 clinical trial sites. 
Our access strategy is designed to ensure that physicians and patients can access KTE-C19 and have a positive personalized experience. We anticipate patients will be covered by both commercial and government payors. Our access team has initiated meetings with national and regional payors to discuss KTE-C19 and the required steps for coverage.
Maximize KTE-C19 clinical development and advance KTE-C19 outside the United States.
We are currently conducting five company-sponsored trials of KTE-C19. We opened a third cohort in ZUMA-1 to allow us to evaluate prophylactic treatment of adverse events, broaden the patient population to include relapsed, transplant-ineligible subjects, and to expand the clinical trial to Europe. We are also conducting a Phase 2 clinical trial (ZUMA-2) of KTE-C19 in patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma, or MCL, a Phase 1-2 clinical trial (ZUMA-3) of KTE-C19 in adult patients with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or ALL, and a Phase 1-2 clinical trial (ZUMA-4) of KTE-C19 in pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. In the third quarter of 2016, we initiated a multi-center Phase 1b/2 clinical trial (ZUMA-6) of KTE-C19 in combination with Genentech’s atezolizumab in patients with refractory DLBCL. 
We expect to report primary data from ZUMA-2 and the Phase 2 portions of ZUMA-3 and ZUMA-4 in 2018. If we believe the data are compelling, we plan to pursue FDA approval for these additional indications. We plan to initiate clinical trials of KTE-C19 for the treatment of indolent NHL, or iNHL, and second line DLBCL, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, or CLL, in 2017. In addition, we are planning to open an expanded access protocol in the first half of 2017 to provide KTE-C19 to appropriate patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL, who are ineligible for ASCT. 
We are also focused on bringing KTE-C19 to additional markets around the world. We plan to submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, for KTE-C19 with the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL and TFL in the second half of 2017. We partnered with Daiichi Sankyo and Fosun Pharma to develop and commercialize KTE-C19 in Japan and China, respectively, and may selectively partner with other third parties to develop and commercialize KTE-C19 in additional countries.
Progress multiple CAR- and TCR-based product candidates to target hematological and solid tumors in the near-term.
In addition to KTE-C19, we continue to advance other CAR-based product candidates. We plan to file an IND for KITE-585 targeting B cell maturation antigen, or BCMA, for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 2017 and for KITE-796 targeting C-type lectin-like molecule-1, or CLL-1, for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, in 2018. KITE-796 is a Kite product candidate being developed under our collaboration with Amgen, and we expect to incorporate molecular “on/off switch” technology into KITE-796 that we licensed from Cell Design Labs, Inc., or CDL. We believe the switch technology may provide dynamic control and precise regulation of KITE-796 after therapeutic administration and we refer to CAR-product candidates using this technology as Control CARs.
We are also progressing multiple TCR-based product candidates. We expect our Phase 1 clinical trial of KITE-718 for the treatment of MAGE A3/A6 positive cancers including NSCLC and bladder cancer to be open in the first half of 2017. In 2018, we plan to file an IND for KITE-439 targeting human papillomavirus, or HPV, type 16 E7 for the treatment of HPV-16 E7-positive cancers including cervical cancer and head and neck cancer. 
Continue to leverage our collaborations to selectively identify and advance additional product candidates and technologies.
We plan to advance multiple additional CAR- and TCR-based product candidates under our collaborations, including with the NCI, Amgen, bluebird bio, Inc., Alpine Immune Sciences, Inc., or AIS, the Netherlands Cancer Institute, or NKI, and Leiden University Medical Center.  In particular, we have three Cooperative Research and Development Agreements, or CRADAs, with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the NCI, through which we are funding the research and development of CAR- and TCR-based product candidates.
8

These NCI collaborations provide us the opportunity to license and advance products for oncology development based on human proof-of-concept data rather than preclinical animal data alone. Additionally, using its proprietary TCR-GENErator technology platform, we believe our European subsidiary, Kite Pharma EU B.V., can systematically discover tumor-specific TCRs. 
We also plan to continue our research of off-the-shelf allogeneic engineered T cell therapies. Pursuant to a license agreement with The Regents of the University of California, we have an exclusive, worldwide license to certain intellectual property related to an artificial thymic organoid system, which we believe will support T cell generation from non-renewable and renewable cell sources, including induced pluripotent stem cells or embryonic stem cells, and enable the research and development of allogeneic engineered T cell therapies.
We may in-license, acquire, or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets to further expand or complement our portfolio of CAR- and TCR-based product candidates.
Engineered Autologous Cell Therapy 
White blood cells are a component of the immune system and are responsible for defending the body against infectious pathogens and other foreign material. There are several types of white blood cells, including T cells, natural killer cells, and B cells. T cells can be distinguished from other white blood cells by T cell receptors present on their cell surface. These receptors contribute to tumor surveillance by helping T cells recognize cancerous cells. The T cell has the ability to kill the cancerous cell once it is identified. When the T cells with cancer-specific receptors are absent, present in low numbers, of poor quality or rendered inactive by suppressive mechanisms employed by tumor tissue, cancer may grow and spread to various organs. In addition, standard of care treatments can be deleterious to T cells’ ability to kill cancer. We believe our therapy has the potential to treat cancer by overcoming the limits of a person’s immunosurveillance by increasing the effectiveness and number of a patient’s cancer-specific T cells.
Our therapy involves engineering T cells to express cancer-specific receptors as illustrated below.
The T cell engineering process that we have developed takes approximately 14 to 16 days from receipt of the patient’s white blood cells at our manufacturing facility to release for delivery to the site for infusion of the engineered T cells back to the patient. We provide our therapy to patients in our clinical trials after they receive a short chemotherapy conditioning regimen, which is intended to improve the survival and proliferative capacity of the newly infused T cells.
Using our technology, T cells can be genetically modified to express one of two classes of cancer-specific receptors: CARs or TCRs. CARs recognize native cancer antigens that are part of an intact protein on the cancer cell surface. TCRs broaden the therapeutic approach by targeting cancer proteins that reside inside the cancer cells. In ordinary cell metabolism, intracellular proteins are degraded into fragments called peptides. These peptides are then “displayed” on the cell membrane by a “presenting” molecule called major histocompatibility complex, or MHC. While T cells may not be able to recognize cancer-specific proteins inside a cancer cell, T cells that are engineered with tumor-specific TCRs are able to recognize a specific peptide from an intracellular protein when it is displayed on the cancer cell surface.
T cells engineered with CARs or TCRs can proliferate inside a patient and have the potential to infiltrate the microenvironment of a solid cancer mass, killing large numbers of cancer cells. Furthermore, we believe T cells engineered with CARs or TCRs can potentially overcome several mechanisms of tumor escape to which endogenous T cells may be susceptible. 
9

Upon binding with a target cell and activation, the engineered T cells release cytokines, which contribute to the killing of cancer cells. However, excessive cytokine release can result in a systemic inflammatory reaction consisting of fever and low blood pressure.
CARs and TCRs are discussed in more detail below.
CARs 
Engineering T cells with a CAR involves using a viral vector as a delivery vehicle containing a CAR sequence to transduce, or integrate, the construct into the T cell’s chromosome. The CAR sequence encodes the single-chain CAR protein. Our KTE-C19 CAR is comprised of the following elements:

• | Target Binding Domain: At one end of the CAR is a target binding domain of an antibody that is specific to the target CD19 antigen on the cancer cell surface. This domain extends out of the engineered T cell into the extracellular space, where it can recognize target antigens. The target binding domain consists of a single-chain variable fragment, or scFv, of an antibody comprising variable domains of heavy and light chains joined by a short linker. This allows the expression of the CAR as a single-chain protein.


• | Transmembrane Domain and Hinge: This middle portion of the CAR links the scFv target binding domain to the activating elements inside the cell. This transmembrane domain “anchors” the CAR in the cell’s membrane. In addition, the transmembrane domain may also interact with other transmembrane proteins that enhance CAR function. In the extracellular region of the CAR, directly adjacent to the transmembrane domain, lies a “hinge” domain. This region of the CAR provides structural flexibility to facilitate optimal binding of the CAR’s scFv target binding domain with the target antigen on the cancer cell’s surface.


• | Activating Domains: Located within the T cell’s interior are two regions of the CAR responsible for activating the T cell upon binding to the target cell. The CD3ζ element delivers an essential primary signal within the T cell, and the CD28 element delivers an additional, co-stimulatory signal. Together, these signals trigger T cell activation, resulting in proliferation of the CAR T cells and direct killing of the cancer cell. In addition, T cell activation stimulates the local secretion of cytokines and other molecules that can recruit and activate additional anti-tumor immune cells.

TCRs
Engineering T cells with a tumor-specific TCR involves using a viral vector containing TCR sequences to transduce the construct into the T cell’s chromosome. The TCR sequences encode two protein chains, which are designed to bind with specific peptides presented by MHC on the surface of certain cancer cells. 
10

The TCR protein chains are expressed on the T cell surface where they associate with CD3 proteins, which are natural components of the TCR complex. Upon binding of the TCR to the peptide-MHC complex on the cancer cell surface, the CD3 proteins deliver signals that trigger T cell activation, resulting in proliferation of the TCR-expressing T cells, killing of the cancer cell and stimulation of cytokine production and other molecules that can recruit and activate additional anti-tumor immune cells.
TCR technology primarily targets cancer antigens that fall into the following main categories: self-antigens, viral antigens and neo-antigens, also known as cancer-specific antigens. Self-antigens are generally shared across patients and include differentiation markers and cancer testis antigens, or CTAs. CTAs are expressed on a wide variety of common tumor types of various histological origins. We believe a subset of CTAs, primarily MAGE, as well as NY-ESO-1 and SSX2, are appropriate TCR targets because their expression on normal tissue is generally restricted to tissues that do not express MHC in adults. Viral antigens, such as those expressed by oncogenes, such as HPV-16-E6 and HPV-16-E7, are also shared across patients and are not expressed on normal tissue. As a result, T cells engineered to target cells with such CTAs or viral antigens would primarily target cancer cells rather than non-cancerous cells. We are initially focused on developing CTA-specific and virus oncoprotein-specific TCR-based product candidates. Under one of our CRADAs, we are also furthering with the NCI the research and development of the next generation of TCR-based product candidates to target neo-antigens such as KRAS, which are those derived from mutations arising in the tumor.
CAR and TCR Differences
There are three main differences between CARs and TCRs:

• | MHC Restriction: Since TCRs recognize peptides only in the context of MHC molecules expressed on the surface of the target cell, their peptide specificity is termed MHC-restricted. In contrast, CAR target recognition is MHC-unrestricted. In humans, MHC molecules are known as human leukocyte antigen, or HLA, proteins. There are several HLA protein types which display genetic variation across the human population. As a result, a TCR-based product candidate would have to be matched to the HLA type of the patient.


• | Cancer Target Frequency: CARs recognize native cancer antigens that are part of an intact protein on the cancer cell surface. Bioinformatic studies predict that 20% to 30% of all encoded proteins may be extracellular or membrane-associated. TCRs broaden the therapeutic approach by recognizing specific peptides derived from intracellular proteins that are displayed on the cancer cell surface in combination with MHC.

11


• | Antigen-Presenting Cell Recognition: As opposed to CARs, TCRs have the potential to recognize cancer antigens not only presented directly on the surface of cancer cells but also presented by antigen-presenting cells in the tumor microenvironment and in secondary lymphoid organs. Antigen-presenting cells are native immune-system cells responsible for the amplification of the immune response.

Other Immunotherapies
Immuno-oncology is one of the most actively pursued areas of research by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies today. Over the past few decades, several novel treatment methodologies have emerged that modulate the immune system including vaccines and monoclonal antibodies. Therapeutic vaccines have historically been associated with modest efficacy in the treatment of cancer. They commonly utilize dendritic cells, a type of immune cell that presents tumor antigens to T cells, which can result in T cell activation. Similarly, monoclonal antibodies, after binding a cancer antigen, classically utilize an effector arm in order to stimulate an immunological response.
More recently, interest and excitement has centered on the use of bispecific antibodies and checkpoint inhibitors. Bispecific antibodies commonly target both the cancer antigen and T cell receptor, thus bringing both cancer cells and T cells in close proximity to maximize the likelihood of an immune response to the cancer cells. Checkpoint inhibitors, or CPIs, work by releasing the body’s natural “brakes” on the immune system. Tumors can evade immune surveillance by triggering co-inhibitory receptors that can blunt T cell effectiveness and proliferation. By targeting these receptors, CPIs release these brakes, thereby reactivating T cells. Both bispecific antibodies and CPIs require functioning T cell populations in order to exert their effect.
We believe our engineered autologous cell therapy presents a promising innovation in immunotherapy by focusing directly on the key immune mediator, the T cell. Our engineered T cells bind to cancer cells directly, and as such, have the potential to kill a substantial number of tumor cells. In addition, we believe that our engineered T cells may be synergistic with other forms of immunotherapy. As an example, engineered autologous cell therapy may potentially be used in combination with CPIs to enhance efficacy. We are conducting a Phase 1b/2 combination study of KTE-C19 and atezolizumab, Genentech's anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody. This is the first industry sponsored combination study of an anti-CD19 engineered CAR T cell and a CPI.
KTE-C19
Overview
We are initially advancing KTE-C19 for the treatment of refractory, aggressive NHL, including the subtypes DLBCL, PMBCL and TFL. NHL is a cancer of white blood cells, including B cells. CD19 is expressed on the surface of B cells, including malignant B cells, and it is not thought to be expressed on any other tissue. B cells are considered non-essential tissue, as they are not required for patient survival. We believe CD19 is an appropriate target for the treatment of all types of B cell leukemias and lymphomas.
Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma, Primary Mediastinal B cell Lymphoma and Transformed Follicular Lymphoma
According to the American Cancer Society, DLBCL is the most common subtype of NHL, accounting for approximately 30% of the total 70,000 NHL patients diagnosed each year in the United States. It is classified as an aggressive lymphoma, in which survival is measured in months rather than years.
First line therapy for patients with DLBCL usually consists of chemotherapy regimen known as R-CHOP (rituximab, cytoxan, adriamycin, vincristine and prednisone), which includes the use of a monoclonal antibody known as rituximab. Approximately 50% to 60% of DLBCL patients are cured with first line therapy.
For patients who relapse or are refractory to first line therapy, the current standard of care for second line therapy consists of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen with rituximab. These second line chemotherapy regimens include R-ICE (rituximab, ifosfamide, carboplatin and etoposide) or R-DHAP (rituximab, dexamethasone, cytarabine and cisplatin).
Patients who respond to second line therapy may go on to receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT. Patients who do not respond to second line therapy or relapse after HSCT are treated with a third line salvage chemotherapy. These patients have a poor prognosis and treatment is generally palliative with no curative treatment options.
Findings from SCHOLAR-1, a multi-institutional, patient-level pooled analysis of outcomes from 635 patients with refractory DLBCL, showed that patients with DLBCL who do not respond to their last treatment with a chemotherapy-based regimen or 
12

have relapsed less than 12 months after ASCT have consistently poor outcomes. Median overall survival was 6.6 months and the overall response rate across all 597 evaluable patients was 26% with only 8% achieving a CR.
FL is the second most common subtype of NHL and the most common type of iNHL. There are approximately 15,300 new diagnoses of FL in the United States each year. Conventional therapy for FL is not curative, and most patients develop progressive disease and chemo-resistance. A pivotal event in the history of some patients with FL is histological transformation to more aggressive malignancies, most commonly DLBCL.
Due to differences in clinicopathologic features and treatment regimens, PMBCL can be considered a different patient population to DLBCL. There are approximately 1,650 new cases of PMBCL in the United States each year. Patients can be generally classified as having either limited stage or advanced stage disease. Limited stage disease can be contained within one irradiation field. In contrast, advanced stage disease refers to disease that cannot be contained within one irradiation field, bulky disease (greater than 10 centimeter wide tumors), and tumors that have an associated pericardial or pleural effusion. Patients of advanced stage disease are typically treated with induction chemoimmunotherapy. Primary refractory disease occurs when initial therapy fails to achieve a complete response and the general approach is to administer systemic chemotherapy with or without rituximab with plans to proceed to high-dose chemotherapy and HSCT in those with chemotherapy-sensitive disease. The treatment of patients who are not candidates for HSCT, who fail to respond to second line chemotherapy regimens, or who relapse after HSCT is generally palliative. Salvage therapy is rarely curative.
Other Lymphomas and Leukemias
We also expect to seek regulatory approval of KTE-C19 for the treatment of other lymphomas and leukemias, including MCL, ALL and CLL.
There are approximately 4,200 new cases of MCL in the United States each year. Current standard of care treatments for MCL are not curative, and virtually all patients will have refractory or recurrent disease. Treatment of MCL is difficult due to the rapid development of resistance to standard of care treatments.
ALL is an aggressive form of leukemia with approximately 6,500 patients diagnosed with ALL in the United States each year. Approximately 90% of patients with ALL will demonstrate a complete remission with intensive induction chemotherapy. However, after consolidation and maintenance therapy, the majority of patients will relapse in the bone marrow. Although approximately half of patients with relapsed ALL will obtain a second complete remission, most will eventually die from leukemia. The prognosis of patients with relapsed or refractory ALL is poor, with median survival less than one year.
CLL is the most common leukemia, with approximately 14,600 new cases in the United States per year. It is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes which are monoclonal in origin. Most patients with CLL will have an initial complete or partial response to chemotherapy, but relapse invariably occurs after treatment discontinuation unless the patient undergoes allogeneic HSCT, which is the only known curative therapy. Almost all patients with CLL will develop progressive disease.
Development Strategy
ZUMA-1
Based on the results from our primary analysis of ZUMA-1, we expect to complete the submission of our BLA in the first quarter of 2017 for accelerated approval of KTE-C19 as a treatment for patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL, who are ineligible for ASCT. The BLA submission will be based on the 101 patients treated in ZUMA-1 as described above under "Recent Developments-ZUMA-1 Primary Analysis of KTE-C19." During the course of the study, there were an additional ten patients enrolled but not treated, due to serious adverse events prior to treatment in seven patients, no measurable disease in two patients and product unavailability in one patient, which largely illustrates the disease severity of the ZUMA-1 patient population. 
Upon submission, there is a 60-day filing review period by the FDA. During this period, the FDA could refuse to file our BLA if the FDA deems the application incomplete. If accepted for FDA review, the FDA’s priority review goal of six months for reviewing and responding to the BLA would begin. 
If approved, we plan to commercially launch KTE-C19 in 2017. The USAN for KTE-C19 is axicabtagene ciloleucel.
13

Even if we receive FDA approval, we may be required to initiate a confirmatory study in NHL in order to fulfill likely post-marketing clinical study requirements to convert any accelerated approval to regular approval. We plan to initiate a clinical trial of KTE-C19 for the treatment of second line DLBCL in 2017 to fulfill the post-marketing clinical study requirement. The design of this study would be confirmed pending regulatory agency discussions. 
We are planning to submit an MAA to the EMA for KTE-C19 for the treatment of relapsed or refractory DLBCL, PMBCL and TFL in the second half of 2017. 
We opened a third cohort in ZUMA-1 to allow us to evaluate prophylactic treatment of adverse events, broaden the patient population to include relapsed, transplant-ineligible subjects, and to expand the clinical trial to Europe. In addition, we are planning to open an expanded access protocol in the first half of 2017 to provide KTE-C19 to appropriate patients with relapsed or refractory aggressive NHL, who are ineligible for ASCT. 
ZUMA-2
We expect to enroll approximately 70 patients with relapsed/refractory MCL in ZUMA-2. The primary endpoint is ORR.  We plan to report primary data from ZUMA-2 in 2018. If we believe the data are compelling, we plan to pursue marketing and regulatory approval for the MCL indication. 
ZUMA-3 and ZUMA-4
We expect to enroll approximately 75 adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL in ZUMA-3 and approximately 75 pediatric patients with relapsed/refractory ALL in ZUMA-4.  As reported at the 2016 ASH Annual Meeting, nine out of 11 patients (82%) achieved complete remission or complete remission with incomplete or partial hematological recovery in a preliminary analysis of the Phase 1 ZUMA-3 and ZUMA-4 trials. In these patients, 100% of responders tested negative for minimal residual disease, which has been shown to correlate with risk of disease relapse in ALL. In the Phase 1 trials, 13 patients were treated with KTE-C19. Eleven patients were evaluable for response and two patients did not reach the evaluation time point at the data cutoff. Five of 13 (38%) patients had grade 3 or higher CRS and grade 3 or higher neurological events. One patient in ZUMA-3 died from KTE-C19 related CRS and one patient in ZUMA-4 died from a disseminated fungal infection unrelated to KTE-C19. All patients had very high disease burden with median bone marrow blasts equal to 70% in ZUMA-3 and 91% in ZUMA-4.
We plan to transition to the Phase 2 portions of both trials in 2017 and report data from the Phase 2 portions of ZUMA-3 and ZUMA-4 in 2018. If we believe the data are compelling, we plan to pursue marketing and regulatory approval for the adult ALL and pediatric ALL indications.
We plan to initiate a clinical trial of KTE-C19 for the treatment of iNHL in the first quarter of 2017 and of CLL later in 2017. 
Additional CAR- and TCR-Based Product Candidates 
CAR-Based Product Candidates
We are researching and developing additional CAR-based product candidates, including KITE-585 and KITE-796. We plan to file an IND to initiate a clinical trial for KITE-585 targeting BCMA for the treatment of multiple myeloma in 2017 and for KITE-796 targeting CLL-1 for the treatment of AML in 2018. KITE-796 is a Kite product candidate being developed under our collaboration with Amgen, and we expect KITE-796 to be a Control CAR that incorporates the molecular “on/off switch” technology that we licensed from CDL.
We are also funding an NCI Phase 1 clinical trial of a fully human anti-CD19 CAR.  The trial’s primary objective is to assess the safety of giving T cells expressing a fully-human anti-CD19 CAR to patients with advanced B-cell cancers.  Patients are currently being enrolled into the Phase 1 dose escalation part of the trial and initial results from the trial are described under "Recent Developments-2017 American Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation Meeting." We expect to progress a next generation humanized anti-CD19 Control CAR that utilizes molecular “on/off switch” technology that we have the option to license from CDL.
TCR-Based Product Candidates
We are also researching and developing multiple TCR-based product candidates. At the end of 2016, we filed an IND to initiate a clinical trial for KITE-718 targeting a MAGE A3/A6 antigen for the treatment of MAGE A3/A6 positive cancers including 
14

NSCLC and bladder cancer. The trial is designed to assess the safety and anti-tumor effect of KITE-718 on these solid tumors. KITE-718 is a HLA-DPB0401 restricted TCR. This HLA type is found in 50% to 70% of Caucasians.
A Phase 1-2a clinical trial of a TCR-based therapy targeting the MAGE A3/A6 antigen is being conducted by the NCI pursuant to one of our CRADAs. The trial’s primary objectives are to determine (1) a safe dose for the administration of autologous T cells transduced with an anti-MAGE A3/A6 TCR, which is HLA-DPB0401/0402 restricted, and Interleukin-2, or IL-2, to patients following a nonmyeloablative but lymphoid depleting preparative regimen, (2) if this approach will result in objective tumor regression in patients with metastatic cancer expressing MAGE A3/A6 and (3) the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen. This trial’s secondary objective is to determine the in vivo survival of gene-engineered cells. Fourteen patients were enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study. One patient with cervical cancer, one with esophageal cancer, and one with urothelial cancer each experienced partial responses without dose limiting toxicities.  The patients with cervical cancer and urothelial cancer were in response more than 12 months after treatment.
We believe we have optimized KITE-718 from the NCI's anti-MAGE A3/A6 TCR by streamlining the manufacturing process through advanced technologies and next-generation cell culture manufacturing conditions. The NCI's product candidate utilized CD4 T cells only, had a manufacturing time of approximately 20 to 24 days and utilized IL-2 for cell expansion. For KITE-718, we expect to use CD4 and CD8 T cells, which we believe work synergistically. We also plan to shorten the manufacturing time to eight to ten days and use IL-7/IL-15 plus a protein kinase B (AKT) inhibitor, which we believe will help generate more naïve and central memory T cells that may have a greater potential to proliferate.
In 2018, we plan to file an IND for KITE-439 targeting HPV-16 E7 for the treatment of HPV-16 E7 positive cancers including cervical cancer and head and neck cancer. 
Pursuant to our CRADAs, we are also funding or expect to fund clinical trials at the NCI involving TCR-based product candidates targeting certain HPV, MAGE, and KRAS antigens and neo-antigens. 
With respect to developing a TCR-based product portfolio, we plan to use a novel Phase 2 design wherein patients with various cancers will be screened for tumor antigen expression as well as the patient specific HLA genotype. Patients will then be assigned a TCR-based therapy that matches both the tumor antigen expression and their presenting HLA protein. We believe this approach may allow for detection of promising benefit to risk profiles in multiple cancers in a single study. 
Manufacturing, Processing and Delivering to Patients 
Because it is important to rapidly treat patients with highly aggressive cancers, we have developed a T cell engineering process for KTE-C19 that takes approximately 14 to 16 days from receipt of the patient’s white blood cells at our manufacturing facility to release for delivery to the site for infusion of the engineered T cells back to the patient. The processing of KTE-C19 begins with the collection of the patient’s white blood cells using a standard blood bank procedure. The collected cells are then sent to a central processing facility, where the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, including T cells, are isolated from the other sample components. These cells are stimulated to proliferate, then transduced with a retroviral vector to introduce the CAR sequence into the patient’s T cells. These engineered cells are then propagated in cell culture bags until a sufficient number of cells are available for infusion back into the patient. The engineered T cells are then washed and frozen at the cell processing site, and shipped back to the clinical center where they can be administered to the patient. In preparation for administration of the engineered T cells, the patient undergoes a short chemotherapy conditioning regimen, which is intended to improve the survival and proliferative capacity of the newly infused T cells.
Using our clinical manufacturing facilities in Santa Monica, California, we are processing KTE-C19 for our ZUMA clinical trials. Cell processing activities are conducted at our facilities under current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, using qualified equipment and materials. We have engaged a third-party contractor to manufacture the retroviral vector that delivers the applicable CAR sequence into the T cells under cGMP. We believe all materials and components utilized in the production of the retroviral vector and final T cell product are readily available from qualified suppliers. We no longer rely on a contract manufacturer for clinical manufacturing of KTE-C19 for our U.S. clinical trials. We plan to rely on a contract manufacturer to assist with part of the manufacturing process for KTE-C19 for our clinical trials in Europe.
To meet projected needs for commercial demand, we have established a commercial manufacturing facility to supply and process KTE-C19 and other CAR- and TCR-based product candidates on a patient-by-patient basis. Our commercial manufacturing facility is in El Segundo, adjacent to Los Angeles International Airport. The facility is subject to an FDA inspection prior to any commercial manufacturing of KTE-C19, and, if the facility passes the inspection and KTE-C19 is approved, we anticipate the El Segundo facility will be operational to support the planned U.S. commercial launch of KTE-C19 
15

in 2017. We are also developing a technology platform to track orders electronically from patient enrollment to the collection of the patient’s cells to infusion of KTE-C19.
In November 2015, we entered into a strategic research collaboration with GE Global Research to develop a next generation, functionally integrated and automated manufacturing system for engineered T cell therapy. We believe this collaboration will accelerate the development of automation technologies for engineered T cell therapy that have the potential to reduce cost, improve speed and minimize variability. Under the terms of the agreement, we and GE Global Research will each contribute resources and relevant expertise to the partnership.
Intellectual Property
Intellectual property is of vital importance in our field and in biotechnology generally. We seek to protect and enhance proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business by seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We will also seek to rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available.
To achieve this objective, a strategic focus for us has been to identify and license key patents that provide protection and serve as an optimal platform to enhance our intellectual property and technology base. Well before the field of adoptive T cell immunotherapy raised commercial interest and started its transition to an industrial environment, we initiated a process of identifying patents with broad coverage in the area of CARs. Between 2009 and 2013, we identified, and ultimately licensed, issued patents with broad claims directed to the CAR concept. These patents were originally filed by investigators at the Weizmann Institute of Science, the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, University of California San Francisco, or UCSF, and Cell Genesys. This process was finalized in December 2013.
This effort was paralleled by the creation and execution in August 2012 of our first CRADA. This agreement provides the framework under which we may license product-related intellectual property from the NIH to support our pipeline development and commercialization activities, as well as enhance and extend the life-time of our patent portfolio.
Our intellectual property estate strategy is designed to provide multiple layers of protection, including: (1) patent rights with broad claims directed to core CAR constructs used in our products; (2) patent rights covering methods of treatment for therapeutic indications; (3) patent rights covering specific products; and (4) patent rights covering innovative manufacturing processes, preconditioning methods, new constructs and methods for genetically engineering T cells.
We believe our current layered patent estate, together with our efforts to develop and patent next generation technologies, provides us with substantial intellectual property protection. We have conducted extensive freedom to operate, or FTO, analyses of the current patent landscape with respect to our lead product candidate, and based on these analyses we believe that there are no valid claims in any third party patents, which would prevent our ability to commercialize KTE-C19. However, in an inter partes review, or IPR, proceeding, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, Patent Trial and Appeal Board declined to revoke a patent relating to certain CAR compositions of matter that we believe is invalid. This patent is owned by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer and Sloan Kettering Institute for Cancer Research, or MSK, and licensed by Juno Therapeutics, Inc., or Juno. Juno and MSK filed a patent infringement lawsuit against us on December 19, 2016 in the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Delaware with respect to the MSK patent. We filed a Notice of Appeal to the IPR decision on February 16, 2017 and, on February 23, 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss the Juno and MSK lawsuit. While we believe that we have a meritorious basis for asserting that the MSK patent is invalid, patent litigation is full of uncertainties, and we cannot provide any assurances that we will prevail in these proceedings. For additional information on the lawsuit, see "Risk Factors-Third-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our product discovery and development efforts" and Note 11 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Our current patent estate includes an exclusive license to a patent portfolio owned by Cabaret Biotech Ltd., or Cabaret, and directed to CAR constructs developed by Dr. Zelig Eshhar, Yeda-Weizmann, NIH, UCSF and Cell Genesys. Our CAR construct-directed patent portfolio includes 10 issued U.S. patents, seven of which are directed to core construct composition of matter and two of which are directed to methods of treatment for therapeutic indications. These patents first began to expire in April 2015, with the last of these patents, which broadly claims scFv-based CAR constructs and is also our most significant CAR-related patent, expiring in 2027. The patent expiring in 2027 and one of the other licensed patents is subject to an ex parte reexamination before the USPTO, which may result in such patents being cancelled, narrowed or held unpatentable. These patents represent all of the material patents underlying KTE-C19. We are working to develop the next generation of CAR and TCR technologies for use in this field, which we intend to patent on our own or to license from our collaborators, to expand this layer of our intellectual property estate.
16

The identification of new technologies and initiation of the exclusive licensing process occur under the framework of the CRADAs between us and the NIH. Since entering into the first CRADA in August 2012, we have secured multiple commercial license agreements with the NIH for intellectual property relating to TCR-based product candidates targeting certain SSX2, NY-ESO-1, HPV, MAGE and KRAS antigens, for a CAR-based product candidate targeting EGFRvIII and for a fully-human CAR-based product candidate targeting CD19. Our MAGE and HPV product-specific intellectual property includes Patent Cooperation Treaty applications with priority dates in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, corresponding U.S. non-provisional patent applications, and corresponding foreign patent applications in Canada, Australia, Europe, China, Israel, Japan, and certain others. The Patent Cooperation Treaty applications with 2013 and 2014 priority dates relate to our TCR-based product candidates targeting HPV antigens, and the Patent Cooperation Treaty applications with the 2011 and 2012 priority dates relate to our TCR-based product candidates targeting the MAGE antigen. We also have other strategic licenses for additional intellectual property rights as described under Note 6 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Our strategy is also to develop and obtain additional intellectual property covering innovative manufacturing processes, preconditioning methods, new constructs and methods for genetically engineering T cells. To support this effort, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We have filed multiple patent applications, jointly with the NCI, relating to our closed manufacturing process and improvements thereto, pre-conditioning regimen, pre-conditioning regimen with cytokines/biomarkers, and expect to continue to file patent applications to expand this layer of our intellectual property estate. 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing of the first non-provisional application to which priority is claimed. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for a patent term restoration of up to five years under the Hatch-Waxman Act, which is designed to compensate for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The length of the patent term restoration is calculated based on the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term restoration under the Hatch-Waxman Act cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be restored. Moreover, a patent can only be restored once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Our Licenses and Collaborations
We have entered into multiple strategic licenses and collaborations, including with the NIH, Cabaret, Amgen, bluebird bio, Inc., CDL, AIS, Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, Inc., Fosun Pharma and Daiichi Sankyo.

For additional information regarding our significant agreements, see Notes 6 and 13 to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Competition 
Presently, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries put significant resources in developing novel and proprietary therapies for the treatment of cancer. We compete with companies in the space of immunotherapy, as well as companies developing novel targeted therapies for cancer. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs and therapies enter the market and advanced technologies become available. 
Due to their promising clinical therapeutic effect in clinical exploratory trials, we anticipate substantial direct competition from other organizations developing advanced T cell therapies. In particular, we expect to compete with (1) therapies with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs, that are naturally occurring tumor-reactive T cells harvested, propagated ex vivo and re-infused into patients; and (2) therapies with engineered T cells, similar to our engineered autologous cell therapy, rendered reactive against tumor-associated antigens prior to their administration to patients. TIL therapy and genetically engineering T cells are being pursued by multiple companies, including Novartis, Juno Therapeutics, Adaptimmune LLC, Celgene Corporation, bluebird bio, Inc., Lion Biotechnologies, Mustang Bio, Inc., ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc., Takara Bio Inc., Immunocore Limited as well as a number of China-based companies. In particular, Novartis and Juno Therapeutics, with the support of Celgene Corporation, are in the process of research and development of their own versions of anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapies and we expect Adaptimmune to compete with any TCR-based product candidates that we develop. In addition, some companies, such as Cellectis, are pursuing allogeneic T cell products, including an anti-CD19 allogeneic T cell product, that could compete with KTE-C19 and our other CAR- and TCR-based product candidates as well as any future allogeneic T cell products we develop. 
While we believe that other known types of immunotherapies, including those described under “—Other Immunotherapies” above, may potentially be used in conjunction with engineered autologous cell therapy, such as CPIs, to enhance efficacy, we do not expect substantial direct competition from these other types of immunotherapies. However, we cannot predict whether other types of immunotherapies may be enhanced and show greater efficacy, and we may have direct and substantial competition from such immunotherapies in the future. 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance and may render our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. 
Government Regulation and Product Approval 
As a biopharmaceutical company that operates in the United States, we are subject to extensive regulation. Our cell products will be regulated as biologics. With this classification, commercial production of our products will need to occur in registered and licensed facilities in compliance with cGMP for biologics. The FDA categorizes human cell- or tissue-based products as either minimally manipulated or more than minimally manipulated, and has determined that more than minimally manipulated products require clinical trials to demonstrate product safety and efficacy and the submission of a BLA for marketing authorization. 
Government authorities in the United States (at the federal, state and local level) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of biopharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the United States, although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of regulation in Europe are addressed in a centralized way, but country-specific regulation remains essential in many respects. The process for obtaining regulatory marketing approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
18

U.S. Product Development Process 
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biological products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include, among other actions, refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research patients and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.

The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions regarding the proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, trials may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such trials. 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research patients provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
19

Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk to benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human patients, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk, including risks inferred from other unrelated immunotherapy trials. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Human immunotherapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of immunotherapy products, or that the data generated in these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
Concurrently with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes 
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human trials, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for biological products and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biological products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small 
20

business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, potent, and/or effective for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve a BLA without a REMS, if required. 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For immunotherapy products, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the GTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control. 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s). 
21

Orphan Drug Designation 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug or biologic for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug or biologic. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the generic identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full BLA, to market the same biologic for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the BLA application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
We have received orphan drug designation for KTE-C19 for the treatment of DLBCL, PMBCL, ALL, MCL, CLL, and FL. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for additional indications or for any additional product candidates. 
Expedited Development and Review Programs 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new products are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. Unique to a fast track product, the FDA may consider for review sections of the BLA on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the BLA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the BLA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA. 
Any product, submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a fast track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. In addition, the FDA currently requires as a condition for accelerated approval pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. Fast track designation, priority review and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
Breakthrough therapy designation is intended to expedite the development and review of products that treat serious or life-threatening conditions. The designation by FDA requires preliminary clinical evidence that a product candidate demonstrates substantial improvement over currently available therapy. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both 
22

accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same product if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will expedite the development and review of such product. 
In December 2015, the FDA granted breakthrough therapy designation status to KTE-C19 for the treatment of patients with refractory DLBCL, PMBCL and TFL. 
Post-Approval Requirements 
Any products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved uses (known as “off-label use”), limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. Although a physician may prescribe a legally available product for an off-label use, if the physicians deems such product to be appropriate in his/her professional medical judgment, a manufacturer may not market or promote off-label uses.
In addition, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to applicable manufacturing requirements after approval to ensure the long-term stability of the product. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including, among other things, recall or withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product. Discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development.
U.S. Marketing Exclusivity 
The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act, or BPCIA, amended the PHSA to authorize the FDA to approve similar versions of innovative biologics, commonly known as biosimilars. A competitor seeking approval of a biosimilar must file an application to establish its molecule as highly similar to an approved innovator biologic, among other requirements. The BPCIA, however, bars the FDA from approving biosimilar applications for 12 years after an innovator biological product receives initial marketing approval. This 12-year period of data exclusivity may be extended by six months, for a total of 12.5 years, if the FDA requests that the innovator company conduct pediatric clinical investigations of the product. As an innovative biological product, KTE-C19 would receive this data protection if the FDA approves it for marketing. 
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a trial. 
Other U.S. Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements 
23

In the United States, our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our business practices, including our sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may be required to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the patient data privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, transparency requirements, and similar state laws, each as amended. 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for protection under a statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor. 
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively, the Affordable Care Act, to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Rather, if “one purpose” of the remuneration is to induce referrals, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is violated. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codified case law that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to, among others, a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for a medical or other item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies are being investigated or, in the past, have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates that are independent contractors or agents of covered entities 
24

that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Affordable Care Act, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
In order to distribute products commercially, we must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of drug and biological products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution, including some states that require manufacturers and others to adopt new technology capable of tracking and tracing product as it moves through the distribution chain. Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, and/or register their sales representatives, as well as to prohibit pharmacies and other healthcare entities from providing certain physician prescribing data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for use in sales and marketing, and to prohibit certain other sales and marketing practices. All of our activities are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements and/or oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payors include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the product. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. 
Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the EU, governments influence the price of pharmaceutical products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which 
25

products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
The marketability of any product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Reform 
In March 2010, President Obama enacted the Affordable Care Act, which is substantially changing healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacting the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.
Among the Affordable Care Act’s provisions of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, in addition to those otherwise described above, are the following:

• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents apportioned among these entities according to their market share in some government healthcare programs;


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;


• | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for most branded and generic drugs, respectively and a cap on the total rebate amount for innovator drugs at 100% of the Average Manufacturer Price, or AMP;


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers’ outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program; and


• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.

Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to numerous provisions of the Affordable Care Act. In January, Congress voted to adopt a budget resolution for fiscal year 2017, or the Budget Resolution, that authorizes the implementation of legislation that would repeal portions of the Affordable Care Act. The Budget Resolution is not a law, but it is widely viewed as the first step toward the passage of legislation that would repeal certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Further, on January 20, 2017, President Trump signed an Executive Order directing federal agencies with authorities and responsibilities under the Affordable Care Act to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of any provision of the Affordable Care Act that would impose a fiscal or regulatory burden on states, individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers, or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices. Congress also could consider subsequent 
26

legislation to replace elements of the Affordable Care Act that are repealed. We will continue to evaluate the effect that the Affordable Care Act and any future measures to repeal or replace the Affordable Care Act have on our business. 
Further, in January 2016, CMS issued a final rule regarding the Medicaid drug rebate program. The final rule, effective April 1, 2016, among other things, revises the manner in which the “average manufacturer price” is to be calculated by manufacturers participating in the Medicaid drug rebate program and implements certain amendments to the Medicaid drug rebate program included in the Affordable Care Act. In addition, it is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
Additional Regulation 
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations. 
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation 
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval of a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In the EU, for example, a clinical trial application must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the clinical trial application is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries. 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug or biological product under EU regulatory systems, we must submit an MAA. The application used to file the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. The European Commission has granted KTE-C19 orphan drug designation to treat DLBCL, PMBCL, ALL, MCL, CLL, small lymphocytic lymphoma, and FL. The designation may provide 10 years of market exclusivity in Europe, subject to certain limited exceptions. However, the designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review or approval process. 
For other countries outside of the EU, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
27

If we or our potential collaborators fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
