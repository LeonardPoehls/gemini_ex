--------+---------



Standard Diversified Opportunities Inc. (f/k/a Special Diversified Opportunities Inc. and Strategic Diagnostics Inc.) (“SDOI”), a holding company until June 1, 2017, and its subsidiaries (collectively, “the Company”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 1990, and, until 2013, engaged in bio-services and industrial bio-detection (collectively, the “Life Sciences Business”). On July 12, 2013, SDOI sold substantially all of its rights, title and interest in substantially all of its non-cash assets related to the Life Sciences Business and became a “shell company,” as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.
 
On June 1, 2017, SDOI consummated a Contribution and Exchange Transaction (“Contribution and Exchange”) to acquire a 52.1% controlling interest in Turning Point Brands, Inc. (“Turning Point”). The transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization or reverse acquisition. Turning Point was the accounting acquirer for financial reporting purposes. Accordingly, the historical financial statements of Turning Point through May 31, 2017 became our historical financial statements, including the comparative prior periods. These consolidated financial statements include the results of SDOI from June 1, 2017, the date the reverse acquisition was consummated. As of December 31, 2017, SDOI has a 51.2% ownership interest in Turning Point.
 
Prior to the consummation of the Contribution and Exchange, SDOI amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to provide for, among other things, the reclassification of every 25 shares of its common stock, par value $0.01 per share, into one share of a new class of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, designated as Class A Common Stock (the “Class A Common Stock”) and the authorization for issuance of an additional class of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of SDOI designated as Class B Common Stock (the “Class B Common Stock”). Prior to the closing of the Contribution and Exchange, SDOI declared a dividend of one share of Class B Common Stock for each outstanding share of Class A Common Stock, payable to holders of record of Class A Common Stock on June 2, 2017. All references in the consolidated financial statements to the number of shares and per share amounts of common stock have been retroactively restated to reflect the reclassification of common stock, the shares issued in the Contribution and Exchange and the dividend of Class B Common Stock. Refer to Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference, for further information. As a result of the consummation of the Contribution and Exchange, SDOI is no longer a shell company.
 
Our subsidiaries are engaged in the following lines of business:
 
 
· | Other tobacco products (Turning Point Brands, Inc. (“Turning Point”), a 51.2% owned subsidiary);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Outdoor advertising (Standard Outdoor LLC (“Standard Outdoor”), a wholly owned subsidiary), beginning in July 2017; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Insurance (Pillar General Inc. (“Pillar General”), a wholly owned subsidiary), beginning in January 2018.

We expect to become a diversified holding company with interests in a variety of industries and market sectors. We will rely upon our existing cash balances and potential distributions from our subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our operating obligations and for future acquisitions. In addition, we may be required to raise additional capital through equity and/or debt financings in order to fund our future operations and/or acquisitions.
 
Turning Point
 
Turning Point is a leading independent provider of Other Tobacco Products (“OTP”) in the U.S. Turning Point sells a wide range of products across the OTP spectrum, including moist snuff tobacco (“MST”), loose leaf chewing tobacco, premium cigarette papers, make-your-own (“MYO”) cigar wraps, cigars, liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products. Turning Point does not sell cigarettes. Turning Point estimates that the OTP industry generated approximately $11.0 billion in manufacturer revenue in 2017. In contrast to manufactured cigarettes, which have been experiencing declining sales for decades based on data published by the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (“TTB”), the OTP industry is demonstrating increased consumer appeal with low to mid-single digit consumer unit growth as reported by Management Science Associates, Inc. (“MSAi”), a third-party analytics and informatics company.
 
Turning Point’s portfolio of brands includes some of the most widely recognized names in the OTP industry, such as Zig-Zag ®, Beech-Nut ®, Stoker’s ®, Trophy ®, and VaporBeast ™. Turning Point has an experienced management team that possesses long-standing industry relationships and a deep understanding of the OTP industry. Turning Point has identified additional opportunities to grow sales, including the launch of new products and expanding our distribution and sales force. Turning Point also believes there are meaningful opportunities to grow through acquisitions and joint ventures across all product categories. As of December 31, 2017, Turning Point products are available in over 170,000 U.S. retail locations which, with the addition of retail stores in Canada, brings Turning Point’s total North American retail presence to an estimated 200,000 points of distribution. Turning Point’s sales team targets widespread distribution to all traditional retail channels, including convenience stores, where over 60% of all OTP volume is currently sold according to MSAi.
 
Turning Point’s reportable segments are (1) smokeless products, which include chewing tobacco and MST, (2) smoking products, which principally include cigarette papers, MYO cigar wraps, and cigars, and (3) NewGen products, which include liquid vapor products, tobacco vaporizer products and non-nicotine/non-tobacco products. The results of SDOI and Standard Outdoor are included in Other. Information regarding net sales, operating income or loss, and assets attributable to each of our segments, is included within Note 19 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.

Smokeless Segment
 
Turning Point’s Smokeless segment includes both loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff tobacco (“MST”). Turning Point’s Smokeless focus brand is Stoker’s in both chewing tobacco and MST. Stoker’s® chewing tobacco has grown considerably over the last several years and is presently the #1 discount brand and the second largest brand in the industry, with approximately 18% market share. Turning Point’s status in the chew market is further strengthened by Beech-Nut®, the #3 premium brand and #6 overall, as well as Trophy®, Durango®, and the five Wind River Brands Turning Point acquired in November 2016. Refer to Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding this acquisition. Collectively, Turning Point is the #2 marketer of chewing tobacco with approximately 28% market share. Turning Point’s chewing tobacco operations are facilitated through its long-standing relationship with Swedish Match, the manufacturer of its loose leaf chewing tobaccos.
 
In MST, Stoker’s remains among the fastest growing brands and holds a 6.7% share in the stores with distribution and a 2.9% share of the total U.S. MST market. Stoker’s pioneered the large 12 oz. tub packaging format and is manufactured using a proprietary process that Turning Point thinks results in a superior product. In late 2015, Turning Point extended the Stoker’s® MST franchise to include traditional 1.2 oz. cans to broaden retail availability. Turning Point’s proprietary manufacturing process is conducted at its Dresden, Tennessee, plant and packaged in both its Dresden, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky facilities.
 
Smoking Segment
 
Turning Point’s Smoking segment principally includes cigarette papers and Make-Your-Own (“MYO”) cigar wraps. The iconic strength of the Zig-Zag® brand drives its leadership position in both the cigarette papers and MYO cigar wrap markets. In cigarette papers, Zig-Zag® is the #1 premium cigarette paper in the U.S. with approximately 30% market share.  Management estimates also indicate that Zig-Zag® is the #1 brand in the promising Canadian market.  Cigarette paper operations are aided by Turning Point’s sourcing relationships with Bolloré.
 
In MYO cigar wraps, the Zig-Zag® brand commands about three-quarters of the market and continues to innovate in novel ways, including Turning Point’s recent introduction of Zig-Zag® ‘Rillo sized wraps which are similar in size to cigarillos, the most popular and fastest growing type of machine-made cigars.  MYO cigar wraps operations are facilitated by Turning Point’s long-standing commercial relationship with the patent holder, Durfort.
 
NewGen Segment
 
Turning Point’s NewGen segment includes its recent acquisitions of Smoke Free Technologies, d/b/a VaporBeast (“VaporBeast”), and The Hand Media and its subsidiaries, d/b/a Vapor Shark (collectively, “Vapor Shark”), which have solidified Turning Point’s status as a major player within the segment, in addition to V2 branded products. Refer to Note 3 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details regarding these acquisitions. VaporBeast is a leading distributor of liquid vapor products servicing the non-traditional retail channel. Vapor Shark is a leading distributor and manufacturer of premium vaping e-liquids with nationwide distribution through non-traditional retail as well as Vapor Shark branded retail locations. Turning Point’s acquisition of VaporBeast, and subsequent acquisition of Vapor Shark, accelerated its entry into the non-traditional retail outlets for vaporizers, e-liquids, and accessories, which Turning Point estimates it sells greater than 50% of all liquid vapor volume. Turning Point believes its NewGen business will expand further as consumers continue to move from combustible cigarettes to vaping. Turning Point believes it is well-positioned to act as a consolidator in the NewGen space in anticipation of increased regulation and will continue to explore potential acquisitions.
 
Standard Outdoor
 
Standard Outdoor is an out-of-home advertising business. As of December 31, 2017, and for the period from July 3, 2017 through December 31, 2017, the business consisted of 5 billboard structures located in several counties near Austin, Texas. Revenues include outdoor advertising revenues, while operating expenses primarily include compensation costs, depreciation and rent expense. The results of Standard Outdoor are included in our consolidated operating results from July 3, 2017, the date of acquisition, and are immaterial to our consolidated financial statements in 2017. In January 2018 and February 2018, we also acquired a total of 169 additional billboard structures, as described further below under Recent Developments.
Pillar General
 
As described further below under Recent Developments, on January 2, 2018, Pillar General acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Interboro Holdings, Inc. ("Interboro") for a cash purchase price of $2.5 million. Under the name Maidstone Insurance Company (“Maidstone”), Interboro offers personal automobile insurance, primarily in the state of New York. Because the transaction closed during 2018, no results of Pillar General are included in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017.

Recent Developments
 
On February 20, 2018, SDOI acquired assets consisting of 86 billboard structures located in Georgia and Florida, as well as the ground leases and advertising contracts relating to such billboard structures for total consideration of approximately $6.9 million, subject to customary and valuation adjustments, of which $3.2 million was paid in cash, $3.5 million is payable under a promissory note and the remainder was paid in our Class A common shares.
 
On January 18, 2018, SDOI acquired assets consisting of 83 billboard structures located in Alabama, as well as the ground leases and advertising contracts relating to such billboard structures for total consideration of approximately $10.5 million, subject to customary and valuation adjustments, of which $4.0 million was paid in cash and the remaining $6.5 million is payable under a promissory note.
 
On January 12, 2018, SDOI issued 181,825 shares of its Class A common stock in a private placement for gross proceeds of $2.0 million.
 
On January 2, 2018, SDOI acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of Interboro for a cash purchase price of $2.5 million. Under the name Maidstone Insurance Company, Interboro offers personal automobile insurance, primarily in the State of New York.
 
On November 9, 2017, the Board of Directors of Turning Point approved the initiation of a cash dividend to its shareholders. The initial quarterly dividend of $0.04 per common share was paid on December 15, 2017 to shareholders of record at the close of business on November 27, 2017. Approximately $0.4 million was distributed to noncontrolling interest holders outside of SDOI as a result of this dividend.
 
Turning Point
 
Competitive Strengths
 
Turning Point believes its competitive strengths include the following:
 
Large, Leading Brands with Significant Scale
 
Turning Point has built a portfolio of leading brands with significant scale that are well recognized by consumers, retailers, and wholesalers. Turning Point’s Stoker’s® and Zig-Zag® brands are each well established and date back 78 and 118 years, respectively. Though the NewGen segment is relatively new within the OTP industry, Turning Point’s 2016 acquisition of VaporBeast added a leading seller of e-liquids, devices, and accessories. In 2017, Stoker’s®, Zig-Zag®, and VaporBeast® together generated approximately $261 million of gross sales, or 84% of its consolidated gross sales. Specifically:
 
 
· | Stoker’s® is the #2 loose leaf chewing tobacco brand and among the fastest growing MST brands in the industry. Turning Point manufactures Stoker’s® MST using only 100% American Leaf, utilizing a proprietary process to produce what it believes is a superior product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Zig-Zag® is the #1 cigarette paper brand in terms of retail dollar sales in the U.S., as measured by Nielsen Convenience, with significant distribution in Canada. Zig-Zag® is also the #1 MYO cigar wrap brand in the U.S.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | VaporBeast is a leading distributor of liquid vapor products to the non-traditional retail channel. Revenue growth at VaporBeast has been delivered through a more effective selling process, which generated increased order sizes and the frequency of customer orders. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Turning Point believes the Stoker’s® brand is seen as an innovator in both the loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff markets. Zig-Zag® is an iconic brand and has strong, enduring brand recognition among a wide audience of consumers.  VaporBeast is a powerful distribution engine that allows Turning Point to further penetrate the vaporizer and e-liquids markets via non-traditional retail outlets.
 
Successful Track Record of New Product Launches and Category Expansions
 
Turning Point has successfully launched new products and entered new product categories by leveraging the strength of its brands. Turning Point methodically targets markets which it believes has significant growth potential. Turning Point has been successful in entering new product categories by extending existing products and brands in addition to introducing new products:

· | Turning Point leveraged the proud legacy and value of the Stoker’s® brand to introduce a 12 oz. MST tub, a product whose size was not offered by any other market participant at the time of introduction. Stoker’s® MST has been among the fastest growing moist snuff brands in the industry in terms of pounds sold. While competitors have introduced larger format tub packaging, the early entry and differentiation of the Stoker’s® product have firmly established Turning Point as the market leader with over 50% of the Tub market. In third quarter 2015, Turning Point introduced Stoker’s® MST in 1.2 oz. cans to further expand retail penetration, particularly in convenience stores.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 5
 

 
· | In 2009, Turning Point extended the Zig-Zag® tobacco brand into the MYO cigar wraps market and captured a 50% market share within the first two years. Turning Point is now the market share leader for MYO cigar wraps with a 76% share. Turning Point believes its success was driven by the Zig-Zag® tobacco branding, which it feels is widely understood by consumers to represent a favorable, customizable experience ideally suited to MYO products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | VaporBeast quickly established itself as a leading marketer and distributor of liquid vapor products to the non-traditional retail universe. With its national footprint, VaporBeast is leveraging its regional consumer preference insights to further accelerate sales advances.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Turning Point strategically targets product categories that it believes demonstrate significant growth potential and for which the value of its brands is likely to have a meaningful impact.  Turning Point believes that its track record and existing portfolio of brands provide growth advantages as it continues to evaluate opportunities to extend its product lines and expand into new categories.
 
Extensive Distribution Network and Data Driven Sales Organization
 
Turning Point has taken important steps to enhance its selling and distribution network and consumer marketing capabilities while keeping its capital expense requirements relatively low. Turning Point services its customer base with an experienced sales and marketing organization of approximately 145 professionals who possess in-depth knowledge of the tobacco industry. Turning Point extensively uses data supported by leading technology to enable its sales force to analyze changing trends and effectively identify evolving consumer preferences at the store level. Turning Point subscribes to a sales tracking system provided by MSAi that measures all OTP product shipments by all market participants, on a weekly basis, from approximately 900 wholesalers to over 250,000 retail stores in the U.S. This system enables Turning Point to understand share and volume trends across multiple categories at the individual store level, allowing them to allocate field sales force coverage to the highest opportunity stores, thereby enhancing the value of new store placements and sales activity.  Within its Stoker’s product categories, Turning Point has seen a positive correlation between the frequency of store calls by its sales force and its retail market share. As the initial sales effort is critical to the success of a product launch, Turning Point believes its experienced sales force, expansive distribution network, and leading market analytics put them in a strong position to swiftly execute new product launches in response to evolving consumer and market preferences.
Long-standing, Strong Relationships with an Established Set of Producers
 
As part of its asset-light operating model Turning Point built long-standing and extensive relationships with leading, high-quality producers. In 2017, Turning Point’s four most important producers were:

· | Swedish Match, which manufactures its loose leaf chewing tobacco;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Bolloré, which provides them with exclusive access to the Zig-Zag® cigarette paper and accessories brand for the U.S. and Canada;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Durfort, from which Turning Point sources its MYO cigar wraps; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | JJA Distributors (“JJA”), from which Turning Point sources its Zig-Zag branded cigars.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



By outsourcing the production of products that represent approximately 87% of its gross sales to a select group of producers with whom it has strong relationships, it is able to maintain low overhead costs and minimal capital expenditures, which together drive Turning Point’s margins.
 
Experienced Management Team
 
With an average of 25 years of consumer products experience, including an average of 22 years in the tobacco industry, Turning Point’s senior management team has enabled them to grow and diversify its business while improving operational efficiency. Members of management have previous experience at other leading tobacco companies, including Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip Morris); Liggett & Myers Tobacco Company (now Liggett Group, a subsidiary of Vector Group ltd); Swedish Match; American Brands, Inc.; and U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (a subsidiary of Altria). Notably, Lawrence Wexler, Turning Point’s President and CEO, brings over 20 years of experience from Altria Group, Inc., where he held various leadership positions within the finance, marketing, planning, manufacturing, and sales departments. Given the professional experience of the senior management team Turning Point is able to analyze risks and opportunities from a variety of perspectives. Turning Point’s senior leadership has embraced a collaborative culture in which the combined experience, analytical rigor, and creativity are leveraged to assess opportunities and deliver products that satisfy consumers’ demands.

Growth Strategies
 
Turning Point is focused on building sustainable margin streams, expanding the availability of its products, developing new products through innovation, and enhancing overall operating efficiencies with the goal of improving margins and cash flow. Turning Point adopted the following strategies to drive growth in its business and build stockholder value:
Grow Share of Existing Product Lines, Domestically and Internationally
 
Turning Point intends to remain a consumer centric organization with an innovative view and understanding of the OTP market. Turning Point believes there are meaningful opportunities for growth within the OTP market. Turning Point expects to continue to identify unmet consumer needs and provide quality products that it believes will result in genuine consumer satisfaction and foster the growth of revenue. Turning Point maintains a robust product pipeline and plan to strategically introduce new products in attractive, growing OTP segments, both domestically and internationally. For example, in addition to its successful launch of Stoker’s® smaller 1.2 oz. MST cans, Turning Point believes there are opportunities for new products in the MST pouch, cigar, and MYO cigar wrap markets. Products currently in its pipeline include; Zig-Zag® Natural Leaf Wraps and Zig-Zag® Unbleached/Hemp Paper in the Smoking products segment; and Primal® Hemp Wraps/Cones, Premium e-liquids, and Vape-not-Burn (“VnB”) devices in the NewGen products segment. Turning Point believes it has successfully built strong, powerful brands possessing significant potential.
 
In 2017, less than 5% of its revenues were generated outside of the U.S. Having established a strong infrastructure and negotiated relationships across multiple segments and products, Turning Point is pursuing an international growth strategy to broaden sales and strengthen margins. Turning Point believes international sales represent a meaningful growth opportunity. Turning Point’s goals include expanding its presence in the worldwide OTP industry on a targeted basis. For example, Turning Point is selling its Stoker’s® MST products in South America, Zig-Zag® cigars in Canada, and Primal® herbal wraps and cones internationally. Turning Point intends to pursue a dual path of introducing its own products and brands as well as partnering with other industry leaders to improve market access and profitability in efforts to support its international expansion.
 
Expand into Adjacent Categories through Innovation and New Partnerships
 
Turning Point continually evaluates opportunities to expand into adjacent product categories by leveraging its current portfolio or through new partnerships. In 2009, Turning Point leveraged the Zig-Zag® tobacco brand and introduced Zig-Zag® MYO cigar wraps with favorable results. Turning Point now commands the #1 market share position for that segment. Turning Point is currently expanding its Zig-Zag® MYO cigar wraps through the expansion of the Zig-Zag® ‘Rillo™ size cigar wraps which are similar in size to machine-made cigarillos, the most popular and rapidly growing cigar type. Additionally, in 2015, Turning Point negotiated the worldwide, exclusive distribution rights to an herbal sheet material that does not contain tobacco or nicotine, affording them the opportunity to sell, on a global basis, an assortment of products that meet new and emerging consumer preferences. These products are sold under its Primal® brand name and are a component of its NewGen product segment. Turning Point intends to continue to identify new adjacent categories for which it is able to leverage its existing brands and partnerships.
 
Continue to Grow a Strong NewGen Platform
 
The OTP category is continually evolving as consumers actively seek out new products and product forms. Given this market demand, Turning Point has developed a NewGen product platform which it believes will serve new and evolving consumer demands across multiple product categories. Core products within its existing NewGen segment include:
 
 
· | Electronic cigarette (“e-cigarette”) and vapor products, including e-liquids,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Tobacco vaporizers, which heat rather than combust the smoking material (VnB), and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Herbal smoking products, which contain no tobacco or nicotine.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------



Among these categories, Turning Point believes the emerging liquid vapor segment may present the greatest growth opportunity as it allows each consumer to customize his or her experience by being able to choose both flavor and nicotine level. Although the liquid vapor segment is in its infancy, Turning Point believes that, when properly commercialized, it may be highly disruptive to the combustible cigarette industry and emerge as a more significant segment of the OTP market. Turning Point believes a majority of current liquid vapor revenues are earned outside of the traditional retail environment through online sales or in non-traditional retail outlets. Turning Point’s recent acquisitions of VaporBeast and Vapor Shark accelerate its expansion into the non-traditional retail outlets for liquid vapor products.
 
 Outside of the tobacco space, Turning Point believes there are meaningful opportunities for herbal smoking products like wraps and cones. To capitalize on these opportunities, Turning Point has obtained the exclusive rights to a proprietary and patented herbal sheet process that enables them to meet consumer interest and achieve strong margins. These products are marketed and sold on a worldwide basis under its Primal™ brand as discussed above.
 
 7
 

Turning Point believes the categories within its NewGen segment are poised to be the key industry growth drivers in the future, and Turning Point is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth. Turning Point intends to continue to pursue growth of its NewGen product platform by offering unique and innovative products to address evolving consumer demands.
 
Strategically Pursue Acquisitions
 
Turning Point believes there are meaningful acquisition opportunities in the fragmented OTP space. Turning Point regularly evaluates acquisition opportunities across the OTP landscape. In evaluating acquisition opportunities, its focus is on identifying acquisitions that strengthen its current distribution platform and product offerings or enable category expansion in areas with high potential growth.
 
Substantially all of its 2017 U.S. gross margin was derived from sales of products currently regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Center for Tobacco Products. Turning Point has significant experience in complying with the FDA regulatory regime with a compliance infrastructure composed of legal and scientific professionals. Turning Point believes many smaller OTP manufacturers currently lack this infrastructure, which it believes is necessary to comply with the broad scope of FDA regulations. Turning Point believes its regulatory compliance infrastructure, combined with its skilled management and strong distribution platform, position them to act as a consolidator within the OTP industry.
 
Turning Point has a strong track record of enhancing it OTP business with strategic and accretive acquisitions. For example, Turning Point’s acquisition of the North American Zig-Zag® cigarette papers distribution rights in 1997 has made them the #1 premium cigarette paper brand in the U.S. in terms of retail dollar sales, as measured by Nielsen. Perhaps more importantly, Turning Point owns the Zig-Zag® tobacco trademark in the U.S. and has leveraged this asset effectively with approximately 52% of its total 2017 Zig-Zag branded gross sales under its own Zig-Zag® marks rather than those it licenses from Bolloré. In 2003, Turning Point acquired the Stoker’s® brand. Turning Point has since built the brand to a strong #2 position in the chewing tobacco industry while successfully leveraging the brand’s value through its MST expansion where it remains among the fastest growing MST brands in the industry. More recently, Turning Point has completed three acquisitions to acquire the five smokeless tobacco brands from Wind River in addition to VaporBeast and Vapor Shark.
 
Turning Point will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities as they may arise while exercising care and diligence to ensure it only pursues opportunities believed to afford operational or distribution synergies and add value.
 
Maintain Lean, Low-Cost Operating Model
 
Turning Point has a lean, asset-light manufacturing and sourcing model which requires low capital expenditures and utilizes outsourced supplier relationships. Turning Point believes its asset-light model provides marketplace flexibility and allows them to achieve favorable margins. Turning Point’s market analytics allow them to efficiently and effectively address evolving consumer and market demands. Turning Point’s supplier relationships allow them to increase the breadth of its product offerings and quickly enter new OTP markets as management is able to focus on brand building and innovation. Turning Point intends to continue to optimize its asset-light operating model as it grows in order to maintain a low cost of operations and healthy margins. In 2017, approximately $268 million of its gross sales, or 87%, were from outsourced production operations. Turning Point’s capital expenditures have ranged between $0.7 million and $3.2 million per year over the previous 5 years. Turning Point does not intend to outsource its MST production as a result of its proprietary manufacturing processes which are substantively different than those of its competitors.
Raw Materials, Product Supply, and Inventory Management
 
Turning Point sources its products through a series of longstanding, highly-valued relationships which allows them to conduct their business on an asset-light, distribution-focused basis.
 
The components of inventories at December 31, 2017 and 2016, were as follows (in thousands):

Smokeless Products
 
Turning Point’s loose leaf chewing and moist snuff tobaccos are produced from air-cured and fire-cured leaf tobacco, respectively. Turning Point utilizes recognized suppliers that generally maintain 12- to 24-month supplies of its various types of tobacco at their facilities. Turning Point does not believe it is dependent on any single country or supplier source for tobacco. Turning Point generally maintains up to a two-month supply of finished, loose leaf chewing tobacco and moist snuff. This supply is maintained at their Louisville, Kentucky, facility and in two regional public warehouses to facilitate distribution.
 
Turning Point also utilizes a variety of suppliers for the sourcing of additives used in its smokeless products and for the supply of its packaging materials. Thus, Turning Point believes it is not dependent on a single supplier for these products. There are no current U.S. federal regulations that restrict tobacco flavor additives in smokeless products. The additives that Turning Point uses are food-grade, generally accepted ingredients.
 
All of Turning Point’s loose leaf chewing tobacco production is fulfilled through its agreement with Swedish Match. See the “Distribution and Supply Agreements” section for Turning Point’s discussion of the Swedish Match Manufacturing Agreement. All of Turning Point’s moist snuff products are manufactured at its facility in Dresden, Tennessee. Packaging occurs at the Dresden, Tennessee, location in addition to the facility in Louisville, Kentucky.
 
Smoking Products
 
Pursuant to its distribution agreements with Bolloré (discussed in more detail, below, under the heading “Distribution and Supply Agreements”), Turning Point is required to purchase from Bolloré all cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injecting machines that it sells, subject to Bolloré fulfilling its obligations under these distribution agreements. If Bolloré is unable or unwilling to perform its obligations or ceases its cigarette paper manufacturing operations, in each case, as set forth in the Distribution Agreements, Turning Point may seek third-party suppliers and continue the use of the Zig-Zag® trademark to market these products. To ensure it has a steady supply of premium cigarette paper products, as well as cigarette tubes and injectors, Bolloré is required to maintain, at its expense, a two-month supply of inventory in a bonded, public warehouse in the U.S.
 
Turning Point obtains its MYO cigar wraps from the patent holder under its agreement with Durfort in the Dominican Republic. Turning Point obtains its Zig-Zag branded cigar products under its agreement with JJA, which sources the cigars on its behalf from the Dominican Republic. Turning Point obtains its MYO cigar smoking tobaccos and pipe tobaccos from domestic sources. Turning Point generally purchases these tobaccos through multiple sources; thus, it believes it is not dependent on a single supplier. Turning Point packages these products at its Louisville, Kentucky, facility.
 
NewGen Products
 
Turning Point has sourcing relationships that are capable of providing liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products for other companies’ brands and for producing its own branded product lines in the category, including its Zig-Zag® brand. Turning Point’s acquisitions of VaporBeast and Vapor Shark have (i) accelerated its entry into the non-traditional retail channel, where it believes the majority of liquid vapor products are sold; (ii) provided enhanced distribution of products; and (iii) established a best-in-class distribution platform combining VaporBeast’s non-traditional selling skills with a national, retail sales force.
 
Turning Point’s herbal smoking products are obtained from a supplier which owns the patented process for producing the sheet material. Turning Point has worldwide, exclusive rights to the material. The production and packaging of its herbal smoking products is subject to an agreement with Durfort. Durfort manufactures and packages the finished goods in the Dominican Republic, subject to Turning Point’s specifications, and coordinates with JJA delivery of the products to its designated distribution center in the U.S. Turning Point believes its early entry into the herbal smoking products market has provided them with a meaningful opportunity to capture market share and increase this share as the market grows.

Turning Point is party to two long-term distribution and license agreements with Bolloré with respect to sales of cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injector machines—one with respect to distribution in the U.S. and one with respect to distribution in Canada (collectively, the “Distribution Agreements”). Under the Distribution Agreements, Bolloré granted Turning Point the exclusive right to purchase products bearing the Zig-Zag® brand name from Bolloré for resale in the U.S. and Canada. Turning Point has the sole right to determine pricing and other terms upon which it may resell any products purchased from Bolloré, including the right to determine the ultimate distributors of such products within these countries. Furthermore, on March 19, 2013, Turning Point entered into an additional License and Distribution Agreement with Bolloré (the “Bolloré License Agreement”), which permits them the exclusive use of the Zig-Zag® brand name in the U.S. for e-cigarettes and any related accessories, including vaporizers and e-liquids. The Bolloré License Agreement terminates upon termination of the Distribution Agreements.

Each of the Distribution Agreements were entered into on November 30, 1992, by a predecessor in interest for an initial twenty-year term. The Distribution Agreements automatically renewed in November 2012 for a second twenty-year term and will automatically renew for successive twenty-year terms unless terminated in accordance with the provisions of such agreement. The Distribution Agreements provide that, in order to assure each of the parties receives commercially reasonable profits in light of inflationary trends and currency fluctuation factors, 120 days prior to December 31, 2004, and each fifth-year anniversary from such date thereafter, the parties are required to enter into good faith negotiations to agree on an index and currency adjustment formula to replace the index and formula currently in effect. If the parties are unable to agree, the dispute is to be submitted to binding arbitration. Pursuant to the Distribution Agreements, if at any time the price received by Bolloré fails to cover its costs, Bolloré may give Turning Point notice of this deficiency, and the parties must promptly negotiate in good faith to adjust prices. If the parties cannot agree on new prices, Turning Point may purchase products from an alternative supplier reasonably acceptable to Bolloré until the next price adjustment period (subject to certain price-matching rights available to Bolloré and other terms and conditions). As of March 1, 2018, Turning Point is operating under a temporary pricing structure and formula. The parties are considering a modified pricing formula and a potential new index and duration; however, there is no guarantee that Turning Point will be able to reach a new pricing agreement with Bolloré at all or on terms satisfactory to Turning Point. Further, Bolloré sources its needs for our orders from an affiliate of one of Turning Point’s competitors. See “Risk Factors—Turning Point depends on a small number of key third-party suppliers and producers for its products” for further details.
 
Pursuant to the Distribution Agreements, export duties, insurance, and shipping costs are the responsibility of Bolloré. Import duties and taxes in the U.S. and Canada are its responsibility. Under the Distribution Agreements, Turning Point must purchase cigarette papers, cigarette tubes, and cigarette injector machines from Bolloré, subject to Bolloré fulfilling its obligations under these agreements. Bolloré is required to provide them with the quantities of the products that Turning Point orders consistent with specific order-to-delivery timelines detailed in the agreement. The Distribution Agreements provide them with certain safeguards to ensure that it will be able to secure a steady supply of product, including (i) granting Turning Point the right to seek third-party suppliers with continued use of the Zig-Zag® trademark if Bolloré is unable to perform its obligations or ceases its cigarette paper manufacturing operation, in each case as set forth in the Distribution Agreements, and (ii) maintaining a two-month supply of safety stock inventory of the premium papers, tubes, and injector machines in the U.S. at Bolloré’s expense.
 
Under the Distribution Agreements, Turning Point has agreed that for a period of five years after the termination of the agreements Turning Point will not engage, directly or indirectly, in the manufacturing, selling, distributing, marketing, or otherwise promoting, in the U.S. and Canada, of cigarette paper or cigarette paper booklets of a competitor without Bolloré’s consent, except for certain de minimis acquisitions of debt or equity securities of such a competitor and certain activities with respect to an alternative supplier used by Turning Point as permitted under the Distribution Agreements.
 
Each of the Distribution Agreements permits Bolloré to terminate such agreement (i) if certain minimum purchases (which, in the case of both Distribution Agreements, have been significantly exceeded in recent years) of cigarette paper booklets have not been made by them for resale in the jurisdiction covered by such agreement within a calendar year, (ii) if Turning Point assigns such agreement without the consent of Bolloré, (iii) upon a change of control without the consent of Bolloré, (iv) upon certain acquisitions of its equity securities by one of its competitors or certain investments by its significant stockholders in one of its competitors, (v) upon certain material breaches, including its agreement not to promote, directly or indirectly, cigarette paper or cigarette paper booklets of a competitor, or (vi) upon its bankruptcy, insolvency, liquidation, or other similar event. Additionally, the Canada Distribution Agreement is terminable by either Turning Point or Bolloré upon the termination of the U.S. Distribution Agreement.
 
Swedish Match Manufacturing Agreement
 
On September 4, 2008, Turning Point entered into a manufacturing and distribution agreement with Swedish Match whereby Swedish Match became the exclusive manufacturer of its loose leaf chewing tobacco. Under the agreement, production of Turning Point’s loose leaf chewing tobacco products was completely transitioned to Swedish Match’s plant located in Owensboro, Kentucky, on September 18, 2009. Turning Point sources all of the tobacco Swedish Match uses to manufacture its products along with certain proprietary flavorings and retain all marketing, design, formula, and trademark rights over its loose leaf products. Turning Point also has the right to approve all product modifications and is solely responsible for decisions related to package design and branding of the loose leaf tobacco produced for Turning Point. Responsibilities related to process control, manufacturing activities, and inventory management with respect to its loose leaf products are allocated between Turning Point and Swedish Match as specified in the agreement. Turning Point also has rights to monitor production and quality control processes on an ongoing basis.
 
The agreement had an initial ten-year term and will automatically be renewed for five successive ten-year terms unless either party provides at least 180 days’ notice prior to a renewal term of its intent to terminate the agreement, or unless otherwise terminated by mutual agreement of the parties in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. If a notice of non-renewal is delivered, the contract will expire two years after the date on which the agreement would have otherwise been renewed. The terms allow the agreement to be assumed by a buyer, terminated for uncured material breach, or terminated by Turning Point subject to a buyout. Turning Point also holds a right of first refusal to acquire the manufacturing plant as well as Swedish Match’s chewing tobacco unit.

JJA Distributors Service Agreement
 
On April 1, 2013 Turning Point entered into an agreement with JJA to source Turning Point’s Zig-Zag branded cigars and cigarillos and other products from the Dominican Republic. Under the agreement, JJA and its Dominican Republic partner purchase and inventory all of the necessary raw materials, including packaging bearing Turning Point’s intellectual property, manufacture to its specifications, and deliver to its designated U.S. distribution center. Turning Point retains all marketing, design, and trademark rights over its cigar products.
Production and Quality Control
 
Turning Point primarily outsources its manufacturing and production processes and focus on packaging, marketing, and distribution. Turning Point currently manufactures approximately 13% of its products as measured by gross sales. Turning Point’s in-house manufacturing operations are limited to (i) the processing and packaging of its pipe tobacco products, which is completed at its manufacturing facility in Louisville, Kentucky, (ii) the manufacturing of its moist snuff products, which occurs at its facility in Dresden, Tennessee, (iii) the packaging of its moist snuff products at Turning Point’s facilities in Dresden, Tennessee, and Louisville, Kentucky, and, with the acquisition of Vapor Shark, (iv) the manufacturing of e-liquids at our Miami, Florida, facility. Turning Point’s MST products are processed in-house, rather than outsourced, as a result of Turning Point’s proprietary manufacturing processes which are substantively different than those of its competitors.
 
Turning Point uses proprietary production processes and techniques, including strict quality controls. Turning Point’s quality control group routinely tests the quality of the tobacco, flavorings, application of flavorings, premium cigarette papers, tubes and injectors, cigars, MYO cigar wraps, liquid vapor products, tobacco vaporizer products, and packaging materials. Turning Point utilizes sophisticated quality controls to test and closely monitor the quality of its products. The high quality of its tobacco products is largely the result of using high-grade tobacco leaf and food-grade flavorings and, on an ongoing basis, analyzing the tobacco cut, flavorings, and moisture content together with strict specifications for sourced products.
 
Given the importance of contract manufacturing to Turning Point’s business, its quality control group ensures that established, written procedures and standards are adhered to by each of its contract manufacturers. Responsibilities related to process control, manufacturing activities, quality control, and inventory management with respect to its loose leaf are allocated between Turning Point and Swedish Match under the manufacturing agreement.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Turning Point has grown the size and capacity of its sales force and intends to continue strengthening the organization to advance its ability to deepen and broaden the retail availability of its products and brands.
 
As of December 31, 2017, Turning Point had a nationwide sales and marketing organization of approximately 145 professionals.  Turning Point’s sales and marketing group focuses on priority markets and sales channels and seeks to operate with a high level of efficiency. In 2017, Turning Point’s sales and marketing efforts enabled its products to reach an estimated 200,000 retail doors in North America and over 800 direct wholesale customers with an additional 100 secondary, indirect wholesalers in the U.S.
 
Turning Point’s sales efforts are focused on wholesale distributors and retail merchants in the independent and chain convenience store, tobacco outlet, food store, mass merchandising, drug store, and non-traditional retail channels. Turning Point has expanded, and intend to continue to expand, the sales of its products into previously underdeveloped geographic markets and retail channels. In 2017, Turning Point derived more than 95% of its net sales from sales in the U.S., with the remainder primarily from sales in Canada.
 
Turning Point subscribes to a sales tracking system from MSAi that records all traditional OTP product shipments (Turning Point as well as those of its competitors) from approximately 900 wholesalers to over 250,000 retail stores in the U.S. This system enables them to understand individual product share and volume trends across multiple categories down to the individual retail store level, allowing them to allocate field sales force coverage to the highest opportunity stores. Additionally, the ability to select from a range of parameters and to achieve this level of granularity means Turning Point can analyze marketplace trends in a timely manner and swiftly evolve its business planning to meet market opportunities.
 
Turning Point employs marketing activities to grow awareness, trial, and sales including selective trade advertising to expand wholesale availability, point-of-sale advertising and merchandising and permanent and temporary displays to improve consumer visibility, and social media. Turning Point complies with all regulations relating to the marketing of tobacco products, such as directing marketing efforts to adult consumers, and are committed to full legal compliance in the sales and marketing of its products. To date, Turning Point has neither relied upon, nor conducted, any substantial advertising in the consumer media for its products.

In the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, Turning Point did not have any customer that accounted for 10% or more of its gross sales. Turning Point’s customers use an open purchase order system to buy its products and are not obligated to do so pursuant to ongoing contractual obligations. Turning Point performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral on trade receivables. Historically, Turning Point has not experienced material credit losses. Sales to customers within its NewGen segment are generally prepaid.
 
Competition
 
Many of Turning Point’s competitors are better capitalized than they are and have greater resources, financial and otherwise. Turning Point believes its ability to effectively compete and strong market positions in its principal product lines are due to the high recognition of its brand names, the perceived quality of each of its products, and the efforts of its sales, marketing, and distribution teams. Turning Point competes against “big tobacco,” including Altria Group, Inc. (formerly Philip Morris); British American Tobacco p.l.c. (formerly Reynolds); Swedish Match; Swisher International; and manufacturers including U.K. based Imperial Brands, PLC, across its segments. “Big tobacco” has substantial resources and a customer base that has historically demonstrated loyalty to their brands.
 
Competition in the OTP market is based upon not only brand quality and positioning but also on price, packaging, promotion, and retail availability and visibility. Given the decreasing prevalence of cigarette consumption, the “big tobacco” companies continue to demonstrate an increased interest and participation in a number of OTP markets.
 
Smokeless Products
 
Turning Point’s three principal competitors in the loose leaf chewing tobacco market are Swedish Match, the American Snuff Company, LLC (a unit of British American Tobacco p.l.c.), and Swisher International Group, Inc. Turning Point believes moist snuff products are used interchangeably with loose leaf products by many consumers. In the moist snuff category, Turning Point faces the same competitors with the addition of U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company (a division of Altria Group, Inc.).
Smoking Products
 
Turning Point’s two major competitors for premium cigarette paper sales are Republic Tobacco, L.P., and Commonwealth Brands, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Imperial Brands, PLC. Turning Point’s two major competitors for MYO cigar wraps are New Image Global, Inc., and Blunt Wrap USA. In cigars, it competes in the non-tipped cigarillo market with Swisher International, Inc., Swedish Match, and Good Times USA.
 
NewGen Products
 
In the NewGen products segment, its competitors are varied as the market is relatively new and highly fragmented. Turning Point’s direct competitors sell products that are substantially similar to its products through the same channels in which Turning Point sells its liquid vapor products and tobacco vaporizer products. Turning Point competes with these direct competitors for sales through wholesalers and retailers including, but not limited to, vapor stores, national chain stores, tobacco shops, and convenience stores. Through its acquisitions of VaporBeast and Vapor Shark, Turning Point now also competes directly with other non-traditional distributors and retailers.
 
Patents, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets
 
Turning Point has numerous registered trademarks relating to its products, including: Beech-Nut®, Trophy®, Havana Blossom®, Durango®, Stoker’s®, Tequila Sunrise®, Fred’s Choice®, Old Hillside®, Our Pride®, Red Cap®, Tennessee Chew®, Big Mountain®, Springfield Standard®, Snake River®, VaporBeast®, and Vapor Shark®. The registered trademarks, which are significant to its business, expire periodically and are renewable for additional 10-year terms upon expiration. Flavor and blend formula trade secrets relating to its tobacco products, which are key assets of its businesses, are maintained under strict secrecy. The Zig-Zag® trade name and trademark for premium cigarette papers and related products are owned by Bolloré and have been exclusively licensed to Turning Point in the U.S. and Canada. The Zig-Zag® trade name and trademark for e-cigarette and vaporizers are also owned by Bolloré and have been exclusively licensed to Turning Point in the U.S. Turning Point own the Zig-Zag® trademark with respect to its use in connection with products made with tobacco including, without limitation, cigarettes, cigars, and MYO cigar wraps in the U.S.

Research and Development and Quality Assurance
 
Turning Point has a research and development and quality assurance function that tests raw materials and finished products in order to maintain a high level of product quality and consistency. Research and development largely bases its new product development efforts on its high-tech data systems. Turning Point spent approximately $1.9 million, $1.8 million, and $1.4 million dollars on research and development and quality control efforts for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Standard Outdoor
 
Business Strategy
 
As of March 1, 2018, following the 2018 acquisitions described above under Recent Developments, Standard Outdoor owns and operates a total of 174 billboard structures in Georgia and Florida (86 billboard structures), Alabama (83 billboard structures) and Texas (5 billboard structures).  All of Standard Outdoor’s billboard structures are on properties that it leases under leases with terms ranging from 10 to 99 years, often with renewal or extension options. Standard Outdoor’s lease obligations vary under these arrangements. Under some leases, Standard Outdoor has no obligations other than to maintain the billboard structures and, in other instances, Standard Outdoor has certain obligations to maintain the real estate on which the billboard structures are located.
 
Standard Outdoor owns and operates traditional billboard structures, where the customer’s advertising copy is printed with computer-generated graphics on a single sheet of vinyl and wrapped around the billboard structure, as well as digital displays.  Many of Standard Outdoor’s billboard structures are located on major highways and target vehicular traffic. Standard Outdoor’s contracts with advertisers are typically short-term (e.g., one month to one year).
 
Standard Outdoor’s billboard structures may have multiple faces. Standard Outdoor believes the out-of-home advertising business offers attractive industry fundamentals and growth opportunities on which Standard Outdoor hopes to capitalize as it increases is presence in various regions in the United States.
 
Standard Outdoor typically owns the physical structures on which its clients’ advertising copy is displayed. Standard Outdoor acquires new structures from third parties and erect them on sites that it leases or for which it has acquired permanent easements.  In addition to the site leases described above, Standard Outdoor generally must obtain from state or local government a permit to build and operate each billboard structure.
 
Competition
 
The outdoor billboard industry is highly competitive. There is a concentration in the ownership of billboards in the geographic markets in which Standard Outdoor competes and significantly larger companies such as Clear Channel Outdoor Communications, OUTFRONT Media Inc. and Lamar Advertising Company, dominate the out-of-home advertising business.  In addition, Standard Outdoor competes with other outdoor advertising solutions, including street furniture (for example, bus shelters and benches), transit and other alternative advertising signs.
Pillar General
 
Business Strategy
 
As of January 2, 2018, following the acquisition of Interboro as described above under Recent Developments, Pillar General has entered the insurance business.  Maidstone, a wholly owned subsidiary of Interboro, offers personal automobile insurance, primarily in the State of New York, with approximately 11,500 policies in-force. In addition, Maidstone is entertaining the possibility of beginning to write homeowner’s insurance coverage in New York.
 
Maidstone sources, writes and services automobile insurance policies using a network of independently licensed and appointed agents and brokers, and currently does not market its products directly to consumers. Maidstone’s broker network currently consists of approximately 750-plus brokers in New York with demonstrated competency in writing automobile insurance in locations that are consistent with Maidstone’s risk appetite and underwriting capabilities, and Maidstone will continue to assess appointing additional agents and brokers in territories where Maidstone does not have a strong presence, enabling Maidstone to further grow and diversify its policyholder base.
 
 Maidstone has an in-house claims department of seasoned claims professionals that works with outside attorneys. Maidstone’s management handles decisions on claim settlements and payment. Should Maidstone enter the homeowner’s sector, it expects to use outside adjusters with expertise in adjusting larger property claims to adjust homeowner’s claims, and to engage a nationally recognized adjusting firm to assist with potential catastrophic events.
 
Maidstone runs a balanced investment strategy, the main tenets of which are, in order of priority, capital conservation, current income and long-term growth of capital and income.

Competition
 
Our insurance business operates in an environment that is highly competitive and very fragmented. We compete with other insurance providers, including but not limited to substantially larger competitors such as GEICO, State Farm, Progressive, Liberty Mutual and Travelers, as well as numerous specialist, regional and local firms in almost every area of our business. Further, new competitors may regularly enter the market. Any additional industries or markets that we may enter through future acquisitions will also likely be occupied by established competitors.
Employees
 
Including our operating subsidiaries as described below, we employed approximately 356 persons at March 1, 2018. Turning Point employed 289 persons. Maidstone Insurance Company employed 58 persons.  Standard Outdoor employed 6 persons. None of our employees are represented by unions. We believe we have a positive relationship with our employees.
