Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering the development of novel therapies in the emerging fields of cell therapy and regenerative medicine. We are focused on developing therapies to treat conditions with high unmet medical needs, with an initial focus on the therapeutic areas of neurology and oncology. We have two core technology platforms.  The first is a type of stem cell capable of becoming all of the cell types in the human body, a property called pluripotency. The second is a type of cell called “dendritic cells” used to teach cancer patients’ immune systems to attack their tumors. We currently have three clinical stage programs based on these platforms:

· | AST-OPC1 is a therapy derived from pluripotent stem cells that is currently in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for spinal cord injuries (“SCI”);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AST-VAC1 is a patient-specific cancer immunotherapy focusing on Acute Myeloid Leukemia (“AML”); and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | AST-VAC2 is a non-patient-specific cancer immunotherapy for which the initiation of a Phase 1/2a clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer is planned for 2017.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We believe that our technology platforms have the potential for application in additional indications, such as advanced multiple sclerosis and white matter stroke for AST-OPC1 and other additional cancer indications for our cancer immunotherapy platform. We were incorporated in Delaware on September 24, 2012.  In October of 2013, we acquired intellectual property, cell lines, preclinical and clinical data, and other assets from Geron Corporation (“Geron”) and also acquired rights to use certain human embryonic stem (“hES”) cell lines and to practice certain patents from BioTime, Inc. (“BioTime”).  Our two core technology platforms are supported by assets acquired from these transactions.  Prior to May 13, 2016, we were a majority-owned and controlled subsidiary of BioTime.
 
 We use hES cells as the starting cells for the production of AST-OPC1 and AST-VAC2. hES cells have almost unlimited capacity to expand and can be differentiated into the various cell types of the body. For AST-OPC1, Asterias has developed methods to produce a oligodendrocyte progenitor cells to help repair spinal cord injury lesions. Likewise for AST-VAC2 , the hES cells are induced to become dendritic cells which educate the immune system to target telomerase, a protein produced by most tumor cells.
 
Asterias uses hES cells rather than adult stem cells as the starting material for the production of its cell therapies for many reasons. Compared to adult stem cells, hES cells have a higher capacity to proliferate and therefore their production can be scaled to meet therapeutic demands. This feature is in contrast with adult stem cells which have a much lower propensity to proliferate and, for many therapeutics applications, require repeated harvesting. In addition, adult stem cells produce a much narrower range of cells types than hES cells. We believe hES cells have more therapeutic applications because they can form most cell types of the body.


Products Under Development
 
AST-OPC1
 
About AST-OPC1
 
Our AST-OPC1 product candidate is comprised of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which are cells that become oligodendrocytes after injection, derived from a current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) master cell bank of undifferentiated hES cells that has been fully qualified for human use. These cells, which are stored frozen until ready for use, are produced under cGMP conditions and screened for adventitious agents.
 
Oligodendrocytes are nature’s neural insulating cells. Like the insulation covering an electrical wire, oligodendrocytes enable the conduction of electrical impulses along nerve fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. They are also known to promote neural growth, as well as induce blood vessel formation around nerve axons. AST-OPC1 cells have been shown to reproduce the natural functions of oligodendrocytes in animals.
 
AST-OPC1 cells have been shown to reproduce the natural functions of oligodendrocytes in animals, including three potentially reparative functions that address the complex pathologies observed at the injury site of a spinal cord injury. These activities of AST-OPC1 include production of neurotrophic factors, stimulation of vascularization, and induction of remyelination of denuded axons, all of which are critical for survival, regrowth and conduction of nerve impulses through axons at the injury site. In preclinical animal testing, AST-OPC1 administration led to remyelination of axons, improved hindlimb and forelimb locomotor function, dramatic reductions in injury-related cavitation and significant preservation of myelinated axons traversing the injury site.

Clinical Studies
 
Phase 1 Study in Patients with Thoracic Spinal Cord Injuries
 
In a Phase 1 clinical trial, five patients with neurologically complete, thoracic spinal cord injury were administered two million AST-OPC1 cells at the spinal cord injury site 7-14 days post-injury. They also received low levels of immunosuppression for the next 60 days. Delivery of AST-OPC1 was successful in all five subjects with no serious adverse events associated with the administration of the cells, with AST-OPC1 itself, or the immunosuppressive regimen. All five patients have completed at least five years of follow-up visits.  No evidence of rejection of AST-OPC1 was observed in detailed immune response monitoring of all patients. In four of the five patients, serial MRI scans indicated that reduced spinal cord cavitation may have occurred. There have been five minor adverse events possibly related to AST-OPC1 such as transient fever and nerve pain. There have been no unexpected neurological changes to date.  Based on the results of this study, we received clearance from FDA to test AST-OPC1 in patients with complete cervical spine injuries, which represents the first targeted population for registration trials.
Phase 1/2a Study in Patients with Complete Cervical Spinal Cord Injuries
 
Based on the results of the completed Phase 1 trial of AST-OPC1 in thoracic spinal cord injury, we obtained permission from the FDA in August 2014 to initiate a Phase 1/2a dose escalation trial in patients with neurologically complete (AIS-A) cervical spinal cord injuries (the “SciStar study”). In May 2016, we were granted FDA clearance to expand patient enrollment to include two additional cohorts of patients with motor complete, sensory incomplete (AIS-B) cervical spinal cord injury.  The SCiStar Phase 1/2a study is an open-label, single-arm trial testing three sequential escalating doses of AST-OPC1 administered at up to 20 million AST-OPC1 cells in as many as 35 patients with sub-acute, C-5 to C-7, motor complete (AIS-A or AIS-B) cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI). These individuals have essentially lost all movement below their injury site and experience severe paralysis of the upper and lower limbs. AIS-A patients have lost all motor and sensory function below their injury site, while AIS-B patients have lost all motor function but may retain some minimal sensory function below their injury site. AST-OPC1 is being administered 14 to 30 days post-injury. Patients will be followed by neurological exams and imaging procedures to assess the safety and activity of the product.
 
We completed enrollment in the first (AIS-A; two million cells) dose cohort in August 2015, and of the second (AIS-A; 10 million cells) dose cohort in August 2016. We are currently open for concurrent enrollment in the third (AIS-A; 20 million cells) and fourth (AIS-B; 10 million cells) cohorts. No serious adverse events related to AST-OPC1 or the administration procedure have been observed to date. In September 2016, we announced early but promising interim efficacy data for the AIS-A patients that had been dosed with 10 million AST-OPC1 cells and completed their 3 month follow-up.
 
In January 2017, we announced additional interim efficacy data from the study on the patients who were enrolled and dosed in the AIS-A 10 million-cell cohort, which we later updated in March 2017, which included the following observations:
 
Improvements in Motor Function
 
 
· | Upper Extremity Motor Score - For the six patients dosed in the AIS-A 10 million-cell cohort, all six patients (100%) saw their early improvements in upper extremity motor score (“UEMS”) at 3 months maintained or further increased through their most recent data point (6 months or 9 months, depending on the most recent data available for each patient).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Motor Level Improvement - For the six patients, all six patients (100%) have achieved at least a one motor level improvement (using the ISNCSCI scale) over baseline on at least one side, and two of six (33%) have achieved two motor levels over baseline on at least one side, with one of these patients achieving a two motor level improvement on both sides.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 3
 

 
· | Matched Historical Control Data - We and other key experts in the spinal cord injury field have developed a set of matched historical control data for both UEMS and Motor Level Improvement to document expected spontaneous recovery in untreated patients for comparison to results seen in patients treated with AST-OPC1. The key results from this analysis showed a meaningful difference in the motor function recovery seen to date in the six patients treated with the 10 million cell dose of AST-OPC1. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Safety
 
 
· | The trial results from the SciStar Phase 1/2a study continued to reveal a positive safety profile for AST-OPC1. There have been no serious adverse events related to AST-OPC1 and data from the study indicate that AST-OPC1 can be safely administered to patients in the subacute period after severe cervical spinal cord injury.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We expect to complete enrollment of the SciStar Phase 1/2a study in the second half of 2017, with interim updates occurring at various times in 2017 and 2018.
 
Manufacturing and Process Development
 
We have sufficient existing clinical-grade lots of AST-OPC1 for the ongoing SciStar Phase 1/2a trial, and are in the process of establishing additional cGMP master and working cell banks of undifferentiated hES cells of the H1 cell line for future clinical development and commercial use. We are also updating the manufacturing and clinical delivery process so AST-OPC1 can be manufactured on a larger scale to support any future registration trial and commercial needs.
 
In January 2017, we announced that we had completed the validation and start-up of our internal cGMP manufacturing facility at our headquarters in Fremont, CA. This facility will be used to produce additional cGMP cell banks and AST-OPC1 to supply any future registration trial and commercial drug supply.
 
Market Conditions
 
It is estimated that there are approximately 17,000 new spinal cord injuries annually in the United States (NSCISC SCI Facts and Figures at a Glance (2016)).  Individuals with neurologically complete cervical spinal cord injury are part of an orphan population with a severe unmet medical need due to the loss of function in all four limbs.  These individuals frequently require significant assistance for their care and activities of daily living. A published study estimated the lifetime costs of care for a person who suffers a cervical SCI at age 25 to up to $5.4 million (Y. C. Cao and M. J. DeVivo (2011)).
 
There are currently no drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) specifically for the treatment of spinal cord injury, although methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid generally used as an anti-inflammatory drug, is sometimes prescribed on an off-label basis to reduce acute inflammation in the injured spinal cord immediately after injury. It is believed that in order to effect substantial benefit in treating this complex injury, multiple mechanisms of action are required, such as re-myelination of the demyelinated axons, generation of new blood vessels to repair the ischemic damage from injury, and the presence of biologics that cause neuro-sprouting or new nerve growth to enable the severed axons to repair. In pre-clinical studies to date, AST-OPC1 cells have been shown to exhibit all three effects.
 
In February 2016, we announced that the FDA had granted our application for Orphan Drug Designation of AST-OPC1 for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.
 
CIRM Grant and other Funding
 
In October 2014, we signed a Notice of Grant Award (“NGA”) with the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (“CIRM”), effective October 1, 2014, with respect to a $14.3 million grant award for clinical development of AST-OPC1. The NGA, as amended, includes the terms under which CIRM will release grant funds to us. Under the NGA, as amended on March 2, 2016, CIRM will disburse the grant funds to us based on our attainment of certain progress milestones.

To date, we have received $12.8 million under the NGA. There can be no assurance we will receive the remaining $1.5 million.  We will need to raise additional capital in order to conduct subsequent clinical trials and to complete product development work necessary for larger trials and commercialization. We intend to continue to seek additional non-dilutive funding through CIRM and other sources to develop this product.
 
AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2
 
We are developing two experimental immunotherapeutic programs, AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2, each designed to attack cancer cells by targeting the cancer cell’s expression of telomerase. Both product candidates use an immune cell type known as dendritic cells to stimulate immune responses to telomerase. Dendritic cells are antigen processing and presenting cells which are potent initiators of a cellular and antibody-mediated immune response. Telomerase is a ubiquitous cancer antigen, expressed at high levels in nearly all human cancers, but at very low levels or not at all in normal human cells. The premise underlying these vaccines is to “teach” the patient’s own immune system to attack cancer cells while sparing other normal healthy cells.
 
AST-VAC1
 
About AST-VAC1
 
AST-VAC1 is an autologous product candidate, or a product that is derived from cells that come from the treated patient. AST-VAC1 consists of mature antigen-presenting dendritic cells pulsed with RNA for the protein component of human telomerase (“hTERT”) and a portion of a lysosomal targeting signal (“LAMP”). LAMP directs the telomerase RNA to the lysosome, the subcellular organelle that directs the RNA to a particular part of the cell membrane. AST-VAC1 is injected into the patient’s skin, with the objective of having the dendritic cells travel to the lymph nodes and instruct cytotoxic T-cells to kill cancerous tumor cells that express telomerase on their surface.
Process Development
 
On August 3, 2016, we entered into a Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with Cognate BioServices, Inc. (“Cognate”), a fully-integrated contract bioservices organization providing development and cGMP manufacturing services to companies and institutions engaged in the development of cell-based products.  Under the Services Agreement, Cognate is performing process development studies in support of our clinical and commercial development activities of AST-VAC1 and production and manufacturing services of AST-VAC1 under cGMP.
Clinical Studies
 
A Phase 2 clinical trial of AST-VAC1 was conducted in patients with AML in complete clinical remission. This trial completed patient enrollment in December 2009. Thirty-three patients with AML entered the study in their first or second complete remission. Prior to or shortly after completing consolidation chemotherapy, patients underwent leukapheresis, a process of collecting white blood cells directly from the patient. AST-VAC1 was produced at a centralized manufacturing facility from the patient-specific white blood cells. Patient blood cells were differentiated to dendritic cells in culture, modified to express telomerase linked to the LAMP targeting signal, aliquoted and cryopreserved. AST-VAC1 was released for patient dosing contingent on several product specifications that included identity of mature dendritic cells, confirmation of telomerase expression, number of viable cells per dose after thawing, and product sterility.
 
Twenty-one patients received AST-VAC1 in the study, including 19 in clinical remission and two in early relapse. AST-VAC1 was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study over multiple vaccinations, with up to 32 serial vaccinations administered (median = 17). Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (bleeding into the skin caused by low platelets in blood) (grade 3-4) was reported in one patient. Other toxicities (grade 1-2) included rash or headache.  Patient immune response to telomerase after vaccination with AST-VAC1 was evaluated using a test called the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (“ELISPOT”) assay to measure the presence of activated T-cells specific to hTERT. Positive immune responses were detected in 55% of patients.

We subsequently performed follow-up data collection on the 19 patients treated in complete remission to determine the long-term effects of the AST-VAC1 administration on remission duration and disease-free survival. Eleven of 19 patients (58%) remained in complete remission at a median follow-up of 52 months. These results compare to historical data suggesting that between 20-40% of patients would be expected to be relapse free at 3-4 years. Additionally, of the 7 patients in the higher risk over 60 year old group, 4 (57%) remained relapse free at a median follow up of 54 months. Historically, relapse free survival rates in this population have been 10-20% at 3-4 years.
 
The next major step in clinical development for AST-VAC1 would be to conduct a confirmatory Phase 2b study in higher risk patients over 60 years old.  We will need to receive additional sufficient funding prior to the commencement of such a study.
 
AST-VAC2
 
About AST-VAC2
 
AST-VAC2 is an allogeneic, or non-patient specific, cancer vaccine candidate designed to stimulate patient immune responses to telomerase. AST-VAC2 is produced from hES cells and can be modified with any antigen. We believe that the use of hES, as opposed to collecting and using the patient’s own blood, as the starting material for AST-VAC2 provides a scalable system for the production of a large number of vaccine doses in a single lot. Allogeneic vaccine production has the potential to have lower manufacturing costs, provide “off-the-shelf” availability which provides broader access to patients, and ensure greater product consistency. In addition, we believe that this approach has the potential to stimulate a more robust immune response through an adjuvant effect of the immune mismatch between the genetic makeup of AST-VAC2 and patients receiving the therapy. Further, we believe AST-VAC2 may be synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors currently in development for many cancer indications. This is because immune checkpoint inhibitors function by relieving suppressive mechanisms exerted on T-cells by the tumor, whereas AST-VAC2 is designed to specifically instruct the T-cells to kill cancerous tumor cells that express telomerase on their surface.
Clinical Trial and Option Agreement with Cancer Research UK
 
During September 2014, we entered into a Clinical Trial and Option Agreement with Cancer Research UK (“CRUK”) and Cancer Research Technology Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CRUK (the “CRUK Agreement”). Under the CRUK Agreement, CRUK has agreed to fund Phase 1/2a clinical development of our AST-VAC2 product candidate loaded with the same LAMP-telomerase construct we have used in AST-VAC1. Under the terms of the CRUK Agreement, we are responsible, at our own cost, for completing process development and manufacturing scale-up of the AST-VAC2 manufacturing process and transferring the resulting cGMP-compatible process to CRUK. CRUK is responsible, at its own cost, for manufacturing clinical grade AST-VAC2 and for carrying out the Phase 1/2a clinical trial of AST-VAC2.
 
In January 2016, we announced that we had completed the technology transfer of the AST-VAC2 manufacturing process to CRUK. The next step is for CRUK’s Centre for Drug Development (“CDD”) to submit a Clinical Trial Authorization application to the UK regulatory authorities for the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which will be sponsored, managed and funded by CDD. The study will administer AST-VAC2 to treat up to 24 patients with either advanced or resected NSCLC to examine the safety, immunogenicity and activity of AST-VAC2 and position the immunotherapy for future clinical trials. We expect patient enrollment for this study to begin in the second half of 2017.  We will continue to serve in a collaborative and advisory role with CRUK throughout this process.
 
Upon completion of the Phase 1/2a study, we will have an exclusive first option to acquire the data generated in the trial. If we exercise that option we will be obligated to make payments upon the execution of the license agreement and, upon the achievement of various milestones, as well as make royalty payments on sales of products. In connection with the CRUK Agreement, we sublicensed to CRUK for use in the clinical trials and product manufacturing process certain patents that have been licensed or sublicensed to us by third parties. We would also be obligated to make payments to those licensors and sublicensors upon the achievement of various milestones, and then royalties on sales of products if AST-VAC2 is successfully developed and commercialized.

Services Agreement with Cell Therapy Catapult Services Limited
 
In October 2015, we entered into a Services Agreement (the “Services Agreement”) with Cell Therapy Catapult Services Limited (“Catapult”), a research organization specializing in the development of technologies which speed the growth of the cell and gene therapy industry. Under the Services Agreement, Catapult will license to us, certain background intellectual property and will develop a scalable manufacturing and differentiation process for our AST-VAC2 development program. In consideration for the license and Catapult’s performance of services, we agreed to make aggregate payments of up to GBP £4,350,000 over the five years after the execution of the Services Agreement. At our option of, up to GBP £3,600,000 of such payments may be settled in shares of our Series A Common Stock. As of December 31, 2016, we have incurred costs since commencement of the Services Agreement of GBP £1,700,000 under the Services Agreement.
 
The Services Agreement may be terminated by us for any reason upon 60 days prior written notice. Catapult may terminate the Services Agreement on 60 days prior written notice if it encounters a technical issue that would prevent it from completing the services at all or without obtaining additional resources or if the estimated time and cost of completing the services will be exceeded and both parties do not reach agreement on revised time and cost terms. Catapult may terminate the Services Agreement in the event we fail to pay any amount due under the Services Agreement 30 days after Catapult makes a written demand for payment. In addition, a non-breaching party may terminate the Services Agreement upon the occurrence a material breach that is not remedied within 30 days. Either party may terminate the Services Agreement in the event the other party becomes subject to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or a similar event.
 
Intellectual Property
 
The patent portfolio that we acquired pursuant to the Asset Contribution Agreement with Geron, dated January 4, 2013 (the “Asset Contribution Agreement”), includes approximately 400 patents and patent applications previously owned by or licensed to Geron that are directed to pluripotent stem (“pPS”) cell-, hES cell-, and dendritic cell-based product opportunities. The portfolio encompasses a number of cell types that can be made from pPS cells, including hepatocytes (liver cells), cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), neural cells (nerve cells, including dopaminergic neurons and oligodendrocytes), chondrocytes (cartilage cells), pancreatic islet β cells, osteoblasts (bone cells), hematopoietic cells (blood-forming cells) and dendritic cells. Also included in the patent portfolio are technologies for growing hES cells or other pPS cells without the need for cell feeder layers or conditioned media, and novel synthetic growth surfaces. With respect to patents that are not specific to our core programs (AST-OPC1, AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2), we are evaluating licensing and other partnering opportunities, including assignment of certain patents to third parties, on an ongoing basis. We are also evaluating maintenance costs relative to remaining patent term and may choose to no longer maintain certain of these patents.  Collectively, these activities may result in a decrease in the total number of patents owned or controlled by us that are not specific to our core programs.
 
In February 2016, we executed a broad, non-exclusive cross-license (the “Cross-License”) with BioTime and its subsidiary ES Cell International Pte Ltd. (“ESI”). Under the Cross-License, we have received: (i) non-exclusive worldwide rights in a range of therapeutic fields to over 30 patents and applications relating to hES cells, and (ii) non-exclusive worldwide rights for therapeutic applications of pluripotent stem cell-derived neural and cardiac cells to over 20 patents and applications relating to hydrogel formulations and, BioTime and ESI received a broad, non-exclusive license to certain of our patents and related patent rights for all purposes in the BioTime Licensed Field during the term of the Cross-License. The BioTime Licensed Field includes all fields of use except any and all applications (a) to treat disorders of the nervous system, and (b) utilizing the immune system to prevent, treat, or cure cancer, and (c) involving the use of cells comprising, derived from, or manufactured using, hES cells or human induced pluripotent stem cells for in vitro assay applications, including but not limited to drug discovery and development, drug monitoring, drug toxicology testing, and consumer products testing.
 
The patent positions for our two most advanced programs are summarized below.
 
 7
 

Neural cells: This portfolio is related to our AST-OPC1 product.  The patent rights relevant to neural cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, include various patent families acquired by us from Geron that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells) into various neural cell types, as well as various culture  and purification methods. These patent rights also include rights licensed from the Regents of the University of California. There are issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, United Kingdom, Japan, China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Singapore and Israel. Additionally, there are four new pending patent families owned by us directed to improved methods of producing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell compositions and methods of treatment of spinal cord injury and stroke using oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The stroke family is jointly owned with the Regents of the University of California; the other three new pending families are solely owned by us.  The expiration dates of the patents acquired from Geron and in-licensed from the Regents of the University of California will be within 2021 to 2030.  The potential expiry dates of the four new patent families with applications pending will be within 2036 to 2037. The commercial success of our AST-OPC1 product depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition in this product with this patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, or a combination of both.
 
Dendritic cells: This portfolio is related to our AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2 products.  The patent rights relevant to dendritic cells include various patent families acquired by us from Geron that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells)  into immature and mature dendritic cells, as well as various culture methods. The dendritic cell patent portfolio also includes several patent families in-licensed from third parties. There are issued patents in the United States, Australia, Europe, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Israel and Singapore. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2019 to 2029. The commercial success of our AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2 products depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition in these products with this patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, or a combination of both.
 
In addition, we have patent protection in the Unites States and various other jurisdictions for producing cardiomyocytes, pancreatic islet cells, hepatocytes, chondrocytes, hematopoietic cells, and osteoblasts. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2020 to 2032. Should a competitor not be able to market a product covered by these patents or if we cannot license these patents before their expiration, the benefits for procurement and maintenance of these rights would not be fully realized and the associated costs would not be fully reimbursed.
 
Licensed Stem Cell Technology and Stem Cell Product Development Agreements
 
Telomerase Sublicense
 
We received the Telomerase Sublicense from Geron in connection with our acquisition of Geron’s stem cell assets. The Telomerase Sublicense grants us an exclusive sublicense under certain patents owned by the University of Colorado’s University License Equity Holdings, Inc. relating to telomerase and entitles us to use the technology covered by the patents in the development of AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2 as immunological treatments for cancer. Under the Telomerase Sublicense, we paid Geron a one-time upfront license fee of $65,000, and we will pay Geron an annual license maintenance fee of $10,000 due on each anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, and a 1% royalty on sales of any products that we may develop and commercialize that are covered by the sublicensed patents. The Telomerase Sublicense will expire concurrently with the expiration of Geron’s license. That license will terminate in November 2018 when the last of the licensed patents expires. The Telomerase Sublicense may also be terminated by us by giving Geron 90 days written notice, by us or by Geron if the other party breaches its obligations under the sublicense agreement and fails to cure their breach within the prescribed time period, or by us or by Geron upon the filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of the assets for the benefit of creditors by the other party.
 
We are obligated to indemnify Geron, Geron’s licensor, and certain other parties for certain liabilities, including those for personal injury, product liability, or property damage relating to or arising from the manufacture, use, promotion or sale of a product, or the use by any person of a product made, created, sold or otherwise transferred by us or our sublicensees that is covered by the patents sublicensed under this agreement.
 
License Agreement with University of California
 
Geron assigned to us its Exclusive License Agreement with The Regents of the University of California for patents covering a method for directing the differentiation of pPS cells to glial-restricted progenitor cells that generate pure populations of oligodendrocytes for remyelination and treatment of spinal cord injury. Pursuant to this agreement, we have an exclusive worldwide license under such patents, including the right to grant sublicenses, to create products for biological research, drug screening, and human therapy using the licensed patents.

Under the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay the university a royalty of 1% from sales of products that are covered by the licensed patent rights, and a minimum annual royalty of $5,000 starting in the year in which the first sale of a product covered by any licensed patent rights occurs, and continuing for the life of the applicable patent right under the agreement. The royalty payments due are subject to reduction, but not by more than 50%, to the extent of any payments that we may be obligated to pay to a third party for the use of patents or other intellectual property licensed from the third party in order to make, have made, use, sell, or import products or otherwise exercise our rights under the Exclusive License Agreement. We will be obligated to pay the university 7.5% of any proceeds, excluding debt financing and equity investments, and certain reimbursements, that we receive from sublicensees, other than our affiliates and joint ventures relating to the development, manufacture, purchase, and sale of products, processes, and services covered by the licensed patent.
 
The license agreement will terminate on the expiration of the last-to-expire of the university’s issued licensed patents. If no further patents covered by the license agreement are issued, the license agreement would terminate in 2024. The university may terminate the agreement in the event of our breach of the agreement. We can terminate the agreement upon 60 days’ notice.
 
World-Wide Non Exclusive WARF License
 
On October 7, 2013, we entered into a Non-Exclusive License Agreement with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (“WARF”) under which we were granted a worldwide non-exclusive license under certain WARF patents and WARF-owned embryonic stem cell lines to develop and commercialize therapeutic, diagnostic and research products. The licensed patents include patents covering methods for growth and differentiation of primate embryonic stem cells. The licensed stem cell lines include the H1, H7, H9, H13 and H14 hES cell lines.
 
In consideration of the rights licensed to us, we have agreed to pay WARF an upfront license fee and have agreed to additional payments upon the attainment of specified clinical development milestones, royalties on sales of commercialized products, and, subject to certain exclusions, a percentage of any payments that we may receive from any sublicenses that we may grant to use the licensed patents or stem cell lines.
 
The license agreement will terminate with respect to licensed patents upon the expiration of the last licensed patent to expire. We may terminate the license agreement at any time by giving WARF prior written notice. WARF may terminate the license agreement if payments of earned royalties, once begun, cease for a specified period of time or if we and any third parties collaborating or cooperating with us in the development of products using the licensed patents or stem cell lines fail to spend a specified minimum amount on research and development of products relating to the licensed patents or stem cell lines for a specified period of time.
 
WARF also has the right to terminate the license agreement if we breach the license agreement or become bankrupt or insolvent or if any of the licensed patents or stem cell lines are offered to creditors.
 
We will indemnify WARF and certain other designated affiliated entities from liability arising out of or relating to the death or injury of any person or damage to property due to the sale, marketing, use, or manufacture of products that are covered by the licensed patents, or licensed stem cells, or inventions or materials developed or derived from the licensed patents or stem cell lines.
 
Royalty Agreement with Geron
 
In connection with our acquisition of Geron’s stem cell assets, we entered into a royalty agreement with Geron (the “Royalty Agreement”) pursuant to which we agreed to pay Geron a 4% royalty on net sales (as defined in the Royalty Agreement), by us or any of our affiliates or sales agents, of any products that we develop and commercialize that are covered by the patents Geron contributed to us. In the case of sales of such products by a person other than us or one of our affiliates or sales agents, we will be required to pay Geron 50% of all royalties and cash payments received by us or by our affiliate in respect of a product sale. Royalty payments will be subject to proration in the event that a product covered by a patent acquired from Geron is sold in combination with another product that is not covered by a patent acquired from Geron. The Royalty Agreement will terminate at the expiration or termination date of the last issued patent contributed by Geron under the Royalty Agreement. We estimate that the latest patent expiration date will be in 2032.

Protecting our Intellectual Property
 
We seek to protect our intellectual property (“IP”) by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our patentable IP that we consider important to the development and implementation of our business and strategy. In addition to relying on patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and contractual agreements to protect our IP.
 
Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates including compositions-of-matter, dosages, and formulations, manufacturing methods, and novel applications, uses and technological innovations related to our product candidates and core technologies. Our business would be negatively impacted if we are not successful in developing additional proprietary technologies that are protected either as trade secrets or by filing additional patent applications.
 
We cannot ensure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that may be filed by us in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our existing or subsequently granted patents will be useful in protecting our drug candidates, technological innovations, and processes. The claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection, may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate, it is possible that any patent related to our product candidates may expire before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, or may remain in force for only a short period of time following commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage afforded by any such patent. In addition, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, duplicate any of our technologies and, if patents are licensed or issued to us, design around the patented technologies licensed to or developed by us. Therefore, our competitors may be able to commercialize similar products, or may be able to duplicate our business strategy, without infringing our patents or otherwise using our intellectual property.
 
The protection afforded by any particular patent depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, scope of coverage encompassed by the granted claims, availability of extensions of patent term and legal interpretation of patent laws in the United States and other countries that could diminish our ability to protect our inventions and to enforce our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, others may have patents that relate to our technology or business that may prevent us from marketing our product candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents. Accordingly, while our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and core technologies will depend, in part, on our success in obtaining and enforcing valid patent claims, we cannot predict with certainty the enforceability of any granted patent claims or of any claims that may be granted from our patent applications.
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation and other challenges regarding patents and other intellectual property rights that involve complex legal and factual questions making our patent position generally uncertain. Any existing or subsequently granted patents may be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable, circumvented or infringed. We have been involved in the past in administrative proceedings with respect to our patents and patent applications and may, as a result of our extensive portfolio, be involved in such proceedings in the future. Additionally, in the future, we may claim that a third party infringes our intellectual property or a third party may claim that we infringe its intellectual property. In any of the administrative proceedings or in litigation, we may incur significant expenses, damages, attorneys’ fees, costs of proceedings and experts’ fees, and management and employees may be required to spend significant time in connection with these actions.

A patent interference proceeding may be instituted with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) when more than one person files a patent application covering the same technology, or if someone wishes to challenge the validity of an issued patent on patents and applications filed before March 16, 2013. At the completion of the interference proceeding, the USPTO will determine which competing applicant is entitled to the patent, or whether an issued patent is valid. Patent interference proceedings are complex, highly contested legal proceedings, and the USPTO’s decision is subject to appeal. This means that if an interference proceeding arises with respect to any of our patent applications, we may experience significant expenses and delay in obtaining a patent, and if the outcome of the proceeding is unfavorable to us, the patent could be issued to a competitor rather than to us. For patents and applications filed after March 16, 2013 a derivation proceeding may be initiated where the USPTO may determine if one patent was derived from the work of an inventor on another patent. Inventorship may also be challenged in litigation.
 
In addition to interference proceedings, the USPTO can reevaluate issued patents at the request of a third party seeking to have the patent invalidated. There are proceedings at the USPTO (ex parte reexamination, post grant review, or inter partes review proceeding), which allow third parties to challenge the validity of an issued patent where there is a reasonable likelihood of invalidity. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, these USPTO proceedings will be very expensive to contest and can result in the cancelation of a patent. This means that patents owned or licensed by us may be subject to further administrative challenges and may be lost if the outcome of the challenge is unfavorable to us.
 
There are also challenges to obtaining patents in countries outside of the United States. In particular, under European patent law and the patent laws of certain other countries, oppositions to the issuance of patents may be filed. These foreign proceedings can be very expensive to contest and can result in significant delays in obtaining a patent or can result in a denial of a patent application. Also in Europe and certain other countries, there is uncertainty about the eligibility of hES cell subject matter for a patent. The European Patent Convention prohibits the granting of European patents for inventions that concern “uses of human embryos for industrial or commercial purposes”.  Following a December 2014 decision at the Court of Justice of the European Union which interpreted parthenogeneticly produced human pluripotent stem cells as patentable subject matter, the European Patent Office now recognizes that human pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells) can be created without a destructive use of human embryos as of June 5, 2003. Consequently, patent applications relating to hES cell subject matter with a filing and priority date after this date are no longer automatically excluded from patentability under Article 53 (a) EPC and Rule 28(c) EPC.
 
We may benefit from a variety of regulatory frameworks in the United States, Europe, China and other territories that provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying drug products. See “Government Regulation—FDA and Foreign Regulation.”
 
Manufacturing
 
We currently occupy a 44,000 square foot facility in Fremont, California which includes a cGMP compliant facility.  In January 2017, we announced that we had completed the validation and start-up of this facility which we eventually plan to use to manufacture AST-OPC1 to supply any future registration trial and commercial drug production.  We will also rely on third party manufacturers to manufacture certain product candidates.  For example, CRUK will manufacture clinical grade AST-VAC2 for the Phase 1/2a clinical trial of AST-VAC2 and Cognate has entered into an agreement with us to provide production and manufacturing services of AST-VAC1 in connection with future clinical studies.
Competition
 
The industry for stem-cell derived therapeutics is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, and chemical and medical products companies operating in the fields of regenerative medicine, cell therapy, tissue engineering, and tissue regeneration. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, certain smaller biotech companies have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies’ potential research and development and commercialization advantages. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those we are developing.

Some of our competitors may be trying to develop cell-based technologies and products that may compete with our potential products based on efficacy, safety, cost, and intellectual property positions.
 
We may also face competition from companies that have filed patent applications relating to the growth, differentiation and therapeutic use of stem cells and dendritic cells. We may be required to seek licenses from these competitors in order to commercialize certain of our proposed products, and such licenses may not be granted.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, quality, approval, distribution, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, marketing, import/export and promotion of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Authorities also heavily regulate many of these activities for human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products or HCT/Ps.
 
FDA and Foreign Regulation
 
We believe that the FDA will regulate most of our proposed products as biologics. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and is responsible for implementing regulations. In addition, establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products are subject to additional registration and listing requirements, including current good tissue practice regulations. Many of our proposed products will be reviewed by the FDA staff in its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (“CBER”) Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies.
 
In the United States, biologic products like ours are subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate, an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) must be submitted to the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at one or more hospitals or medical centers to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the clinical trial based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the intended patient population. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuous process. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development required to create the product.
 
In additional to regulating the clinical development of our products, the FDA regulates in the United States other areas involving our product, including:
 
 
· | Applications for Marketing Approval: No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate application, which in the case of a cell therapy or vaccine product will be a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to BLA approval. To date, the FDA has not granted marketing approval to any hES-based therapeutic products and it is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject our product candidates to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologics derived from other technologies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Combination Products: If we develop any products that are used with medical devices, they may be considered combination products, which are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components or parts such as a biologic and a device. The regulatory requirements for a combination product comprised of a biologic administered with a delivery device can be more complex, because in addition to the individual regulatory requirements for each component, additional combination product regulatory requirements may apply. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Post-Approval Matters: Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. Data resulting from these clinical trials may result in expansions or restrictions to the labeled indications for which a product has already been approved. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Manufacturing: The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced in compliance with cGMP. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | FDA Regulation of Advertising and Product Promotion: The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical and biological products. Claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of a BLA or an amendment to a BLA, and must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Sales of pharmaceutical and biological products outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
California State Regulations
 
The state of California has adopted legislation and regulations that require institutions that conduct stem cell research to notify, and in certain cases obtain approval from, a Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (“SCRO Committee”) before conducting the research. Under certain California regulations, all hES cell lines that will be used in our research must be acceptably derived.
 
We also comply with certain California regulations that require certain records to be maintained with respect to stem cell research and the materials used.
 
In compliance with state regulations, we have formed a SCRO Committee which reviews each of Asterias’ projects that involve the use of pluripotent stem cells.  The committee reviews and confirms that we are using only hES cell lines that have been acceptably derived and that the research conducted using these cells lines is both scientifically and ethically justified.  The AST-OPC1 and AST-VAC2 programs have been reviewed by the SCRO Committee and have been deemed to comply with federal and state guidelines. The hES cell lines that we use are all on the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) registry of lines that have been reviewed and meet standards for federal funding grants.
 
California Proposition 71
 
During November 2004, California State Proposition 71 (“Prop. 71”), the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative, was adopted by state-wide referendum. Prop. 71 provides for a state-sponsored program designed to encourage stem cell research in the State of California, and to finance such research with State funds totaling approximately $295,000,000 annually for 10 years beginning in 2005. This initiative created CIRM, which will provide grants, primarily but not exclusively, to academic institutions to advance both hES cell research and adult stem cell research.  On October 16, 2014 we signed a NGA with CIRM, effective October 1, 2014, with respect to a $14.3 million grant award for clinical development of our product, AST-OPC1.   To date, we have received $12.8 million under the NGA. There can be no assurance we will receive the remaining $1.5 million.
