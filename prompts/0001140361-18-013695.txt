Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company dedicated to developing cell-based therapeutics to treat neurological conditions associated with demyelination and cellular immunotherapies to treat cancer. We have industry-leading technology in two cell types, each with broad potential applicability: (1) oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, which become oligodendrocytes that have the potential to remyelinate axons within the central nervous system and perform other restorative functions, and (2) antigen-presenting dendritic cells, which train T-cells in the immune system to attack and destroy solid or liquid tumor cells across multiple types of cancer. 
 We currently have three clinical stage programs:
 
• | AST-OPC1 is an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell population derived from pluripotent stem cells that is currently in a Phase 1/2a clinical trial for spinal cord injuries (SCI) that has been partially funded by the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AST-VAC2 is a non-patient-specific (off-the-shelf) cancer immunotherapy derived from pluripotent stem cells for which a clinical trial in non-small cell lung cancer is being funded and sponsored by Cancer Research UK, the world’s largest independent cancer research charity; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AST-VAC1 is a patient-specific cancer immunotherapy which has generated positive Phase 2 data in the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Like chimeric antigen receptor, or CAR-T, therapies, AST-VAC1 is an autologous therapy meaning that it is sourced from a patients own cells through a standard process known as leukapheresis. For AST-OPC1 and AST-VAC2, we use human embryonic stem (hES) cell lines, which were originally isolated in the 1990s and which have almost unlimited capacity to expand and differentiate into the various cell types of the body. For AST-OPC1, hES cells are induced to become an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell population that supplements the bodys natural axon remyelination function, which can be damaged or otherwise insufficient as a result of certain neurological events or conditions including spinal cord injury. Likewise for AST-VAC2, the hES cells are differentiated to mature dendritic cells that educate the immune system to target telomerase, a protein produced by most tumor cells.
 We believe that our experience, expertise, and intellectual property surrounding oligodendrocyte progenitor cells and dendritic cells provide us with two distinct technology platforms in neurology and cancer immunotherapy. Our neurology platform has the potential for application in additional indications, such as advanced multiple sclerosis and white matter stroke, and our immunotherapy platform potentially could be employed in any immunogenic cancer and could be designed to target antigens beyond telomerase.

  Corporate History
 We were incorporated in Delaware on September 24, 2012. In October 2013, we acquired intellectual property, cell lines, preclinical and clinical data, and other assets from Geron Corporation (Geron) and also acquired rights to use certain hES cell lines and to practice certain patents from BioTime, Inc. (BioTime). Additionally, in February 2016, we executed a broad, non-exclusive cross-license with BioTime and its subsidiary ES Cell International Pte Ltd. Our two core technology platforms are based upon and supported by assets acquired from these transactions. 
 Immediately following our 2013 transaction with Geron, we were approximately 72% owned by BioTime and, until May 13, 2016, we were a majority-owned and controlled subsidiary of BioTime. As of December 31, 2017, BioTime owned approximately 40% of our outstanding shares.
 Our principal executive offices are located at 6300 Dumbarton Circle, Fremont, California 94555. Our telephone number is (510) 456-3800. Our corporate website is www.asteriasbiotherapeutics.com. The contents of our website are not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Products Under Development
 AST-OPC1
 About AST-OPC1
 Our AST-OPC1 product candidate is an oligodendrocyte progenitor cell population, derived from a current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) master cell bank of undifferentiated hES cells that has been qualified for human use. These cells, which are stored frozen until ready for use, are produced under cGMP conditions and screened for adventitious agents.
 Oligodendrocytes are natures neural insulating cells. Like the insulation covering an electrical wire, oligodendrocytes enable the conduction of electrical impulses along nerve fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous system. They are also known to promote neural growth, as well as induce blood vessel formation around nerve axons. 
 AST-OPC1 cells have been shown to reproduce the natural functions of oligodendrocytes in animals, including three potentially reparative functions that address the complex pathologies observed at the site of a spinal cord injury. These activities of AST-OPC1 include production of neurotrophic factors, stimulation of vascularization, and induction of remyelination of denuded axons, all of which are critical for survival, regrowth, and conduction of nerve impulses through axons at the injury site. In preclinical animal testing, AST-OPC1 administration led to remyelination of axons, improved hind limb and forelimb locomotor function, dramatic reductions in injury-related cavitation, and significant preservation of myelinated axons traversing the injury site.
 Phase 1/2a Study in Patients with Complete Cervical Spinal Cord Injuries
 Based on the results of a previously completed Phase 1 safety trial of AST-OPC1 in thoracic spinal cord injury, we obtained permission from the FDA in August 2014 to initiate a Phase 1/2a dose escalation trial in subjects with neurologically complete (AIS-A) cervical spinal cord injuries (the SCiStar study). In May 2016, we were granted FDA clearance to expand the SCiStar study to enroll additional subjects to include two additional cohorts of subjects with motor complete, sensory incomplete (AIS-B) cervical spinal cord injury. The SCiStar study is an open-label, single-arm trial testing three sequential escalating doses of AST-OPC1 administered at up to 20 million AST-OPC1 cells in twenty-five subjects with subacute, C-4 to C-7, motor complete (AIS-A or AIS-B) cervical spinal cord injuries (SCI). These individuals have essentially lost all movement below their injury site and experience severe paralysis of the upper and lower limbs. AIS-A patients have lost all motor and sensory function below their injury site, while AIS-B patients have lost all motor function but may retain some minimal sensory function below their injury site. AST-OPC1 was administered 21 to 42 days post-injury. Subjects will be followed by neurological exams and imaging procedures to assess the safety and activity of the product.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  We completed enrollment of the entire SCiStar study in December 2017. The SCiStar study consists of five cohorts:
 
Cohort | Injury Type; AST-OPC1 Dose | # of Subjects
---------+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------
Cohort 1 | AIS-A; 2M AST-OPC1 cells (low dose for safety evaluation) | 3 
Cohort 2 | AIS-A; 10M AST-OPC1 cells | 6 
Cohort 3 | AIS-A; 20M AST-OPC1 cells* | 6 
Cohort 4 | AIS-B; 10M AST-OPC1 cells | 6 
Cohort 5 | AIS-B; 20M AST-OPC1 cells* | 4 
Total | | 25 


In October 2017, we reported 12-month data from the SCiStar studys Cohort 2. At 12 months, 67% (4 out of 6) of Cohort 2 subjects recovered 2 or more motor levels on at least one side, exceeding the companys 12-month tertiary target of 45-50% of subjects achieving this level of improvement. In February 2018, we provided a clinical trial update that highlighted, among other things, the following:
 
• | Positive Safety Profile – We have dosed 25 subjects with AST-OPC1 in the SCiStar study and a total of 30 subjects including the five subjects from the previous Phase 1 safety trial who have been followed for as long as seven years. To date, there have been no serious adverse events (SAEs) related to the AST-OPC1 cells.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cell Engraftment – 92% (11/12) of Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 subjects have magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at six months consistent with the formation of a tissue matrix at the injury site, which is early and encouraging evidence that AST-OPC1 cells have engrafted at the injury site and helped to prevent cavitation. Together with the previously reported results from Cohort 2, the MRI results-to-date for 94% (17/18) of the Cohort 2-4 subjects provide supportive evidence that AST-OPC1 cells have durably engrafted at the injury site and helped to prevent cavitation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Improved Motor Function – 75% (9/12) of Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 subjects have recovered at least one motor level on at least one side through six months, and 17% (2/12) of subjects have recovered two or more motor levels on at least one side through six months. At six months, 83% (15/18) of Cohort 2-4 subjects recovered at least 1 motor level on at least one side and 22% (4/18) of Cohort 2-4 subjects recovered two or more motor levels on at least one side.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


We will have various interim readouts in 2018 and expect to report the six-month top-line readout for the entire study late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of 2018 and the 12-month top-line readout for the entire study late in the fourth quarter 2018 or early in the first quarter of 2019.
 The SCiStar study followed a previous Phase 1 clinical trial, in which five subjects with neurologically complete, thoracic spinal cord injury were administered two million AST-OPC1 cells at the spinal cord injury site 7-14 days post-injury. They also received low levels of immunosuppression for the next 60 days. Delivery of AST-OPC1 was successful in all five subjects with no serious adverse events associated with the administration of the cells, with AST-OPC1 itself, or the immunosuppressive regimen. All five subjects have completed at least six years of follow-up. No evidence of rejection of AST-OPC1 was observed in detailed immune response monitoring of all subjects. In four of the five subjects, serial MRI scans indicated that reduced spinal cord cavitation may have occurred. There have been five minor adverse events possibly related to AST-OPC1 such as transient fever and nerve pain. There have been no unexpected neurological changes to date. 
 Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy Designation and Orphan Drug Designation
 In September 2017, the FDA granted our request for AST-OPC1 to be designated a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) under the 21st Century Cures Act. The RMAT designation is intended to facilitate expedited development, review and approval for important new regenerative medicine therapies for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates the potential to address a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. In addition to providing an avenue for increased and earlier interactions with the FDA, RMAT-designated products may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. We expect to have discussions with the FDA sometime in 2018 on the development of AST-OPC1 using the RMAT designation.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  In February 2016, we announced that the FDA had granted our application for Orphan Drug Designation of AST-OPC1 for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury.
 Manufacturing and Process Development
 We are in the process of establishing additional cGMP master and working cell banks of undifferentiated hES cells of the H1 cell line for future clinical development and commercial use. We are also updating the manufacturing process for AST-OPC1 to improve yields and support a scalable process for eventually manufacturing on a larger scale. We will need to successfully complete the update of the manufacturing process in order to manufacture additional clinical-grade lots of AST-OPC1 to use for future clinical development.
Market Conditions
 It is estimated that there are approximately 17,000 new spinal cord injuries annually in the United States (NSCISC SCI Facts and Figures at a Glance (2016)). As of 2016, the National Spinal Cord Injury Statistical Center reported that approximately 4,500 of these new spinal cord injuries annually in the United States are AIS-A, AIS-B or AIS-C patients with C-4 to C-7 spinal cord injuries (https://www.nscisc.uab.edu/). Individuals with neurologically complete cervical spinal cord injury are part of an orphan population with a severe unmet medical need due to the loss of function in all four limbs. These individuals frequently require significant assistance for their care and activities of daily living. A published study estimated the lifetime costs of care for a person who suffers a cervical SCI at age 25 to up to $5.4 million (Y. C. Cao and M. J. DeVivo (2011)).
 There are currently no drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for the treatment of spinal cord injury, although methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid generally used as an anti-inflammatory drug, is sometimes prescribed on an off-label basis to reduce acute inflammation in the injured spinal cord immediately after injury. It is believed that in order to effect substantial benefit in treating this complex injury, multiple mechanisms of action are required, such as re-myelination of the demyelinated axons, generation of new blood vessels to repair the ischemic damage from injury, and the presence of biologics that cause neurite or new nerve growth to enable the severed axons to repair. In pre-clinical studies to date, AST-OPC1 cells have been shown to exhibit all three effects.
 CIRM Grant and other Funding
 In October 2014, we signed a Notice of Grant Award (NGA) with the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM), effective October 1, 2014, with respect to a $14.3 million grant award for clinical development of AST-OPC1. The NGA, as amended, includes the terms under which CIRM will release grant funds to us. Under the NGA, as amended on March 2, 2016, CIRM pledged to disburse the grant funds to us based on our attainment of certain progress milestones and we have received the entire $14.3 million awarded to us under the NGA. 
 We will need to raise additional capital in order to conduct subsequent clinical trials and to complete product development work necessary for larger trials and commercialization, which may include additional non-dilutive funding through CIRM and other sources to develop this product.
 AST-VAC2 and AST-VAC1
 We are developing two experimental immunotherapeutic programs, AST-VAC2 and AST-VAC1, each designed to attack cancer cells by targeting the cancer cells expression of human telomerase (hTERT). Both product candidates use an immune cell type known as dendritic cells to stimulate immune responses to telomerase. Dendritic cells are antigen processing and presenting cells which are potent initiators of a cellular and antibody-mediated immune response. Telomerase is a pan-cancer antigen, expressed at high levels in nearly all human cancers, but at very low levels or not at all in normal human cells. Somewhat analogous to CAR-T therapies, the premise underlying these vaccines is to stimulate a T cell response to tumor cells. Our AST-VAC programs seek to teach the patients own immune system to attack cancer cells while sparing other normal healthy cells.
 Our AST-VAC programs have the potential to be used as a monotherapy or in combination with other therapies. As a monotherapy, we believe our AST-VAC programs, which to date have shown a more favorable safety profile than many other approaches to treat cancer, have potential as a remission maintenance therapy in cancers that are susceptible to immune attack, express telomerase and have high rates of relapse. We believe our AST-VAC programs are also potentially complimentary with other therapies, such as CAR-T therapies, that program T cells to 


 5

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  aggressively attack cancer cells to induce remission but also have less favorable toxicity profiles and therefore are not well tolerated as a remission maintenance therapy. A CAR-T therapy that induces remission could potentially be used in combination with one of our AST-VAC programs to help a patient stay in remission.
 We also believe our AST-VAC programs may be synergistic with other therapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, where the checkpoint inhibitor allows the immune system to again work naturally to attack cancer cells in a situation where the bodys own natural response is being suppressed by the cancer. We also believe that our AST-VAC programs have the potential to be applicable therapies across a wide range of cancers since telomerase is expressed at high levels in the vast majority of human cancers.
 AST-VAC2
 About AST-VAC2
 AST-VAC2 is an allogeneic, or non-patient specific, cancer vaccine candidate designed to stimulate patient immune responses to telomerase. AST-VAC2 is produced from hES cells and can be modified with any antigen. The use of hES, as opposed to collecting and using the patients own blood, as the starting material for AST-VAC2 provides a scalable system for the production of a large number of vaccine doses in a single lot. Allogeneic vaccine production has the potential to have lower manufacturing costs, provide off-the-shelf availability which provides broader access to patients, and ensure greater product consistency. In addition, we believe that this approach has the potential to stimulate a more robust immune response through an adjuvant effect of the immune mismatch between the biological profile of AST-VAC2 and patients receiving the therapy. 
Clinical Trial and Option Agreement with Cancer Research UK
 During September 2014, we entered into a Clinical Trial and Option Agreement with Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Cancer Research Technology Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of CRUK (the CRUK Agreement). Under the CRUK Agreement, CRUK has agreed to fund Phase 1 clinical development of our AST-VAC2 product candidate loaded with the same LAMP-telomerase construct we have used in AST-VAC1. Under the terms of the CRUK Agreement, we are responsible, at our own cost, for completing process development and manufacturing scale-up of the AST-VAC2 manufacturing process and transferring the resulting cGMP-compatible process to CRUK. CRUK is responsible, at its own cost, for manufacturing clinical grade AST-VAC2 and for carrying out the Phase 1 clinical trial of AST-VAC2. The study will administer AST-VAC2 to treat up to 24 patients with either advanced or resected NSCLC to examine the safety, immunogenicity, and activity of AST-VAC2 and position the immunotherapy for future clinical trials. We will continue to serve in a collaborative and advisory role with CRUK throughout this process. The CRUK Agreement is subject to termination if certain milestones relating to regulatory approvals are not achieved, if we are in material breach of the agreement and we do not cure such breach within 60 days, or if we are insolvent or commence liquidation proceedings. In addition, CRUK may terminate the CRUK Agreement if the clinical trial protocol, or an amendment thereto, is not approved by the regulatory authority, ethics committee or the Company, if CRUK is not satisfied with the product manufacturing process, if CRUK faces budget constraints, if certain problems arises during the clinical trial, or performance of the CRUK Agreement by CRUK would be unlawful.
 In January 2016, we announced that we had completed the technology transfer of the AST-VAC2 manufacturing process to CRUK. 
 In September 2017, we announced that the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the NHS Research Ethics Committee (REC) had provided the necessary approvals to initiate the first-in-human (FIH) clinical trial of AST-VAC2 in the United Kingdom. 
 We anticipate the first subjects in this study to be dosed in the first half of 2018. Assuming the first subject is dosed in the first half of 2018, the Company expects to report initial safety readouts in the second half of 2018.
 Upon completion of the Phase 1 study, we will have an exclusive first option to acquire the data generated in the trial. If we exercise that option we will be obligated to make payments upon the execution of the license agreement and, upon the achievement of various milestones, as well as make royalty payments on sales of products. In connection with the CRUK Agreement, we sublicensed to CRUK for use in the clinical trials and product manufacturing process certain patents that have been licensed or sublicensed to us by third parties. We would also be obligated to make payments to those licensors and sub licensors upon the achievement of various milestones, and then royalties on sales of products if AST-VAC2 is successfully developed and commercialized.

  Services Agreement with Cell Therapy Catapult Services Limited
 In October 2015, we entered into a Services Agreement (the Services Agreement) with Cell Therapy Catapult Services Limited (Catapult), a research organization specializing in the development of technologies which speed the growth of the cell and gene therapy industry. Under the Services Agreement, Catapult will license to us, certain background intellectual property and will develop a scalable manufacturing and differentiation process for our AST-VAC2 development program. In consideration for the license and Catapults performance of services, we agreed to make aggregate payments of up to GBP £4,350,000 over the five years after the execution of the Services Agreement. At our option of, up to GBP £3,600,000 of such payments may be settled in shares of our Series A Common Stock. As of December 31, 2017, we have incurred costs since commencement of the Services Agreement of GBP £3,200,000 under the Services Agreement.
 The Services Agreement may be terminated by us for any reason upon 60 days prior written notice. Catapult may terminate the Services Agreement on 60 days prior written notice if it encounters a technical issue that would prevent it from completing the services at all or without obtaining additional resources or if the estimated time and cost of completing the services will be exceeded and both parties do not reach agreement on revised time and cost terms. Catapult may terminate the Services Agreement in the event we fail to pay any amount due under the Services Agreement 30 days after Catapult makes a written demand for payment. In addition, a non-breaching party may terminate the Services Agreement upon the occurrence a material breach that is not remedied within 30 days. Either party may terminate the Services Agreement in the event the other party becomes subject to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or a similar event. 
 AST-VAC1
 About AST-VAC1
 AST-VAC1 is an autologous product candidate, manufactured from cells that come from the patient. AST-VAC1 consists of antigen-presenting mature dendritic cells pulsed with messenger RNA for the protein component of human telomerase (hTERT) and a portion of a lysosomal targeting signal (LAMP). LAMP directs the telomerase RNA to the lysosome, the subcellular organelle that directs the RNA to a particular part of the cell membrane. AST-VAC1 is injected into the patients skin and the dendritic cells travel to the lymph nodes and instruct cytotoxic T cells to kill cancerous tumor cells that express telomerase on their surface; helper T cells are also induced and are also theoretically capable of killing cancer cells.
Process Development
 On August 3, 2016, we entered into a Development and Manufacturing Services Agreement (the Services Agreement) with Cognate BioServices, Inc. (Cognate), a fully-integrated contract bioservices organization providing development and cGMP manufacturing services to companies and institutions engaged in the development of cell-based products. On August 16, 2017, we amended certain statements of work to modify the timing of certain process development studies being performed by Cognate under the Services Agreement. Under the Services Agreement, as amended, Cognate performs process development studies in support of our clinical and commercial development activities of AST-VAC1. Most of the initial process development work that we intend to complete under this Services Agreement was completed in 2017.
Clinical Studies
 A Phase 2 clinical trial of AST-VAC1 was conducted in subjects with AML in complete clinical remission. This trial completed subject enrollment in December 2009. Thirty-three subjects with AML entered the study in their first or second complete remission. Prior to or shortly after completing consolidation chemotherapy, subjects underwent leukapheresis, a process of collecting white blood cells directly from the subject. AST-VAC1 was produced at a centralized manufacturing facility from the subject-specific white blood cells. Subject blood cells were differentiated to dendritic cells in culture, modified to express telomerase linked to the LAMP targeting signal, aliquoted and cryopreserved. AST-VAC1 was released for subject dosing contingent on several product specifications that included identity of mature dendritic cells, confirmation of telomerase expression, and number of viable cells per dose after thawing, and product sterility.
 Twenty-one subjects received AST-VAC1 in the study, including 19 in clinical remission and two in early relapse. AST-VAC1 was found to have a favorable safety and tolerability profile in this study over multiple

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  vaccinations, with up to 32 serial vaccinations administered (median=17). Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (bleeding into the skin caused by low platelets in blood) (grade 3-4) was reported in one subject. Other toxicities (grade 1-2) included rash or headache. Subject immune response to telomerase after vaccination with AST-VAC1 was evaluated using a test called the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay to measure the presence of activated T-cells specific to hTERT. Positive immune responses were detected in 55% of subjects.
 We subsequently performed follow-up data collection on the 19 subjects treated in complete remission to determine the long-term effects of the AST-VAC1 administration on remission duration and disease-free survival. Eleven of 19 subjects (58%) remained in complete remission at a median follow-up of 52 months. These results compare to historical data suggesting that between 20-40% of subjects would be expected to be relapse free at 3-4 years. Additionally, of the 7 subjects in the higher risk over 60-year-old group, 4 (57%) remained relapse free at a median follow up of 54 months. Historically, relapse free survival rates in this population have been 10-20% at 3-4 years. We believe that the results of this trial provide encouraging evidence that by targeting hTERT, our AST-VAC programs may have the potential to be effective therapies in the treatment of a wide range of cancers.
 The next major step in clinical development for AST-VAC1 would be to conduct a confirmatory Phase 2b study. We will need to receive additional sufficient funding or identify a partner for this program prior to the commencement of such a study.
 Intellectual Property
 The patent portfolio that we acquired pursuant to the Asset Contribution Agreement with Geron, dated January 4, 2013 (the Asset Contribution Agreement), currently includes approximately 420 patents and patent applications owned by or licensed to us that are directed to pluripotent stem (pPS) cell-, hES cell-, and dendritic cell-based product opportunities. The portfolio encompasses methods for making a number of cell types from hES or other pPS cells, including hepatocytes (liver cells), cardiomyocytes (heart muscle cells), neural cells (nerve cells, including dopaminergic neurons and oligodendrocytes), chondrocytes (cartilage cells), pancreatic islet β cells, osteoblasts (bone cells), hematopoietic cells (blood-forming cells) and dendritic cells, and related compositions. Also included in the patent portfolio are technologies for culture and scalable expansion of undifferentiated hES cells or other pPS cells, including methods for culturing without the need for cell feeder layers or conditioned media, and methods for culturing undifferentiated hES or pPS cells in suspension. The patent portfolio also encompasses novel synthetic surfaces for culturing certain hES or pPS-derived differentiated cell types, including oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. In the past 12 months (during a period commencing on February 15, 2017 and ending on February 14, 2018), 46 new patents were issued that are either owned by us or exclusively licensed to us. Included in the 46 new patents issued in the United States, Europe, Japan, Canada, China, Australia, Israel and South Korea are patents for differentiating pPS cells to hematopoietic progenitors and immature and mature dendritic cells (supporting our AST-VAC2 program) as well as patents covering differentiation of pPS cells to various other lineages, including neural cells, cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes. Other patents that issued during the same period include patents related to various aspects of culture and expansion of undifferentiated hES or pPS cells. With respect to patents that are not specific to our core programs (AST-OPC1, AST-VAC1, and AST-VAC2), we are evaluating licensing and other partnering opportunities, including assignment of certain patents to third parties, on an ongoing basis. We are also evaluating maintenance costs relative to remaining patent term and may choose to no longer maintain certain of these patents. Collectively, these activities may result in a decrease in the total number of patents owned or controlled by us that are not specific to our core programs.
 In February 2016, we executed a broad, non-exclusive cross-license (the Cross-License) with BioTime and its subsidiary ES Cell International Pte Ltd. (ESI). Under the Cross-License, we received: (i) non-exclusive worldwide rights in a range of therapeutic fields to over 30 patents and applications relating to hES cells, and (ii) non-exclusive worldwide rights for therapeutic applications of pluripotent stem cell-derived neural and cardiac cells to over 20 patents and applications relating to hydrogel formulations. Under the Cross-License, BioTime and ESI received a broad, non-exclusive license to certain of our patents and related patent rights for all purposes in the BioTime Licensed Field during the term of the Cross-License. The BioTime Licensed Field includes all fields of use except any and all applications (a) to treat disorders of the nervous system, and (b) utilizing the immune system to prevent, treat, or cure cancer, and (c) involving the use of cells comprising, derived from, or manufactured using, hES cells or human induced pluripotent stem cells for in vitro assay applications, including but not limited to drug discovery and development, drug monitoring, drug toxicology testing, and consumer products testing.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  The patent positions for our core programs (AST-OPC1, AST-VAC1, and AST-VAC2) are summarized below.
 Neural cells: This portfolio is related to our AST-OPC1 product. The patent rights relevant to neural cells, such as oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, include various patent families acquired by us from Geron that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells) into various neural cell types, as well as various culture and purification methods. These patent rights also include rights licensed from the Regents of the University of California. There are issued patents in the United States, Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, China, Hong Kong, India, Korea, Singapore and Israel. Additionally, there are five new pending patent families owned by us directed to improved methods of producing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocyte progenitor cell compositions and methods of treatment of spinal cord injury and stroke using oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. The stroke family is jointly owned with the Regents of the University of California; the other four new pending families are solely owned by us. The expiration dates of the patents acquired from Geron and in-licensed from the Regents of the University of California will be within 2021 to 2030. The potential expiry dates of the four new patent families with applications pending will be within 2036 to 2038. The commercial success of our AST-OPC1 product depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition in this product with this patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, or a combination of both.
 Dendritic cells: This portfolio is related to our AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2 products. The patent rights relevant to dendritic cells include various patent families acquired by us from Geron or in-licensed from third parties that are directed to the differentiation of pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells) into hematopoietic progenitor cells and immature and mature dendritic cells. In addition, these patent rights include a patent family with claims directed to immunogenic compositions comprising antigen-presenting dendritic cells and methods of eliciting an anti-telomerase immune response in a subject by administering to the subject such compositions. There are issued patents in the United States, Australia, Europe, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Israel and Singapore. The expiration dates of the patents acquired from Geron and in-licensed to us range from 2019 to 2029. Additionally, there is a new pending patent family owned by us with claims directed to immunotherapeutic compositions comprising immunogenic peptides and methods of eliciting a cellular mediated immune response in a subject, with a provisional patent application filed in 2017. The potential expiry date of the new patent family with a pending provisional application will be in 2038. The commercial success of our AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2 products depends, in part, upon our ability to exclude competition in these products with this patent portfolio, regulatory exclusivity, or a combination of both.
 In addition, we have patent protection in the Unites States and various other jurisdictions for producing cardiomyocytes, pancreatic islet cells, hepatocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. The expiration dates of these patents range from 2020 to 2032. Should a competitor not be able to market a product covered by these patents or if we cannot license these patents before their expiration, the benefits for procurement and maintenance of these rights would not be fully realized and the associated costs would not be fully reimbursed.
 Licensed Stem Cell Technology and Stem Cell Product Development Agreements
 Telomerase Sublicense
 We received the Telomerase Sublicense from Geron in connection with our acquisition of Gerons stem cell assets. The Telomerase Sublicense grants us an exclusive sublicense under certain patents owned by the University of Colorados University License Equity Holdings, Inc. relating to telomerase and entitles us to use the technology covered by the patents in the development of AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2 as immunological treatments for cancer. Under the Telomerase Sublicense, we paid Geron a one-time upfront license fee of $65,000, and we will pay Geron an annual license maintenance fee of $10,000 due on each anniversary of the effective date of the agreement, and a 1% royalty on sales of any products that we may develop and commercialize that are covered by the sublicensed patents. The Telomerase Sublicense will expire concurrently with the expiration of Gerons license. That license will terminate in November 2018 when the last of the licensed patents expires. The Telomerase Sublicense may also be terminated by us by giving Geron 90 days written notice, by us or by Geron if the other party breaches its obligations under the sublicense agreement and fails to cure their breach within the prescribed time period, or by us or by Geron upon the filing or institution of bankruptcy, reorganization, liquidation or receivership proceedings, or upon an assignment of a substantial portion of the assets for the benefit of creditors by the other party.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  We are obligated to indemnify Geron, Gerons licensor, and certain other parties for certain liabilities, including those for personal injury, product liability, or property damage relating to or arising from the manufacture, use, promotion or sale of a product, or the use by any person of a product made, created, sold or otherwise transferred by us or our sublicensees that is covered by the patents sublicensed under this agreement.
License Agreement with University of California
 Geron assigned to us its Exclusive License Agreement with The Regents of the University of California for patents covering a method for directing the differentiation of pPS cells to glial-restricted progenitor cells that generate pure populations of oligodendrocytes for remyelination and treatment of spinal cord injury. Pursuant to this agreement, we have an exclusive worldwide license under such patents, including the right to grant sublicenses, to create products for biological research, drug screening, and human therapy using the licensed patents.
 Under the license agreement, we will be obligated to pay the university a royalty of 1% from sales of products that are covered by the licensed patent rights, and a minimum annual royalty of $5,000 starting in the year in which the first sale of a product covered by any licensed patent rights occurs, and continuing for the life of the applicable patent right under the agreement. The royalty payments due are subject to reduction, but not by more than 50%, to the extent of any payments that we may be obligated to pay to a third party for the use of patents or other intellectual property licensed from the third party in order to make, have made, use, sell, or import products or otherwise exercise our rights under the Exclusive License Agreement. We will be obligated to pay the university 7.5% of any proceeds, excluding debt financing and equity investments, and certain reimbursements, that we receive from sublicensees, other than our affiliates and joint ventures relating to the development, manufacture, purchase, and sale of products, processes, and services covered by the licensed patent.
 The license agreement will terminate on the expiration of the last-to-expire of the universitys issued licensed patents. If no further patents covered by the license agreement are issued, the license agreement would terminate in 2024. The university may terminate the agreement in the event of our breach of the agreement. We can terminate the agreement upon 60 days notice.
 World-Wide Non-Exclusive WARF License
 On October 7, 2013, we entered into a Non-Exclusive License Agreement with the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) under which we were granted a worldwide non-exclusive license under certain WARF patents and WARF-owned embryonic stem cell lines to develop and commercialize therapeutic, diagnostic and research products. The licensed patents include patents covering methods for growth and differentiation of primate embryonic stem cells. The licensed stem cell lines include the H1, H7, H9, H13, and H14 hES cell lines.
 In consideration of the rights licensed to us, we have agreed to pay WARF an upfront license fee and have agreed to additional payments upon the attainment of specified clinical development milestones, royalties on sales of commercialized products, and, subject to certain exclusions, a percentage of any payments that we may receive from any sublicenses that we may grant to use the licensed patents or stem cell lines.
 The license agreement will terminate with respect to licensed patents upon the expiration of the last licensed patent to expire; with respect to the licensed stem cell lines, the license agreement will remain in force until terminated by either party in accordance with the termination provisions. We may terminate the license agreement at any time by giving WARF prior written notice. WARF may terminate the license agreement if payments of earned royalties, once begun, cease for a specified period of time or if we and any third parties collaborating or cooperating with us in the development of products using the licensed patents or stem cell lines fail to spend a specified minimum amount on research and development of products relating to the licensed patents or stem cell lines for a specified period of time.
 WARF also has the right to terminate the license agreement if we breach the license agreement or become bankrupt or insolvent or if any of the licensed patents or stem cell lines are offered to creditors.
 We will indemnify WARF and certain other designated affiliated entities from liability arising out of or relating to the death or injury of any person or damage to property due to the sale, marketing, use, or manufacture of products that are covered by the licensed patents, or licensed stem cells, or inventions or materials developed or derived from the licensed patents or stem cell lines.

  Royalty Agreement with Geron
 In connection with our acquisition of Gerons stem cell assets, we entered into a royalty agreement with Geron (the Royalty Agreement) pursuant to which we agreed to pay Geron a 4% royalty on net sales (as defined in the Royalty Agreement), by us or any of our affiliates or sales agents, of any products that we develop and commercialize that are covered by the patents Geron contributed to us. In the case of sales of such products by a person other than us or one of our affiliates or sales agents, we will be required to pay Geron 50% of all royalties and cash payments received by us or by our affiliate in respect of a product sale. Royalty payments will be subject to proration in the event that a product covered by a patent acquired from Geron is sold in combination with another product that is not covered by a patent acquired from Geron. The Royalty Agreement will terminate at the expiration or termination date of the last issued patent contributed by Geron under the Royalty Agreement. We estimate that the latest patent expiration date will be in 2032.
Protecting our Intellectual Property
 We seek to protect our intellectual property (IP) by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our patentable IP that we consider important to the development and implementation of our business and strategy. In addition to relying on patents, we rely on trade secrets, know-how, and contractual agreements to protect our IP.
 Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other intellectual property protection for our product candidates including compositions-of-matter, dosages, and formulations, manufacturing methods, and novel applications, uses and technological innovations related to our product candidates and core technologies. Our business would be negatively impacted if we are not successful in developing additional proprietary technologies that are protected either as trade secrets or by filing additional patent applications.
 We cannot ensure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications that may be filed by us in the future, nor can we ensure that any of our existing or subsequently granted patents will be useful in protecting our drug candidates, technological innovations, and processes. The claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection, may not provide a basis for commercially viable products or may not provide us with any competitive advantages. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate, certain patents related to our product candidates will expire before any of our product candidates can be commercialized, while other patents may remain in force for only a short period of time following commercialization, thereby reducing the advantage afforded by any such patent. In addition, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, duplicate any of our technologies and, if patents are licensed or issued to us, design around the patented technologies licensed to or developed by us. Therefore, our competitors may be able to commercialize similar products, or may be able to duplicate our business strategy, without infringing our patents or otherwise using our intellectual property.
 The protection afforded by any particular patent depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, scope of coverage encompassed by the granted claims, availability of extensions of patent term and legal interpretation of patent laws in the United States and other countries that could diminish our ability to protect our inventions and to enforce our intellectual property rights. Furthermore, others may have patents that relate to our technology or business that may prevent us from marketing our product candidates unless we are able to obtain a license to those patents. Accordingly, while our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our products and core technologies will depend, in part, on our success in obtaining and enforcing valid patent claims, we cannot predict with certainty the enforceability of any granted patent claims or of any claims that may be granted from our patent applications.
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation and other challenges regarding patents and other intellectual property rights that involve complex legal and factual questions making our patent position generally uncertain. Any existing or subsequently granted patents may be challenged, invalidated, found unenforceable, circumvented or infringed. We have been involved in the past in administrative proceedings with respect to our patents and patent applications and may, as a result of our extensive portfolio, be involved in such proceedings in the future. Additionally, in the future, we may claim that a third-party infringes our intellectual property or a third party may claim that we infringe its intellectual property. In any of the administrative proceedings or in litigation, we may incur significant expenses, damages, attorneys fees, costs of proceedings and experts fees, and management and employees may be required to spend significant time in connection with these actions.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  A patent interference proceeding may be instituted with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) when more than one person files a patent application covering the same technology, or if someone wishes to challenge the validity of an issued patent on patents and applications filed before March 16, 2013. At the completion of the interference proceeding, the USPTO will determine which competing applicant is entitled to the patent, or whether an issued patent is valid. Patent interference proceedings are complex, highly contested legal proceedings, and the USPTOs decision is subject to appeal. This means that if an interference proceeding arises with respect to any of our patent applications, we may experience significant expenses and delay in obtaining a patent, and if the outcome of the proceeding is unfavorable to us, the patent could be issued to a competitor rather than to us. For patents and applications filed after March 16, 2013 a derivation proceeding may be initiated where the USPTO may determine if one patent was derived from the work of an inventor on another patent. Inventorship may also be challenged in litigation.
 In addition to interference proceedings, the USPTO can reevaluate issued patents at the request of a third party seeking to have the patent invalidated. There are proceedings at the USPTO (ex parte reexamination, post grant review, or inter partes review proceeding), which allow third parties to challenge the validity of an issued patent where there is a reasonable likelihood of invalidity. As with the USPTO interference proceedings, these USPTO proceedings will be very expensive to contest and can result in the cancelation of a patent. This means that patents owned or licensed by us may be subject to further administrative challenges and may be lost if the outcome of the challenge is unfavorable to us.
 There are also challenges to obtaining patents in countries outside of the United States. In particular, under European patent law and the patent laws of certain other countries, oppositions to the issuance of patents may be filed. These foreign proceedings can be very expensive to contest and can result in significant delays in obtaining a patent or can result in a denial of a patent application. Also, in certain countries, there is uncertainty about the eligibility of hES cell subject matter for a patent under so-called morality clauses. Following a December 2014 decision at the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Patent Office now recognizes that human pluripotent stem cells (including hES cells) can be created without a destructive use of human embryos as of June 5, 2003. Consequently, patent applications relating to hES cell subject matter with a filing and priority date after this date are no longer automatically excluded from patentability under Article 53 (a) EPC and Rule 28(c) EPC. In other countries such as India and China, uncertainty about the eligibility of hES cell subject matter for patentability has not been resolved. 
 We may benefit from a variety of regulatory frameworks in the United States, Europe, China and other territories that provide periods of non-patent-based exclusivity for qualifying drug products. See Government Regulation—FDA and Foreign Regulation.
 Manufacturing
 We currently occupy a 44,000 square foot facility in Fremont, California which includes a cGMP compliant facility. We have used this facility to work on updating the manufacturing process for AST-OPC1 and we may eventually use this facility to manufacture AST-OPC1 or other product candidates to supply future trials. We will also rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture certain product candidates. For example, CRUK will manufacture clinical grade AST-VAC2 for the upcoming Phase 1 clinical trial of AST-VAC2.
Competition
 The industry for stem-cell derived therapeutics and other cell therapies is characterized by rapidly evolving technology and intense competition. Our competitors include major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, and chemical and medical products companies operating in the fields of regenerative medicine, cell therapy, tissue engineering, and tissue regeneration. Many of these companies are well-established and possess technical, research and development, financial, and sales and marketing resources significantly greater than ours. In addition, certain smaller biotech companies have formed strategic collaborations, partnerships and other types of joint ventures with larger, well established industry competitors that afford these companies potential research and development and commercialization advantages. Academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations are also conducting and financing research activities which may produce products directly competitive to those we are developing. This intense competition leads to a rapidly evolving landscape on several fronts that creates risks for companies in this space, including changes in standard of care for certain disease states or conditions that we may be targeting for development and new intellectual property related to developing cell therapies that may impact our operations.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Some of our competitors may be trying to develop cell-based technologies and products that may compete with our potential products based on efficacy, safety, cost, and intellectual property positions.
 We may also face competition from companies that have filed patent applications relating to the growth, differentiation and therapeutic use of stem cells and dendritic cells. We may be required to seek licenses from these competitors in order to commercialize certain of our proposed products, and such licenses may not be granted.
 Government Regulation
 Government authorities at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries, extensively regulate among other things, the development, testing, manufacture, quality, approval, distribution, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, marketing, import/export and promotion of drugs, biologics, and medical devices. Authorities also heavily regulate many of these activities for human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products.
 FDA and Foreign Regulation
 We believe that the FDA will regulate most of our proposed products as biologics. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act, and is responsible for implementing regulations. In addition, establishments that manufacture human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products are subject to additional registration and listing requirements, including current good tissue practice regulations. Many of our proposed products will be reviewed by the FDA staff in its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies (OTAT, formerly known as the Office of Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies, or OCTGT).
 In the United States, biologic products like ours are subject to rigorous FDA review and approval procedures. After testing in animals to evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product candidate, an Investigational New Drug application (IND) must be submitted to the FDA to obtain authorization for human testing. Extensive clinical testing, which is generally done in three phases, must then be undertaken at one or more hospitals or medical centers to demonstrate optimal use, safety, and efficacy of each product in humans. The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical testing and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend, or terminate the clinical trial based upon the data which have been accumulated to that point and its assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the intended patient population. All adverse events must be reported to the FDA. Monitoring of all aspects of the study to minimize risks is a continuous process. The time and expense required to perform this clinical testing can far exceed the time and expense of the research and development required to create the product.
 In additional to regulating the clinical development of our products, the FDA regulates in the United States other areas involving our product, including:
 
• | Applications for Marketing Approval: No action can be taken to market any therapeutic product in the United States until an appropriate application, which in the case of a cell therapy or vaccine product will be a Biologics License Application (BLA), has been approved by the FDA. FDA regulations also restrict the export of therapeutic products for clinical use prior to BLA approval. To date, the FDA has not granted marketing approval to any hES-based therapeutic products and it is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies may subject our product candidates to additional or more stringent review than drugs or biologics derived from other technologies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Combination Products: If we develop any products that are used with medical devices, they may be considered combination products, which are defined by the FDA to include products comprised of two or more regulated components or parts such as a biologic and a device. The regulatory requirements for a combination product comprised of a biologic administered with a delivery device can be more complex, because in addition to the individual regulatory requirements for each component, additional combination product regulatory requirements may apply.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Post-Approval Matters: Even after initial FDA approval has been obtained, further studies may be required to provide additional data on safety or to gain approval for the use of a product as a treatment for clinical indications other than those initially targeted. Data resulting from these clinical trials may result in expansions or restrictions to the labeled indications for which a product has already been approved.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Manufacturing: The FDA regulates the manufacturing process of pharmaceutical products, and human tissue and cell products, requiring that they be produced in compliance with cGMP.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  
• | FDA Regulation of Advertising and Product Promotion: The FDA also regulates the content of advertisements used to market pharmaceutical and biological products. Claims made in advertisements concerning the safety and efficacy of a product, or any advantages of a product over another product, must be supported by clinical data filed as part of a BLA or an amendment to a BLA, and must be consistent with the FDA approved labeling and dosage information for that product.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Sales of pharmaceutical and biological products outside the United States are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country. Even if FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The time required to obtain such approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 California State Regulations
 The state of California has adopted legislation and regulations that require institutions that conduct stem cell research to notify, and in certain cases obtain approval from, a Stem Cell Research Oversight Committee (SCRO Committee) before conducting the research. Under certain California regulations, all hES cell lines that will be used in our research must be acceptably derived.
 We also comply with certain California regulations that require certain records to be maintained with respect to stem cell research and the materials used.
 In compliance with state regulations, we have formed a SCRO Committee which reviews each of Asterias projects that involve the use of pluripotent stem cells. The committee reviews and confirms that we are using only hES cell lines that have been acceptably derived and that the research conducted using these cells lines is both scientifically and ethically justified. The AST-OPC1 and AST-VAC2 programs have been reviewed by the SCRO Committee and have been deemed to comply with federal and state guidelines. The hES cell lines that we use are all on the National Institutes of Health (NIH) registry of lines that have been reviewed and meet standards for federal funding grants.
 California Proposition 71
 During November 2004, California State Proposition 71 (Prop. 71), the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative, was adopted by state-wide referendum. Prop. 71 provides for a state-sponsored program designed to encourage stem cell research in the State of California, and to finance such research with State funds totaling approximately $295,000,000 annually for an initially scheduled 10 years beginning in 2005. This initiative created CIRM, which will provide grants, primarily but not exclusively, to academic institutions to advance both hES cell research and adult stem cell research. On October 16, 2014 we signed a NGA with CIRM, effective October 1, 2014, with respect to a $14.3 million grant award for clinical development of our product, AST-OPC1. As of December 31, 2017, we have received the entire $14.3 million.
Employees
 In 2017, we made adjustments to our operating expenses as appropriate by reducing staffing allocated to non-clinical activities as a part of a broader effort to more closely align operating expenses with the Companys primary goal of continuing to generate clinical data in our clinical stage programs. The reduction in staffing reduced our number of employees by approximately 25 employees.
 As of March 1, 2018, we employed 31 persons on a full-time basis, with 12 of our employees holding M.D. and/or Ph.D. degrees in one or more fields of medicine or science. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. All of our employees except for one individual located in the United Kingdom are based in the United States.
 Research and Development
 Our research and development expenses were $26.6 million, $25.5, million and $17.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015 respectively.
