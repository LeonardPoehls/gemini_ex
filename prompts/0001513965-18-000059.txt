Item 1. Business
Overview
American Midstream Partners, LP is a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership that was formed in August 2009 to own, operate, develop and acquire a diversified portfolio of midstream energy assets. We provide critical midstream infrastructure that links producers of natural gas, crude oil, NGLs, condensate and specialty chemicals to numerous intermediate and end-use markets. Through our five reportable segments, (i) gas gathering and processing services, (ii) liquid pipelines and services, (iii) natural gas transportation services, (iv) offshore pipelines and services and (v) terminalling services, we engage in the business of gathering, treating, processing, and transporting natural gas; gathering, transporting, storing, treating and fractionating NGLs; gathering, storing and transporting crude oil and condensates and storing specialty chemical products and refined products. As of September 1, 2017, as a result of the disposition of the Propane Marketing Services business ("Propane Business") described in Note 4 - Discontinued Operations, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, we have eliminated the Propane Marketing Services segment.
Our primary assets are strategically located in some of the most prolific onshore and offshore producing regions and key demand markets in the United States. Our gathering and processing assets are primarily located in (i) the Permian Basin of West Texas, (ii) the Cotton Valley/Haynesville Shale of East Texas, (iii) the Eagle Ford Shale of South Texas, (iv) the Bakken Shale of North Dakota and (v) offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Our liquid pipelines, natural gas transportation and offshore pipelines and terminal assets are located in prolific producing regions and key demand markets in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, Texas, Tennessee and in the Port of New Orleans in Louisiana and the Port of Brunswick in Georgia. Additionally, we operate a fleet of NGL gathering and transportation trucks in the Eagle Ford shale and the Permian Basin. See Recent Developments for more information about our recent acquisitions and dispositions.
We own or have ownership interests in more than 5,100 miles of onshore and offshore natural gas, crude oil, NGL and saltwater pipelines across 17 gathering systems, seven interstate pipelines and nine intrastate pipelines; eight natural gas processing plants; four fractionation facilities; an offshore semisubmersible floating production system with nameplate processing capacity of 90 MBbl/d of crude oil and 220 MMcf/d of natural gas; six marine terminal sites with approximately 6.7 MMBbls of above-ground aggregate storage capacity for petroleum products, distillates, chemicals and agricultural products; and 90 active transportation trucks and a total trailer fleet of 130, of which 35 are Liquefied Petroleum Gas ("LPG") trailers and 95 are crude oil trailers.
A portion of our cash flow is derived from our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, including a 66.67% operated interest in Destin Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (“Destin”), a natural gas pipeline; a 35.7% non-operated interest in the Class A units of Delta House FPS LLC ("FPS") and of Delta House Oil and Gas Lateral LLC ("Lateral") (collectively referred to herein as "Delta House"), which is a floating production system platform and related pipeline infrastructure; a 16.7% non-operated interest in Tri-States NGL Pipeline, L.L.C. ("Tri-States"), an NGL pipeline; a 66.7% operated interest in Okeanos Gas Gathering Company, LLC ("Okeanos"), a natural gas pipeline; and a 25.3% non-operated interest in Wilprise Pipeline Company, L.L.C. (“Wilprise”), a NGL pipeline.
We manage our business and analyze and report our results of operations through five reportable segments.
• Gas Gathering and Processing Services. Our Gas Gathering and Processing Services segment provides “wellhead-to-market” services to producers of natural gas and NGLs, which include transporting raw natural gas from various receipt points through gathering systems, treating the raw natural gas, processing raw natural gas to separate the NGLs from the natural gas, fractionating NGLs, and selling or delivering pipeline quality natural gas and NGLs to various markets and pipeline systems.

Pending Southcross Energy Partners, L.P. Merger
On October 31, 2017, we, our General Partner, our wholly owned subsidiary, Cherokee Merger Sub LLC (“Merger Sub”), Southcross Energy Partners, L.P. (“SXE”), and Southcross Energy Partners GP, LLC (“SXE GP”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “SXE Merger Agreement”). Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the SXE Merger Agreement, SXE will merge with Merger Sub (the “SXE Merger”), with SXE continuing its existence under Delaware law as the surviving entity in the SXE Merger and wholly owned subsidiary of us. 
At the effective time of the SXE Merger (the “Effective Time”), each common unit of SXE (each, an “SXE Common Unit”) issued and outstanding or deemed issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive 0.160 (the “Exchange Ratio”) of a common unit (each, an “AMID Common Unit”) representing limited partner interests in us (the “Merger Consideration”), except for those SXE Common Units held by affiliates of SXE and SXE GP, which will be canceled for no consideration. Each SXE Common Unit, Subordinated Unit (as defined in the SXE Merger Agreement) and Class B Convertible Unit (as defined in the SXE Merger Agreement) held by Southcross Holdings LP (“Holdings LP”) or any of its subsidiaries and the SXE Incentive Distribution Rights (as defined in the SXE Merger Agreement) outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be canceled in connection with the closing of the SXE Merger.
In connection with the SXE Merger Agreement, on October 31, 2017, we and our General Partner entered into a Contribution Agreement (the “SXE Contribution Agreement” and, together with the SXE Merger Agreement, the “SXE Transaction Agreements”) with Holdings LP. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the SXE Contribution Agreement, Holdings LP will contribute its equity interests in its new wholly owned subsidiary (“SXH Holdings”), which will hold substantially all the current subsidiaries (Southcross Holdings Intermediary LLC, Southcross Holdings Guarantor GP LLC and Southcross Holdings Guarantor LP) and business of Holdings LP, to us and our General Partner in exchange for (i) the number of AMID Common Units with a value equal to $185,697,148, subject to certain adjustments for cash, indebtedness, working capital and transaction expenses contemplated by the SXE Contribution Agreement, divided by $13.69 per AMID Common Unit, (ii) 4,500,000 AMID Preferred Units (as defined in the SXE Contribution Agreement), (iii) options to purchase 4,500,000 AMID Common Units (the “Options”), and (iv) 3,000 AMID GP Class D Units (as defined in the SXE Contribution Agreement) (the transactions contemplated thereby and the agreements ancillary thereto, the “SXE Contribution” and together with the SXE Merger, the “SXE Transactions”). A portion of the consideration will be deposited into escrow in order to secure certain post-closing obligations of Holdings LP. Concurrently with the closing of the transaction, our agreement of limited partnership will be amended to reflect the issuance of AMID Preferred Units, and the GP LLC Agreement will be amended to reflect the issuance of such AMID GP Class D Units.
As disclosed in the Registration statement on Form S-4, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on January 11, 2018, the SXE Merger has a total aggregate consideration of $817.9 million, including a total assumed debt of $644.6 million.
Other developments 
In the fourth quarter of 2017, we were notified by the operator of Delta House FPS that certain third party-owned upstream infrastructure would require remedial work, resulting in a temporary delay of production volumes flowing into Delta House. This remediation is scheduled to be completed later in the second quarter of 2018, at which time full production is anticipated to resume flowing into Delta House. This has resulted in a reduction in cash distributions from Delta House, including those attributable to our 35.7% interest, during the curtailment. 
On March 11, 2018, we and Magnolia Infrastructure Holdings, LLC ("Magnolia"), an affiliate of ArcLight, entered into a Capital Contribution Agreement to provide additional capital and corporate overhead support to us during the first three quarters of 2018 in connection with temporary curtailment of production flows at Delta House. Pursuant to the agreement, Magnolia has agreed to provide support to us in an amount to be agreed, up to the difference between the actual cash distribution received by us on account of our interest in Delta House and the quarterly cash distribution expected to be received if production flows to Delta House had not been not curtailed.
On February 16, 2018, we announced the sale of the Refined Products Terminals (the "Refined Products Business") consisting of two terminal facilities, located in Caddo Mills, Texas ("Caddo Mills") and North Little Rock, Arkansas ("NLR"), to DKGP Energy Terminals LLC, a joint venture between Delek Logistics Partners, LP and Green Plains Partners LP, for approximately $138.5 million in cash, subject to working capital adjustments. Closing of the sale of the Refined Products Business is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018.

Market Conditions
Average daily prices for New York Mercantile Exchange ("NYMEX") West Texas Intermediate ("WTI") crude oil ranged from a high of $66.27 per barrel to a low of $42.48 per barrel from January 1, 2017 through March 26, 2018. Average daily prices for NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas ranged from a high of $6.24 per MMBtu to a low of $2.44 per MMBtu from January 1, 2017 through March 26, 2018. 
Fluctuations in energy prices can greatly affect the development of new crude oil and natural gas reserves. Further increases in commodity prices of crude oil and natural gas, as observed through the later part of 2017, could have a positive impact on exploration, development and production activity, and, if sustained, could lead to a material increase in such activity. Sustained expansion or reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operation would lead to continued or further increased or reduced utilization of our assets. We are unable to predict future potential movements in the market price for natural gas, crude oil and NGLs and thus, cannot predict the ultimate impact of commodity prices on our operations.
Business Strategies
Our business objectives continue to focus on maintaining stable cash flows from our existing assets and executing on growth opportunities to increase our long-term cash flows on a per unit basis. We believe the key elements to stable cash flows are the diversity of our asset portfolio and our fee-based business which represents a significant portion of our estimated margins, the objective of which is to protect against downside risk in our cash flows.
Utilize our strategically located and integrated assets to maximize value for our customers. We own and operate a portfolio of midstream assets strategically located in some of the most prolific natural gas and crude oil producing regions and key demand markets in the United States and offshore in the Gulf of Mexico. Through our diversified and integrated asset base, we provide critical infrastructure that links producers of natural gas, crude oil, NGLs, condensate and specialty chemicals to numerous intermediate and end-use markets while allowing us to generate revenue and service the same energy molecules at various stages along the midstream value chain.
Enhance existing assets and realize operating efficiencies. We intend to enhance the profitability of our assets by increasing utilization, realizing operating efficiencies and providing additional midstream services desired by our customers. We continually seek to attract new volumes from existing and new customers through superior customer service and asset optimization. In addition, we expect to be able to provide additional midstream services to our customers by cross-selling complementary services. For example, we intend to leverage our crude oil and NGL trucking capabilities across our onshore gathering and processing footprint and expand our service offering in the Permian Basin and Cotton Valley/Haynesville Shale. We can accommodate additional volumes at minimal incremental cost, which provides highly attractive economics.
Capitalize on organic growth opportunities. We continually seek to identify and evaluate economically attractive organic expansion opportunities that leverage our asset footprint and strategic relationships with our customers. These organic projects include new interconnects, repurposing underutilized assets and adding additional capacity to meet increased demand from our customers.  
Pursue accretive acquisitions. We plan to pursue accretive acquisitions of complementary midstream assets that will allow us to increase market share and density in our core operating areas and realize operational efficiencies and commercial synergies. Future acquisition opportunities may include bolt-on acquisitions within our asset footprint, consolidation of third party interests in our joint ventures and strategic acquisitions. Our partnership with ArcLight may present us with future drop-down opportunities and the ability to jointly pursue third party acquisitions that may not otherwise be feasible on a stand-alone basis.
Maintain focus on stable, fee-based and fixed-margin cash flow with minimal direct exposure to commodity prices. We seek to minimize our direct commodity price exposure and maintain stable cash flow by generating a substantial portion of our total gross margin pursuant to fee-based and fixed-margin contracts. We have been successful executing on this strategy and have increased the percentage of gross margin generated from fee-based and fixed-margin contracts for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Maintain a conservative and flexible capital structure. We plan to pursue a disciplined financial policy and maintain a conservative capital structure to allow us to pursue additional organic growth projects and acquisitions, with a conservative mix of debt and equity, even in challenging market environments.

Competitive Strengths 
We believe we are well-positioned to successfully execute our strategy because of the following competitive strengths:
Stable and predictable cash flows supported by fee-based and fixed-margin contracts. Substantially all of our transmission and terminal assets are contracted on a firm transportation or take-or-pay basis and a majority of our offshore assets are contracted under long-term, life-of-lease dedications. We believe that the nature of our contracts minimizes our direct commodity price exposure and enhances the stability of our business and the predictability of our financial performance.
Diversified and strategically located portfolio of midstream assets. Our assets are diversified geographically and by business line, which contribute to the stability of our cash flows. We operate throughout many of the most prolific crude oil and natural gas producing regions in the United States and offshore Gulf of Mexico. We have access to multiple sources of crude oil, natural gas and liquids and are in close proximity to various interstate and intrastate pipelines as well as utility, industrial and other commercial end users. Our diverse and creditworthy customer base includes several large producers, refiners and marketers.
Significant scale and capability. As of December 31, 2017, after giving effect to the JPE Merger and other acquisitions, we have approximately $1.9 billion in total assets across the midstream value chain providing onshore and offshore crude oil and natural gas gathering, processing, transmission and storage as well as hydrocarbon and refined product terminal assets and NGL fractionation, distribution and sales. Following the closing of the JPE Merger, we own or have an ownership interest in approximately 5,100 miles of onshore and offshore natural gas, crude oil, NGL and saltwater pipelines across 17 gathering systems, seven interstate pipelines and nine intrastate pipelines; eight natural gas processing plants; four fractionation facilities; an offshore semi-submersible floating production system with nameplate processing capacity of 90 MBbl/d of crude oil and 220 MMcf/d of natural gas; six marine terminal sites with approximately 6.7 MMBbls of above-ground storage capacity; and 90 transportation trucks and a total trailer fleet of 130, of which 35 are LPG trailers and 95 are crude oil trailers. We believe our size, scale and capabilities enhance our ability to serve our customers and provide financial flexibility and an increased ability to access the capital markets.
Strategically located offshore position with high barriers to entry. We have a substantial footprint in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico with our ownership interest in the Delta House platform and associated assets. This state-of-the-art floating, production and storage facility is located in one of the most active parts of the deep-water Gulf of Mexico and we have well-established relationships and long-term agreements with key participants along the entire value chain in the region. We believe producers in the areas of the Gulf of Mexico in which we operate are motivated to connect their production to our existing pipelines as construction of new pipelines is often not feasible due to cost and timing considerations. In addition, we have acquired additional strategic assets that provide us with substantial operational flexibility including multiple delivery and offload points as we move hydrocarbons from source to market, allowing us to provide a valuable and differentiated service to our customers.
Relationship with ArcLight. Our relationship with ArcLight provides us with access to ArcLight’s extensive operational and commercial expertise. ArcLight indirectly owns 48.6% of our limited partner interests and 100% of the IDRs. We believe that ArcLight is economically incentivized to promote and support our business plan and to pursue projects that enhance the overall value of our business.
Experienced management and operational teams. Our executive management team has an average of approximately 20 years of experience in the midstream energy industry. The team possesses a comprehensive skill set to support our business and execute our business strategy through asset optimization, accretive development projects and acquisitions. 
Our Segments
AMID manages its business under five distinct operating segments: Gas Gathering and Processing Services, Liquid Pipelines and Services, Natural Gas Transportation Services, Offshore Pipelines and Services and Terminalling Services. Each segment is explained below along with description of the assets that support each of those segments.
Gas Gathering and Processing (G&P) Services Segment
Results of operations from the Gas Gathering and Processing Services segment are determined primarily by the volumes of natural gas we gather, process and fractionate, the commercial terms in our current contract portfolio and natural gas, crude oil, NGL and condensate prices. We gather and process natural gas primarily pursuant to the following arrangements:

7

 Fee-Based Arrangements. Under these arrangements, we generally are paid a fixed fee for gathering, processing and transporting natural gas.

 Fixed-Margin Arrangements. Under these arrangements, we purchase natural gas and off-spec condensate from producers or suppliers at receipt points on our systems at an index price less a fixed transportation fee and simultaneously sell an identical volume of natural gas or off-spec condensate at delivery points on our systems at the same, undiscounted index price. By entering into back-to-back purchases and sales of natural gas or off-spec condensate, we are able to lock in a fixed margin on these transactions. We view the segment gross margin earned under our fixed-margin arrangements to be economically equivalent to the fee earned in our fee-based arrangements.
 Percent-of-Proceeds Arrangements (“POP”). Under these arrangements, we generally gather raw natural gas from producers at the wellhead or other supply points, transport it through our gathering system, process it and sell the residue natural gas, NGLs and condensate at market prices. Where we provide processing services at the processing plants that we own, or obtain processing services for our own account in connection with our elective processing arrangements, we generally retain and sell a percentage of the residue natural gas and resulting NGLs. However, we also have contracts under which we retain a percentage of the resulting NGLs and do not retain a percentage of residue natural gas. Our POP arrangements also often contain a fee-based component.
Gross margin earned under fee-based and fixed-margin arrangements is directly related to the volume of natural gas that flows through our systems and is not directly dependent on commodity prices. However, a sustained decline in commodity prices could result in a decline in throughput volumes from producers and, thus, a decrease in our fee-based and fixed-margin gross margin. These arrangements provide stable cash flows, but upside in higher commodity-price environments is limited to an increase in throughput volumes from producers. Under our typical POP arrangement, our gross margin is directly impacted by the commodity prices we realize on our share of natural gas and NGLs received as compensation for processing raw natural gas. However, our POP arrangements often contain a fee-based component, which helps to mitigate the degree of commodity-price volatility we could experience under these arrangements. We further seek to mitigate our exposure to commodity price risk through our hedging program. See the information set forth in Part II, Item 7A of this Report under the caption - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk - Commodity Price Risk.
Our Gas Gathering and Processing Services assets are located in Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas and in shallow state and federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Louisiana and are positioned in areas with opportunities for organic growth. We continually seek new sources of raw natural gas and crude oil supply to maintain and increase the throughput volume on our gathering systems and through our processing plants.
We generally derive revenue in our Gas Gathering and Processing Services segment from fee-based, fixed-margin and POP arrangements, for our producer and supplier customers and our own account. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our fee-based, fixed-margin arrangements and our POP arrangements accounted for approximately 59.1% and 40.9%, respectively, of our segment gross margin for the Gathering and Processing Services segment.
In our G&P segment, we have the following assets:
Lavaca System
The Lavaca System consists of 203 miles of high and low-pressure pipelines ranging from four to 12 inches in diameter with 24,960 horsepower of leased compression, 3,215 horsepower of owned compression and associated facilities located in the Eagle Ford shale in Gonzales and Lavaca Counties, Texas. The Lavaca System currently has a design capacity of approximately 218 MMcf/d.

The Chatom System consists of a 25 MMcf/d refrigeration processing plant, a 1,600 Bbl/d fractionation unit, a 160 long-ton per day sulfur recovery unit, and a 24-mile gas gathering system and compression capacity of 3,456 horsepower. The system is located in Washington County, Alabama, approximately 15 miles from our Bazor Ridge processing plant in Wayne County, Mississippi. The Chatom System gathers natural gas from onshore crude oil and natural gas wells in the Norphlet and Smackover formations in Alabama and Mississippi. Chatom also has a truck rack and the capability to receive and fractionate NGLs.
Bazor Ridge System
The Bazor Ridge gathering and processing system consists of approximately 169 miles of pipeline, with diameters ranging from three to eight inches, and three compressor stations with a combined compression capacity of 1,069 horsepower. Our Bazor Ridge System is located in Jasper, Clarke, Wayne and Greene counties of Mississippi. The Bazor Ridge System also contains an idled sour natural gas treating and cryogenic processing plant located in Wayne County, Mississippi, with a design capacity of approximately 22 MMcf/d as well as four inlets and one discharge compressor with approximately 5,218 of combined horsepower. The natural gas supply for our Bazor Ridge System is derived primarily from rich natural gas produced from crude oil wells targeting the mature Upper Smackover formation. Since 2016, the Bazor Ridge facility has been exclusively used as a central gathering and compression facility and processing has been re-routed to the Chatom System. 
Glade Crossing
The Glade Crossing processing facility consists of a refrigeration unit, amine plant, and dehydration equipment with a design capacity of 5 MMcf/d. The facility is located near Laurel in Jones County, Mississippi.
Burns Point
Burns Point Plant is a cryogenic processing plant with a design capacity of 165 MMcf/d that is jointly owned by us and the plant operator, Enterprise Gas Processing, LLC ("Enterprise"). We hold a 50% undivided, non-operated interest in the Burns Point Plant. We acquired an interest in the asset group and not in a legal entity. We and Enterprise are proportionately liable for the liabilities. Outside of the rights and responsibilities of the operator, we and Enterprise have equal rights and obligations to the assets. Significant non-capital and maintenance capital expenditures, plant expansions and significant plant dispositions require the approval of both owners. The plant has been shut down since December 2017 due to maintenance issues. 
Offshore Texas System
The Offshore Texas System consists of the GIGS and Brazos systems, which have approximately 56 miles of pipeline with diameters ranging from six to sixteen inches and a design capacity of approximately 100 MMcf/d. The Offshore Texas System is in a position to provide gathering and dehydration services to natural gas producers in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico offshore Texas. Since 2016, the offshore pipe on both systems was abandoned, and the onshore pipe was out of service.
Mesquite
We own a 48.4% non-operated interest in Mesquite, a collaborative arrangement with EnLink Midstream located near Midland, Texas. The Mesquite facility includes a rail terminal and 5,000 Bbl/d fractionation unit that facilitates the receipt, treatment and sale of off-spec condensate and NGLs via pipeline, truck and rail.

Liquid Pipelines and Services Segment
Results of operations from the Liquid Pipelines and Services segment are determined by the volumes of crude oil transported on the interstate and intrastate pipelines we own. Tariffs associated with our Bakken system are regulated by FERC for volumes gathered via pipeline and trucked to the AMID Truck facility in Watford City, North Dakota. Volumes transported on our Silver Dollar system are underpinned by long-term, fee-based contracts. Our transportation arrangements are further described below:

Firm Transportation Arrangements. Our obligation to provide firm transportation service means that, pursuant to the agreement with the shipper, we transport crude oil nominated by the shipper up to the maximum daily quantity specified in the contract. In exchange for that obligation on our part, the shipper pays a specified reservation charge, whether or not the shipper utilizes the capacity. In most cases, the shipper also pays a variable-use charge with respect to quantities actually transported by us. 
Uncommitted Shipper Arrangements. Our obligation to provide interruptible transportation service means that we are only obligated to transport crude oil nominated by the shipper to the extent that we have available capacity. For this service the shipper pays no reservation charge but pays a variable-use or commodity charge for quantities actually shipped.

Fee-Based Arrangements. Under these arrangements our operations are underpinned by long-term, fee-based contracts with leading producers in the Midland Basin. Some of these contracts also have minimum volume commitments as well as some have acreage dedications.

Buy-Sell Arrangements. We enter into outright purchase and sales contracts as well as buy/sell contracts with counterparties, under which contracts we gather and transport different types of crude oil and eventually sell the crude oil to either the same counterparty or different counterparties. We account for such revenue arrangements on a gross basis. Occasionally, we enter into crude oil inventory exchange arrangements with the same counterparty which the purchase and sale of inventory are considered in contemplation of each other. Revenues from such inventory exchange arrangements are recorded on a net basis.
Following are brief descriptions of the assets that make up the Liquid Pipelines and Services segment:
Bakken System
The Bakken crude oil gathering pipeline system consists of a 43-mile pipeline with capacity to transport up to approximately 40,000 Bbls/d of crude oil to the Tesoro Logistics pipeline located Northeast of Watford City, North Dakota and a planned interconnect with the Energy Transfer Dakota Access Pipeline. The system, which commenced operations in October 2015, provides producers in the area with access to refinery, rail and pipeline markets. The system also has the capability to receive volumes through its truck rack, which also commenced operations in November 2015. 
Silver Dollar Pipeline
The Silver Dollar Pipeline is located in the Permian basin and with capacity to transport approximately 130,000 Bbls/d of crude oil. The pipeline was constructed in 2013.
Crude Oil Supply and Logistics (COSL) and AMID Liquids Trucking
Our Marketing business operates around both crude pipeline assets and trucking hubs. We buy and sell crude in North Dakota and Texas to facilitate movements on our pipelines. We operate crude oil trucks in the West Texas, South Texas and the Texas Panhandle. We have a fleet of over 75 crude oil trucks as well as 20 NGL trucks that assist our marketing efforts. 
Other Systems
Tri-States, Cayenne and Wilprise are also part of the Liquid Pipelines and Services segment and are listed under Investment in Unconsolidated Affiliates below.
Natural Gas Transportation Services Segment
Results of operations from the Natural Gas Transportation Services segment are determined by a capacity reservation charge from firm transportation contracts, a variable-use or commodity charge for firm and interruptible transportation contracts and the volumes 
10

of natural gas transported on the interstate and intrastate pipelines we own pursuant to interruptible transportation or fixed-margin contracts. Our transportation arrangements are further described below:

Firm Transportation Arrangements. Our obligation to provide firm transportation service means that, pursuant to the agreement with the shipper, we transport natural gas nominated by the shipper up to the maximum daily quantity specified in the contract. In exchange for that obligation on our part, the shipper pays a specified reservation charge, whether or not the shipper utilizes the capacity. In most cases, the shipper also pays a variable-use or commodity charge with respect to quantities actually transported by us.

Interruptible Transportation Arrangements. Our obligation to provide interruptible transportation service means that, pursuant to the agreement with the shipper, we only transport natural gas nominated by the shipper to the extent that we have available capacity. For this service the shipper pays no reservation charge but pays a variable-use or commodity charge for quantities actually shipped.

Fixed-Margin Arrangements. Under these arrangements, we purchase natural gas from producers or suppliers at receipt points on our systems at an index price less a fixed transportation fee and simultaneously sell an identical volume of natural gas at delivery points on our systems at the same undiscounted index price. We view fixed-margin arrangements to be economically equivalent to our interruptible transportation arrangements.
Following are brief descriptions of the assets that make up the Natural Gas Transportation Services segment:
Midla and MLGT Systems
Our Midla System is a FERC-regulated interstate natural gas pipeline. On April 16, 2015, the FERC approved the Midla Agreement between Midla and its customers allowing Midla to retire the existing 1920's pipeline, which was comprised of approximately 355 miles of pipeline ranging in diameter from two to 22 inches and linked the Monroe Natural Gas Field in northern Louisiana and interconnections with the Transco Pipeline System to customers in Mississippi and Louisiana, and replace the existing natural gas service with a new 52-mile, high pressure 12-inch pipeline (the Midla-Natchez Line) to serve long-standing residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Under the Midla Agreement, customers not served by the new Midla-Natchez Line were connected to other interstate or intrastate pipelines, other gas distribution systems, or offered conversion to propane service. On June 29, 2015, the Partnership filed for authorization to construct the Midla-Natchez pipeline with the FERC, which was approved on December 17, 2015. Construction commenced in the second quarter of 2016 and service on the Midla-Natchez line began on March 31, 2017. Under the Midla Agreement, Midla executed multiple long-term agreements seeking to recover its investment in the Midla-Natchez Line. As of December 2017, the 1920’s vintage pipeline was inactive.
The Mid Louisiana Gas Transmission LLC (“MLGT”) System is an intrastate transmission system that sources natural gas from interconnects with the Florida Gas Transmission (FGT) Pipeline system, the TETCO Pipeline system, the Transco Pipeline system and the Gulf South Pipeline and delivers to various markets including the city of Baton Rouge utility demand, Louisiana refinery owned and operated by ExxonMobil Corporation, and several other industrial customers. Our MLGT-Baton Rouge System is comprised of approximately 65 miles of pipeline with diameters ranging from three to 16 inches. 
The northern portion of the MLGT system, which includes the T-32 lateral that was acquired from Midla in 2017 in conjunction with the FERC approved Midla Agreement, consists of approximately ten miles of high-pressure pipeline with diameters ranging from six to 16 inches. Natural gas on this system is sourced from Tennessee Gas Pipeline and delivered to multiple power plants operated by Entergy. In addition, the ANGUS Chemical facility was connected on the T-32 system in the first half of 2017, increasing the T-32 system load by approximately 7,000 Mcf/d. The entire MLGT System is connected to six receipt and 28 delivery points.

Offshore Pipelines and Services Segment
Results of operations from the Offshore Pipelines and Services segment are determined by capacity reservation fees from firm and interruptible transportation contracts and the volumes of natural gas transported on the interstate and intrastate pipelines we own pursuant to interruptible transportation or fixed-margin contracts. Our transportation arrangements are further described below:

Firm Transportation Arrangements. Our obligation to provide firm transportation service means that, pursuant to the agreement with the shipper, we transport natural gas nominated by the shipper up to the maximum daily quantity specified in the contract. In exchange for that obligation on our part, the shipper pays a specified reservation charge, whether or not the shipper utilizes the capacity. In most cases, the shipper also pays a variable-use charge with respect to quantities actually transported by us.

Interruptible Transportation Arrangements. Our obligation to provide interruptible transportation service means that, pursuant to the agreement with the shipper, we only transport natural gas nominated by the shipper to the extent that we have available capacity. For this service the shipper pays no reservation charge but pays a variable-use charge for quantities actually shipped.

Fixed-Margin Arrangements. Under these arrangements, we purchase natural gas from producers or suppliers at receipt points on our systems at an index price less a fixed transportation fee and simultaneously sell an identical volume of natural gas at delivery points on our systems at the same undiscounted index price. We view fixed-margin arrangements to be economically equivalent to our interruptible transportation arrangements.

Following are brief descriptions of the assets that make up the Terminalling Services segment:
Westwego Terminal Operations
The Westwego Terminal site consists of 48 above-ground storage tanks with a combined capacity of 1,044,600 barrels. Our operations support many different commercial customers, including commodity brokers, refiners and chemical manufacturers. Our location within the Port of New Orleans, the warehousing and international distribution attributes this location provides, along with our broad customer base, contributes to the potential diversity of the products customers may want stored in our terminal. The products will generally fall into two broad categories: chemical and agricultural. 
Our income from the Westwego Terminal is derived from storage capacity contracts, throughput charges for receipt and delivery of our customers' products; and other services requested by our customers, such as blending services. The terms of our storage capacity contracts range from month-to-month to multiple years, with renewal options. 
At the Westwego Terminal, we generally receive our customers' liquid product by river vessel at our Mississippi River dock and by railcar. The product is transferred from the river vessels and railcars to the specified storage tank via the terminal's internal pipeline system. The customer's product is removed from storage at our terminal by truck, railcar and/or water vessel. The length of time that the customer's product is held in storage without transfer varies depending upon the customer's needs. 
Brunswick Terminal Operations
The Brunswick Terminal site consists of one 60,000-barrel above-ground storage tank, two 80,000-barrel above-ground storage tanks and two 500-barrel above-ground storage tanks with a combined capacity of 221,000 barrels. The Brunswick Terminal is currently leasing land from the Georgia Ports Authority pursuant to a lease that is in effect until April 2026. 
This terminal is ideally suited to serve petroleum, chemical and agricultural customers who need deep-water access and distribution in the southeastern United States. Income from the Brunswick Terminal is derived from storage capacity contracts, throughput charges for receipt and delivery of our customers' products and other services requested by our customers, such as blending services. The terms of our storage capacity contracts will range from month-to-month to multiple years, with renewal options. 
At the Brunswick Terminal, we offer product transfer via river vessel, railcar and bulk-liquid carrying truck. At the Brunswick Terminal, the customer's liquid product is received by barge or ship at the dock. The product is transferred from barges or ships to the storage tank via the terminal's internal pipeline system. The customer's product is removed from storage at our terminal by truck or railcar. The length of time that the customer's product is to be held in storage without transfer will vary depending on the customer's needs. 
Harvey Terminal Operations 
The Harvey Terminal is located on 56 acres on the west bank of the Mississippi River in the Port of New Orleans and equipped to handle a wide variety of petroleum and chemical products. Terminal storage operations at the Harvey Terminal commenced in July 2014 and currently consists of 34 above-ground storage tanks with a combined capacity of approximately 1,135,200 barrels. The Harvey Terminal is a full-service storage site, including 3,000 feet of rail track that can accommodate up to 50 cars and a two bay semi-automated truck loading facility. At the Harvey Terminal, we generally receive our customers' liquid product by river vessel at our Mississippi River dock and by railcar. The product is transferred from the river vessels and railcars to the specified storage tank via the terminal's internal pipeline system. The customer's product is removed from storage at our terminal by truck, railcar and/or water vessel. When fully developed, the Harvey Terminal has the potential to provide more than 2 million barrels of storage capacity. 
Cushing
Our crude oil storage facility in Cushing, Oklahoma has an aggregate shell capacity of approximately 3.0 million barrels. We generate crude oil storage revenues by charging customers a fixed monthly fee per barrel of shell capacity that is not contingent on the customer's actual usage of our storage tanks, i.e., take-or-pay firm storage contracts. 
14

North Little Rock and Caddo Mills 
Our refined products terminals have aggregate storage capacity of approximately 1.3 million barrels at two refined products terminals located in North Little Rock, Arkansas and Caddo Mills, Texas. Our North Little Rock terminal has storage capacity of approximately 550,000 barrels from 11 tanks and is primarily supplied by a refined products pipeline operated by Enterprise TE Products Pipeline Company LLC. Our Caddo Mills terminal has storage capacity of approximately 770,000 barrels from 10 tanks and is primarily supplied by the Explorer Pipeline. We generate fee-based loading revenues with customers under contracts that, consistent with industry practice, typically contain evergreen provisions after an initial term of six months to two years. We also generate revenue from (i) blending activities, such as ethanol blending and butane blending, and (ii) our vapor recovery units. A majority of the customers in our refined products terminals and storage segment are large, well-known oil companies and independent refiners. 
On February 16, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of our refined products terminals to DKGP Energy Terminals LLC, a joint venture between Delek Logistics Partners, LP and Greens Plains Partners LP, for approximately $138.5 million in cash, subject to working capital adjustments. Closing of the sale is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2018. 
Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates
Delta House
On September 29, 2017, we acquired an additional 15.5% equity interest in Class A units of Delta House, from affiliates of ArcLight for total cash consideration of approximately $125.4 million. Post-closing, we and ArcLight indirectly own a 35.7% and 23.3% interest, respectively, in Delta House.
Delta House is a semi-submersible floating production system with associated crude oil and natural gas export pipelines located in the Mississippi Canyon region of the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. The semi-submersible floating production system receives raw production from deepwater wells, which includes a mixture of crude oil, natural gas, and produced water, and separates the production into its components. The separated crude oil and natural gas pressures are increased, creating pipeline quality crude oil and natural gas that flows into the respective crude oil and natural gas export pipelines. Delta House is operated by LLOG Exploration Offshore, LLC ("LLOG Exploration") and has nameplate processing capacity of 80,000 Bbl/d and 200 MMcf/d and peak processing capacity of 100,000 Bbl/d and 240 MMcf/d. 
Cayenne JV
On August 8, 2017, we entered into a joint venture agreement with Targa Midstream Services, LLC (“Targa”) by which our previously wholly owned subsidiary Cayenne Pipeline, LLC (“Cayenne”) became the Cayenne joint venture between Targa and us (“Cayenne JV”). We received $5.0 million in cash in exchange for the sale of 50% ownership interest in Cayenne to Targa. The sole asset of the joint venture is a natural gas pipeline, which has been converted into a natural gas liquids pipeline. Both parties will each have 50% economic interests and 50% voting rights, with Targa serving as the operator of the pipeline and the joint venture. The additional costs of conversion and associated construction are shared equally by us and Targa. The pipeline became operational on December 28, 2017.
Okeanos
We own a 66.7% operated interest in Okeanos, a 100-mile natural gas gathering system located in the Gulf of Mexico with a total capacity of 1.0 Bcf/d. The Okeanos pipeline connects two platforms and one lateral, terminating at the Destin Main Pass 260 platform in the Mississippi Canyon region of the Gulf of Mexico. Contracted volumes on the Okeanos pipeline are based on life-of-field dedication.
Destin
On October 27, 2017, American Midstream Emerald, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, entered into a Purchase and Sale Agreement with Emerald Midstream, LLC, an ArcLight affiliate, to purchase an additional 17.0% equity interest in Destin Pipeline Company, LLC for total consideration of $30.0 million.  With the acquisition, the Partnership owns a 66.67% interest in Destin. The Destin pipeline is a FERC-regulated, 255-mile natural gas transport system with total capacity of 1.2 Bcf/d. The system originates offshore in the Gulf of Mexico and includes connections with four producing platforms, and six producer-operated laterals, including Delta House. The 120-mile offshore portion of the Destin system terminates at the Pascagoula processing plant, owned by Enterprise Products Partners, LP, and is the single source of raw natural gas to the plant. The onshore portion of 
15

Destin is the sole delivery point for merchant-quality gas from the Pascagoula processing plant and extends 135 miles north in Mississippi. Destin currently serves as the primary transfer of gas flows from the Barnett and Haynesville shale plays to Florida markets through interconnections with major interstate pipelines. Contracted volumes on the Destin pipeline are based on life-of-field dedication, dedicated volumes over a given period, or interruptible volumes as capacity permits.
Wilprise
We own a 25.3% non-operated interest in Wilprise, a FERC-regulated, approximately 30-mile NGL pipeline that originates at the Kenner Junction and terminates in Sorrento, Louisiana, where volumes flow via pipeline to a Baton Rouge fractionator.
Tri-States
We own a 16.7% non-operated interest in Tri-States, a FERC-regulated, 161-mile NGL pipeline and sole form of transport to Louisiana-based fractionators for NGLs produced at the Pascagoula plant served by Destin and other facilities.
Competition 
The midstream business is very competitive, with a number of publicly traded and private equity backed entities servicing the space based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and efficiencies. Competition is often the greatest in geographic areas experiencing robust drilling by producers and during periods of high commodity prices for natural gas, crude oil and/or NGLs. Competition is also increased in those geographic areas where our commercial contracts with our customers are shorter term and therefore must be renegotiated on a more frequent basis. An increase in competition could result from new pipeline, processing facility, or storage installations or expansions of existing facilities.  Major competitors in various aspects of our business include DCP Midstream LLC; Energy Transfer Partners, L.P.; EnLink NGL Marketing, L.P.; Kinder Morgan Energy Partners; Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P.; Columbia Gulf Transmission Company; Enterprise Gas Processing, LLC; Gulf South Pipeline Company, LP; Southern Natural Gas Company; Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company, LLC; Texas Eastern Pipeline; International-Matex Tank Terminals; LBC Tank Terminals; Royal Vopak; Stolt-Nielsen Limited, Westway Terminals Company LLC, and Williams, among others.
Other Segment Information
For additional information on our segments, including revenues from customers, profit or loss and total assets, see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report and Note 23 - Reportable Segments, in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Safety and Maintenance
We are subject to regulation by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA") pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 ("NGPSA"), and by the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 ("PSIA"), which was reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006. The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. crude oil and natural gas transportation pipelines and some gathering lines in high-consequence areas. The PHMSA has developed regulations implementing the PSIA that require transportation pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in "high-consequence areas," such as high population areas. The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011, which became law in January 2012, increases the penalties for safety violations, establishes additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and requires studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The PHMSA issued a final rule applying safety regulations to certain rural low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines that were not covered previously by some of its safety regulations. We believe that this rule does not apply to any of our pipelines. PHMSA issued, but has yet to publish, its final rule for hazardous liquids pipelines on January 13, 2017. That rule extends regulatory reporting requirements to all liquid gathering lines, requires additional event-driven and periodic inspections, requires use of leak detection systems on all hazardous liquid pipelines, modifies repair criteria, and requires certain pipelines to eventually accommodate inline inspection tools. It is unclear when or if this rule will go into effect as, on January 20, 2017, the Trump Administration directed that all regulations that had been sent to the Office of the Federal Register, but not yet published, be immediately withdrawn for further review. In March 2016, PHMSA published a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding natural gas pipelines that would amend existing integrity management requirements, expand assessment and repair requirements to pipelines in areas with medium population densities, and extend regulatory requirements to onshore gas gathering lines that are currently exempt. While we cannot predict the outcome of these legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity 
16

management requirements) to pipelines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time the terms of any new laws or rules or the costs of compliance associated with such requirements.
We regularly inspect our pipelines, and third parties assist us in interpreting the results of the inspections.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines, but most states are certified by the U.S. Department of Transportation ("DOT") to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. In practice, because states can adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. These state crude oil and gas standards may include requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas pipelines have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.
In addition, we are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act ("OSHA"), and comparable state statutes, the purposes of which are to protect the health and safety of workers, both generally and within the pipeline industry. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act (Superfund") and comparable state statutes require that information be maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that such information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens. We and the entities in which we own an interest are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management ("PSM") regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety, Superfund and PSM.
We and the entities in which we own an interest are subject to:

• | EPA Chemical Accident Prevention Provisions, also known as the Risk Management Plan requirements, which are designed to prevent the accidental release of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive materials; and


• | Department of Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards, which are designed to regulate the security of high-risk chemical facilities.

Regulation of Operations
Regulation of pipeline gathering and transportation services, natural gas sales and transportation of NGLs may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our products and services.
Regulation of our terminals require us to maintain and currently hold approvals and permits from federal, state and local regulatory agencies for air quality and water discharge, as well as standard local occupational licenses.
Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation
Our interstate natural gas transportation systems are subject to the jurisdiction of FERC pursuant to the Natural Gas Act ("NGA"). Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. Federal regulation of our interstate pipelines extends to such matters as:

• | rates, services, and terms and conditions of service;


• | the types of services offered to customers;


• | the certification and construction of new facilities;


• | the acquisition, extension, disposition or abandonment of facilities;


• | the maintenance of accounts and records;


• | relationships between affiliated companies involved in certain aspects of the natural gas business;


• | the initiation and discontinuation of services;


• | market manipulation in connection with interstate sales, purchases or transportation of natural gas; and


• | participation by interstate pipelines in cash management arrangements.

17

Under the NGA, the rates for service on these interstate facilities must be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory.
The rates and terms and conditions for our interstate pipeline services are set forth in FERC-approved tariffs. Pursuant to FERC's jurisdiction over rates, existing rates may be challenged by complaint and proposed rate increases may be challenged by protest. Any successful complaint or protest against our rates could have an adverse impact on our revenue associated with providing transportation service.
In 2008, FERC issued Order No. 717, a final rule that implements standards of conduct that include three primary rules: (1) the "independent functioning rule," which requires transmission function and marketing function employees to operate independently of each other; (2) the "no-conduit rule," which prohibits passing transmission function information to marketing function employees; and (3) the "transparency rule," which imposes posting requirements to help detect any instances of undue preference. The FERC has since issued four rehearing orders that generally reaffirmed the determinations in Order No. 717 and also clarified certain provisions of the Standards of Conduct.
In April 2008, the FERC issued a Policy Statement regarding the composition of proxy groups for determining the appropriate return on equity for natural gas and crude oil pipelines using FERC's Discounted Cash Flow ("DCF") model for setting cost-of-service or recourse rates. In the policy statement, FERC concluded, among other matters that Master Limited Partnerships ("MLPs") should be included in the proxy group used to determine return on equity for both natural gas and crude oil pipelines, but the long-term growth component of the DCF model should be limited to fifty percent of long-term gross domestic product. The adjustment to the long-term growth component, and all other things being equal, results in lower returns on equity than would be calculated without the adjustment. However, the actual return on equity for our interstate pipelines will depend on the specific companies included in the proxy group and the specific conditions at the time of the future rate case proceeding. 
In July 2016, the D.C. Circuit issued its opinion in United Airlines, Inc., et al.v. FERC, finding that FERC had acted arbitrarily and capriciously when it failed to demonstrate that permitting an interstate petroleum products pipeline organized as a limited partnership to include an income tax allowance in the cost of service underlying its rates in addition to the discounted cash flow return on equity would not result in the pipeline partnership owners double-recovering their income taxes. The court vacated FERC’s order and remanded to FERC to consider mechanisms for demonstrating that there is no double recovery as a result of the income tax allowance. On December 15, 2016, FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking comment on how to address any double recovery resulting from income tax allowance policy. On March 15, 2018, FERC issued an order on remand in the United Airlines case and a revised policy statement on income tax recovery that disallows income tax allowances for master limited partnerships in cost of service rates. In addition, FERC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking on March 15, 2018 that proposes to require all interstate natural gas pipelines to submit cost of service information to account for reductions in cost of service resulting from FERC’s new policy on income tax allocations for master limited partnerships and the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that went into effect January 1, 2018. Depending upon the resolution of these issues, the cost of service rates of our interstate natural gas pipelines could be affected to the extent they propose new rates or changes to their existing rates or if their rates are subject to complaint or challenged by FERC. However, we have considered the impact the proposed policy changes by the FERC would have on us, and we have determined that based on the current rate structure on the Partnership's FERC regulated pipelines, the proposed changes are expected to have a negligible impact on the earnings and cash flow of the Partnership. Although we cannot predict whether FERC will propose any additional policy revisions, we expect any such policy revisions will have limited application to us, because a substantial majority of the Partnership's operations are not FERC regulated.
Section 311 Pipelines
Intrastate transportation of natural gas is largely regulated by the state in which such transportation takes place. To the extent that our intrastate natural gas transportation systems transport natural gas in interstate commerce without an exemption under the NGA, the rates, terms and conditions of such services are subject to FERC jurisdiction under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act, or NGPA, and Part 284 of the FERC's regulations. Pipelines providing transportation service under Section 311 are required to provide services on an open and nondiscriminatory basis. The NGPA regulates, among other things, the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline on behalf of a local distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline. The rates, terms and conditions of some transportation services provided on our Section 311 pipeline systems are subject to FERC regulation pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. Under Section 311, rates charged for intrastate transportation must be fair and equitable, and amounts collected in excess of fair and equitable rates are subject to refund with interest. The terms and conditions of service set forth in the intrastate facility's statement of operating conditions are also subject to FERC's review and approval. Should the FERC determine not to authorize rates equal to or greater than our currently approved Section 311 rates, our business may be adversely affected. Failure to observe the service limitations applicable to transportation and storage services under Section 311, failure to comply with the rates approved by the FERC for Section 311 service, and failure to comply with the terms 
18

and conditions of service established in the pipeline's FERC-approved statement of operating conditions could result in alteration of jurisdictional status, and/or the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies.

Intrastate natural gas pipelines are defined as pipelines that operate entirely within a single state, and generally are not subject to FERC's jurisdiction under the NGA. Hinshaw pipelines, by definition, also operate within a single state, but can receive gas from outside their state without becoming subject to FERC's NGA jurisdiction. Specifically, Section 1(c) of the NGA exempts from the FERC's NGA jurisdiction those pipelines that transport gas in interstate commerce if (1) they receive natural gas at or within the boundary of a state, (2) all the gas is consumed within that state and (3) the pipeline is regulated by a state commission. Following the enactment of the NGPA, the FERC issued Order No. 63 authorizing Hinshaw pipelines to apply for authorization to transport natural gas in interstate commerce in the same manner as intrastate pipelines operating pursuant to Section 311 of the NGPA. Hinshaw pipelines frequently operate pursuant to blanket certificates to provide transportation and sales service under the FERC's regulations.
Historically, FERC did not require intrastate and Hinshaw pipelines to meet the same rigorous transactional reporting guidelines as interstate pipelines. However, as discussed below, in 2010 the FERC issued Order No. 735, which increases FERC regulation of certain intrastate and Hinshaw pipelines. See Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirements.
Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of FERC. However, some of our natural gas gathering activity is subject to Internet posting requirements imposed by FERC as a result of FERC's market transparency initiatives. We believe that our natural gas pipelines meet the traditional tests that FERC has used to determine that a pipeline is a gathering pipeline and is, therefore, not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, is the subject of substantial, on-going litigation, so the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts or Congress. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. In recent years, FERC's efforts to promote open access, transparency, and the unbundling of interstate pipeline services has prompted a number of interstate pipelines to transfer their non-jurisdictional gathering facilities to unregulated affiliates. As a result of these activities, natural gas gathering may begin to receive greater regulatory scrutiny at both the state and federal levels. Our natural gas gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject to more stringent application of state or federal regulation of rates and services. Our natural gas gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Our natural gas gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in most of the states in which we operate. These statutes generally require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. The regulations under these statutes can have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. The states in which we operate have adopted a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, there has been no adverse effect to our system due to these regulations.
Market Behavior Rules; Posting and Reporting Requirements
On August 8, 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005, ("EP Act 2005"). Among other matters, the EP Act 2005 amended the NGA to add an anti-manipulation provision that makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior in contravention of rules and regulations to be prescribed by FERC and, furthermore, provides FERC with additional civil penalty authority. On January 19, 2006, FERC issued Order No. 670, a rule implementing the anti-manipulation provision of the EP Act 2005, and subsequently denied rehearing. The rules make it unlawful for any entity, directly or indirectly in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC to (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) to make any untrue statement of material 
19

fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The new anti-manipulation rules apply to interstate gas pipelines and storage companies and intrastate gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, such as Section 311 service, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted "in connection with" gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. The new anti-manipulation rules do not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but only to the extent such transactions do not have a "nexus" to jurisdictional transactions. The EP Act 2005 also amends the NGA and the NGPA to give FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of these statutes, up to $1,000,000 per day per violation for violations occurring after August 8, 2005. This maximum penalty authority established by statute will continue to be adjusted periodically for inflation. In connection with this enhanced civil penalty authority, FERC issued a policy statement on enforcement to provide guidance regarding the enforcement of the statutes, orders, rules and regulations it administers, including factors to be considered in determining the appropriate enforcement action to be taken. Should we fail to comply with all applicable FERC-administered statutes, rule, regulations and orders, we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines.
The EP Act of 2005 also added a section 23 to the NGA authorizing the FERC to facilitate price transparency in markets for the sale or transportation of physical natural gas in interstate commerce. In 2007, FERC took steps to enhance its market oversight and monitoring of the natural gas industry by issuing several rulemaking orders designed to promote gas price transparency and to prevent market manipulation. In December 2007, FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing, or Order No. 704. Order No. 704 requires buyers and sellers of annual quantities of natural gas of 2,200,000 MMBtu or more, including entities not otherwise subject to FERC jurisdiction, to submit on May 1 of each year an annual report to FERC describing their aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to or may contribute to the formation of price indices. Order No. 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers and, if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC's policy statement on price reporting. In June 2010, the FERC issued the last of its three orders on rehearing further clarifying its requirements.
In May 2010, the FERC issued Order No. 735, which requires intrastate pipelines providing transportation services under Section 311 of the NGPA and Hinshaw pipelines operating under Section 1(c) of the NGA to report on a quarterly basis more detailed transportation and storage transaction information, including: rates charged by the pipeline under each contract; receipt and delivery points and zones or segments covered by each contract; the quantity of natural gas the shipper is entitled to transport, store, or deliver; the duration of the contract; and whether there is an affiliate relationship between the pipeline and the shipper. Order No. 735 further requires that such information must be supplied through a new electronic reporting system and will be posted on FERC's website, and that such quarterly reports may not contain information redacted as privileged. The FERC promulgated this rule after determining that such transactional information would help shippers make more informed purchasing decisions and would improve the ability of both shippers and the FERC to monitor actual transactions for evidence of market power or undue discrimination. Order No. 735 also extends the FERC's periodic review of the rates charged by the subject pipelines from three years to five years. Order No. 735 became effective on April 1, 2011. In December 2010, the FERC issued Order No. 735-A. In Order No. 735-A, the FERC generally reaffirmed Order No. 735 requiring section 311 and "Hinshaw" pipelines to report on a quarterly basis storage and transportation transactions containing specific information for each transaction, aggregated by contract.
In July 2010, for the first time the FERC issued an order finding that the prohibition against buy/sell arrangements applies to interstate open access services provided by Section 311 and Hinshaw pipelines. The FERC denied the numerous requests for rehearing of the July order. However, in October 2010, the FERC issued a Notice of Inquiry seeking public comment on the issue of whether and how parties that hold firm capacity on some intrastate pipelines can allow others to use their capacity, including to what extent buy/sell transactions should permitted and whether the FERC should consider requiring such pipelines to offer capacity release programs. In the Notice of Inquiry, the FERC granted a blanket waiver regarding such transactions while the FERC is considering these policy issues. The comment period has ended but the FERC has not yet issued an order. 
Interstate Oil and Liquids Pipeline Regulation
Our Bakken crude oil gathering system, FERC-regulated American Panther, LLC offshore liquids pipelines (known as the Tiger Shoals and MP 77 offshore pipeline systems) and the Tri-States and Wilprise NGL pipelines, in which we have equity investments, are regulated as common carrier interstate pipelines by the FERC under the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EP Act 1992”) and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. Under the ICA, FERC has authority regarding the rates and terms and conditions of service for the transportation of oil and natural gas liquids in interstate commerce. Such pipelines are regulated as common carriers. FERC regulation is limited to rate-related issues, and does not extend to the construction of new facilities or cessation of service. The ICA and FERC’s regulations require that rates and terms and conditions of service for interstate service on common carrier pipelines be just and reasonable and must not be 
20

unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. FERC’s regulations also require interstate common carrier pipelines to file with FERC and publicly post tariffs stating their interstate transportation rates and terms and conditions of service.
In general, interstate common carrier pipeline rates are initially set through negotiations with non-affiliated shippers or via cost of service ratemaking. In addition, rates can be set via settlement agreed to by all shippers and market-based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. Effective January 1, 1995, the FERC implemented regulations pursuant to EP Act 1992 establishing an indexing system that permits an oil pipeline, subject to limited challenges, to annually increase or decrease its transportation rates due to inflationary changes in costs using a FERC-approved index, without making a cost of service filing. Every five years, the FERC reviews the appropriateness of the index in relation to industry costs. On December 17, 2015, the FERC established a new Producer Price Index for Finished Goods (the “PPI-FG”) of PPI-FG plus 1.23 percent for the five-year period beginning July 1, 2016. Under FERC’s regulations, pipelines can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-services approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology.
Under the ICA, FERC or interested persons may challenge existing or proposed new or changed rates, services, or terms and conditions of service. FERC is authorized to investigate such charges and may suspend the effectiveness of a new rate for up to seven months. FERC could require a common carrier pipeline to collect rates subject to refund until completion of an investigation during which FERC could find that the new or changed rate is unlawful. In contrast, FERC has clarified that initial rates and terms of service agreed upon with committed shippers in a transportation services agreement are not subject to protest or a cost-of-service analysis where the pipeline held an open season offering all potential shippers service on the same terms.
A successful rate challenge could result in a common carrier pipeline paying refunds of revenue collected in excess of the just and reasonable rate, together with interest for the period the rate was in effect, if any. FERC may also order a pipeline to reduce its rates prospectively, and may require a common carrier pipeline to pay shippers reparations retroactively for rate overages for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint. FERC also has the authority to change terms and conditions of service if it determines that they are unjust or unreasonable or unduly discriminatory or preferential.
On March 15, 2018, FERC issued an order on remand in the United Airlines case and a revised policy statement on income tax recovery that disallows income tax allowances for master limited partnerships in cost of service rates. Under the revised policy statement, pipelines can no longer include income tax allowances in their annual FERC Form 6 report regarding their cost of service. In addition, FERC announced in the revised policy statement that it intends to account for its new policy on income tax allowances for MLPs and the reduction in the corporate tax rate from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in its next five-year assessment of the oil pipeline index in 2020. However, we have considered the impact the proposed policy changes by the FERC would have on us, and we have determined that based on the current rate structure on the Partnership's FERC regulated pipelines, the proposed changes are expected to have a negligible impact on the earnings and cash flow of the Partnership. Although we cannot predict whether FERC will propose any additional policy revisions, we expect any such policy revisions will have limited application to us, because a substantial majority of the Partnership's operations are not FERC regulated.
Offshore Natural Gas Pipelines
Our offshore natural gas gathering pipelines are subject to federal regulation under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, which requires that all pipelines operating on or across the outer continental shelf provide open and nondiscriminatory access to shippers. From 1982 until 2012, the Minerals Management Service ("MMS"), of the U.S. Department of the Interior ("DOI"), was the federal agency that managed the nation's crude oil, natural gas, and other mineral resources on the outer continental shelf, which is all submerged lands lying seaward of state coastal waters which are under U.S. jurisdiction, and collected, accounted for, and disbursed revenues from federal offshore mineral leases. On June 18, 2010, the Minerals Management Service was renamed the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement ("BOEMRE"). In October 2011, the BOEMRE was reorganized into and replaced by two separate agencies, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management ("BOEM") and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement ("BSEE"). The BOEM manages the exploration and development of the nation's offshore resources. BOEM seeks to appropriately balance economic development, energy independence, and environmental protection through crude oil and gas leases, renewable energy development and environmental reviews and studies. BSEE works to promote safety, protect the environment, and conserve resources offshore through vigorous regulatory oversight and enforcement.
Sales of Natural Gas and NGLs
The price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and, for the most part, is not subject to state regulation. However, with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities, we are required to observe anti-market 
21

manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the FERC and/or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC"), and the Federal Trade Commission ("FTC"). Should we violate the anti-market manipulation laws and regulations, we could also be subject to related third-party damage claims by, among others, sellers, royalty owners and taxing authorities.
Sales of NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could enact price controls in the future.
As discussed above, the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas pipelines and those initiatives may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas both directly and indirectly.
Environmental Matters
General
Our operation of pipelines, plants, terminals and other facilities for the gathering, compressing, treating and transporting of natural gas and other products is subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment or otherwise restricting the way we operate;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in sensitive areas, such as wetlands, coastal regions or areas inhabited by endangered or threatened species;


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during permit reviews;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate pollution conditions caused by our operations or attributable to former operations; and


• | enjoining the operations of facilities deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties. Certain environmental statutes impose strict joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where substances, hydrocarbons or wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other waste products into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance. We also actively participate in industry groups that help formulate recommendations for addressing existing or future regulations.
We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various environmental activities in which we are presently engaged are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather, compress, treat and transport natural gas. We cannot assure, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulations.
Hazardous Substances and Waste
Our operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations relating to the management and release of hazardous substances, solid and hazardous wastes and petroleum hydrocarbons. These laws generally regulate the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and may impose strict joint and several liability for the investigation and remediation of affected areas where hazardous substances may have been released or disposed. For instance, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act ("CERCLA"), and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous 
22

substance into the environment. These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. We may handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment.
We also generate industrial wastes that are subject to the requirements of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), and comparable state statutes. While RCRA regulates both solid and hazardous wastes, it imposes strict requirements on the generation, storage, treatment, transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes. We generate little hazardous waste; however, it is possible that these wastes, which could include wastes currently generated during our operations, will in the future be designated as "hazardous wastes" and, therefore, be subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements. In December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires EPA to propose a rulemaking by March 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Any such changes in the laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.
We currently own or lease properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years. Although previous operators have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under the other locations where these hydrocarbons and wastes have been transported for treatment or disposal. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), to clean up contaminated property (including contaminated soil and groundwater) or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently aware of any facts, events or conditions relating to such requirements that could materially impact our operations or financial condition.
Air Quality and Climate Change
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act and comparable state and local laws and regulations. These laws and regulations regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including our compressor stations and processing plants, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. Such laws and regulations may require that we obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with air permits containing various emissions and operational limitations and utilize specific emission control technologies to limit emissions. Failure to comply with applicable air statutes or regulations may lead to the assessment of administrative, civil or criminal penalties and may result in the limitation or cessation of construction or operation of certain air emission sources. Although we can give no assurances, we believe such requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results, and the requirements are not expected to be more burdensome to us than to any similarly situated company. As the EPA issues new, lower National Ambient Air Quality Standards ("NAAQS"), we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions. For example, in June 2010, the EPA issued a new NAAQS for sulfur dioxide, or SO2, and replaced the 24-hour and annual standards with a more stringent hourly standard. In October 2015, the agency finalized a reduction of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone standard from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion; both nitrogen oxides and VOCs are ozone precursors. This reduction is expected to increase the number of ozone nonattainment areas. In October 2016, the EPA also finalized Control Technology Guidelines for emissions of VOCs from crude oil and natural gas industry sources to be relied upon by states when implementing the ozone standard in ozone nonattainment areas. We believe that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to any other similarly situated companies. 
On April 17, 2012, the EPA approved final rules under the Clean Air Act that establish new air emission controls for crude oil and natural gas production, pipelines and processing operations. These rules became effective on October 15, 2012. The established specific new requirements regarding emissions from wet seal and reciprocating compressors at production facilities, gathering systems, boosting facilities and onshore natural gas processing plants, effective October 15, 2012, and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels at production facilities, gathering systems, boosting facilities and onshore natural gas processing plants, effective October 15, 2013. In addition, the rules revise existing requirements for volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from equipment leaks at onshore natural gas processing plants by lowering the leak definition for valves from 10,000 parts per million to 500 parts per million and requiring the monitoring of connectors, pumps, pressure relief devices and open-ended lines, effective October 15, 2012. Initial compliance and ongoing compliance with the new subset of rules required capital expenditures and 
23

ongoing compliance expenses. Following the publication of the final rule, the EPA received petitions for reconsideration of certain aspects of the standards. On April 12, 2013, the EPA published proposed updates to the NSPS Subpart OOOO storage tank requirements. On September 23, 2013, the EPA published final revisions to the NSPS Subpart OOOO storage tank requirements, including a phase-in of installation of VOC controls and alternate limits for tanks where emissions have declined. The EPA issued revised definitions related to the stages of well completions and amended storage tank requirements under NSPS Section OOOO in December 2014 and further revised the storage tank requirements in March 2015. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA published updates to new source performance standard requirements that would impose more stringent controls on methane and VOC emissions from oil and gas development and production operations, including hydraulic fracturing and other well completion activity. The EPA is currently engaged in rulemaking to stay the effective date of these rules. Also, the EPA published NSPS Subpart 0000a, effective August 2, 2016, which places requirements on sources constructed, modified or reconstructed after September 18, 2015. Many of the requirements of NSPS Subpart OOOO mirror those in NSPS Subpart OOOO; however, new equipment being regulated are pneumatic pumps and fugitive emissions at well sites and compressor stations. Similarly, in November 2016, the BLM issued rules requiring additional efforts by producers to reduce venting, flaring, and leaking of natural gas produced on federal and Native American lands. However, in December 2017, implementation of this rule was delayed until January 2019.
A number of states have adopted or considered programs to reduce “greenhouse gases,” or GHGs and the EPA has declared that GHGs “endanger” public health and welfare, and is regulating GHG emissions from mobile sources such as cars and trucks. According to the EPA, this final action on the GHG vehicle emission rule triggered regulation of carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions from stationary sources under certain Clean Air Act programs at both the federal and state levels, particularly the Prevention of Significant Deterioration program and Title V permitting. These requirements for stationary sources took effect on January 2, 2011; however, in June 2014 the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision upholding these rules and struck down the EPA’s greenhouse gas permitting rules to the extent they impose a requirement to obtain a federal air permit based solely on emissions of greenhouse gases. Large sources of other air pollutants, such as VOC or nitrogen oxides, could still be required to implement process or technology controls and obtain permits regarding emissions of greenhouse gases. The EPA has also published various rules relating to the mandatory reporting of GHG emissions, including mandatory reporting requirements of GHGs from petroleum and natural gas systems. In October 2015, the EPA amended and expanded greenhouse gas reporting requirements to all segments of the crude oil and natural gas industry, including gathering and boosting facilities and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines, starting with the 2016 reporting year, and in January 2016, the EPA proposed additional revisions to leak detection methodology to align the reporting rule with the new source performance standards.
The permitting, regulatory compliance and reporting programs taken as a whole increase the costs and complexity of operating oil and gas operations in compliance with these legal requirements, with resulting potential to adversely affect our cost of doing business, demand for the oil and gas we transport and may require us to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act ("Clean Water Act"), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into state waters as well as waters of the U.S. and to conduct construction activities in waters and wetlands. In May 2015, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a final rule to clarify which waters and wetlands are subject to Clean Water Act regulation. The implementation of this rule was stayed nationwide in October 2015 as a result of litigation. In January 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that district courts have jurisdiction over challenges to the rule. Litigation surrounding this rule is ongoing, and, in addition to delaying the rule's applicability date until February 6, 2020, the EPA has instituted a rule-making process to repeal the rule. Certain state regulations and the general permits issued under the Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program prohibit the discharge of pollutants and chemicals. Spill Prevention Control and Countermeasure ("SPCC") requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of regulated waters in the event of a hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. These permits may require us to monitor and sample the storm water runoff from certain of our facilities. Some states also maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. We believe that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.
Safe Drinking Water Act
24

The underground injection of crude oil and natural gas wastes are regulated by the Underground Injection Control program authorized by the Safe Drinking Water Act. The primary objective of injection well operating requirements is to ensure the mechanical integrity of the injection apparatus and to prevent migration of fluids from the injection zone into underground sources of drinking water. As of December 31, 2017, the Partnership is in compliance with the requirements. 
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act ("ESA") restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our pipelines may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states.
National Environmental Policy Act
The National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA") establishes a national environmental policy and goals for the protection, maintenance, and enhancement of the environment and provides a process for implementing these goals within federal agencies. A major federal agency action having the potential to significantly impact the environment requires review under NEPA and, as a result, many activities requiring FERC approval must undergo NEPA review. Many of our activities are covered under categorical exclusions that result in a shorter NEPA review process. The Council on Environmental Quality has issued final guidance to reinvigorate NEPA reviews that, while intended to streamline the process, may result in longer review processes that could lead to delays and increased costs that could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.
Anti-terrorism Measures
The federal Department of Homeland Security regulates the security of chemical and industrial facilities pursuant to regulations known as the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. These regulations apply to oil and gas facilities, among others, that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” Pursuant to these regulations, certain of our facilities are required to comply with certain regulatory provisions, including requirements regarding inspections, audits, recordkeeping, and protection of chemical-terrorism vulnerability information. 
Title to Properties and Rights-of-Way
Our real property falls into two categories: i) parcels that we own in fee and ii) parcels in which our interest derives from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. Portions of the land on which our plants and other major facilities are located are owned by us in fee title, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to these lands. The remaining land on which our plant sites and major facilities are located, are held by us pursuant to surface leases between us, as lessee, and the fee owner of the lands, as lessors. Our predecessors leased or owned these lands for many years without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory leasehold estates or fee ownership in such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license held by us or to our title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses.
Employees
The Partnership does not have any employees. All of the employees required to conduct and support our operations are employed by our General Partner, and the officers of our General Partner manage our operations and activities. As of December 31, 2017, our General Partner employed approximately 490 people who provide direct, full-time support to our operations. None of these employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and our General Partner considers its employee relations to be positive.
General
We make certain filings, and amendments thereto, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports.
