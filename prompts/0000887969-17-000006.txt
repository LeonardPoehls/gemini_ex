Focused Sales and Marketing Strategy
While we serve a broad range of customers including large global service providers, small regional carriers, enterprises, educational institutions and governments, our strategy is to focus our sales and marketing efforts on servicing existing customers across our wide base while also focusing on developing new opportunities with smaller regional Service Providers as well as Data Center Operators, Network Equipment Manufacturers, Government Entities, Enterprises and other entities for data center interconnect applications. We believe that recent consolidation among network equipment vendors has created an opportunity for MRV to grow its business among relatively under-served customers in its target market segments.
Markets Served
MRV primarily serves the following markets:
Service Providers
Historically, Service Providers have been categorized separately as telecommunications service providers or cable operators, but in recent years, service providers have converged through acquisitions, mergers, and partnerships so we consider the providers as a group. Our telecommunications service provider customer base includes international, national and regional telecommunications carriers, both wireline and wireless. Telecommunications service providers are under increasing competitive pressure, primarily from emerging competitors that offer similar services at competitive prices. Additionally, as the Internet has become ubiquitous and consumers demand significantly more mobile, providers of content delivery and cloud-based services have been driving the need for more flexible high bandwidth applications. Our products and services enable both established and emerging telecommunications service providers to transition their existing network infrastructures to deliver a broader mix of higher bandwidth services to consumers and enterprises. We provide products that enable telecommunications service providers to support demand for video delivery, broadband data and video and wireless broadband services.
