Corporate History and General Information
 
Veroni Brands Corp. (“Veroni” or the “Company”) was incorporated as “Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation” on December 7, 2016 under the laws of the State of Delaware. In September 2017, the Company implemented a change of control by issuing shares to new stockholders, redeeming shares of existing stockholders, electing a new officer and director and accepting the resignations of its then existing officers and directors.
 
In connection with the change in control, the stockholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name from Echo Sound Acquisition Corporation to European CPG Acquisition Corporation. In November 2017, the stockholders of the Company and its board of directors unanimously approved the change of the Company’s name to Veroni Brands Corp.
 
The Company is located at 650 Forest Edge Drive, Vernon Hills, Illinois 60061. The Company’s main phone number is 888-794-2999. The Company’s fiscal year end is December 31. Neither the Company nor its predecessors have filed for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings nor are in the process of filing for bankruptcy, receivership or any similar proceedings.
 
Relationship with Tiber Creek Corporation
 
Igor Gabal on behalf of GP Michigan, LLC, the Company’s sole officer and director, previously entered into an agreement with Tiber Creek, whereby Tiber Creek would provide assistance to GP Michigan, LLC in effecting transactions for Mr. Gabal and GP Michigan, LLC to acquire a public reporting company, including: transferring control of a public reporting company to Mr. Gabal and/or GP Michigan; causing the preparation and filing of forms, including a registration statement, with the Securities and Exchange Commission; assist in listing its securities on a trading exchange; and assist in establishing and maintaining relationships with market makers and broker-dealers. GP Michigan agreed to pay Tiber Creek $80,000 for those services, which was recorded as a capital contribution on behalf of the Company, and of which $48,000 was recorded to prepaid expenses and $32,000 to professional fees on behalf of the Company.
 
Under the agreement, Tiber Creek has received to date $55,000 from Igor Gabal of the $80,000 fee. In addition, the Company’s then-current stockholders, James Cassidy and James McKillop, were permitted to retain an aggregate total of 250,000 shares of the original 20,000,000 shares owned prior to the change in control.
 
Background
 
The Company has only recently emerged from its status as a development-stage company after the end of the 2017 fiscal year, and it has limited operating history and is expected to experience losses in the near term. The Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Summary
 
The business of the Company focuses on the import, sales and distribution of premium food and beverage products, primarily from Europe. Within this strategy, Veroni has secured a long-term exclusive import and distribution agreement with a major European supplier, FoodCare Sp. z o,o., a company organized under the laws of the Poland (“FoodCare”). Veroni will be the sole and exclusive importer and distributor of Iron Energy, an energy drink sponsored by celebrity boxer Mike Tyson, with access to numerous other beverage brands through this partnership. We are a multifaceted company with a strategy for growing across a variety of consumer product categories.

Risks and Uncertainties Facing the Company
 
The Company has had no revenues or customers to date; provided, however, it is Veroni’s goal to begin sales of its licensed products by securing relationships with distributors, food and beverage retailers and by expanding its portfolio of products through strategic partnerships with new suppliers.
 
As an early-stage company, the Company has no operating history and is expected to continuously experience losses in the near term. The Company needs to generate revenue or locate additional financing in order to continue its developmental plans. As a company in the early part of its life, management of the Company must build relationships with food and beverage retailers and effectively market its products in order to execute the business plan of the Company on a broad scale. Further, there is no guarantee that the Company will be able to identify sufficient numbers of customers to generate enough revenues to continue operations or proceed with developing its business in accordance with its business plan.
 
One of the biggest challenges facing the Company will be in securing adequate capital to fund its projects, including securing adequate capital to pay for the manufacturing of its products. Secondarily, following the manufacturing of its products, a major challenge will be implementing effective sales, marketing and distribution strategies to reach the intended end customers. The Company has considered and devised its initial sales, marketing and advertising strategy, however, the Company will need to skillfully implement this strategy in order to achieve success in its business.
 
Due to these and other factors, the Company’s need for additional capital, the Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
The Business: Food and Beverage Distribution
 
Veroni is an importer, seller and distributor of premium food and beverage products, primarily from Europe. Within this strategy, Veroni has secured a long-term exclusive import and distribution agreement with a major European supplier, FoodCare Sp. z o,o., a company organized under the laws of the Poland (“FoodCare”). Veroni will be the sole and exclusive importer and distributor to the United States market of Iron Energy, an energy drink sponsored by celebrity boxer Mike Tyson, with access to numerous other beverage brands through this long-term partnership. We are a multifaceted company with a strategy for growing across a variety of consumer product categories.
 
We believe that Veroni’s business will have the following strategic advantages:
 

● | U.S.-Based Distribution for European Products: Through the development of relationships with European suppliers, we believe that our business will enable foreign suppliers to penetrate the U.S. market through immediate access to Veroni’s future network of sales, broker, distributors and retailers. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | International Beverage Portfolio – Veroni’s product offerings will consist of an established European quality beverage portfolio of energy drinks, water, juices and Ice tea. 
● | Diverse Products - Veroni’s product offerings will be available in a variety of flavors, sizes and price points. 
● | International Strategic Partnerships and Licensing – The Company’s plans on developing an international portfolio of consumer food and beverage products through exclusive licensing agreements with companies across the world. 
● | Focus on Premium Goods – The Company plans on focusing on distributing high profit products that are traded in the premium space. 

 
Veroni is an importer and distributor of beverage products with an extensive manufacturing relationship with international partners that offer great margins and European quality. Our goal is to become a one stop shop to the food and beverage distributors as well as beer distributor network. Veroni will endeavor to have its distributors achieve and maintain Veroni’s Retail Vision: (1) Off-premise guidelines will include distribution, display and space management, holding power, brand positioning, price signage, retail merchandising and quality assurance; and (2) On-premise guidelines will include distribution, feature support and retail merchandising and promotional/sampling events.

Iron Energy’s target consumers are college students, young transitional adults coming out of college, independent singles in their 20’s and 30’s, athletes and the “party-goers” population.

The Market 
 
Since the Red Bull brand arrived in the U.S. in 1997, we believe that the energy drink category has been fast-growth and high-margin. As the segment centered on a handful of major brands, most of them moving to retail through captive distribution systems, for a while there was a large flow of new entrants, some of them very well financed, but that has slowed as the difficulty of making much headway has become clear. Thus, many smaller brands either seek to carve out an identity as healthier than mainstream brands, with their artificial ingredients and curious and misunderstood fortifiers like taurine, or have sought to occupy carefully targeted marketing niches.
 
According to Packaged Facts report, Energy & Sports Drinks: U.S. Market Trends & Opportunities, sales of energy and sports drinks grew to $25 billion in sales in 2016 after rising at an annual rate of 7% over the preceding half decade. Packaged Facts forecasts that energy and sports drinks will remain among the fastest growing sectors of the beverage market.1
 
Marketing Strategy
 
The Company plans on engaging celebrity and former boxer Mike Tyson to act as “brand ambassador” by representing the Iron Energy at:
 

● | Special events appearances 
--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Trade shows participation 
● | Distributors and retailers “meet and greets” 
● | Veroni Brands Sponsorship events 

 
Further, the Company plans to market the Company’s products via the following retail merchandising and promotional programs:
 

● | Ad features and promotional activities 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Shelf placement and adjacencies 
● | Feature and multiple display programming 
● | Loyalty card 
● | In-store sampling and promotions 
● | Merchandising via shelf strips, counter cards, paper and permanent P.O.S. such as mirrors and signs 
● | College rep program at major So Cal universities 

 
The Company also plans on advertising through traditional television, radio, print, and social media advertisements, airport, bus shelter, taxi cab top, airport terminal advertisements, and through event sponsorships.
 
Competition
 
The Energy drink beverage market is dominated by brands such as Monster (which has 43% of the market), Red Bull, and Rockstar.2
 
Strategic Partners, Retailers and Suppliers
 
The Company believes that strategic partnerships will be a major component of the Company’s operating strategy and path to success. The Company hopes to work with several strategic partners in important areas of its business and operations. Currently, the Company has an exclusive distribution agreement, covering the United States market, with a European food and beverage supplier, FoodCare Sp. z o,o., a company organized under the laws of the Poland (“FoodCare”), through which it has the exclusive right to distribute the Iron Energy drink, as well as an assortment of other products. The Company plans on engaging retailers throughout the U.S. and Canada to sell its products, including retailers like 7-Eleven, Circle K, Dollar General and many others.

At December 31, 2017, Veroni had only one employee, its sole officer, Igor Gabal. In March 2018, Veroni hired six additional employees. Veroni’s corporate offices and distribution center (with access to 3,000 pallets space capacity) is located in Vernon Hills, Illinois.
Existing Contracts
 
On January 30, 2018, the Company entered into a distribution agreement with FoodCare. Under the terms of the Distribution Agreement, the Company became the exclusive importer and distributor of FoodCare’s products in the United States, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands (the “U.S. market”). The term of the Distribution Agreement is for a period of 10 years during which Veroni will have the exclusive right to distribute FoodCare products within the U.S. market, so long as Veroni purchases the required quantity of product from FoodCare. The Distribution Agreement is terminable upon (1) mutual consent of the parties, (2) by either party in writing without justification, if an issue is not amicably resolved in 30 days of such issue, by providing 180 days’ notice (in which case the Company would lose its exclusivity rights), or (3) immediately in the event of notice of an uncured breach in the terms of the Distribution Agreement. FoodCare Sp. z o.o., a company organized under the laws of the Poland, is a manufacturer and supplier of desserts, cereals, energy drinks and other beverage products. Notably, FoodCare manufactures the “Iron Energy” drink, a product sponsored by celebrity and former boxer Mike Tyson.
Revenues and Losses
 
Since its inception, the Company has focused its efforts on identifying potential products for acquisition and business development, and has devoted little attention or resources to sales and marketing or generating near-term revenues and profits. The Company has no revenues to date and has not realized any profits as of yet. In order to succeed, the Company needs to develop a viable strategy to market its products. The Company posted net losses of $44,045 and $3,312 for the year ended December 31, 2017 and for the period from December 7, 2016 (inception) to December 31, 2016, respectively.
Effect of Existing or Probable Governmental Regulation
 
The FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), enacted on January 4, 2011, amended section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), in relevant part, to require that facilities engaged in manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding food for consumption in the United States submit additional registration information to FDA, including an assurance that FDA will be permitted to inspect the facility at the times and in the manner permitted by the FD&C Act. Section 415 of the FD&C Act, as amended by FSMA, also requires food facilities required to register with FDA to renew such registrations every other year, and provides FDA with authority to suspend the registration of a food facility in certain circumstances. Specifically, if FDA determines that food manufactured, processed, packed, received, or held by a registered food facility has a reasonable probability of causing serious adverse health consequences or death to humans or animals, FDA may by order suspend the registration of a facility that:

● | Created, caused, or was otherwise responsible for such reasonable probability; or 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Knew of, or had reason to know of, such reasonable probability; and packed, received, or held such food. 

 
The Company’s operations may be subject to these registration requirements.
