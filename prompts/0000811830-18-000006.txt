ITEM 1 - BUSINESS
General
Santander Holdings USA, Inc. ("SHUSA" or the "Company") is the parent company of Santander Bank, National Association, (the "Bank" or "SBNA"), a national banking association, and owns a majority interest (approximately 68%) of Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, "SC"), a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SHUSA is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts and the Bank's main office is in Wilmington, Delaware. SC is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. SHUSA is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Banco Santander, S.A. ("Santander"). SHUSA is also the parent company of Santander BanCorp (together with its subsidiaries, “Santander BanCorp”), a holding company headquartered in Puerto Rico which offers a full range of financial services through its wholly-owned banking subsidiary, Banco Santander Puerto Rico; Santander Securities, LLC (“SSLLC”), a broker-dealer headquartered in Boston; Banco Santander International (“BSI”), an Edge Act corporation located in Miami which offers a full range of banking services to foreign individuals and corporations based primarily in Latin America; Santander Investment Securities Inc. (“SIS”), a registered broker-dealer located in New York providing services in investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed-income securities; and several other subsidiaries.
The Bank's principal markets are in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. At December 31, 2017, the Bank had 647 branches and 2,046 automated teller machines ("ATMs") across its footprint. The Bank uses its deposits, as well as other financing sources, to fund its loan and investment portfolios. The Bank earns interest income on its loan and investment portfolios. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest income from a number of sources, including deposit and loan services, sales of loans and investment securities, capital markets products and bank-owned life insurance ("BOLI"). The Bank's principal non-interest expenses include employee compensation and benefits, occupancy and facility-related costs, technology and other administrative expenses. The volumes, and accordingly the financial results, of the Bank are affected by the economic environment, including interest rates and consumer and business confidence and spending, as well as the competitive conditions within the Bank's geographic footprint.
SC's primary business is the indirect origination of retail installment contracts ("RICs"), principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. SC also offers a full spectrum of auto financing products and services to Chrysler customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand, the trade name used in providing services ("Chrysler Capital") under the ten-year private label financing agreement with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles US LLC ("FCA"), formerly Chrysler Group LLC, signed by SC in 2013 (the "Chrysler Agreement"). These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. SC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile and recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. Additionally, SC has several relationships through which it provides other consumer finance products. Common stock of SC ("SC Common Stock") is listed for trading on the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") under the trading symbol "SC". 
SC's Relationship with FCA
In February 2013, SC entered into the Chrysler Agreement, pursuant to which SC became the preferred provider for FCA’s consumer loans and leases and dealer loans effective May 1, 2013. Business generated under terms of the Chrysler Agreement is branded as Chrysler Capital. During 2017, SC originated more than $6.7 billion of Chrysler Capital retail installment contracts ("RICs") and more than $6.0 billion of Chrysler Capital vehicle leases.
The Chrysler Agreement requires, among other things, that SC bears the risk of loss on loans originated pursuant to the agreement, but also that FCA shares in any residual gains and losses from consumer leases. The agreement also requires that SC maintains at least $5.0 billion in funding available for dealer inventory financing and $4.5 billion of financing dedicated to FCA retail financing. In turn, FCA must provide designated minimum threshold percentages of its subvention business to SC.

The Chrysler Agreement has a ten-year term, subject to early termination in certain circumstances, including the failure by either party to comply with certain of their ongoing obligations. These obligations include, for SC, meeting specified escalating penetration rates for the first five years, and, for FCA, treating SC in a manner consistent with comparable original equipment manufacturers' ("OEMs") treatment of their captive providers, primarily regarding sales support. In addition, FCA may also terminate the agreement if, among other circumstances, (i) a person other than Santander or its affiliates or its other stockholders owns 20% or more of its common stock and Santander and its affiliates own fewer shares of common stock than such person, (ii) the Company becomes, controls, or becomes controlled by, an OEM that competes with Chrysler, or (iii) certain of SC's credit facilities become impaired.
In connection with entering into the Chrysler Agreement, SC paid FCA a $150 million upfront, nonrefundable fee on May 1, 2013. This fee is considered payment for future profits generated from the Chrysler Agreement. Accordingly, the Company amortizes the Chrysler Agreement over the expected ten-year term as a component of net finance and other interest income. The Company has also executed an equity option agreement with FCA, whereby FCA may elect to purchase, at any time during the term of the Chrysler Agreement, at fair market value, an equity participation of any percentage in the Chrysler Capital portion of SC's business.
For a period of 20 business days after FCA's delivery to SC of a notice of intent to exercise its option, the Company is to discuss with FCA, in good faith, the structure and valuation of the proposed equity participation. If the parties are unable to agree on a structure and FCA still intends to exercise its option, SC will be required to create a new company into which the Chrysler Capital assets will be transferred and which will own and operate the Chrysler Capital business. If FCA and SC cannot agree on a fair market value during the 20-day negotiation period, each party will engage an investment bank and the appointed banks will mutually appoint a third independent investment bank to determine the value, with the cost of the valuation divided evenly between FCA and SC. Each party has the right to a one-time deferral of the independent valuation process for up to nine months. FCA will have a period of 90 days after a valuation has been determined, either by negotiation between the parties or by an investment bank, to deliver a binding notice of exercise. Following this notice, FCA's purchase is to be paid and settled within 10 business days, subject to a delay of up to 180 days if necessary to obtain any required consents from governmental authorities.
Any new company formed to affect FCA's exercise of its equity option will be a Delaware limited liability company unless otherwise agreed to by the parties. As long as each party owns at least 20% of the business, FCA and SC will have equal voting and governance rights without regard to ownership percentage. If either party has an ownership interest in the business of less than 20%, the party with less than 20% ownership will have the right to designate a number of directors proportionate to its ownership and will have other customary minority voting rights.
Because the equity option is exercisable at fair market value, SC could recognize a gain or loss upon exercise if the fair market value is determined to be different from book value. The Company believes that the fair market value of its Chrysler Capital financing business currently exceeds book value and therefore has not recorded a contingent liability for potential loss upon FCA's exercise.
Subsequent to the exercise of the equity option, SC's rights under the Chrysler Agreement would be assigned to the jointly-owned business. Exercise of the equity option would be considered a triggering event requiring re-evaluation of whether or not the remaining unamortized balance of the upfront fee the Company paid to FCA on May 1, 2013 should be impaired.
Until January 31, 2017, SC had a flow agreement with Bank of America whereby the Company was committed to sell a contractually determined amount of eligible Chrysler Capital loans to Bank of America on a monthly basis, depending on the amount and credit quality of eligible current month originations and prior month sales. This agreement originally extended through May 31, 2018. On July 27, 2016, the flow agreement was amended to reduce the maximum commitment to sell eligible loans each month to $300,000. On October 27, 2016, Bank of America notified the Company that it was terminating the flow agreement effective January 31, 2017 and, accordingly, the agreement is now terminated. For loans sold under the agreement, SC retains the servicing rights at contractually agreed-upon rates. The Company may also receive or pay a servicer performance payment based on an agreed-upon formula if performance on the sold loans is better or worse, respectively, than expected performance at the time of sale.
SC has sold loans to Citizens Bank of Pennsylvania ("CBP") under terms of a flow agreement and other predecessor sale agreements. SC retains servicing on the sold loans and will owe CBP a loss-sharing payment capped at 0.5% of the original pool balance if losses exceed a specified threshold, established on a pool-by-pool basis. On June 25, 2015, SC executed an amendment to the servicing agreement with CBP which increased the servicing fees. This amendment also amended the flow agreement between CBP and SC, effective August 1, 2015, to reduce CBP's committed purchases of Chrysler Capital prime loans from a maximum of $600 million and a minimum of $250 million per quarter to a maximum of $200 million and a minimum of $50 million per quarter. On February 13, 2017, the Company and CBP entered into a mutual agreement to terminate the flow agreement effective May 1, 2017.

Intermediate Holding Company ("IHC")
On July 1, 2016, due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander became subject to both of the provisions of the Final Rule discussed below under the "Supervision and Regulation" section of Item 1 of this Form 10-K. As a result of this rule, ownership of several Santander subsidiaries, including Santander BanCorp, BSI, SIS and SSLLC, were transferred to the Company, which became a U.S. intermediate holding company (an "IHC"). On July 1, 2017, an additional Santander subsidiary, Santander Financial Services, Inc. (“SFS”), a finance company located in Puerto Rico, was transferred to SHUSA.
Segments
The Company's reportable segments are focused principally around the customers the Company serves. In 2017, the Company has identified the following reportable segments: 
Consumer and Business Banking
The Consumer and Business Banking segment includes the products and services provided to Bank customers through the Bank's branch locations, including consumer deposit, business banking, residential mortgage, unsecured lending and investment services. The branch locations offer a wide range of products and services to consumers and business banking customers, including demand and interest-bearing demand deposit accounts, money market and savings accounts, CDs and retirement savings products. The branch locations also offer lending products such as credit cards, home equity loans and lines of credit, and business loans such as commercial lines of credit and business credit cards. In addition, the Bank provides investment services to its retail customers, including annuities, mutual funds, and insurance products. Santander Universities, which provides grants and scholarships to universities and colleges as a way to foster education through research, innovation and entrepreneurship, is the last component of this segment.
Commercial Banking
The Commercial Banking segment currently provides commercial lines, loans, and deposits to medium and large business banking customers as well as financing and deposits for government entities, commercial loans to dealers and financing for equipment and commercial vehicles. This segment also provides financing and deposits for government entities and niche product financing for specific industries, including oil and gas and mortgage warehousing, among others. 
Commercial Real Estate
The Commercial Real Estate segment offers commercial real estate loans and multifamily loans to customers.
Global Corporate Banking ("GCB")
The GCB segment serves the needs of global commercial and institutional customers by leveraging the international footprint of Santander to provide financing and banking services to corporations with over $500 million in annual revenues. GCB's offerings and strategy are based on Santander's local and global capabilities in wholesale banking.
SC
SC is a specialized consumer finance company focused on vehicle finance and third-party servicing. SC’s primary business is the indirect origination of RICs, principally through manufacturer-franchised dealers in connection with their sale of new and used vehicles to retail consumers. In conjunction with a ten-year private label financing agreement with FCA that became effective May 1, 2013, SC offers a full spectrum of auto financing products and services to FCA customers and dealers under the Chrysler Capital brand. These products and services include consumer RICs and leases, as well as dealer loans for inventory, construction, real estate, working capital and revolving lines of credit. SC also originates vehicle loans through a web-based direct lending program, purchases vehicle RICs from other lenders, and services automobile, recreational and marine vehicle portfolios for other lenders. In the third quarter of 2015, SC announced that it would exit personal lending, and such assets were accordingly classified as held for sale. In February 2016, SC sold substantially all of the $869.3 million Lending Club portfolio and the remaining portfolio was sold in April 2017.
6

SC continues to hold the Bluestem portfolio, which had a carrying balance of approximately $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017, and remain a party to agreements with Bluestem that includes obligations, among other things, to purchase new advances originated by Bluestem and existing balances on accounts with new advances, for an initial term ending in April 2020 and renewable through April 2022 at Bluestem’s option. Although a third party is being sought to assume this obligation, SC may not be successful in finding such a party, and Bluestem may not agree to the substitution. The Bluestem portfolio continues to be classified as held-for sale. Significant lower-of-cost-or-market adjustments have been recorded on this portfolio and may continue as long as SC holds the portfolio, particularly due to the purchase commitments.
SC has entered into a number of intercompany agreements with the Bank. All intercompany revenue and fees between the Bank and SC are eliminated in the consolidated results of the Company.
The financial results for each of these reportable segments are included in Note 23 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are discussed in Item 7, "Line of Business Results" within the Management's Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") section of this Form 10-K. These results have been presented based on the Company's management structure and management accounting practices. The structure and accounting practices are specific to the Company and, as a result, the financial results of the Company's reportable segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions.
Other
The Other category includes certain immaterial subsidiaries such as BSI, Banco Santander Puerto Rico, SIS, SSLLC, and SFS, the unallocated interest expense on the Company's borrowings and other debt obligations and certain unallocated corporate income and indirect expenses.
Subsidiaries
SHUSA has two principal consolidated majority-owned subsidiaries at December 31, 2017, the Bank and SC. 
Employees
At December 31, 2017, the Company had approximately 17,000 employees among its subsidiaries. No Company employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
Competition
The Bank is subject to substantial competition in attracting and retaining deposits and in lending funds. The primary factors in competing for deposits include the ability to offer attractive rates, the convenience of office locations, the availability of alternate channels of distribution, and servicing capabilities. Direct competition for deposits comes primarily from other national, regional, and state banks, thrift institutions, and broker dealers. Competition for deposits also comes from money market mutual funds, corporate and government securities, and credit unions. The primary factors driving competition for commercial and consumer loans are interest rates, loan origination fees, service levels and the range of products and services offered. Competition for originating loans normally comes from thrift institutions, national and state banks, mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, finance companies, and insurance companies.
SC is also subject to substantial competition, particularly in the automobile finance industry. SC competes on the pricing it offers on its loans and leases as well as the customer service SC provides automobile dealer customers. SC, along with its competitors, provides pricing and other terms and conditions for loans and leases through web-based credit application aggregation platforms. When dealers submit applications for consumers acquiring vehicles, they can compare SC's terms and conditions against its competitors’ pricing. Dealer relationships are important in the automotive finance industry. Vehicle finance providers tailor product offerings to meet dealers' needs. SC's primary competitors in the vehicle finance space are national and regional banks, credit unions, independent financial institutions, and the affiliated finance companies of automotive manufacturers. 
Supervision and Regulation
SHUSA is a bank holding company (“BHC”) pursuant to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the “BHC Act”). As a BHC, the Company is subject to consolidated supervision by the Federal Reserve. SBNA is an FDIC-insured national bank authorized under the National Bank Act and subject to supervision by the OCC. In addition, CFPB has oversight over SHUSA, SBNA, and SHUSA’s other non-bank affiliates, including SC, for compliance with federal consumer protection laws.

Foreign Banking Organizations (“FBOs”)
In February 2014, the Federal Reserve issued the final rule implementing certain enhanced prudential standards (“EPS”) mandated by section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “DFA") (“Final Rule”). Under the Final Rule, FBOs with over $50 billion of U.S. non-branch assets, including Santander, were required to consolidate U.S. subsidiary activities under an IHC. In addition, the Final Rule required U.S. BHCs and FBOs with at least $50 billion in total U.S. consolidated non-branch assets to be subject to EPS and heightened capital, liquidity, risk management, and stress testing requirements. Due to both its global and U.S. non-branch total consolidated asset size, Santander was subject to both of the above provisions of the Final Rule. As a result of this rule, Santander has transferred substantially all of its U.S. bank and non-bank subsidiaries previously outside the Company to the Company, which became an IHC effective July 1, 2016. A phased-in approach is being used for the standards and requirements at both the FBO and the IHC. As a U.S. BHC with more than $50 billion in total consolidated assets, the Company became subject to the EPS on January 1, 2015. Other standards of the FBO Final Rule will be phased in through January 1, 2019.
DFA
The DFA instituted major changes to banking and financial institution regulatory regimes as a result of the financial crisis. The DFA includes a number of provisions designed to promote enhanced supervision and regulation of financial companies and financial markets. The DFA introduced substantial reforms that reshape the financial services industry, including significantly enhanced regulation. This enhanced regulation has required and will continue to require higher compliance costs and negatively affect the Company's revenue and earnings. 
EPS
The DFA imposes EPS on BHCs with at least $50 billion in total consolidated assets (often referred to as “systemically important financial institutions”), including the Company, and required the Federal Reserve to establish prudential standards for such BHCs that are more stringent than those applicable to other BHCs, including standards for risk-based capital requirements and leverage limits; heightened capital and liquidity standards, including eliminating trust preferred securities as Tier 1 regulatory capital; enhanced risk management requirements; and credit exposure reporting and concentration limits. These changes have impacted and are expected to continue impacting the profitability and growth of the Company.
The DFA mandates an enhanced supervisory framework, which means that the Company is subject to annual stress tests by the Federal Reserve, and the Company and the Bank are required to conduct semi-annual and annual stress tests, respectively, reporting results to the Federal Reserve and the OCC. The Federal Reserve also has discretionary authority to establish additional prudential standards, on its own or at the Financial Stability Oversight Council's recommendation, regarding contingent capital, enhanced public disclosures, short-term debt limits, and otherwise as deemed appropriate.
Stress Testing and Capital Planning
The Company is subject to the Federal Reserve’s capital plan rule, which requires the Company and the Bank to perform stress tests and submit the results to the Federal Reserve and the OCC on an annual basis. The Company is also required to submit a mid-year stress test to the Federal Reserve. In addition, together with the annual stress test submission, the Company is required to submit a proposed capital plan to the Federal Reserve. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in the Company's stress tests and capital plans.
Under the capital plan rule, the Company is considered a large and non-complex BHC. The Federal Reserve may object to the Company’s capital plan if the Federal Reserve determines that the Company has not demonstrated an ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio on a pro forma basis under expected and stressful conditions throughout the planning horizon. Large and non-complex BHCs such as the Company are no longer subject to the qualitative objection criteria of the capital plan rule which are applied to larger banks that fall outside the large and non-complex BHC definition.
SHUSA and SBNA are subject to various regulatory restrictions relating to the payment of dividends, including regulatory capital minimums and the requirement to remain "well-capitalized" under prompt corrective action regulations. As a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, SC is included in various regulatory restrictions relating to payment of dividends

Regulatory Capital Requirements
In July 2013, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC and the OCC released final U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules implementing the global regulatory capital reforms of Basel III that are applicable to both SHUSA and the Bank. The final rules established a comprehensive capital framework that includes both the advanced approaches for the largest internationally active U.S. banks, formerly known as Basel II, and a standardized approach that applies to all banking organizations with over $500 million in assets. Subject to various transition periods, this rule became effective for SHUSA on January 1, 2015.
The rules narrow the definition of regulatory capital and establish higher minimum risk-based capital ratios and prompt corrective action thresholds that, when fully phased in, require banking organizations, including the Company and the Bank, to maintain a minimum common equity tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0%, a total capital ratio of 8.0% and a minimum leverage ratio, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets for the quarter, of 4.0%.
A capital conservation buffer of 2.5% above these minimum ratios is being phased in over three years starting in 2016, beginning at 0.625% and increasing by that amount on each subsequent January 1, until the buffer reaches 2.5% on January 1, 2019. This buffer is required for banking institutions and BHCs to avoid restrictions on their ability to make capital distributions, including paying dividends.
The U.S. Basel III regulatory capital rules include deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights ("MSRs"), deferred tax assets dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities are deducted from CET1 to the extent any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1. Implementation of the deductions and other adjustments to CET1 for the Company and the Bank began on January 1, 2015 and was initially planned over three years, with a fully phased-in requirement of January 1, 2018. However, during 2017, the regulatory agencies proposed finalized changes to the capital rules that became effective on January 1, 2018.  These changes extended the current treatment and will defer the final transition provision phase-in at non-advanced approach institutions for certain capital elements, and suspend the risk-weighting to 100 percent for deferred taxes and mortgage servicing assets not disallowed from capital, in lieu of advancing to 250 percent.  In addition, the regulatory agencies issued a secondary proposal in 2017 to further revise the capital rule by introducing new treatment of high volatility acquisition, development and construction loans, and by modifying the calculation for minority interest includible within capital, for which the regulators have not released a final decision.  
See the Bank Regulatory Capital section of the MD&A of this Form 10-K for the Company's capital ratios under Basel III standards. The implementation of certain regulations and standards relating to regulatory capital could disproportionately affect the Company's regulatory capital position relative to that of its competitors, including those that may not be subject to the same regulatory requirements as the Company.
If capital has reached the significantly or critically undercapitalized levels, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. All but well-capitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act (the “FDIA”) and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions or repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the capital account of the institution. 
At December 31, 2017, the Bank met the criteria to be classified as “well-capitalized.”

Liquidity Rules
In September 2014, the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, and the OCC finalized a rule to implement the Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (the “LCR”) for certain internationally active banks and nonbank financial companies, and a modified version of the LCR for certain depository institution holding companies that are not internationally active. The LCR is designed to ensure that a banking entity maintains an adequate level of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets ("HQLA") equal to its expected net cash outflow for a 30-day time horizon. This rule implements a phased implementation approach under which the most globally important covered companies (more than $700 billion in assets) and large regional financial institutions ($250 billion to $700 billion in assets) were required to begin phasing-in the LCR requirements in January 2015. Smaller covered companies (more than $50 billion in assets), such as the Company, were required to calculate the LCR monthly beginning January 2016. In November 2015, the Federal Reserve published a revised final LCR rule. Under this revision, the Company was required to calculate the modified US LCR (the "US LCR") on a monthly basis beginning with data as of January 31, 2016. There is no requirement to submit the calculation to the Federal Reserve. The Company will be required to publicly disclose its US LCR results beginning October 1, 2018. 
In October 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the final standard for the net stable funding ratio (the “NSFR”). The NSFR is designed to promote more medium- and long-term funding of the assets and activities of banking entities over a one-year time horizon The NSFR requires banks to maintain a stable funding profile in relation to their on- and off-balance sheet activities, thereby reducing the likelihood that disruptions to a bank's regular sources of funding will erode its liquidity in a way that could increase the risk of its failure and potentially lead to broader systemic stress. In May 2016, the Federal Reserve issued a proposed rule for NSFR applicable to U.S. financial institutions. The proposed rule has not been finalized, and the Company is currently evaluating the impact this proposed rule would have on its financial position, results of operations and disclosures.
Resolution and Recovery Planning
The DFA requires all BHCs and FBOs with assets of $50 billion or more to prepare and regularly update a resolution plan. The resolution plan must assume that the covered company is resolved under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and that no “extraordinary support” is received from the U.S. or any other government. In addition, the insured depository resolution plan rule requires that a bank with assets of $50 billion or more develop a plan for its resolution in a manner that ensures that depositors receive rapid access to their insured deposits, maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets, and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in resolution. Santander and the Bank most recently submitted resolution plans in accordance with these rules in December 2015.
In September 2016, the OCC issued final guidelines that requires a bank with consolidated assets of $50 billion to develop and maintain a recovery plan that is appropriate for its size, risk profile, activities, and complexity, including the complexity of its organizational and legal entity structure. As provided in the final rule, SBNA must complete its initial recovery plan by July 2018.
Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity ("TLAC")
The Federal Reserve adopted a final rule in December 2016 that requires certain U.S. organizations to maintain a minimum amount of loss-absorbing instruments, including a minimum amount of unsecured long-term debt (“LTD”) (the “TLAC Rule”). The TLAC Rule applies to U.S. global systemically important banks and to IHCs with $50 billion or more in U.S. non-branch assets that are controlled by a global systemically important FBO. The Company is such an IHC.
Under the TLAC Rule, companies are required to maintain a minimum amount of TLAC, which consists of a minimum amount of LTD and Tier 1 capital. As a result, SHUSA will need to hold the higher of 18% of its risk-weighted assets ("RWAs") or 9% of its total consolidated assets in the form of TLAC. SHUSA must maintain a TLAC buffer composed solely of common equity Tier 1 capital and will be subject to restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments based on the size of the TLAC buffer it maintains. In addition, the TLAC Rule requires SHUSA to hold LTD of at least 6% of its RWAs or 3.5% of its total consolidated assets. The TLAC Rule is effective January 1, 2019.
Volcker Rule
The DFA added new Section 13 to the BHC Act, which is commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” The Volcker Rule prohibits a “banking entity” from engaging in “proprietary trading” or engaging in any of the following activities with respect to a hedge fund or a private equity fund (together, a “Covered Fund”): (i) acquiring or retaining any equity, partnership or other ownership interest in the Covered Fund; (ii) controlling the Covered Fund; or (iii) engaging in certain transactions with the fund if the banking entity or any affiliate is an investment adviser or sponsor to the Covered Fund. These prohibitions are subject to certain exemptions for permitted activities.
10

Because the term “banking entity” includes an insured depository institution, a depository institution holding company and any of their affiliates, the Volcker Rule has sweeping worldwide application and covers entities such as Santander, the Company, and certain of the Company’s subsidiaries (including the Bank and SC), as well as other Santander subsidiaries in the United States and abroad.
The Company implemented certain policies and procedures, training programs, record keeping, internal controls and other compliance requirements that were necessary to comply with the Volcker Rule. As required by the Volcker Rule, the compliance infrastructure has been tailored to each banking entity based on its size and its level of trading and Covered Fund activities. SHUSA's compliance program includes, among other things, processes for prior approval of new activities and investments permitted under the Volcker Rule, testing and auditing for compliance and a process for attesting annually that the compliance program is reasonably designed to achieve compliance rule.
Collateral Requirements
The Company routinely executes interest rate swaps for the management of its asset/liability mix, and also executes such swaps with its borrower clients. Under the DFA, the Bank is required to post collateral with certain of its counterparties and clearing exchanges. While clearing these financial instruments offers some benefits and additional transparency in valuation, the system requirements for clearing execution add operational complexities to the business and accordingly increase operational risk.
Risk Retention Rule
In December 2014, the Federal Reserve issued its final credit risk retention rule, which generally requires sponsors of asset-backed securities ("ABS") to retain at least five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing ABS. Compliance with the rule with respect to ABS collateralized by residential mortgages was required beginning in December of 2015. Compliance with the rule with regard to all other classes of ABS was required beginning in December of 2016. SHUSA, primarily through SC, is an active participant in the structured finance markets and began to comply with the retention requirements effective in December 2016.
Heightened Standards
The Bank is subject to the OCC's regulations under the National Bank Act. The various laws and regulations administered by the OCC for national banks affect the Bank's corporate practices and impose certain restrictions on its activities and investments to ensure that the Bank operates in a safe and sound manner. These laws and regulations also require the Bank to disclose substantial business and financial information to the OCC and the public. 
In September 2014, the OCC finalized guidelines to strengthen the governance and risk management practices of large financial institutions commonly known as “heightened standards.” The heightened standards apply to insured national banks with $50 billion or more in consolidated assets. The heightened standards require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written risk governance framework to manage and control their risk-taking activities. The heightened standards also provide minimum standards for the institutions’ boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework.
Transactions with Affiliates
Depository institutions must remain in compliance with Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and the Federal Reserve's Regulation W, which governs the activities of the Bank with affiliated companies and individuals. Section 23A imposes limits on certain specified “covered transactions,” which include loans, lines, and letters of credit to affiliated companies or individuals, and investments in affiliated companies, as well as certain other transactions with affiliated companies and individuals. The aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to 10% of a bank’s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and 20% for all affiliates. Certain covered transactions also must meet collateral requirements that range from 100% to 130% depending on the type of transaction.
Section 23B of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits a depository institution from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are considered arms' length. To meet the definition of arms-length, the terms of the transaction must be the same, or at least as favorable, as those for similar transactions with non-affiliated companies.
As a U.S. domiciled subsidiary of a global parent with significant non-bank affiliates, the Bank and the Company face elevated compliance risk in this area.

Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”)
SBNA and Banco Santander Puerto Rico are subject to the requirements of the CRA, which requires the appropriate federal financial supervisory agency to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of the local communities in which it is located. Banco Santander Puerto Rico’s current CRA rating is “Outstanding.” SBNA’s most recent public CRA report of examination rated the Bank as “Needs to Improve” for the January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013 evaluation period. The Bank’s rating based solely on the applicable CRA lending, service and investment tests would have been “satisfactory.” However, the overall rating was lowered to “Needs to Improve” due to previously disclosed instances of non-compliance by the Bank that are being remediated. The OCC takes into account the Bank’s CRA rating in considering certain regulatory applications the Bank makes, including applications related to establishing and relocating branches, and the Federal Reserve does the same with respect to certain regulatory applications the Company makes. In addition, there may be some negative impacts on aspects of the Bank’s business as a result of the downgrade. For example, certain categories of depositors are restricted from making deposits in banks with a “Needs to Improve” rating.
Interchange Rule
Under the Durbin Amendment to the DFA, in June 2011 the Federal Reserve issued the final rule implementing debit card interchange fee and routing regulation. The final rule establishes standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by debit card issuers, including the Bank, are “reasonable and proportional” to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions, and prohibits network exclusivity arrangements on debit cards to ensure merchants have choices in how debit card transactions are routed.
CFPB
The CFPB has broad regulatory and supervisory powers with respect to federal consumer protection laws. As a result, the CFPB has the authority to regulate the Company, the Bank, SC and other SHUSA subsidiaries that offer consumer products. The CFPB’s oversight includes deposit products, credit cards, mortgage lending, and automobile loans. In addition, the CFPB has broad powers with respect to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices in connection with any transaction with a consumer. 
In March 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin recommending that indirect vehicle lenders, including SC, take steps to monitor and impose controls over vehicle dealer "mark-up" policies under which dealers impose higher interest rates on certain consumers, with the mark-up shared between the dealer and the lender. In accordance with SC's policy, dealers were allowed to mark-up interest rates by a maximum of 2.00%, but in October 2014 SC reduced the maximum compensation (participation) from 2.00% (industry practice) to 1.75%. SC plans to continue to evaluate this policy for effectiveness and may make further changes to strengthen oversight of dealers and mark-up rates.
Regulation AB II
In August 2014, the SEC adopted final rules known as Regulation AB II that, among other things, expanded disclosure requirements and modified the offering and shelf registration process for asset-backed securities (“ABS”). All offerings of publicly registered ABS and all reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), for outstanding publicly-registered ABS were required to comply with the new rules and disclosures on and after November 23, 2015, except for asset-level disclosures. Compliance with the new rules regarding asset-level disclosures was required for all offerings of publicly registered ABS on and after November 23, 2016. SC must comply with these rules, which affects SC's public securitization platform.
BHC Activity and Acquisition Restrictions
Federal laws restrict the types of activities in which BHCs may engage, and subject them to a range of supervisory requirements, including regulatory enforcement actions for violations of laws and policies. BHCs may engage in the business of banking and managing and controlling banks, as well as closely-related activities.
The Company would be required to obtain approval from the Federal Reserve if the Company were to acquire shares of any depository institution or any holding company of a depository institution, or any financial entity that is not a depository institution, such as a lending company.

Control of the Company or the Bank
Under the Change in Bank Control Act, individuals, corporations or other entities acquiring SHUSA's common stock may, alone or together with other investors, be deemed to control the Company and thereby the Bank. Ownership of more than 10% of SHUSA’s capital stock may be deemed to constitute “control” if certain other control factors are present. If deemed to control the Company, those persons or groups would be required to obtain the Federal Reserve's approval to acquire the Company’s common stock and could be subject to certain ongoing reporting procedures and restrictions under federal law and regulations. 
Standards for Safety and Soundness
The federal banking agencies adopted certain operational and managerial standards for depository institutions, including internal audit system components, loan documentation requirements, asset growth parameters, information technology and data security practices, and compensation standards for officers, directors and employees. The implementation or enforcement of these guidelines has not had a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.
Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC 
The Bank is a member of the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is administered by the FDIC. Deposits are insured up to the applicable limits by the FDIC, and such insurance is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The FDIC imposes deposit insurance premiums and is authorized to conduct examinations of, and require reporting by, FDIC-insured institutions. It also may prohibit any FDIC-insured institution from engaging in any activity the FDIC determines by regulation or order to pose a serious risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against banking institutions and may terminate an institution’s deposit insurance if it determines that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or is in an unsafe or unsound condition.
The FDIC charges financial institutions deposit premium assessments to ensure it has reserves to cover deposits that are under FDIC-insured limits, which is currently $250,000 per depositor per ownership category for each ownership deposit account category. 
FDIC insurance premium expenses were $61.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.
In addition to deposit insurance premiums, all insured institutions are required to pay a Financing Corporation assessment, in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s. In 2017, the Bank paid Financing Corporation assessments of $4.0 million, compared to $4.5 million in 2016. The annual rate for all insured institutions dropped to $0.046 for every $1,000 in domestic deposits in 2017, compared to $0.056 in 2016. The assessments are revised quarterly and continued until the bonds matured between 2017 and 2019.
In March 2016, the FDIC finalized the rule to implement Section 334 of the DFA to provide for a surcharge assessment at an annual rate of 4.5 basis points on banks with over $10 billion in assets to increase the FDIC insurance fund. The FDIC commenced this surcharge in the third quarter of 2016, and will continue for eight consecutive quarters. After the eight quarters, the FDIC may charge a shortfall assessment.
Restrictions on Subsidiary Banking Institution Capital Distributions
Under the FDIA, insured depository institutions must be classified in one of five defined tiers (well-capitalized, adequately-capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized). Under OCC regulations, an institution is considered “well-capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10% or greater, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8% or greater, (iii) has a CET1 capital ratio of 6.5% or greater, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 5% or greater and (v) is not subject to any order or written directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level. 
If capital levels fall to significantly or critically undercapitalized levels, further material restrictions can be imposed, including restrictions on interest payable on accounts, dismissal of management and, in critically undercapitalized situations, appointment of a receiver or conservator. Critically undercapitalized institutions generally may not, beginning 60 days after becoming critically undercapitalized, make any payment of principal or interest on their subordinated debt. All but well-capitalized institutions are prohibited from accepting brokered deposits without prior regulatory approval. Pursuant to the FDIA and OCC regulations, institutions which are not categorized as well-capitalized or adequately-capitalized are restricted from making capital distributions, which include cash dividends, stock redemptions and repurchases, cash-out mergers, interest payments on certain convertible debt and other transactions charged to the institution’s capital account. At December 31, 2017, the Bank met the criteria to be classified as “well-capitalized.”
13

Federal banking laws, regulations and policies limit the Bank’s ability to pay dividends and make other distributions to the Company. The Bank must obtain prior OCC approval to declare a dividend or make any other capital distribution if, after such dividend or distribution: (1) the Bank’s total distributions to the Company within that calendar year would exceed 100% of its net income during the year plus retained net income for the prior two years; (2) the Bank would not meet capital levels imposed by the OCC in connection with any order, or (3) the Bank is not adequately capitalized at the time. In addition, the OCC's prior approval is required if the OCC deems it to be in troubled condition or a problem institution. 
Any dividends declared and paid have the effect of reducing the Bank’s Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets and risk-based capital ratios. The Company paid cash dividends on common stock of $10.0 million in 2017 while no dividends were declared or paid in 2016. The Company returned capital of $11.7 million in 2017 while no capital was returned in 2016.
Federal Reserve Regulation
Under Federal Reserve regulations, the Bank is required to maintain a reserve against its transaction accounts (primarily interest-bearing and non-interest-bearing checking accounts). Because reserves must generally be maintained in cash or in low-interest-bearing accounts, the effect of the reserve requirements is to reduce an institution’s asset yields.
The amount of total reserve requirements at December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $294.2 million and $244.7 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, the Company complied with the reserve requirements. 
Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") System
The FHLB system was created in 1932 and consists of 11 regional FHLBs. FHLBs are federally-chartered but privately owned institutions created by Congress. The Federal Housing Finance Agency is an agency of the federal government that is charged with overseeing the FHLBs. Each FHLB is owned by its member institutions. The primary purpose of the FHLBs is to provide funding to their members for making housing loans as well as for affordable housing and community development lending. FHLBs are generally able to make advances to their member institutions at interest rates that are lower than could otherwise be obtained by such institutions. As a member, the Bank is required to make minimum investments in FHLB stock based on its level of borrowings from the FHLB. The Bank is a member of and held investments in the FHLB of Pittsburgh which totaled $116.1 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $280.3 million at December 31, 2016. The Bank utilizes advances from FHLB to fund balance sheet growth, provide liquidity and for asset and liability management purposes. The Bank had access to advances with the FHLB of up to $17.7 billion at December 31, 2017, and had outstanding advances of $1.95 billion or 11% of total availability at that date. The level of borrowing capacity the Bank has with the FHLB of Pittsburgh is contingent upon the level of qualified collateral the Bank holds at a given time.
The Bank received $12.9 million and $24.2 million in dividends on its stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh in 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
Anti-Money Laundering and the USA Patriot Act
Several federal laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, the Money Laundering Control Act, and the USA Patriot Act require all financial institutions to, among other things, implement policies and procedures relating to anti-money laundering, compliance, suspicious activities, currency transaction reporting and due diligence on customers. The USA Patriot Act substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the U.S.; imposed compliance and due diligence obligations; created criminal penalties; compelled the production of documents located both inside and outside the U.S., including those of non-U.S. institutions that have a correspondent relationship in the U.S.; and clarified the safe harbor from civil liability to clients. The U.S. Treasury has issued a number of regulations that further clarify the USA Patriot Act’s requirements and provide more specific guidance on their application. 
Financial Privacy
Under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (the "GLBA"), financial institutions are required to disclose to their retail customers their policies and practices with respect to sharing nonpublic customer information with their affiliates and non-affiliates, how they maintain customer confidentiality, and how they secure customer information. Customers are required under the GLBA to be provided with the opportunity to “opt out” of information sharing with non-affiliates, subject to certain exceptions.

Environmental Laws
Environmentally related hazards have become a source of high risk and potentially significant liability for financial institutions related to their loans. Environmentally contaminated properties owned by an institution’s borrowers may result in a drastic reduction in the value of the collateral securing the institution’s loans to such borrowers, high environmental cleanup costs to the borrower affecting its ability to repay its loans, the subordination of any lien in favor of the institution to a state or federal lien securing clean-up costs, and liability to the institution for cleanup costs if it forecloses on the contaminated property or becomes involved in the management of the borrower. To minimize this risk, the Bank may require an environmental examination of, and reports with respect to, the property of any borrower or prospective borrower if circumstances affecting the property indicate a potential for contamination, taking into consideration the potential loss to the institution in relation to the burdens to the borrower. Such examination must be performed by an engineering firm experienced in environmental risk studies and acceptable to the institution, and the costs of such examinations and reports are the responsibility of the borrower. These costs may be substantial and may deter a prospective borrower from entering into a loan transaction with the Bank. The Company is not aware of any borrower which is currently subject to any environmental investigation or clean-up preceding that is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of SHUSA or its subsidiaries.
Securities Regulation
The Company conducts its securities activities through its subsidiaries SIS and SSLLC. SIS and SSLLC are registered broker-dealer with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). SIS’s activities include investment banking, institutional sales, trading and offering research reports of Latin American and European equity and fixed income securities. SSLLC is a registered investment advisor.
