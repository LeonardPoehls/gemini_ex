Item 1.    Business
Overview
Rosetta Stone Inc. (“Rosetta Stone,” “the Company,” “we” or “us”) is dedicated to changing people's lives through the power of language and literacy education. Our innovative digital solutions drive positive learning outcomes for the inspired learner at home or in schools and workplaces around the world. 
Founded in 1992, Rosetta Stone's language division uses cloud-based solutions to help all types of learners read, write, and speak more than 30 languages. Lexia Learning, Rosetta Stone's literacy education division, was founded more than 30 years ago and is a leader in the literacy education space. Today, Lexia helps students build fundamental reading skills through its rigorously researched, independently evaluated, and widely respected instruction and assessment programs. Rosetta Stone Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 2005. 
As our Company has evolved, we believe that our Enterprise & Education Language and Literacy segments are our largest opportunities for long-term value creation. The customers in these markets have needs that recur each year, creating a more predictable sales opportunity. This need profile also fits well with our suite of language and literacy products, and the well-known Rosetta Stone brand. We also believe the demand is growing for e-learning based literacy solutions in the U.S. and English language-learning around the globe. 
As a result, we are emphasizing the development of products and solutions for Corporate and K-12 learners who need to speak and read English. This focus extends to the Consumer segment, where we continue to make product investments serving the needs of passionate language-learners who are motivated, results focused and willing to pay for a quality language-learning experience. 
To position the organization for success, our focus is on the following priorities:

1. | Grow literacy sales and market share by providing fully aligned digital instruction and assessment tools for K-12, building a direct distribution sales force to augment our historical reseller model, and continuing to develop our implementation services business;


2. | Position our Enterprise & Education Language segment for profitable growth by focusing our direct sales on our best geographies and customer segments, partnering with resellers in other geographies and successfully delivering our CatalystTM product to Corporate customers. Catalyst integrates our Foundations, Advantage, and Advanced English for Business products with enhanced reporting, assessment and administrator tools that offers a simple, more modern, metrics-driven suite of tools that are results-oriented and easily integrated with leading corporate language-learning systems;


3. | Maximize the profitability of our Consumer language business by providing an attractive value proposition and a streamlined, mobile-oriented product portfolio focused on consumers' demand, while optimizing our marketing spend appropriately;


4. | Seek opportunities to leverage our language assets including our content, tools and pedagogy, as well as our well-known Rosetta Stone brand, through partnerships with leading players in key markets around the world; and


5. | Continue to identify opportunities to become more efficient.

In pursuing these priorities, we will (i) allocate capital to the areas of our business that we believe have the greatest value creation potential, including our Lexia literacy business, (ii) focus our businesses on their best customers, including K-12 learners primarily in North America, Corporate learners primarily in North America and Northern Europe in our Enterprise & Education Language segment, and passionate learners in the U.S. and select non-U.S. geographies in our Consumer language business, and (iii) optimize the sales and marketing costs for these businesses and the costs of our business overall. 
Business Segments
Our business is organized into three operating segments: Enterprise & Education Language, Literacy, and Consumer. The Enterprise & Education Language segment derives language-learning revenues from sales to educational institutions, corporations, and government agencies worldwide under a Software-as-a-Service ("SaaS") model. The Literacy segment derives revenue under a SaaS model from the sales of literacy solutions to educational institutions serving grades K through 12. The Consumer segment derives revenue from sales to individuals and retail partners worldwide. For additional information regarding our segments, see Note 17 of Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Prior periods are presented consistently with our current operating segments and definition of segment contribution.

Our research and development expenses were $26.3 million, $29.9 million, and $33.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Customers and Distribution Channels
No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's revenue during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 or 2014. Our practice is to ship our products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from customers; consequently, backlog is not significant.
Enterprise & Education Language:
Our Enterprise & Education Language distribution channel is focused on targeted sales activity primarily through a direct sales force in five markets: K-12 schools, colleges and universities, government agencies, not-for-profit organizations, and corporations. Our Enterprise & Education language-learning customers include the following:
Educational Institutions.    These customers include primary and secondary schools and colleges and universities.
Government Agencies and Not-for-Profit Organizations.    These customers include government agencies and organizations developing workforces that serve non-native speaking populations, offering literacy programs, and preparing members for overseas missions.
Corporations.    We promote interest in this market with onsite visits, trade show and seminar attendance, speaking engagements, and direct mailings.
Third-party Resellers and Partners. We utilize third-party resellers and partners to provide our language-learning solutions to businesses, schools, and public-sector organizations in markets predominantly outside the U.S.
Literacy:
Our Literacy distribution channel utilizes a direct sales force as well as relationships with third-party resellers focused on the sale of Lexia solutions to K-12 schools.
Consumer:
Our Consumer distribution channel comprises a mix of our call centers, websites, third party e-commerce websites, app-stores, consignment distributors, select retail resellers, and daily deal partners. We believe these channels complement each other, as consumers who have seen our direct-to-consumer advertising may purchase at our retailers, and vice versa. 
Direct to consumer.    Sales generated through either our call centers, our e-commerce website at www.rosettastone.com, and app stores.
Indirect to consumer. Sales generated through arrangements with third-party e-commerce websites such as the Apple App Store, and consignment distributors such as Wynit Distribution and Software Packaging Associates. 
Retailers.    Our retailers enable us to provide additional points of contact to educate consumers about our solutions, expand our presence beyond our own websites, and further strengthen and enhance our brand image. Our retail relationships

include Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble, Target, Best Buy, Books-a-Million, Sam's Club, Staples, and others in and outside of the U.S. We also partner with daily deal resellers. 
Home School.    We promote interest in the language-learning market through advertising in publications focused on home schooling and attending local trade shows.
Sourcing and Fulfillment
Consistent with the SaaS model in our Enterprise & Education Language and Literacy segments, our strategy in the Consumer segment is to shift the sales mix away from CD-based product sales toward a cloud-based software subscription in order to reduce costs associated with physical packaging and distribution. 
Our physical inventory utilizes a flexible, diversified and low-cost manufacturing base. We use third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers to obtain substantially all of our product and packaging components and to manufacture finished products. We believe that we have good relationships with our manufacturers and suppliers and that there are alternative sources in the event that one or more of these manufacturers or suppliers is not available. We continually review our manufacturing and supply needs against the capacity of our contract manufacturers and suppliers with a view to ensuring that we are able to meet our production goals, reduce costs and operate more efficiently.
Competition
Rosetta Stone competes in several categories within the technology-based learning industry, including consumer, enterprise and educational language learning, and literacy. 
The language-learning market is highly fragmented globally and consists of a variety of instructional and learning modes: classroom instruction utilizing the traditional approach of memorization, grammar and translation; immersion-based classroom instruction; self-study books, audio recordings and software that rely primarily on grammar and translation; and free online and mobile offerings that provide content and opportunities to practice writing and speaking. In the enterprise and education-focused language market, we compete with EF English Live (formerly EF Englishtown), Global English, Wall Street English (Pearson), inlingua, Imagine Learning, Transparent Language, Duolingo, Middlebury Interactive Languages, Speexx as well as many private language schools and other classroom-based courses. Within consumer-focused language learning, our competitors include Berlitz (Benesse Holdings), Pimsleur (Simon & Schuster, part of CBS Corporation), Living Language (Penguin Random House, a joint venture of Pearson and Bertelsmann), McGraw-Hill Education, Duolingo, Inc., Fluenz, Busuu Ltd., Babbel (operated by Lesson Nine GmbH) and many other small and regionally-focused participants. In addition there are several competitors that are primarily focused on teaching English including Open English (Open English LLC), EF English Live and Inglés Sin Barreras.
In the literacy category, we compete primarily in the K-12 digital reading space in the U.S. with Imagine Learning, Scientific Learning, Odyssey (Compass Learning), Renaissance, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, Curriculum Associates, and iStation.
Seasonality
Our business is affected by variations in seasonal trends. Within our Enterprise & Education Language segment, sales in our education, government, and corporate sales channels are seasonally stronger in the second half of the calendar year due to purchasing and budgeting cycles. Literacy segment sales are seasonally stronger in the second and third quarters of the calendar year corresponding to the end and beginning of school district budget years. Consumer sales are affected by seasonal trends associated with the holiday shopping season. In particular, we generate a significant portion of our Consumer sales in the fourth quarter during the period beginning on Black Friday through the end of the calendar year. 
Our operating segments are affected by different sales-to-cash patterns. Consumer sales typically turn to cash more quickly than Enterprise & Education Language and Literacy sales, which tend to have longer collection cycles. Historically, in the first half of the year we have been a net user of cash and in the second half of the year we have been a net generator of cash. 
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property is critical to our success. We rely on a combination of measures to protect our intellectual property, including patents, trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights and non-disclosure and other contractual arrangements. In certain circumstances, we may sub-license our intellectual property including our trademarks and software for use in certain markets. 
We have ten U.S. patents, fourteen foreign patents and several U.S. and foreign patent applications pending that cover various aspects of our language-learning and literacy technologies.

We have registered a variety of trademarks, including our primary or house marks, Rosetta Stone, The Blue Stone Logo, Lexia Learning, Lexia, Fit Brains, and Catalyst. These trademarks are the subject of either registrations or pending applications in the U.S., as well as numerous countries worldwide where we do business. We have been issued trademark registrations for our yellow color from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. We intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks we use today and those we develop in the future. We believe that the distinctive marks that we use in connection with our solutions are important in building our brand image and distinguishing our offerings from those of our competitors. These marks are among our most valuable assets. 
In addition to our distinctive marks, we own numerous registered and unregistered copyrights, and trade dress rights, to our products and packaging. We intend to continue to strategically register copyrights in our various products. We also place significant value on our trade dress, which is the overall image and appearance of our products, as we believe that our trade dress helps to distinguish our products in the marketplace from our competitors.
Since 2006, we have held a perpetual, irrevocable and worldwide license from the University of Colorado allowing us to use speech recognition technology for language-learning solutions. Since 2014, we have also held a commercial license from the Florida State University Research Foundation allowing us to use certain computer software and technology in our literacy offerings. These types of arrangements are often subject to royalty or license fees.
We diligently protect our intellectual property through the use of patents, trademarks and copyrights and through enforcement efforts in litigation. We routinely monitor for potential infringement in the countries where we do business. In addition, our employees, contractors and other parties with access to our confidential information are required to sign agreements that prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of our proprietary rights, information and technology.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,012 total employees, consisting of 717 full-time and 295 part-time employees. We have employees in France and Spain who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that we have good relations with our employees.
