 U.S. Geothermal Inc. (the Company, we or us or words of similar import) is in the renewable green energy business. Through our subsidiary, U.S. Geothermal Inc., an Idaho corporation (Geo-Idaho, although our references to the Company include and refer to our operations through Geo-Idaho), we are engaged in the acquisition, development and utilization of geothermal resources in the Western United States and the Republic of Guatemala. Geothermal energy is the natural heat energy stored within the earths crust. In some areas of the earth, economic concentrations of heat energy result from a combination of geological conditions that allow water to penetrate into hot rocks at depth, become heated, and then circulate to a near surface environment. In these settings, commercially viable extraction of the geothermal energy and its conversion to electricity become possible and a geothermal resource is present.

Development of Business 
 U.S. Geothermal Inc. was originally incorporated on March 10, 2000 in the State of Delaware. The Company constructs, manages and operates power plants that utilize geothermal resources to produce electricity. The Companys operations have been, primarily, focused in the Western United States. 
 The Company currently owns and operates the following geothermal power plant projects: Raft River, Idaho; San Emidio, Nevada; and Neal Hot Springs, Oregon. The Company also has geothermal property interests in the Republic of Guatemala; the Geysers in California; Vale, Oregon; Crescent Valley, Nevada; Ruby Hot Springs, Nevada; Lee Hot Springs, Nevada; and Gerlach, Nevada, some of which are under development or exploration. 
 History
Geo-Idaho was formed as an Idaho corporation in February 2002 to conduct geothermal resource development.
 U.S. Cobalt Inc. entered into a merger agreement with Geo-Idaho on February 28, 2002, which was amended and restated on November 30, 2003, and closed on the reverse take-over on December 19, 2003. In accordance with the merger agreement, the Company acquired Geo-Idaho through the merger of Geo-Idaho with a subsidiary, EverGreen Power Inc., an Idaho corporation formed for that purpose. Geo-Idaho was the surviving corporation and is the subsidiary through which the Company conducts operations. As part of this acquisition, the Company name was changed to U.S. Geothermal Inc.
 Plan of Operations
Our business strategy is to identify, evaluate, acquire, develop, and operate geothermal assets and resources economically, safely and efficiently. Our management evaluates our operating projects based on revenues and expenses, and our projects under development, based on costs attributable to each project. We examine different factors when assessing projects at different stages of development or potential acquisitions, such as the internal rate of return of the investment, technical and geological matters and other relevant business considerations. 
 We intend to execute this strategy in several steps outlined below: 
 
 | Maximize Our Operations  Our operating power plants and operations team provide revenue to the Company through both power sales and Operations & Maintenance contracts. We strive to optimize plant operations through high safety standards, quality preventative maintenance programs, operator education, equipment selection and by exceeding our annual budgetary goals. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 -6- 


 | Leverage Management Team Capabilities and Experience  Our strategy is focused on the identification and acquisition of resources that can be developed in a cost-effective manner to produce attractive returns. In particular, we seek to acquire projects that have already undergone geothermal resource discovery. In addition, we intend to operate and manage construction of the projects, while using internal personnel and third-party contractors to efficiently and cost-effectively develop those resources. We believe that we have the strategic personnel in place to determine which resources provide the greatest opportunity for efficient development and operation. We have developed relationships and employed personnel that will allow us to develop and utilize geothermal resources as efficiently as possible. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | Develop Our Pipeline of Quality Projects  Our project pipeline currently consists of several projects that we believe are aligned with our growth strategy. These projects typically have consulting reports from various industry experts supporting our belief in those projects potential. We are evaluating the potential of those projects and expect to negotiate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) for power deliveries with counterparties for some of these growth opportunities. If realized, our identified project pipeline will greatly expand our renewable power generation capacity as we move forward with the development of those opportunities. 
 | Utilize Production Tax Credits, Investment Tax Credits and Other Incentives  Although geothermal power production can be cost competitive with fossil fuel power generating facilities on a life cycle cost basis, government incentives such as production tax credits (PTC) and Investment Tax Credits (ITC) available to geothermal power producers help offset the high upfront project capital cost by enhancing the project economics and attracting capital investment. For the Raft River Unit I project, we partnered with Goldman Sachs as a tax equity partner to fully utilize production tax credits available to the project. Our strategy is to structure project ownership to optimize project economics. Under current legislation, a company may elect to take 30% ITC for certain qualified investments (or the PTC) provided construction of the project was started prior to the end of 2017. We believe that the second phase of our San Emidio project, our WGP Geysers project, and our Crescent Valley project each qualify for this credit. 
 | Pursue Acquisition Strategy  The geothermal market, particularly in the United States, is fragmented and characterized by a few large players and a number of smaller ones. Geothermal exploration and development is capital intensive, technically challenging and requires long lead times before a project will produce revenue. We believe that geothermal technical and managerial talent is limited in the industry and that access to capital to develop projects will not be equally available to all participants. As a result, we believe that there will be opportunities in the future to pursue acquisitions of geothermal projects and/or geothermal development companies with attractive project pipelines. 

 -7- 


 | Evaluate Other Potential Revenue Streams from Geothermal Resources  In addition to electricity generation, we may evaluate additional applications for our geothermal resources including industrial, agriculture, and aquaculture purposes. These uses generally constitute lower temperature applications where, after driving a turbine generator, residual hot water can be cycled for secondary processes before being returned to the geothermal reservoir by injection wells, which can provide incremental revenue streams. We may evaluate the optimal use for each geothermal resource and determine whether selling heat for industrial purposes or generating and subsequently selling power to a grid will generate the highest return on the asset.

 For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company was focused on:
 
 | operating and optimizing the Neal Hot Springs, San Emidio and Raft River power plants; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | continuing detailed engineering and pursuing PPA opportunities for the WGP Geysers project; 
 | continuing permitting and engineering for the San Emidio II project; 
 | continuing the advanced resource evaluation portion of the $1.5 million SubTER grant from the Department of Energy at San Emidio and Crescent Valley; 
 | continuing engineering for the Neal Hot Springs hybrid cooling system and injection pump system; and 
 | evaluating potential new geothermal projects and acquisition opportunities. 

 The Board of Directors is focused on the strategic direction of the Company, including review of the Companys overall development plan as well as reviewing strategic alternatives. The Board has established committees to assist the Board with this process. There can be no assurance that this ongoing strategic review will result in any specific action or transaction or that any action taken or transaction we may enter into will prove to be beneficial to stockholders. 
 On January 24, 2018, U.S. Geothermal Inc. (the Company) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) by and among Ormat Nevada Inc., a Delaware corporation (Ormat), OGP Holding Corp., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ormat (Merger Sub) and the Company. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Company (the Merger), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue its corporate existence under the Delaware General Corporation Law as the surviving company in the Merger and a subsidiary of Ormat. 
 Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the Effective Time), each share of common stock, par value $0.001, of the Company (Company Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time of the Merger (other than Company Shares owned by Ormat, Merger Sub or the Company (as treasury stock or otherwise), or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, in each case, not Company Shares owned by shareholders who have exercised their rights as dissenting owners under Delaware law) will be automatically converted into the right to receive $5.45 per Company Share in cash, without interest. 
 -8- 

The Merger Agreement provides that, at the Effective Time, each of the Companys then outstanding stock options will be treated as follows: (i) the accelerated vesting and settlement of all then-outstanding Options immediately prior to and contingent on the closing of the Merger, (ii) the cash-out of such Options providing for payment of an amount equal to the excess, if any,of the Merger Consideration per Company Share over the exercise price of such Options and (iii) the cancellation, as of the Effective Time, of each Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Certain optionholders, such as directors and officers, will be required to sign an Option Holder Acknowledgement Form, attached as an exhibit to the Merger Agreement, in order to be automatically cashed-out as noted above in subsection (ii).
 The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of the Company, Ormat and Merger Sub relating to their respective businesses and organizations, in appropriate cases subject to materiality qualifiers. Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides forcustomary pre-closing covenants of the Company, including covenants relating to conducting its business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and refraining from taking certain actions without Ormats consent, covenants not to solicit proposals relating to alternative transactions or, subject to certain exceptions, enter into discussions concerning or provide information in connection with alternative transactions and covenants requiring the Companys board of directors (the Board), subject to certain exceptions, to recommend that the Company's shareholders approve the Merger Agreement. In the event that the Board receives an alternative acquisition proposal that it determines is a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) in accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company may, subject to compliance with requirements to provide notice to and a period for Ormat to match such proposal, and subject to payment of the termination fee payable by the Company to Ormat and other conditions and requirements set forth in the Merger Agreement, terminate the Merger Agreement to accept the applicable Superior Proposal. 
 The Company, Ormat and Merger Sub have agreed to use their respective commercially reasonable efforts, subject to certain exceptions, to, among other things, consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicable and make all required filings and obtain all required consents, permits, regulatory approvals and expirations or terminations of waiting periods. None of the Company, Ormat or Merger Sub is required to divest any of its businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take any other action or to agree to any limitation or restriction of any kind on its business, operations, properties or assets. 
 Consummation of the Merger is subject to various conditions, including, among others, customary conditions relating to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the requisite vote of the Company's shareholders, expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and any other applicable antitrust laws, any required approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and any other applicable filings with or authorizations, consents or waivers from third parties. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned on the other parties representations and warranties being true and correct (subject to certain materiality exceptions) and the other parties having performed in all material respects its obligations and complied in all material respects with the agreements and covenants under the Merger Agreement. The transaction is not conditioned on Ormats receipt of financing.
 -9- 

The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for each of the Company and Ormat, including, among others, if the Merger has not been consummated by May 24, 2018. Either party may also terminate the Merger Agreement if the Company's stockholder approval has not been obtained at a duly convened meeting of the Company's stockholders or an order permanently restraining, enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the Merger becomes final and non-appealable. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, generally relating to alternative acquisition proposals, an adverse change in the Boards recommendation in favor of the Merger, a knowing and intentional breach of the Company representations or warranties, or a failure by the Company to consummate the Merger when required to do so pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, the Company would be required to pay Ormat a termination fee equal to 3% of the Merger Consideration (approximately $3.2 million). Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, generally relating to a knowing and intentional breach of Ormats representations or warranties, or a failure by Ormat to consummate the Merger when required to do so pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Ormat would be required to pay the Company a reverse termination fee equal to 3% of the Merger Consideration (approximately $3.2 million).
 The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is attached as Exhibit 2.1 to the Companys Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on January 25, 2018, which is incorporated by reference herein. 
 Project Overview 
 The following is a list of projects that are in operation, under development or under exploration. Projects in operation currently have producing geothermal power plants. Projects under development have a geothermal resource discovery or may have wells in place, but require the drilling of new or additional production and injection wells in order to supply enough geothermal fluid sufficient to operate a commercial power plant. Projects under exploration do not have a geothermal resource discovery occurrence yet, but have significant thermal and other physical evidence that warrants the expenditure of capital in search of the discovery of a geothermal resource. Due to inflation and marketplace increases in the costs of labor and construction materials, estimates provided for project development costs could understate actual costs.

Projects in Operation
Although other factors may impact our operations and financial condition, including many that we do not or cannot foresee, we believe that our results of operations and financial condition for the foreseeable future will be affected by the factors discussed below. A summary of the Companys operations is as follows:
Projects in Operation

(3) | Average of 3 years generation. 
(4) | Generation eligible for full PPA price. Generation from 9.9 MW up to 14.7 MW is eligible for excess energy payment of $50 per megawatt-hour within the terms of the PPA. 

 Facility Generation
Generation from all facilities totaled 323,832 megawatt hours for 2017. For 2016, the total generation was 326,601 megawatt hours. For the fourth quarter of 2017, generation from all facilities totaled 95,417 megawatt hours compared to 97,879 megawatt hours during the same period in 2016. 
 Neal Hot Springs, Oregon
Neal Hot Springs is located in Eastern Oregon near the town of Vale, the county seat of Malheur County, and achieved commercial operation on November 16, 2012. The Neal Hot Springs facility is designed as a 22 megawatt net annual average power plant, consisting of three separate 12.2 megawatt (gross) modules, with each module having a design output of 7.33 megawatts (net) annual average based on a specific flow and temperature of geothermal brine. 
 For the fourth quarter of 2017, generation was 56,100 megawatt-hours with an average of 25.6 net megawatts per hour of operation and plant availability was 99.3% . For the same period in 2016, the plant generated 57,038 megawatt-hours with an average of 26.3 net megawatts per hour and plant availability was 98.2% . Warmer winter temperatures reduced generation during the fourth quarter of 2017. 
 The PPA for the project was signed on December 11, 2009 with the Idaho Power Company. It has a 25-year term, and a variable percentage annual price escalation. The PPA has a seasonal pricing structure that pays 120% of the average price for four months (July, August, November, December), 100% of the average price for five months (January, February, June, September, October) and 73.3% of the average price for three months (March, April, May). The annual average price paid under the PPA for 2017 is $111.83 per megawatt-hour. For 2018, the average price will increase to $114.49 per megawatt-hour. 
 -11- 

San Emidio Unit I, Nevada
The Unit I power plant at San Emidio is located approximately 100 miles north-east of Reno, Nevada near the town of Gerlach, and achieved commercial operation on May 25, 2012. The San Emidio facility is a single 14.7 megawatt (gross) module with a design output of 9 megawatts (net) annual average based on a specific flow and temperature of geothermal brine.
 For the fourth quarter of 2017, generation was 18,097 megawatt-hours with an average of 8.2 net megawatts per hour of operation and plant availability was 89.3% . For the same period in 2016, the plant generated 20,803 megawatt-hours with an average of 9.4 net megawatts per hour and plant availability was 98.2% . 
 In mid-December 2017, the plant was shut down for 7 days to repair leaks that were found in the vaporizer tubes. The damaged tubes were plugged and will be replaced during the spring 2018 scheduled maintenance outage. The pump in production well 75B-16 was shut down on December 29, 2017 after 7.8 years in service. The pump was replaced and returned to service. Standby production well 75-16 was brought on line to supplement brine flow to the plant while 75B-16 was off line. 
 On May 31, 2011, an amended and restated PPA was signed with Sierra Pacific Power Company d/b/a NV Energy for the sale of up to 10 megawatts annual average. The PPA has a 25-year term with an annual escalation rate of 1 percent. The annual average price paid under the PPA for 2017 is $93.94 per megawatt-hour. For 2018, the price will increase to $94.88 per megawatt-hour. 
 Raft River, Idaho
Raft River Energy I is located in Southern Idaho, near the town of Malta, and achieved commercial operation on January 3, 2008. The Raft River facility is a single, 18 megawatt (gross) module, with a design output of 13 megawatts (net) annual average based on a specific flow and temperature of geothermal brine.
 For the fourth quarter of 2017, generation was 21,220 megawatt-hours with an average of 10.8 net megawatts per hour of operation and plant availability was 100%. For the same period in 2016, the plant generated 20,039 megawatt-hours with an average of 9.2 net megawatt hours and plant availability was 100%. 
 Production pump RRG-7 was off line for 79 days to replace the pump, build a new pump support structure and make a repair to the surface casing. The well was shut down in late September 2017 when the pump failed after 8 years in service and was restarted in mid-December 2017. 
 Subsequent to the end of the year, the remaining 5% of the project owned by GFSF Investments I Corp, a wholly owned subsidiary of Goldman Sachs, was purchased on January 2, 2018. The purchase price was $350,000. U.S. Geothermal Inc. now owns 100% of the project. 
 Well RRG-9, which was used as part of an $11.4 million thermal stimulation grant funded primarily by the DOE, has increased injection capacity to a current level of over 1,450 gpm. This injection capacity is sufficient to provide all of the additional volume needed to accept the flow from well RRG-5 without requiring any new drilling. 
 -12- 

The PPA for the project was signed on September 24, 2007 with the Idaho Power Company and allows for the sale of up to 13 megawatts of electricity on an annual average basis. The PPA has a 25 year term with a starting average price for the year 2007 of $52.50 that escalates at 2.1% per year through 2020 and then at 0.6% per year until the end of the contract in 2034. The Idaho Power PPA has a seasonal pricing structure that pays 120% of the average price for four months (July, August, November, December), 100% of the average price for five months (January, February, June, September, October) and 73.5% of the average price for three months (March, April, May). The annual average price paid under the PPA for 2017 is $64.63 per megawatt-hour. The average price for 2018, including the projects share of the REC value, will be $74.32 per megawatt-hour.
 In addition to the price paid for energy by Idaho Power, Raft River Unit I used to receive $4.75 per megawatt-hour under a separate contract for the sale of RECs to Holy Cross Energy, a Colorado electric cooperative. As of January 2018, a new, 10-year REC contract with the Public Utility District No. 1 of Clallam County, Washington has replaced the Holy Cross Energy contract. This REC contract only includes the sale of the RECs owned by the Raft River project. Under the terms of our PPA, starting in 2018, 49% of the RECs produced will be owned by the Raft River Project, and the Idaho Power Company will own the remaining 51%.
Material Projects Under Development/Exploration
In addition to our projects in operation, we have projects under development and under exploration. Projects under development have at least a geothermal resource discovery or may have wells in place, but require the drilling of new or additional production and injection wells in order to supply enough geothermal fluid sufficient to operate a commercial power plant. Projects under exploration do not have a geothermal resource discovery occurrence yet, but have significant thermal and other physical evidence that warrants the expenditure of capital in search of the discovery of a geothermal resource. Due to inflation and marketplace increases in the costs of labor and construction materials, estimates of property development costs may be low. 
 A summary of projects under development and under exploration is as follows:

Binary Cycle Geothermal Power Plants 
 In a binary cycle geothermal power plant hot water is produced to a piping and gathering system from wells drilled into the geothermal reservoir. The hot water flows, with to a heat exchanger called a vaporizer where it vaporizes a secondary working fluid, with its heat extracted, causing the original hot water to become cool. All of the cooled water is then pumped to injection wells where it is injected back into the reservoir to help recharge the geothermal reservoir. The vaporized working fluid passes through a turbine which drives an electrical generator that is tied into the electrical transmission grid. Upon discharging the turbine the secondary working fluid is condensed before piping it back to the vaporizer where the process is repeated. 
 -14- 


Dry Steam Geothermal Power Plants 
 An example of a vapor dominated geothermal system is at The Geysers in central California. Dry super-heated steam is produced from wells through a piping system and run directly through a turbine. The turbine drives an electrical generator that delivers power to the electrical transmission grid. Steam discharges from the turbine into a condenser where it is condensed forming water. The water is pumped to a cooling tower where it can be used as water for the cooling process. The cooled water from the cooling tower is recycled back to the condenser to repeat the process. Any excess water from the cooling tower is pumped through a piping system to injection wells where it is injected back into the reservoir which helps to recharge the geothermal reservoir. 
 
-15- 

Flash Geothermal Power Plants 
 In hot water geothermal systems (temperatures greater than approximately 400 degrees Fahrenheit), flash production systems are often used. The hot water is produced from wells drilled into the geothermal reservoir. The hot water from the various production wells is piped to a flash tank where the pressure is reduced. The reduction in pressure in the flash tank causes part of the hot water to flash to form steam and part to remain as water. The flash tank also acts a separator, separating the steam from the water. The hot water separated from the steam is pumped through a pipeline system to injection wells and injected into the reservoir for reservoir recharge. The steam coming off the flash tank/separator is piped directly to a turbine where the process is identical to that used for dry steam geothermal power plants. 
Neal Hot Springs  Upgrade Projects
At our operating Neal Hot Springs project, there are approximately 3.9 megawatts of annual average generation that are available under the terms of the PPA. Each megawatt of increased generation is worth approximately $990,000 per year at the 2019 contract price of $116.45.
 The decision was made to delay the hybrid cooling system until 2019 to allow additional time to firm up the water supply and complete the final design of the cooling system. The updated design for the hybrid system would have a single cooling tower with heat exchangers located at all three units. Cooling water would come from both fresh groundwater wells and treated geothermal water. The engineering for the hybrid system is completed to the bid level and will be further refined during the year. Water cooling will increase the efficiency of the plant during the summer period when generation is suppressed by high ambient temperatures. 
 A second upgrade project under evaluation and engineering is the addition of two injection pumps that would both reduce the parasitic load in the plant, and allow an increase in the pumping capacity of the production pumps that feed hot fluid to the plant. The estimated capital costs is $1.6 million and the system could be on-line by the 4th quarter 2018.
 San Emidio I, Nevada  Upgrade Project
At our operating San Emidio I project, we will move forward with an enhancement program to increase generation from the power plant by drilling a new production well in the Southwest Zone and delivering that fluid to the San Emidio I plant. There are approximately 1.5 megawatts annual average that remains available under the terms of the PPA at full price, and several more megawatts that could be sold at the excess energy price. One megawatt at full contract price is worth approximately $800,000 in additional annual revenue and each megawatt of excess energy generated above 10 megawatts, but below 14.7 megawatts is worth approximately $425,000.

The drilling permit was received from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) in January 2018 to drill production well 25A-21. A permit from the State of Nevada is pending. The new production well will twin observation well 25-21, which intersected a high temperature, high permeability structure in the Southwest Zone. The well will be connected to the Phase I plant with a new pipeline, and is now planned to provide up to 2,000 gallons per minute of 320°F fluid. Starting production from the Southwest Zone in 2018 will provide a long-term flow test of the Southwest Zone that will be critical to understand its full development potential. 
 Raft River, Idaho  Upgrade Project
The addition of production well RRG-5 increased the average generation from the Raft River plant by 1.6 net megawatts in 2017. Due to the positive response from the wellfield, which showed a minimal decrease in fluid levels, a study to increase the capacity of production pump RRG-4 in 2018 was completed. The upgrade project would consist of adding additional bowls to the pump and setting the pump deeper in the well to produce approximately 400-500 gpm more fluid to the plant. The pump in RRG-4 has been in service for 10 years and was already scheduled for replacement in 2018.
 This upgrade would result in an estimated generation increase of approximately 0.5 net megawatts annual average. In 2019, the first full year of production, the energy plus renewable energy credit value will be $75.71 per megawatt hour. If the full amount of new generation is realized, it would result in approximately $600,000 of additional annual revenue. Approximately half of this revenue is expected to be realized in 2018. 
 WGP Geysers, California  Development Project
The WGP Geysers project is located in the broader Geysers geothermal field located approximately 75 miles north of San Francisco, California. The broader Geysers geothermal field is the largest producing geothermal field in the world generating more than 850 megawatts of power for more than 30 years. Acquisition of the WGP Geysers Project from Ram Power was completed on April 22, 2014 for $6.4 million. We expect that approximately 75% of the development may be funded by non-recourse project debt, with the remainder funded through equity financing. Due to the lapse in the Federal Investment Tax Credit program for geothermal power generation and the delay for start of construction, we do not believe that the project currently qualifies for the 30% ITC or PTC. Several bills have been introduced in Congress that could reauthorize the ITC/PTC for geothermal power generation, but it is unknown when that action might take place. 
 Detailed engineering of the 28.8 net megawatt power plant is nearly complete. Our engineers and consultants are working in concert with our EPC contractors to examine all aspects of the construction cycle with a focus on reducing construction costs. The hybrid cooling design will dramatically increase the volume of water available for injection back into the reservoir, which will result in increased power generation over the life of the project. Traditional water cooled geothermal steam plants re-inject approximately 20 to 25% of the water that is extracted from the steam, while our current hybrid design may re-inject approximately 80% more of the water. This higher injection rate will provide long term, stable steam production, and will result in increased power generation over the life of the project.

The Conditional Use Permit from Sonoma County, which approves the construction plan for the WGP Geysers power plant, was received on December 16, 2016 and is active for 10 years. Combined with the Large Generator Interconnection Agreement (LGIA) that was received from the California Independent System Operator and Pacific Gas & Electric, this completes the long lead permits and agreements that are needed for the project. Once final engineering design is finished, and a PPA is executed, an air quality permit and building permit will be needed before on site construction will begin.
 We terminated the LGIA the project had with the California Independent System Operator and Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). The termination was driven by various milestone dates that were not achievable because of the lack of a PPA and the lack of an easement for the 1.7 mile long transmission line from the plant to the substation. This LGIA allowed the project to connect to the transmission grid and deliver up to 35 megawatts of energy. The Company paid the total interconnection cost of $1.9 million to the grid operator for their substation work. After termination, the remaining balance of the interconnection cost is expected to be reimbursed to the Company during the first quarter of 2018.
 We are now considering an alternative interconnection method which will trigger additional interconnection studies and extend the time required for interconnection into the transmission grid. A ring bus type substation located on the plant site will be required if the easement cannot be acquired. The additional cost associated with the ring bus type substation is currently included in the estimated capital cost for the project. 
 Based on flow test data generated from well flow testing performed in mid-2015, a third party expert reported in September 2015, that the four production wells already drilled are capable of delivering an initial capacity of 28.1 MW (gross) or 25.4 MW (net) based on current power plant steam conversion rates from a detailed design for a 28.8 MW (net) power plant. These tests show the wells would initially produce a combined total of 458,000 pounds per hour. Using the average steam production rate from these wells and an assumed interference factor of 30%, the third party expert estimates that an additional two to three production wells would be needed to support the long-term operation of a 28.8 MW (net) plant. Using the large data base from the surrounding Geysers geothermal field, the historic WGP well production data, and the 2015 flow test information, a numerical reservoir model has been developed to provide the final well requirements and targeting for injection sites.
 We continue to submit proposals when Request for Offers are released by organizations seeking renewable energy and have continued bilateral discussions with several potential purchasers. In Fall 2017, we adopted a revised, more aggressive pricing structure when submitting bids. Despite the new pricing structure, to date, the WGP Geysers project has not been selected to negotiate a PPA. Purchasers have expressed interest in renewable, base load power to replace fossil fuel based power generation that is being phased out of some of their portfolios and to stabilize and balance intermittent resources already in their portfolios.

San Emidio Phase II, Nevada  Development Project
The Phase II expansion is dependent on successful development of additional production and injection well capacity. We expect that approximately 75% of the Phase II development may be funded by non-recourse project debt, with the remainder funded through equity financing. We believe the project qualifies for the 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit (or Production Tax Credit) which, when monetized, can meet most of the equity financing requirements.
 A power plant development permit application for the San Emidio Phase II project was submitted to the BLM on March 29, 2017. The application provides for the installation of three power plant units and up to 20 wells and related infrastructure needed to develop the project. It is expected that the evaluation by the BLM will take 12 months or longer to complete. All of the required cultural and biological surveys were completed for the plant and wellfield area during the second quarter, with no unique or notable sites or species identified. Archeological surveys of the power line that will interconnect the plant to the NV Energy substation were conducted during the 4th quarter 2017. 
 During September 2017, a 59-hour, multi-well flow test was conducted using three of the recently drilled Southwest Zone wells. Total flow from the wells was approximately 1,590 gpm. Testing included a step rate program with four-hour increments, whereby one well, then two wells, and finally all three wells were flowed for the 51-hour duration of the test. Flowing temperature from the three wells ranged from 319°F to 325°F. Pressure was also monitored on the flowing wells, which experienced pressure drawdown from 7.7 psi to 43.0 psi. A monitoring well in the Southwest Zone, located 1,700 feet from the nearest flowing well, had a pressure drawdown of 4.3 psi. Five additional monitoring wells located in the Phase I reservoir area recorded pressure changes of 0.9 psi to 3.2 psi. 
 These results continue to support the previously announced Probability Power Density model resource estimate of 25.9 megawatts at a 90% probability. The 50% probability level estimate of 47 megawatts remains unchanged because all of these wells are inside the originally defined Southwest Zone resource area. Future drilling to expand the resource beyond the currently defined area is planned but cannot be implemented until the Environmental Assessment for the Phase II power plant development is approved by the BLM. 
 An application for a LGIA was filed with NV Energy on June 26, 2017. The LGIA would provide for the interconnection of 45 megawatts of generation capacity. Permitting for the transmission line, which is approximately 57 miles long, may extend the time required to interconnect the project and could impact the currently projected commercial operation date. The LGIA was accepted as complete by NV Energy and entered the first step in the FERC mandated evaluation process on October 1, 2017. The first phase study, a System Impact Study (“SIS”), was received on January 29, 2018. The SIS that was presented indicated potentially higher transmission costs, but did not study the correct interconnection parameters and is currently undergoing a re-study by NV Energy. A second phase study, the Facilities Study, will be required to be completed before an interconnection agreement can be reached.
 The three power plant equipment packages that were purchased in 2016 are available to provide this project with the major, long lead equipment requirements for 25-35 net megawatts annual average (depending upon cooling system used). The increased San Emidio II reservoir capacity with a 320°F+ temperature fits the design range of the equipment. These new, unused components represent approximately 70% of the equipment needed for a complete facility similar to the Companys Neal Hot Springs operation.

In July 2016, the Company was awarded a $1.5 million DOE cost share grant under the Development of Technologies for Sensing, Analyzing, and Utilizing Novel Subsurface Signals in Support of the Subsurface Technology and Engineering (SubTER) Crosscut Initiative. The program approved under the grant includes using new subsurface imaging technologies at both San Emidio and Crescent Valley to identify fluid flow paths in the geothermal resource. The primary data collection phase of the program, which included passive seismic and magnetotelluric (MT) stations, was completed at San Emidio in December 2016. A second phase of data collection was required to fill in and replace a limited number of MT stations at San Emidio, and was completed in the third quarter. Final interpretation of the geophysical data is currently underway.
 After all data is compiled and interpreted, if viable drilling targets have been identified, DOE may approve a second phase of the grant program to confirm the findings by drilling. There is no assurance the DOE will approve the drilling phase of the grant, even if viable targets are identified. The total program cost is estimated to be $1.9 million and we anticipate the Company cost share would be $400,000. 
 El Ceibillo, Republic of Guatemala  Development Project
A geothermal energy rights concession, located 14 kilometers southwest of Guatemala City, was awarded to U.S. Geothermal Guatemala S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in April 2010. The concession agreement contains a schedule that requires the development and construction of a power plant. In July 2015, the Guatemalan Ministry of Energy and Mines approved a modified construction schedule that extended the development and construction period to June 1, 2018. There are 24,710 acres (100 square kilometers) in the concession, which is at the center of the Aqua and Pacaya twin volcano complex. 
 On September 28, 2017, U.S. Geothermal Guatemala S.A. was notified that it has been awarded a $3.42 (€2.91) million grant from the German Development Facility for Latin America for further development drilling at the El Ceibillo project. The grant represents an approximate 40% cost share for drilling up to three production wells, with a total estimated program cost of $8.81 (€7.486) million. If the GDF funding is used on the project and the power plant is constructed, the grant would be converted into a loan. The German Development Bank may consider financing the entire project if it moves to production. The next phase of work for the project is being considered by the management team as 2018 budgets are being developed. 
 On December 29, 2017 we were notified that the US Trade Development Agency had approved the grant for a feasibility study at El Ceibillo valued at $825,319. The study is being led by Power Engineers of Hailey, Idaho and a consortium of professional geothermal contractors. It is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2018. All of the proceeds from the grant are paid to the contractors at defined milestones. 
 A production well, EC-5, was drilled in August 2016 to a depth of 1,450 feet (442 meter and intersected a high permeability zone at 1,299 feet (396 meters). EC-5 underwent a series of flow tests, with field wide monitoring, beginning on September 5, 2016 and ran until September 13, 2016. Data was collected from three monitoring wells during the test (EC-2A, EC-3, and EC-4) to provide pressure data for the reservoir model. Fluid samples taken at the end of the flow test indicate a potential reservoir temperature of 450 to 523°F (232 to 273°C).
 -20- 

With the shallow, commercial resource now outlined, a deeper well has been sited to test the producing structure down dip from well EC-5 to a projected depth of 1,970 to 2,300 feet (600-800 meters). A deeper intersection in the reservoir could increase the reservoir capacity and production temperature and change the design of the power plant. Well EC-1, which was drilled in 2013 to a depth of 5,650 feet (1,722 meters) found a measured bottom-hole temperature of 526°F (274°C), but did not intersect a commercial zone of permeability. The comparative geology between EC-5 and EC-1 suggests a fault or other structure feeding the reservoir may be located in the area between the two wells. 
 Expenditures at El Ceibillo are being carefully controlled until we see evidence that the energy market is advancing in Guatemala. On January 10, 2017, the Guatemalan government, through the National Electrical Energy Commission (COMISIÓN NACIONAL DE ENERG¥A ELÉCTRICACNEE), announced that it is preparing to issue a Request For Proposal (RFP) for 420 megawatts of power, of which 40 megawatts is to be reserved specifically for geothermal energy. The RFP was not issued in 2017 and there is still no indication of when that RFP may be issued. When the RFP is issued, we expect to bid the El Ceibillo project into the process. 
 Raft River Phase II, Idaho
In 2011, the Raft River Phase II project was awarded an $11.4 million cost-shared, thermal stimulation program grant from the DOE with the University of Utah Energy and Geoscience Institute as the project lead. The goal of the project is to create an Enhanced Geothermal System (EGS) by creating thermal fractures and developing a corresponding increase in permeability in the low permeability rock. Well RRG-9 was made available for the program and the first stage of injection into the well began in June 2013.
 Initially the well was only capable of receiving 20 gpm of water due to the low permeability of the rock. After several moderate pressure stimulations, the injection of cold power plant discharge fluid first began in June 2015 and has continued to date. The lower temperature fluid causes thermal fracturing within the higher temperature host rock of the reservoir. At the current plant generation level, the flow into the well has continued to increase and is now approximately 1,572 gallons per minute. 
 Well RRG-9 continues to be used temporarily for injection from the Raft River Energy I power plant as an extension of the DOE EGS program. The Companys contributions for the thermal stimulation program are made in-kind by the use of the RRG-9 well, well field data provided by the Company, and through ongoing labor for monitoring support. 
 The development and construction of a Phase II project at Raft River is dependent upon additional drilling and the availability of a PPA.

Crescent Valley, Nevada
The Crescent Valley prospect consists of approximately 21,300 acres (33.3 square miles) of private and Federal geothermal leases. It is located in Eureka County, Nevada, approximately 15 miles south of the Beowawe geothermal power plant and about 33 miles southeast of Battle Mountain. The project was acquired as part of the Earth Power Resources merger which was completed in December 2014. 
 In light of federal legislation that extended the qualification for the 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit to projects that began construction prior to December 31, 2014, drilling of the first production/injection well CVP-001 (67-3) was initiated in December of 2014, following completion of gravity surveys, and analysis of prior temperature gradient drilling data. Well CVP-001 was completed on March 27, 2015 to a depth of 2,746 feet. The well exhibited modest permeability with a flowing temperature of 213°F, which makes the well suited for duty as an injection well.
 The SubTER program, approved under the DOE grant awarded in July 2016, includes using new subsurface technologies at both San Emidio and Crescent Valley to identify fluid flow paths in the geothermal resource. The passive seismic data collection phase of the program was completed at Crescent Valley in December of 2016. A magnetotelluric (MT) survey was completed during the third quarter 2017. The data is being interpreted to develop a 3D map to help identify future drilling targets. The details of this award are discussed in the San Emidio Phase II project discussion above.
Employees
At December 31, 2017, the Company had 48 full-time and one part time employees (14 administrative and project development, and 34 field and plant operations) in the United States, with another 9 employees in Guatemala. The Company continuously considers acquisition opportunities, and if the Company is successful in making acquisitions, additional management and administrative staff may be added. 
 The Company did not experience any labor disputes or labor stoppages during the current fiscal year. 
 Principal Products
The principal product is based upon activities related to the production of electrical power from the utilization of the Companys geothermal resources. The primary product will be the direct sale of power generated by our interests in our geothermal power plants. Currently, our principal revenues consist of energy sales and energy credit sales. All power plants currently in operation, as well as all sites under exploration or development, are sites located in the Western United States or in the Republic of Guatemala in Central America.

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Geothermal energy is natural heat energy stored within the Earths crust at economically accessible depth. In some areas of the Earth, economic concentrations of heat energy result from a combination of geological conditions that allow water to penetrate into hot rocks at depth, become heated, and then circulate to a near surface environment. In these settings, commercially viable extraction of the geothermal energy and its conversion to electricity become possible and a geothermal resource is present. 
 There are four major components (or factors) to a geothermal resource:
 
1. | Heat source and temperature  The economic viability of a geothermal resource is related to the amount of heat generated. The higher the temperature, the more valuable the geothermal resource. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Fluid  A geothermal resource is commercially viable only when the system contains water and/or steam as a medium to transfer the heat energy to the surface. 
3. | Permeability  The fluid present underground must be able to move. In general, significant porosity and permeability within the rock formation are needed to create a viable reservoir. 
4. | Depth  The cost of development increases with depth, as do resource temperatures. The proximity of the reservoir to the surface is therefore a key factor in the economic valuation of a geothermal resource. 

 Electrical power is directly produced through the utilization of geothermal resources; however, these resources are not a direct component of the final product. 
 Unless major geological changes occur that impact the geothermal reservoirs, the condition of the existing resources is expected to remain relatively consistent over time. 
 Significant Government Permits
 The Company maintains all permits necessary for operating its three plants located in Idaho, Nevada and Oregon. In addition, in December 2016 the Company received the Sonoma County Conditional Use Permit required for construction and operations of the WGP Geysers project. 
 Neal Hot Springs, Oregon. The Neal Hot Springs project has four primary permits governing power plant operations. The permits include: 
 
1. | Geothermal Well Permits issued by the Department of Geology. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | A Right-of-Way issued by the Bureau of Land Management. 
3. | A Conditional Use Permit issued by the Malheur County Commission. 
4. | Underground Injection Control Permit issued by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality. 

 -23- 

San Emidio, Nevada. The San Emidio project has five primary permits governing power plant operations. The permits include: 
 
1. | Geothermal well permits issued by the Nevada Division of Minerals. 
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | A Special Use Permit issued by the Washoe County Board of Commissioners. 
3. | An Air Quality Permit to Operate from Washoe County. 
4. | A Surface Discharge Permit from Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. 
5. | An Underground Injection Permit from Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. 

 Raft River, Idaho. The Raft River project has three primary permits governing power plant operations. The permits include: 
 
1. | Geothermal well permits issued by the Idaho Department of Water Resources. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | A Conditional Use Permit issued by the Cassia County Planning and Zoning Commission. 
3. | A Wastewater Reuse Permit issued by the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality. 

 WGP Geysers, California. Western GeoPower had previously been issued all necessary permits for construction and operation of up to a 38.5 megawatt geothermal power plant. The Sonoma County Conditional Use Permit administratively expired in 2015. A new Conditional Use was issued in December 2016 for an initial term of 10 years including administrative extensions of 5 years. The primary permits include: 

1. | Geothermal well permits for production and injection wells issued by the California Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | A Conditional Use Permit that has been issued by the Sonoma County. 
3. | Air Quality Permit to Construct issued by the Northern Sonoma Air Quality Board. 

 Seasonality of Business
The Company has been producing energy revenues under the terms of three PPAs. Two of these contracts specify favorable rate periods and all three plants experience changes in levels of production through the year. The Raft River Energy I LLC (Raft River, Idaho) and USG Oregon LLC (Neal Hot Springs, Oregon) contracts pay higher rates in the months of July/August and November/December. Energy production can be influenced by the seasonal temperatures. The Companys binary geothermal plants can operate more efficiently in cooler temperatures. Cooler temperatures facilitate the cooling process of the secondary fluid that is used to power the turbines. The Neal Hot Springs plant, since it utilizes air cooling rather than water cooling, is impacted more in the summer (lower generation) than the Raft River or San Emidio plants. Neal Hot Springs produces higher generation in the winter. Drilling and other construction activities can be negatively impacted by inclement weather that can occur, primarily, during the winter months.
 -24- 

Industry Practices/Needs for Working Capital
 The Company is heavily involved in exploration and development operations. Once the decision is made to construct a project, high levels of working capital are committed, either directly or indirectly to the construction efforts. After a plant becomes commercially operational and the necessary operating reserves have been funded, the needs for working capital are typically low. The Company is expecting to be significantly involved in exploration and development activities for the next 5 to 10 years. 
 Dependence on a Few Customers
Ultimately, the market for electrical power is vast; however, the numbers of entities that can physically, logistically and economically purchase the commodity in large quantities are limited. The Companys primary revenues originate from energy sales and the sale of energy credits. Currently, the Company generates energy revenues and energy credits from three sources. Idaho Power Company purchases energy generated by both Raft River Energy I LLC and USG Oregon LLC. NV Energy purchases energy from USG Nevada LLC. As of January 2018, energy credits earned by Raft River plant are sold to the Public Utility District No. 1 of Clallam County, Washington. Under the current PPAs, energy credits that are earned by USG Oregon LLC and USG Nevada LLC plants are bundled with energy sales. Based upon current operations and expected project completions, it is expected that the Company will have a small number of direct customers that may amount to less than 10 over the next 5 to 10 years. 
 Competitive Conditions
Although the market for different forms of energy is large and dominated by very powerful players, we perceive our industrial competition to be independent power producers and in particular those producers who provide green renewable power. Our definition of green power is electricity derived from a source that does not pollute the air, water or earth. Sources of green power, in addition to geothermal, include wind, solar, biomass and run-of-the river hydroelectric. A number of states have instituted renewable portfolio standards (RPS) that require utilities and retail sellers of electricity to purchase a minimum percentage of their power from renewable sources. For example, RPS statutes in California require 50% by 2030, Oregon requires 50% by 2040 and Nevada requires 25% by 2015. According to the Department of Energys Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy department, approximately 38 states nationwide have established renewable portfolio standards or goals encouraging the procurement of green, renewable power. As a result, we believe green power is an important sub-market in the broader electric market, in which many power purchasers are increasing or committing to increase their investments. Accordingly, the conventional energy producers do not provide direct competition. 
 In the Pacific Northwest there are currently only two commercial geothermal facilities, both operated by the Company. There are a number of wind farms, as well as biomass and run-of-the river hydroelectric facilities. However, the Company believes that the combination of greater reliability and the baseload generation profile provided by geothermal power, with access to infrastructure for deliverability, and a low "full life" cost of power will allow geothermal to successfully compete for long term PPAs.

 Environmental Compliance
Geothermal drilling, construction and power plant operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental requirements and construction oversight. Applicable laws may include but are not limited to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Endangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, state specific geothermal drilling rules, state and federal injection well requirements and standards and local building codes. 
 Prior to acquiring an existing geothermal development, USG retains an independent, licensed engineer or geologist to conduct an Environmental Site Assessment and evaluate the property for recognized environmental conditions that could result in regulatory and financial liabilities being passed to U.S. Geothermal Inc. or our subsidiaries.
 Our geothermal operations involve significant quantities of geothermal brine that is returned to the local subsurface, geologic formation. We also use isopentane and R-134A refrigerant working fluids, and numerous industrial lubricants that are defined by state regulatory agencies as contaminants if released or spilled. We are not aware of any mismanagement of these materials and we are required to promptly report any release of specified volumes of oil, lubricants, and chemicals used in our operations. 
 The requisite approvals and permits for our operations have been independently reviewed and verified prior to obtaining project financing. Independent legal reviews have verified that USG and our subsidiary companies are operated in accordance with applicable laws. Existing laws and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted, or new laws and regulations may become applicable to us. Under those circumstances we work with the appropriate agency or entity to ensure that our operations remain in compliance with the applicable rules. As of the date of this memorandum, all of the permits and approvals required to operate our plants have been obtained and are valid.

Neal Hot Springs, Oregon
The Neal Hot Springs project is situated approximately 12 miles west of Vale, Oregon. There are two nearby residents; both are family of JR Land & Livestock, our primary lessor. There are no unique plant or animal communities in the area and no unique cultural or environmental constraints. 
 Because the power plant is air-cooled the only environmental reporting required is a monthly production and injection report and an annual water quality summary. The reports are filed with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality and Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries. Bi-annual water monitoring has been conducted since 2008 and will continue throughout the life of the project. Energy generation reports are filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on a quarterly basis. An independent legal team has reviewed all regulatory requirements, permits and approvals for the project.
 Adjoining rangelands are privately and federally managed and there are no rangeland or cropland management obligations. 
 The Neal project is in compliance with all environmental permitting, monitoring and reporting requirements and has received no formal or informal notices from any local, state, or federal agency. 
 San Emidio, Nevada
The San Emidio project is located approximately 14 miles south of Gerlach Nevada. The nearest residence is over four miles from the plant site. 
 The San Emidio staff files monthly, quarterly and annual water reports with the Nevada Department of Environmental Protection and Nevada Department of Water Resources. Similar to other projects San Emidios monthly geothermal production and injection volumes are submitted the Nevada Division of Minerals and Nevada Division of Environmental Protection. Water quality reporting is also submitted regularly to the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection.
 San Emidio is in compliance with all environmental permitting, monitoring and reporting requirements and has received no formal or informal notices from any local, state, or federal agency. 
 Raft River, Idaho
The Raft River project is located approximately 12 miles south of Malta, Idaho in a rural agricultural area with the nearest residence approximately two miles from the plant site. There are no unique plants or animal communities in the area and no unique cultural or environmental constraints. 
 Wastewater reuse requires bi-annual ground water monitoring at six locations, monthly monitoring of the cooling water and annual reporting. Water quality data is collected a minimum of twice annually. Monthly production and injection reports are filed with the Idaho Department of Water Resources, and land application and cooling water quality reports are filed with the Idaho Department of Environmental Quality and Idaho Department of Water Resources annually. The Projects private lands are managed on an ongoing basis for weed control, water management, irrigation, and fencing infrastructure.

Governmental Approvals and Regulations
 The geothermal energy industry in the United States is regulated by federal, state and local agencies and commissions. Those agencies and commissions regulate geothermal drilling, power generation activities and environmental protection through permitting, licensing and bonding requirements. The following information is a general summary of the electric utility industry and applicable regulations in the United States and is not a full statement of the law or all issues pertaining to electric industry requirements.
 Regulatory oversight of the industry can be broadly divided between rules governing geothermal exploration and rules governing actual energy generation, power sales and delivery. Geothermal fluid production is regulated under federal and state rules and regulations that require permits for drilling operations, geothermal fluid production and injection, and well abandonment. Prior to drilling agencies will review plans and ensure that natural resource values such as air, water, wildlife and vegetation are protected. Geothermal energy generation is regulated under federal, state and local rules and regulations. Permits are required for power plant construction and operation and ensure that a project site is suitable and that natural resource values and community concerns, if any, are evaluated and mitigated during the planning and design phase. 
 Federal Electric Utility Industry Regulation. Electricity production and public utilities are regulated by both the federal government and state utility commissions. State utility commissions traditionally exercise their jurisdiction over an electric utilitys retail operations. There are two primary pieces of federal legislation that have governed public utilities since the 1930s, the Federal Power Act (FPA) and Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA). These statutes have been amended and supplemented by subsequent legislation, including Public Utility Regulatory Protection Act (PURPA), the Energy Policy Act of 1992, and Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005). 
 Federal Power Act. Pursuant to the FPA the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has exclusive jurisdiction over the rates for most wholesale sales of electricity and transmission in interstate commerce. These rates may be based on a cost of service approach or may be determined on a market basis through competitive bidding or negotiation. FERC's regulations under PURPA exempt owners of small power production Qualifying Facilities that use geothermal resources as their primary source and other Qualifying Facilities that are 30 megawatts or under in size from many provisions of the FPA. 
 Under the FPA and FERCs regulations, the wholesale sale of power at market-based or cost-based rates requires that the seller have authorization issued by FERC to sell power at wholesale pursuant to a FERC-accepted rate schedule. FERC grants market-based rate authorization based on several criteria, including a showing that the seller and its affiliates lack market power in generation and transmission, that the seller and its affiliates cannot erect other barriers to market entry and that there is no opportunity for abusive transactions involving regulated affiliates of the seller. All of the Companys facilities are qualifying facilities and have been granted market-based rate authority to make wholesale sales of electrical energy by FERC. For the Neal Hot Springs power plant, USG Oregon files electronic quarterly reports of the contract and transaction data.

Energy Policy Act of 2005. EPAct 2005 contains provisions to prohibit the manipulation of the electric energy and natural gas markets and increase the ability of FERC to enforce and promote compliance with the statutes, orders, rules, and regulations that FERC administers. To implement the market manipulation provision of EPAct 2005, FERC amended its regulations to prohibit a company, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas, electric energy, or transportation or transmission services subject to FERCs jurisdiction, from (1) using or employing any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, (2) declaring any untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or (3) engaging in any act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The EPAct 2005 made a number of other changes to laws affecting the regulation of electricity. These include, but are not limited to, giving FERC explicit authority to proscribe and enforce rules governing market transparency, giving FERC authority to oversee and enforce electric reliability standards, requiring FERC to promulgate rules providing for incentive ratemaking to encourage investments that promote transmission reliability and reduce congestion, giving FERC certain siting authority for transmission lines in critical transmission corridors, requiring FERC to promulgate rules granting incentives for transmission owners to join Regional Transmission Organizations, authorizing FERC to require unregulated utilities to provide open access transmission, and ensuring that load serving entities can retain transmission rights necessary to serve native load requirements. EPAct 2005 promulgated PUHCA 2005, which repeals PUHCA 1935, effective as of February 8, 2006. 
 Public Utility Holding Company Act. Under PUHCA 2005, the books and records of a utility holding company, its affiliates, associate companies, and subsidiaries are subject to FERC and state commission review with respect to transactions that are subject to the jurisdiction of either FERC or the state commission or costs incurred by a jurisdictional utility in the same holding company system. However, if a company is a utility holding company solely with respect to Qualifying Facilities, exempt wholesale generators, or foreign utility companies, it will not be subject to review of books and records by FERC under PUHCA 2005. Qualifying Facilities that make only wholesale sales of electricity are not subject to state commissions rate, financial, and organizational regulations and, therefore, would not be subject to any review of their books and records by state commissions pursuant to PUHCA 2005 as long as the Qualifying Facility is not part of a holding company system that includes a utility subject to regulation in that state.
 Our power plants are Qualifying Facilities that make only wholesale sales of electricity and are not subject to rate, financial and organizational regulations that are otherwise applicable to electric utilities in those states. The power plants each sell their electrical output under power purchase agreements to an electric utility company. The utilities are regulated by their respective state public utilities commissions. Neither USG nor our subsidiaries are considered utility holding companies under FPA, FERC, the EPAct2005, or PUHCA2005 and those regulations have had no direct adverse impact on our ability to develop geothermal resources or deliver power under our contracts.

Geothermal Development Concession in Guatemala. The following summary of certain aspects of the electric industry in Guatemala should not be considered a full statement of the laws of Guatemala or all of the issues pertaining thereto. 
 In Guatemala, the General Electricity Law of 1996, Decree 93-96, created a wholesale electricity market and established a new regulatory framework for the electricity sector. The law created a regulatory commission, the CNEE, and a new wholesale power market administrator, the AMM, for the regulation and administration of the sector. The AMM is a private not-for-profit entity. The CNEE functions as an independent agency under the Ministry of Energy and Mines and is in charge of regulating, supervising, and controlling compliance with the electricity law, overseeing the market and setting rates for transmission services, and distribution to medium and small customers. All distribution companies must supply electricity to such customers pursuant to long-term contracts with electricity generators. Large customers can contract directly with the distribution companies, electricity generators or power marketers, or buy energy in the spot market. Guatemala has approved a Law of Incentives for the Development of Renewable Energy Power plants, Decree 52-2003, in order to promote the development of renewable energy power plants. This law provides certain benefits to companies utilizing renewable energy, including a 10-year exemption from corporate income tax and an import tax exemption for generation equipment, transmission lines and substation equipment. In September 2008, CNEE issued a resolution which approved the Technical Norms for the Connection, Operation, Control and Commercialization of the Renewable Distributed Generation and Self-producers Users with exceeding amounts of energy. This technical norm was created to regulate all aspects of generation, connection, operation, control and commercialization of electric energy produced with renewable sources to promote and facilitate the installation of new generation plants, and to promote the connection of existing generation plants which have exceeding amounts of electric energy for commercialization. It is applicable to projects with a capacity of up to 5 megawatts. 
 Environmental Credits
In the past several years, there has been increased demand for energy generated from geothermal resources in the United States as production costs for electricity generated from geothermal resources have become competitive relative to fossil fuel generation. This is partly due to newly enacted legislative and regulatory incentives, such as production tax credits and state renewable portfolio standards. State renewable portfolio standards laws require that an increasing percentage of the electricity supplied by electric utility companies operating in states with such standards will be derived from renewable energy resources until certain pre-established goals are met. We expect increasing demand for energy generated from geothermal and other renewable resources in the United States as additional states adopt or extend renewable portfolio standards.
 As a green power producer, environmental-related credits, such as renewable energy credits or carbon credits, are also available for sale to power companies (to allow them to meet their green power requirements) or to businesses which produce carbon based pollution. In all of the Companys projects, these credits have been sold separately, or bundled with the electricity to provide an additional source of revenue.
 -32- 

We expect the following key incentives to influence our results of operations:
 Production Tax Credits and Investment Tax Credits. A PTC provides project owners with a federal tax credit for the first ten years of plant operation. The PTC enhances the annual revenues of the projects by as much as 25 percent per year for the first 10 years. Facilities that begin construction after December 31, 2016 will not be eligible to use this production tax credit. The federal production tax credit available for geothermal energy in 2014 was 2.3 cents per kilowatt-hour. Alternatively, certain projects under construction before the end of 2016, are eligible to elect to take a 30% ITC in lieu of the PTC. The ITC may be taken after the plant has gone into operation and may be monetized. Both PTC and ITC credits require a tax equity partner to monetize. 
 The WGP Geysers project, San Emidio II project, and the Crescent Valley project all began construction prior to December 31, 2014, and the Company believes all three projects currently qualify for the 30% ITC in lieu of the PTC. 
 Renewable Energy Credits. Renewable Energy Certificates, or RECs, are tradable environmental commodities that represent proof that one megawatt-hour of electricity was generated from an eligible renewable energy resource. A renewable energy provider is credited with one REC for every 1,000 kilowatt-hours or one megawatt-hour of electricity it produces. The electrical energy is fed into the electrical grid and the accompanying REC can either be delivered to the purchaser of the power (bundled) or can be sold on the open market providing the renewable energy producer with an additional source of income. 
 On July 29, 2006, the Company signed a $4.6 million renewable energy credits purchase and sales agreement with Holy Cross Energy, a Colorado cooperative electric association. The agreement is capped at 87,600 RECs (10 megawatt average over the year) through the year 2017. Holy Cross Energy began purchasing the renewable energy credits associated with the RREI power production on October 2007, and continued purchasing through 2017. Under the revised RREI agreement, Idaho Power keeps all RECs above 87,600 RECs per year. In addition, we retain 49% of the renewable energy credits associated with power production from RREI after 2017 and Idaho Power retains the other 51%.
 On December 15, 2010, a second REC contract was signed with Public Utility District No. 1 of Clallam County, Washington. The term of the agreement is from 2018 to 2034 and includes sales of an estimated 50,000 megawatt hours of RECs annually, representing the 49% ownership in RECs retained by RREI under the Idaho Power PPA. 
 The PPAs for the existing San Emidio and Neal Hot Springs power plants require the bundling of power sales and RECs. Therefore, under these contracts all RECs are delivered with the net power sold to the utility.
