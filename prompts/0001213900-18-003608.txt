ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
Overview
  We are a financial services company committed to transforming the life insurance industry with disruptive and innovative products and services. We built our business by creating opportunities for consumers to obtain significantly more value for their life insurance policies in a secondary market as compared to the traditional options offered by the insurance industry. We are working to enhance and extend our business in the life insurance industry through continued innovation in our products and services, including the application of advanced technology. Finally, we entered into a strategic relationship with The Beneficient Company Group, L.P. that we expect to provide a significant increase in assets, common shareholder equity and earnings.
  Our core life insurance secondary market business is designed to serve consumers 65 years or older owning life insurance. We seek to earn non-correlated yield from life insurance policies that we purchase in the secondary market. We purchase these policies at a discount to the face value of the policy’s benefit and continue to pay the premiums in order to collect the policy benefits. The secondary market opportunity exists because the incumbent life insurance industry offers consumers inadequate surrender values for the policies they sell. Since inception, we have purchased over $2.7 billion in face value of policy benefits from consumers for over $477 million, as compared to the $35 million in surrender value offered by insurance carriers on those same policies. Our products provide unique and valuable services to the senior consumers that we serve.
  The opportunity to earn non-correlated yield generated from a portfolio of life insurance is potentially generated from the difference between the (i) purchase price of the life insurance assets over time, plus the premiums and financing costs to maintain those assets; and (ii) the face value of the policy benefits received. As of December 31, 2017, the total face value of the life insurance policy benefits that we own was $1.68 billion, and the total investment in our portfolio of life insurance assets, including the purchase price, attendant premiums and financing costs was $644 million.
  The goal of our secondary life insurance business has been to build a profitable, large and well-diversified portfolio of life insurance assets. We believe that scale and diversification are key factors and risk mitigation strategies to provide consistent cash flows and reliable investment returns. We believe that we are reaching this goal in terms of acquiring portfolio size and diversification. Our other key goal has been to build an operational platform to work with financial advisors and insurance professionals to assist consumers in accessing our products and services. We believe originating life insurance policies for the secondary market is a key source of value for our business.
  More recently, we have been working to further innovate in the primary life insurance market with products and services built using our advanced epigenetic technology. On April 26, 2017 we exclusively licensed the patent pending “DNA Methylation Based Predictor of Mortality” discovered by Dr. Steve Horvath from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). We refer to the technology developed by Dr. Horvath as M-Panel technology because it measures methylation patterns along the human epigenome. The “DNA Methylation Based Predictor of Mortality” established an all-cause mortality hazard ratio estimate based upon a pattern of methylation along the human epigenome. The science, known as epigenetics, is a facet of biology that reflects certain aspects of one’s interactions with environmental and physiological conditions at a molecular level. We believe epigenetics provides a foundational science for improving the traditional factors measured by the life insurance industry in underwriting, as well as providing new insights into health and wellness. To that end, we recently filed patents for our proprietary M-Panel Smoking and Alcohol consumption Tests. We are in the process of applying this advanced epigenetic technology into commercial applications that will permit us to reimagine the way in which risk is assessed, selected and priced in the life insurance, long-term care insurance and annuity industries.
  On January 12, 2018, we entered into a strategic relationship through a Master Exchange Agreement (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Master Agreement”), among GWG Holdings, GWG Life, The Beneficient Company Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Beneficient”), MHT Financial SPV, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (“MHT SPV”), and certain related trusts (the “Seller Trusts”). The transactions contemplated by the Master Agreement are collectively referred to in this report as the “Exchange Transaction.” Information regarding Beneficient and the Exchange Transaction is set forth below and in Item 1A (Risk Factors) of this report under the caption “Risks Related to the Pending Exchange Transaction.”

  Our business was originally organized in February 2006. We added our current parent holding company, GWG Holdings Inc., in March 2008, and in September 2014 we consummated an initial public offering of our common stock on The NASDAQ Capital Market where our stock trades under the ticker symbol “GWGH.”
  GWG Holdings, Inc. (“GWG Holdings”) conducts its life insurance secondary market business through a wholly owned subsidiary, GWG Life, LLC (“GWG Life”), and GWG Life’s wholly owned subsidiaries, GWG Life Trust and GWG DLP Funding IV, LLC. All of these entities are legally organized in Delaware, other than GWG Life Trust, which is governed by the laws of the State of Utah. GWG Holdings’ wholly owned subsidiary, Life Epigenetics Inc. (formerly named Actüa Life & Annuity Ltd.), was formed to engage in various life insurance related businesses and activities related to its exclusive license for “DNA Methylation Based Predictor of Mortality” technology. Unless the context otherwise requires or we specifically so indicate, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “our,” “our Company,” “GWG,” or the “Company” refer to these entities collectively. Our headquarters are based in Minneapolis, Minnesota.
  On December 7, 2015, GWG Holdings formed a wholly owned subsidiary, GWG MCA, LLC. On January 13, 2016, GWG MCA, LLC was converted to a corporation and became GWG MCA Capital, Inc. GWG MCA Capital, Inc. was formed to provide cash advances to small businesses.
  Markets
  Secondary Life Insurance Market
  The market for life insurance is large. According to the American Council of Life Insurers Fact Book 2017 (ACLI), consumers owned approximately $12 trillion in face value of individual life insurance policy benefits in the United States in 2016. In that same year, the ACLI reports that individual consumers purchased an aggregate of $1.7 trillion of new individual life insurance policy benefits. This figure includes all types of individual life policies, including term insurance and permanent insurance known as whole life and universal life.
  The secondary market for life insurance exists as a result of consumer lapse behaviors and surrender values far below economic value offered to consumers for their life insurance by the issuing insurance carriers. The ACLI reports that the annual lapse and surrender rate for individual life insurance policies is 5.2% of the in-force face value of benefits, amounting to over $624 billion in face value of policy benefits lapsed and surrendered in 2016 alone. According to Milliman (2004), a leading actuarial consulting firm, nearly 88% of all universal life insurance policies issued in the United States ultimately do not terminate with the payment of a death claim.
  The life insurance secondary market primarily serves consumers, 65 years and older, and their families who own life insurance. These consumers represent the fastest growing demographic segment in the United States, estimated to be over 49 million in 2016, according to the U.S. Census Bureau in its 2015 report “Projections and the Size and Composition of the U.S. Population: 2014 to 2060”. As these consumers age, they and their families will be faced with a variety of financial needs that can be met from the value-added products and services we offer. Our life insurance secondary market products and services address the convergence of major trends that include: increased lifetime estate tax exemptions, changing needs for life insurance protection, the disappearance of traditional long-term care insurance protection, under-saving for retirement, and increasing medical expenses. Our approach to the life insurance secondary market allows consumers to efficiently access the value of an illiquid life insurance asset, which may otherwise lapse or be surrendered, to offset the costs associated with retirement and aging.
  This year we experienced a noticeable increase in activity and interest in the life insurance secondary market across the entire spectrum of market constituents. This increased activity and interest was marked by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) policy bulletin issued July 19, 2017 in support of products we provide that the bulletin described as “innovative private market solutions for financing Americans’ long-term care needs.” The NAIC, citing the Company’s August 25, 2016 presentation, discussing how consumers could exchange the market value of their life insurance policies for products designed to fund long-term care expenses. The use of a life insurance policy to generate resources to fund long-term care was pioneered by our Executive Vice President, Chris Orestis. Today, we are the only company in the life insurance industry that provides this innovative product to pay for long-term care expenses.

  Primary Life Insurance Market and Technology (“Insurtech”)
  The opportunity to apply technology to transform the insurance industry is significant. According to leading industry consultancy firms such as KPMG, Accenture, and Ernst & Young, there is a major movement afoot to transform the insurance industry through the use and application of advanced technology. This movement, commonly referred to as “insurtech,” suggests a new era of disruptive entrants into the traditional insurance marketplace that have the potential to upend the insurance industry’s historical approach to assessing and selecting acceptable underwriting risks.
  We have identified advanced epigenetic technology as a means to improve underwriting systems in the primary life insurance market. Our M-Panel technology provides innovative insights into individual all-cause mortality and may have market-wide application to traditional life insurance underwriting. In addition, we have filed patent applications for our Smoking and Alcohol Tests. We believe these tests will provide more accuracy and precision in assessing the key factors used in the traditional life insurance underwriting process. We intend to commercialize and apply our tests to the primary market of life insurance and believe that our initial tests, and additional testing we plan to develop, may have applications outside of the insurance industry.
  Our Business
  Our business was founded to acquire life insurance policies in the secondary market and earn a profit from those assets. We believe that we are uniquely positioned in the life insurance secondary market, particularly as the need for our products and services grows. Over the past year we have been expanding our business with products and services built from intellectual property based on epigenetic science. In addition, we recently announced our pending transaction with The Beneficient Company Group, L.P. that will serve to expand our business to include a greater, more diversified portfolio of assets.
  To participate in our industry and deliver our products and services in the markets we serve, we intend to spend significant resources: (i) recruiting and developing professional management; (ii) establishing strategic relationships for delivering the services we provide; (iii) creating opportunities for investors to participate in the yield and capital appreciation from the life insurance assets and intellectual property we own; (iv) developing innovative products from epigenetic technology; and (v) developing an operational platform and systems for originating life insurance.
  Secondary Life Insurance
  Secondary Life Insurance — Origination
  We generally purchase life insurance assets in the secondary market directly from policy owners who purchased their life insurance in the primary market. Historically, we have purchased these life insurance policies through a network of specialized life settlement brokers who assist consumers and financial professionals in accessing the secondary market. One of our key strategic initiatives has been to expand our ability to originate and purchase life insurance policies directly from consumers by working with their financial or insurance advisor. We refer to this strategy as our “D100” initiative because we seek to acquire 100% of the life insurance policies that we purchase directly from consumers without the aid of a broker. Our D100 initiative is focused on bringing our products and services to consumers through partnerships with independent life insurance distribution organizations, which we believe is critical to achieve the growth potential of the life insurance secondary market.
Secondary Life Insurance Underwriting
  We focus on purchasing high quality life insurance assets through our origination practices and underwriting procedures. These practices and procedures strive to meet guidelines and methodologies published by rating agency A.M. Best. At the same time, we seek innovative value-added tools, services, and methodologies to improve both the accuracy and efficiency with which we acquire life insurance assets.
  Our secondary market underwriting procedures consist of a careful review and analysis of available materials and information related to a life insurance policy and the insured. The goal of our underwriting procedures is to make an informed purchasing decision. We typically purchase life insurance policies from insureds who are 65 years or older and whose life expectancies are less than 144 months (twelve years). The life expectancies we use are estimates, stated in months, which indicate the 50% probability of an individual’s mortality (meaning actuarial analysis predicts half of
  3
  the individuals with similar age, sex, and medical conditions will experience mortality before that number of months, and half will experience mortality after that number of months). Life expectancies are based on actuarial tables that predict statistical probability of individual mortality.
  We obtain life expectancies from independent third-party medical-actuarial underwriting firms, unless the life insurance policy benefit has a face value of $1,000,000 or less (which we generally refer to as a “small face policy”).
  Secondary Life Insurance – Value Proposition
  The value proposition of owning a life insurance asset purchased in the secondary market is the opportunity to earn a spread between the investment cost of the life insurance assets and the face value of the policy benefits. Accordingly, if we purchase life insurance assets in the secondary market, and make all the attendant premium payments to maintain those assets in order to receive the policy benefits, the most significant risk factors (among others that we discuss in the “Risk Factors” section of this report) in the performance of those assets are: (i) the predictability of mortality, or longevity risk; and (ii) the creditworthiness of the issuing life insurance company, or credit risk. We believe the value proposition of our investments in the life insurance assets is our ability to obtain superior risk-adjusted returns.
  We believe actuarial mortality is the single largest variable affecting the returns on our investments in life insurance assets over time. Accurately predicting an individual’s mortality date is impossible, and the best an actuary can do is provide a set of probabilities of survival over time. Nevertheless, predicting mortality among a group of similarly situated individuals is less difficult — in fact, the larger the group, the more accurate actuarial predictions tend to become. The statistical mathematical concept stating that the results of random events tend to become very predictable as the number of events becomes large is the “Central Limit Theorem” (or more commonly known as the “Law of Large Numbers”). This statistical mathematical concept is the basis for many business models, ranging from insurance to the lottery. Insurance carriers, for example, can be very certain of the number of insurance claims they can expect when they have spread their risk over a large pool of diversified policies. In this way, insurance carriers can price a large number of insurance policies of any type to collect premiums slightly above the level of expected claims, and thereby expect to earn a surplus or profit. Similarly, a lottery can depend on an expected amount of earnings equal to the small advantage built into the odds of the games.
  The implications for our business model are two-fold: first, as we accumulate larger numbers of life insurance policies, we should expect our results to increasingly correlate with our expectations; second, over the long run, we should expect that the actual cash flows will converge with the forecasted cash flows from our portfolio of life insurance assets, and the actual return on our portfolio of life insurance assets will converge with our expected return. Although medical advances and life expectancy changes may significantly impact the longevity risk we face and our understanding of that risk, these concepts nevertheless serve as guiding principles as we seek to build, manage, and forecast the performance of our portfolio of life insurance assets.
  These expectations are affirmed in research published by A.M. Best and others, illustrating that as the number of insured lives increase within a portfolio of life insurance policies, there is a corresponding decrease in the standard deviation of the mortality events within the portfolio — i.e., longevity risk decreases as the number of insureds increases. Standard & Poor’s indicates that 1,000 insured lives are required to reach statistical “significance” (where the relationship, in this context, between mortality projections and actual mortality events is not random). A.M. Best concludes that a portfolio of at least 300 insured lives is statistically significant. Our current portfolio covers 804 insured lives and we believe that both the predictability and actual performance will continue to improve with additional size and diversification. Accordingly, we continue to seek to grow the size and diversification of the portfolio in order to mitigate risk and improve our profitability.
  We rely on the payment of policy benefit claims by life insurance companies as a significant source of cash inflow. The life insurance assets we own represent obligations of third-party life insurance companies to pay the benefit amount under the policy upon the mortality of the insured. As a result, we manage this credit risk exposure by generally purchasing policies issued by insurance companies with investment-grade ratings from Standard & Poor’s, and diversifying our portfolio among a number of insurance companies.
  The yield to maturity on bonds issued by life insurance carriers reflects, among other things, the credit risk (risk of default) of such insurance carrier. We follow the yields on certain publicly traded life insurance company bonds because this information is part of the data we consider when valuing our portfolio of life insurance policies for our financial statements.
  4
  The average yield to maturity of publicly traded life insurance company bonds data we consider when valuing our portfolio of life insurance policies was 2.71% as of December 31, 2017. We believe that this reflects, in part, the financial market’s judgment that credit risk is low with regard to these carriers’ financial obligations. It should be noted that the obligations of life insurance carriers to pay life insurance policy benefits ranks senior to all of their other financial obligations, such as the aforementioned senior bonds they issue. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 96.7% of the face value of policy benefits in our life insurance portfolio were issued by insurance companies with investment-grade credit ratings from Standard & Poor’s.

 Secondary Life Insurance — Portfolio Return Modeling
  Our portfolio of life insurance assets is to earn superior risk-adjusted returns. At any time, we calculate our returns from our life insurance assets based upon (i) our historical results; and (ii) the future cash flows we expect to realize from our statistical forecasts. To forecast our expected future cash flows and returns, we use the probabilistic method of analysis. The expected internal rate of return of our portfolio is based upon future cash flow forecasts derived from a probabilistic analysis of policy benefits received and policy premiums paid in relation to our non-GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America, or “GAAP”) investment cost basis. As of December 31, 2017, the expected internal rate of return on our portfolio of life insurance assets was 10.48% based
  6
  on our portfolio benefits of $1.68 billion and our non-GAAP investment cost basis of $644.2 million (including purchase price, premiums paid, and financing costs incurred to date). This calculation excludes returns realized from our matured policy benefits which are substantial.
  We seek to further enhance our understanding of our expected future cash flow and returns by using a stochastic analysis, sometimes referred to as a “Monte Carlo simulation,” to provide us with a greater understanding of the variability of our projections. The stochastic analysis we perform provides internal rates of return calculations for different statistical confidence intervals. The results of our stochastic analysis, in which we run 10,000 random mortality scenarios, demonstrates that the scenario ranking at the 50th percentile of all 10,000 results generates an internal rate of return (“IRR”) of 10.46%, which is very near to our expected IRR (“Expected IRR”) of our portfolio of 10.48%. Our Expected IRR is based upon future cash flow forecasts derived from a probabilistic analysis of our policy benefits received and policy premiums paid in relation to our non-GAAP investment cost basis. The stochastic analysis results also reveal that our portfolio is expected to generate an internal rate of return of 9.98% or better in 75% of all generated scenarios; and an internal rate of return of 9.56% or better in 90% of all generated scenarios. As the portfolio continues to grow in size and diversity, all else equal, the scenario results cluster closer to each other around our median, or 50th percentile, internal rate of return expectation, thereby lowering future cash flow volatility and potentially justifying our use of lower discount rates to value our portfolio.
  In sum, we believe our statistical analyses show that, if we can continue to grow and maintain our investments in life insurance assets, then, in the absence of material negative events affecting our most significant risks, including but not limited to longevity, credit risk, interest rate and financing risk, those investments will potentially provide superior risk-adjusted returns for our Company.
  The complete detail of our portfolio of life insurance policies, owned by our wholly owned subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017, organized by the current age of the insured and the associated policy benefits, sex, estimated life expectancy, issuing insurance carrier, and the credit rating of the issuing insurance carrier, is set in Exhibit 99.2 to this report.
  Primary Life Insurance and Technology (“Insurtech”)
  We believe life insurance underwriting will transform due to advancements in science and technology. As part of that transformational change, we believe that the science of epigenetics will serve as a foundational science to this advancement for the life insurance industry. The life insurance industry is striving to achieve more automated underwriting and improve the overall customer experience. However, for a large number of life insurance policies issued today, the industry requires the collection of blood and urine to measure traditional health underwriting factors. Epigenetics not only offers a less invasive saliva-based solution, but promises to provide greater accuracy and precision to these traditional underwriting factors.
Science Overview — Genetics vs. Epigenetics
  The science of epigenetics differs materially from genetics. Genetic science is the study of human DNA, or genes, that consist of over three billion base pairs consisting of Adenine (A), Guanine (G), Thymine (T) and Cytosine(C). The Human Genome Project reports that the first human genomes were fully mapped and sequenced in 2003 at a cost of $2.7 billion. Since then, the cost of genetic sequencing has decreased exponentially where “next-generation sequencing” has brought this cost down even faster than Moore’s Law would have predicted. Several companies, such as Helix, now measure targeted sections of the genome as a service directly to consumers for under $100.
  Epigenetic science is the study of how gene expression changes through the addition or removal of biochemical markers rather than alterations in the genetic DNA code itself. Unlike the genome, which basically stays the same throughout a person’s lifetime, studies show that the epigenome changes dramatically over a person’s lifetime based on age, behaviors and other environmental factors. This means that the epigenome is reacting to an individual’s behavior or environment, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, or running marathons. Among the most studied epigenetic processes is DNA methylation, wherein chemical molecules called methyl groups attach or detach to cytosines along the genome, thereby affecting gene expression. By measuring unique methylation signatures along the genome, we believe we can identify health conditions or disease states that are traditionally used to underwrite life insurance with greater accuracy and precision.
  7
  While our technology is scientifically verified, the science of epigenetics is still nascent. As a result, we anticipate our technology to evolve rapidly in a way that adds to its core benefits over time. In particular, we believe that once our technology is commercialized for use and more lives are underwritten, we will have more data to further refine our technology and enhance its underwriting benefit. We also expect that the costs and the time required to process our tests will continue to fall due to technological advances, economies of scale and process improvements. The anticipated strengthening of these core benefits gives us confidence that epigenetic testing will become an integral part of life insurance underwriting and a driving force of the industry’s transformation.
  Epigenetic Testing — All-Cause M-Panel Mortality Test
  We believe epigenetics not only promises to improve upon many traditional factors used in underwriting with greater accuracy and precision, but also opens up new factors in underwriting itself. In 2013, Dr. Steve Horvath published his landmark paper on the “Epigenetic Clock,” which demonstrated that epigenetic data can be used to estimate human age. In late 2016, an international effort led by Dr. Horvath and Dr. Brian Chen, our Chief Science Officer, established that a new epigenetic clock could be used to “predict all-cause mortality above and beyond chronological age and traditional risk factors.” The meta-analysis study completed by Dr. Horvath and Dr. Chen on DNA methylation and mortality prediction, involved more than 13,000 people from multiple countries that were followed for a number of years. In April of 2017, we secured an exclusive global license from UCLA to use Dr. Horvath’s patent pending all-cause mortality predictive technology for the life insurance and related industries. We call the technology to conduct our all-cause M-Panel Mortality Test technology after the methylation signatures used in the analysis to identify individual risk of all-cause mortality.
  The research behind our all-cause M-Panel Mortality Test suggests that the information it provides about an individual’s risk of mortality is a new important independent factor that should be considered in life insurance underwriting. With the help of actuarial consultants, we have translated the all-cause mortality hazard ratios reported in Dr. Horvath’s research into individual actuarial mortality factors. The actuarial consultants reported that the process we developed was “acceptable and consistent with established actuarial principles,” an important confirmation of the proposed application of an all-cause M-Panel Mortality Test. We are in process of conducting our first large scale pilot test to analyze the independent and significance of our all-case M-Panel Mortality Test.
  Epigenetic Testing — M-Panel Smoking Test
  We recently filed for patent protection for our proprietary M-Panel Smoking Test. Environmental factors, such as smoking tobacco, impact the epigenome and can be measured through distinct epigenetic patterns. Given the large difference in life insurance premiums between smokers and non-smokers, and the shortcomings of current testing methodologies for testing smoking status, we have developed our proprietary M-Panel Smoking Test. The current gold-standard for measuring smoking status used by the life insurance industry measures cotinine collected from saliva, blood or urine. The half-life of cotinine in the human body is 16-19 hours, which means that >95% of cotinine is eliminated from the human body after about 3 days, making it easy for smokers to appear as non-smokers.
  In contrast, our patent pending M-Panel Smoking Test analyzes methylation patterns in saliva to assess a variety of smoking patterns, including short-term and long-term effects of smoking on the epigenome. The test is based on a rich body of scientific evidence that identified specific epigenetic signatures for different smoking patterns. Several studies have reported individual epigenetic markers that may be used to estimate: (i) the amounts of cigarettes smoked, (ii) whether someone has regularly smoked within the past decade, and (iii) whether someone is a currently smoking or not. Building upon these findings, we developed a proprietary algorithm that selects the optimal combination of epigenetic markers to determine an individual’s smoking habits. Using a single biological sample (e.g., saliva), the M-Panel Smoking Test identifies four categories of smokers: current smokers, recent quitters, long-term quitters, and never smokers. In addition to these four classifications, the M-Panel Smoking Test can also estimate the amount of cigarettes a current smoker likely smokes. Both amount and duration of smoking in one’s lifetime plays a dramatic role in determining one’s risk for morbidity and mortality. We believe our M-Panel Smoking Test will provide new features and details of individual smoking behavior that are not currently on the market. For a discussion of risks attendant to our M-Panel Smoking Test, see Risk Factors (“Commercializing the M-Panel or other technology…”).

  Epigenetic Testing — M-Panel Alcohol Test
  We recently filed for patent protection for our proprietary M-Panel Alcohol Test. Similar to smoking tobacco, alcohol consumption leads to changes in the epigenome which may be useful in life insurance underwriting decisions. Today, quantification of alcohol intake is currently limited to self-reporting, as well as a limited number of biomarkers that have their own strengths and limitations. Current biomarkers to detect alcohol consumption are able to measure recent alcohol use (e.g., ethyl glucuronide), moderate use (e.g., PeTH), longer term use (e.g., carbohydrate-deficient transferrin), and chronic alcohol intake (e.g., severe liver damage, alanine aminotransferase). However, each of these biomarkers have limitations that include their cost and accuracy, particularly for the biomarkers that detect moderate and longer term use. We believe there is a great need for a single test that integrates information across self-report and multiple biomarkers and epigenetics may offer such a test. Our patent pending M-Panel Alcohol Test is based on scientific research that identifies specific methylation signatures for different drinking patterns. Building upon these findings, the proprietary algorithm underlying our M-Panel Alcohol Test identifies three types of alcohol consumption patterns with a single biological sample (e.g., from saliva): heavy drinkers, moderate drinkers, and light/non-drinkers. For a discussion of risks attendant to our M-Panel Alcohol Test, see Risk Factors (“Commercializing the M-Panel or other technology…”).
Epigenetics — Research and Development
  We are engaged in several research and development efforts to further validate, refine and expand our epigenetic M-Panel testing capabilities. In particular, we are working with leading researchers in smoking and alcohol consumption to enhance and further validate our technology. We expect our research and development will support and enhance the efficacy of our M-Panel testing technology. We are in the final stages of readying our first scaled research pilot that will run concurrent M-Panel testing and life insurance underwriting analysis on up to 10,000 unique insurance applicants. We will compare and analyze the standard underwriting information against a detailed epigenetic scan of methylation patterns on each insurance applicant.
  One of the first analyses that we conduct will be to compare the standard overall underwriting conclusion for each applicant to our all-cause M-Panel Mortality Test. This analysis will determine the relationship between our all-cause M-Panel Mortality Test and traditional underwriting conclusions. We seek to discover the correlation between our all-cause M-Panel Mortality Test results and traditional underwriting conclusions and risk classifications. A strong correlation will indicate that the all-cause M-Panel Mortality Test can be used to capture some or all of the current underwriting process, and a non-correlation will indicate that the all-cause M-Panel Mortality Test captures a new underwriting factor to be considered. This is critical for understanding the value proposition of our all-cause M-Panel Mortality Test to life insurance underwriting.
  We also expect to finalize our M-Panel Smoking and Alcohol Tests for commercialization with the pilot. The pilot will allow us to compare the standard smoking test laboratory results currently used by the life insurance industry with a “ground truth” smoking measure based on a panel of biomarkers. With this information, we seek to demonstrate the accuracy of the current practice of measuring smoking in life insurance against “gold standard” biomarkers and the results of our M-Panel Smoking Test. We plan to run a similar process with respect to testing alcohol consumption using “gold standard” measurements. We expect we will emerge from the pilot with a quantitative understanding of the accuracy of our M-Panel Smoking and Alcohol Tests that will be critical in understanding the value proposition and commercialization of these tests for the life insurance industry.
  The Beneficient Company Group, L.P. Strategic Transaction
  On January 12, 2018, we entered into a strategic transaction through a Master Exchange Agreement (as it may be amended from time to time, the “Master Agreement”), among GWG Holdings, GWG Life, The Beneficient Company Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“Beneficient”), MHT Financial SPV, L.L.C., a Delaware limited liability company (“MHT SPV”), and certain related trusts (the “Seller Trusts”). Information regarding Beneficient and the Exchange Transaction is set forth below and in Item 1A (Risk Factors) of this report under the caption “Risks Related to the Pending Exchange Transaction.” We expect that this transaction will increase our common shareholder equity, diversify our balance sheet, income statement and cash flow sources while creating opportunities to leverage existing infrastructure and capabilities.

  Description of The Beneficient Company Group, L.P.
  Beneficient is a privately-held company organized as a Delaware master limited partnership, the general partner of which is Beneficient Management, a Delaware limited liability company. Subject to receipt of its regulatory trust charters from the State of Texas, Beneficient intends to register its common units with the SEC in the future and to apply for listing on a national stock exchange. If so registered and listed, Beneficient would be considered a publicly traded partnership for Internal Revenue Service purposes. There can be no assurance as to the timing or effectiveness, if any, of the proposed SEC registration and stock exchange listing of the common units.
  Subject to receipt of its regulatory charters, Beneficient plans to provide to mid-to-high net worth individuals (i.e., individuals having a net worth of between $5 million and $30 million) trust services and related liquidity products and loans for the alternative assets and illiquid investment funds those individuals may own, as well as a variety of other financial services, including custody and clearing of alternative assets, fund and trust administration, and insurance services for covering risks attendant to owning or managing alternative assets.
  In addition, Beneficient is developing a third business segment, referred to as financial technologies and online platforms, designed to offer clients online financial technologies and platforms for direct access to Beneficient’s liquidity products and services as well as specialized reporting tools. To expand this segment, Beneficient has acquired assets of ACE Portal Inc. (“ACE”), which was previously financed in part by the New York Stock Exchange in order to develop and operate a centralized platform for accredited and qualified investors to access the private markets for private placements of equity, debt and fund interests marketed by SEC-registered broker-dealers. Beneficient’s acquisition of the ACE closed in the first quarter of 2018.
  Description of the Overall Exchange Transaction
  The Seller Trusts are expected to own up to 82% of Beneficient’s issued and outstanding common units in the limited partnership. Pursuant to the Master Agreement, we will acquire the Beneficient common units held by the Seller Trusts in exchange for consideration valued at up to $800 million, which will be comprised of a combination of our common stock and five-year L Bonds valued, collectively, at up to $650 million, and $150 million in cash. The exact number of outstanding common units of Beneficient that we will purchase from the Seller Trusts, and the exact number of shares of our common stock and L Bonds that we will issue to the Seller Trusts as consideration therefor, will be determined approximately five business days prior to the closing of the Exchange Transaction. The Master Agreement provides, however, that the aggregate value of the consideration (consisting of our common stock, L Bonds and cash) provided to the Seller Trusts will not be less than $550 million nor more than $800 million.
  As part of the Exchange Transaction, we may elect, in our sole discretion, to issue and sell to MHT SPV a combination of additional shares of common stock (at a purchase price of $10.00 per share) and additional L Bonds for aggregate cash proceeds of $150 million. We would use the proceeds from the sale of these additional securities to facilitate our payment of the cash consideration to the Seller Trusts.
  Also as part of the Exchange Transaction, GWG Life will make a commercial loan to Beneficient in a principal amount between $275 million and $400 million. The expected terms of the commercial loan are described below under “—  Other Agreements — Commercial Loan Agreement.”
  Below is a diagram of the Exchange Transaction:
 
 10
  We have ascribed a minimum value of $10.00 per unit to the common units of Beneficient that we will acquire in the Exchange Transaction. If valuation opinions are secured from nationally recognized valuation firms stating that the common units of Beneficient will have, as of the closing date of the Exchange Transaction, a fair value of less than $9.00 per common unit, and such opinion is subsequently confirmed by a separate valuation opinion, Beneficient will cause its existing security holders to transfer additional common units to us at the closing as shall be necessary to provide an aggregate value to us equal to $10.00 per unit.
  The Exchange Transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018, subject to the satisfaction of various closing conditions set forth in the Master Agreement.
  Proposed Listing of Beneficient Common Units; Redemption
  In the Master Agreement, Beneficient has agreed to use its commercial best efforts to pursue and obtain a listing of its common units on a nationally recognized stock exchange (a “listing”) on or prior to the 40-month anniversary of the closing of the Exchange Transaction. If Beneficient does not (i) file a registration statement with the SEC in connection with a listing within 24 months after the closing of the Exchange Transaction, or (ii) secure a listing on or prior to the 40-month anniversary of the closing of the Exchange Transaction, then the Master Agreement provides that we may, at our election, cause Beneficient to adopt a strategy to redeem all of the common units of Beneficient held by us. If we were to make such an election, Beneficient would be obligated to repurchase our common units at a redemption price equal to the greater of $11.00 per unit or the book value per unit as of the date of redemption.
  In adopting its redemption strategy, Beneficient will be obligated to use no less than 75% of its distributable cash flow (calculated quarterly as cash flows derived from operations, plus cash inflows from financings, less mandatory tax distributions) to satisfy our redemption election and any redemption elections that may be made by the holders of other interests in Beneficient that have redemption rights. If we were to elect redemption, then Beneficient will be obligated under the Master Agreement to use a percentage of its distributable cash flow (as defined above), each quarter, equal to the percentage that the common units held by us on the date of our election bears to the total number of outstanding common units (on an undiluted basis) as of the date of our election, until such time as all of our common units shall have been redeemed.
  Other Agreements
  The Master Agreement contemplates a number of other agreements that will be executed and delivered between the date of the Master Agreement and closing, or at the closing, in furtherance of the Exchange Transaction. None of these other agreements have been fully negotiated, reduced to writing, executed and delivered. Generally, the Master Agreement requires the proposed parties to these other agreements to use some level of effort to arrive at terms reasonably acceptable to the parties, or to enter into these other agreements in customary but negotiated form or substance reasonably acceptable to the parties. In all cases, however, the Master Agreement itself provides some of the material terms and conditions that will be included in these other agreements. Descriptions under the captions below summarize certain of the material terms and conditions that the Master Agreement specifies for these other agreements.
Commercial Loan Agreement
  As required by the Master Agreement, at the closing of the Exchange Transaction, GWG Life, as the lender, will enter into a commercial loan agreement (the “Commercial Loan Agreement”) with Beneficient, as the borrower. The proceeds of the loan are intended to be used by Beneficient for working capital and to facilitate the delivery of trust products and services of Beneficient. The principal amount of the loan is expected to be $275 million, but may be increased by agreement of the parties up to an aggregate maximum amount of $400 million. Simple interest will accrue on the principal amount at the rate of 5% per annum, one-half of which will be due and payable in cash on a monthly basis, and one-half of which will accrue and become due on the maturity date. The loan will have a four-year term, and the maturity date will be the 48-month anniversary of the Commercial Loan Agreement. The outstanding principal amount of the commercial loan, together with interest thereon, may be prepaid in cash at any time or from time to time without penalty. The amounts owing in connection with the Commercial Loan Agreement will rank junior only to Beneficient’s bank debt and the NPC-B Unit Accounts of Beneficient Company Holdings, L.P., the subsidiary limited partnership of Beneficient. We expect that, in addition to the above, the Commercial Loan Agreement will contain certain financial covenants and other terms and conditions that are customary for commercial agreements of this type.
  11
  Registration Rights Agreements; Lock-Up Provisions
  In connection with the closing of the Exchange Transaction, and as contemplated in the Master Agreement, we will enter into two different registration rights agreements, one of which will grant resale registration rights to us with respect to the common units of Beneficient we will receive at the closing, and the other of which will involve our grant of resale registration rights to the Seller Trusts with respect to the shares of common stock and L Bonds we issue to the Seller Trusts at the closing. These registration rights agreements are intended to provide the parties with the legal right to resell the securities they receive in the Exchange Transaction in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933. Notwithstanding the registration rights to be granted to the Seller Trusts, the ability of the Seller Trusts to resell the shares of our common stock they receive in the Exchange Transaction will be limited by the contractual provisions of the Orderly Marketing Agreement discussed below.
  MHT SPV has agreed that, until the earlier of (i) the listing of the common units of Beneficient on a nationally recognized stock exchange and (ii) 40 months from the date of closing, it will not directly or indirectly sell, transfer, distribute, pledge or otherwise dispose of any shares it receives in the Exchange Transaction without our prior written consent.
  Orderly Marketing Agreement
  The Master Agreement obligates us and the Seller Trusts to negotiate in good faith the terms of an agreement (the “Orderly Marketing Agreement”) with one or more nationally recognized investment banks for the orderly marketing and resale of the shares of our common stock that we issue to the Seller Trusts under the Master Agreement. The purpose of the Orderly Marketing Agreement is to manage the timing and amount of our common shares that are publicly resold in the market since the number of shares of our common stock to be issued under the Master Agreement will substantially increase the total number of our issued and outstanding shares. However, the terms of that Orderly Marketing Agreement have not yet been determined. There is no assurance that the Orderly Marketing Agreement will accomplish its purpose of maintaining a stable market for our common stock.
Shareholders’ Agreement
  The Master Agreement contemplates and requires the delivery at closing of a shareholders’ agreement (the “Shareholders’ Agreement”) among the Seller Trusts, MHT SPV and GWG. The purpose of the Shareholders’ Agreement is to limit the voting power of the Seller Trusts and MHT SPV and the control they would otherwise be entitled to exercise over GWG. To that end, the Shareholders’ Agreement will provide that all voting securities of GWG over which the Seller Trusts and MHT SPV (and their respective transferees) have voting control will be voted solely in proportion with the votes cast by all other holders of voting securities of GWG on any matter put before them. In addition, until the earlier of (i) one year from the closing of the Exchange Transaction and (ii) the termination of the Orderly Marketing Agreement, the Seller Trusts (including their assignees and transferees, and their respective affiliates) will be subject to certain standstill restrictions. These restrictions will prohibit the Seller Trusts from, among other things, acquiring any voting securities of GWG or any of its subsidiaries, seeking or proposing to influence or control our management, Board of Directors, or policies, and submitting a proposal for any merger, recapitalization, reorganization, business combination, or other extraordinary transaction involving GWG.
  No Control of the Business and Affairs of Beneficient
  Beneficient is a limited partnership organized in the State of Delaware and its business and affairs are managed by its general partner. Although we will become the owner of up to 82% of the issued and outstanding common units in Beneficient upon consummation of the Exchange Transaction, owners of common units of Beneficient have only limited voting rights relating to certain matters under applicable state law and Beneficient’s partnership agreement Therefore, we will have limited or no ability to influence Beneficient’s management’s decisions regarding its business.
  Competitive and Regulatory Framework
  Competition
  We encounter significant competition from numerous companies in the products and services we provide and seek to develop in the life insurance industry. Many of these competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do and may have significantly lower cost of funds than us because they have access to insured deposits or greater access
  12
  to the capital markets, for example. Moreover, some of these competitors have significant cash reserves and can better fund shortfalls in collections that might have a more pronounced impact on companies such as ours. They may also have greater market share. In the event that these or other competitors make a significant effort to compete against our businesses, we would experience significant challenges with our business model.
  Competition can take many forms, including the pricing, technology, financing resources, transaction structuring, timeliness and customer service. Some competitors may outperform us in these areas. These factors could adversely affect our profitability by reducing our return on investment or increasing our risk.
  As we enter new markets, we expect to experience significant competition from incumbent market participants. Our ability to compete in these markets will be dependent upon our ability to deliver value-added products and services to the customers we serve. Even still, our competitors in these markets may have greater financial, market share and other resources than we do. These factors could adversely affect our profitability by reducing our return on investment or increasing our risk as we enter these markets.
  Government Regulation
  Our business is highly regulated at the state level with respect to the life insurance industry, and at the federal level with respect to the issuance of our  securities offerings. At the state level, states generally subject us to laws and regulations requiring us to obtain specific licenses or approvals to purchase life insurance policies in those states. State statutes typically provide state regulatory agencies with significant powers to interpret, administer and enforce the laws relating to the life insurance industry. Under this authority, state regulators have broad discretionary power and may impose new licensing and other requirements, and interpret or enforce existing regulatory requirements in new and different ways. Any of these new requirements, interpretations or enforcement directives could be materially adverse to our industry. Furthermore, because the areas of business in which we participate are relatively new, we believe it is likely that state regulation will increase and grow more complex in the foreseeable future. We cannot, however, predict what any new regulation would specifically involve or how it might affect our industry or our business.
  The state regulatory landscape for the use of genetic and epigenetic testing in life insurance underwriting is such that genetic and epigenetic testing is generally permitted. A few states require informed consent for use of genetic testing in life insurance underwriting. Epigenetic testing is distinguishable from genetic testing and we believe epigenetic testing does not raise the ethical issue found with genetic testing of denying insurance coverage to applicants based on immutable inherited characteristics. While well-informed policymakers and regulators should have little reason to consider expanding current definitions of genetic testing to include epigenetic testing, or to increase restrictions on life insurance underwriting using epigenetic test results, we can provide no such assurances.
  Although the federal securities laws and regulations do not directly affect life insurance, in some cases the purchase of a variable life insurance policy may constitute a transaction involving a “security” that is governed by federal securities laws. While we presently hold few variable life insurance policies, our holding of a significant amount of such policies in the future could cause our Company or one of our subsidiaries to be characterized as an “investment company” under the federal Investment Company Act of 1940. The application of that law to all or part of our businesses — whether due to our purchase of life insurance policies or to the expansion of the definition of “securities” under federal securities laws — could require us to comply with detailed and complex regulatory requirements, and cause us to fall out of compliance with certain covenants under our senior credit facility with LNV Corporation. Such an outcome could negatively affect our liquidity and increase our cost of capital and operational expenses, all of which would adversely affect our operating results. It is possible that such an outcome could even threaten the viability of our business and our ability to satisfy our obligations as they come due.
  We hold licenses to purchase life insurance policies in 38 states and can also purchase in the eight unregulated states. At times, we may work with licensed entities to purchase a policy in a state where we are not licensed.
  Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
  HIPAA requires that holders of medical records maintain such records and implement procedures designed to assure the privacy of patient records. In order to carry out our business, we receive medical records and obtain a release to share such records with a defined group of persons, take on the responsibility for preserving the privacy of that information, and use the information only for purposes related to the life insurance policies we own.
  13
  The Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (GINA)
  GINA is a federal law that protects people from genetic discrimination in health insurance and employment. GINA prohibits health insurers from: (i) requesting, requiring, or using genetic information to make decisions about eligibility for health insurance; or (ii) making decisions on the health insurance premium, contribution amounts, or coverage terms they offer to consumers. In addition, GINA makes it against the law for health insurers to consider family history or a genetic test result, a pre-existing condition, require a genetic test, or use any genetic information, to discriminate coverage, even if the health insurance company did not mean to collect such genetic information.
  GINA does not apply to the life insurance, long-term care or annuity industries. The life insurance, long-term care or annuity industries operate on medical-evidenced underwriting principles in which specific medical conditions are taken into account when assessing and pricing risk. The regulation of genomic data is relatively new, and we believe it is likely that regulation will increase and grow more complex in the foreseeable future. We cannot, however, predict what any new law or regulation would specifically involve or how it might affect our industry, our business, or our future plans.
  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
  On December 22, 2017, the U.S. federal government enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Reform Bill”). The Tax Reform Bill changed existing United States tax law and includes provisions that will affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. The Tax Reform Bill reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate and changed business-related exclusions, deductions and credits.
Employees
  We employ approximately 65 employees.
  Properties
  Our principal executive offices are located at 220 South Sixth Street, Suite 1200, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55402. At that location, we lease 17,687 square feet of space for a lease term expiring in 2025. We believe that these facilities are adequate for our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as needed.
