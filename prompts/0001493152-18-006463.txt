Overview of Our Business
 
Recent Developments
 
The Company’s principal business is to offer personalized web-based nutrition and fitness programs based on users’ genetic data. We believe our artificial intelligence-based algorithm generates accurate and valuable insight about individual health risks, and has to potential to flag and develop a preventative care plan for potential areas of health concern. Through a web-based questionnaire, and upload of the user’s raw genetic data, the algorithm identifies areas of potential health risk and generates a preventative action plan, which includes a personalized nutrition and fitness plan, and nutritional supplement recommendations. Subscribers who have previously purchased their genetic health information from 23andMe will be able to provide their login information, and upload that data to our website. Our technology will then automatically adjust the user’s nutrition and wellness plan according to that genetic data. Our personalized plans feature meal plans, virtual personal training, supplement recommendations, downloadable menus, recipes, and shopping lists. In the near future, we plan to offer our subscribers the opportunity to enhance their personalized wellness plans by ordering lab diagnostic kits for more comprehensive blood testing and analysis. Presently, customers can order premium nutritional and vitamin supplements from our online health supplement marketplace. We plan to generate revenues through user subscriptions, lab diagnostic kit purchases, sales of compounding pharmacy products, and nutritional supplements. We launched our website, www.frelii.com, in March 2018. We are currently doing business under the name “Frélii.” Effective March 9, 2018, the Company changed its name to “Frélii, Inc.” and its trading symbol to “FRLI.”

Corporate History
 
The Company incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2002, under the name “Bayview Corporation.” From 2005 until 2009, the Company’s business involved researching and developing cancer treatment drugs. From July 2009 until May 2011, the Company operated as a real estate services firm, seeking to capitalize on the real estate opportunities resulting from the dislocation in the credit markets, and by extension, the multifamily housing market, by acquiring, rehabilitating, stabilizing and selling distressed multifamily properties in the southern United States, predominantly in Texas. On May 26, 2011, the Company changed its name to Vican Resources, Inc., and changed its business model when it sold the real estate services division and acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vican Trading, Inc., a Montreal-based purchaser and seller of metals, ores, and other commodities (hereafter, “Vican Trading”). Upon the acquisition of Vican Trading, there was an implied option for either party to rescind the original acquisition. During the year that option was exercised, and on December 20, 2011, the Company again changed its business when it unwound the acquisition of Vican Trading and acquired all of the assets of Med Ex Direct, Inc., a Florida-based provider of management services in respect of the distribution of diabetic supplies, principally to Hispanic patients (hereafter, “Med Ex Florida”). On March 22, 2012, the Company again changed its business to become an oil & gas exploration, development, and distribution company, unwound the purchase of the assets of Med Ex Florida, and acquired an interest in two oil & gas wells located in Jefferson County, Mississippi.
 
In April 2017, the Company underwent a change of control whereby our current Chief Executive Officer Ian Jenkins acquired a controlling interest in the Company’s capital stock and was appointed our sole officer and director. On April 11, 2017, the Company executed a Share Exchange Agreement with Unprescribed, LLC, later amended to include Cornerstone Medical Center LLC, whereby the Company, among other terms, agreed to exchange shares with the ownership units of those two entities for 25,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Share Exchange Agreement, as amended, terminated by its own terms on December 31, 2017. Following the termination of the Share Exchange Agreement, management modified its business plan to acquire certain intellectual property assets and engage a new executive team to launch its new business, a web-based subscription service providing personalized nutrition and wellness plans.
