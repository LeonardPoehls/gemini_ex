ITEM 1: | BUSINESS
--------+---------

GENERAL 
 Bay Banks of Virginia, Inc. (the Company) is a bank holding company that conducts substantially all of its operations through its subsidiaries, Virginia Commonwealth Bank (formerly named Bank of Lancaster) (the Bank) and VCB Financial Group, Inc. (the Financial Group). The Company was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia on June 30, 1997, in connection with the holding company reorganization of the Bank of Lancaster. The Bank opened for business in 1930 and has partnered with the communities it serves to ensure responsible growth and development since its organization. 
 The Bank is a state-chartered bank, headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, and a member of the Federal Reserve System. The Bank has offices in Virginia throughout the Northern Neck and Middle Peninsula and in the Greater Richmond area of central Virginia. It serves businesses, professionals and consumers with a wide variety of financial services, including retail and commercial banking, investment services, and mortgage banking. Products include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, cash management accounts, certificates of deposit, individual retirement accounts, commercial and industrial loans, residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, home equity loans, consumer installment loans, investment accounts, insurance, credit cards, online banking, telephone banking, and mobile banking. 
 The Bank currently has nineteen offices in the Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area, the Tri-Cities (Petersburg, Hopewell, Colonial Heights), Kilmarnock and throughout the Northern Neck, and Suffolk, Virginia. A substantial amount of the Banks deposits are interest bearing, and the majority of the Banks loan portfolio is secured by real estate. Deposits of the Bank are insured by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). 
 On April, 2017, the Company completed a merger with Virginia BanCorp Inc. (Virginia BanCorp), a bank holding company conducting substantially all of its operations through its subsidiary Virginia Commonwealth Bank, pursuant to the agreement and plan of merger, dated November 2, 2016, by and between the Company and Virginia BanCorp. The Company is the surviving corporation, and former shareholders of Virginia BanCorp received 1.178 shares of the Companys common stock for each share of Virginia BanCorp common stock they owned for a total issuance of 4,586,221 shares of the Companys stock valued at approximately $42.2 million at the time of closing. After the merger was completed, the Companys legacy shareholders owned approximately 51% of the outstanding stock of the Company, and Virginia BanCorps former shareholders owned approximately 49% of the outstanding stock of the Company. After the merger was completed, Virginia BanCorps, subsidiary bank was merged with and into Bank of Lancaster, which changed its name to Virginia Commonwealth Bank. Bank operating systems were consolidated and the migration to a new core operating system was completed during the fourth quarter of 2017. 
 The Companys primary market includes the Greater Richmond, Virginia metropolitan area, the Northern Neck Peninsula of Virginia, and Middlesex County, which is located across the Rappahannock River from the Northern Neck. The Northern Neck includes the counties of Lancaster, Northumberland, Richmond, and Westmoreland. The Company expanded operations into the Richmond, Virginia market in 2014 with an eye toward higher density business and consumer demographics and furthered its penetration into the Richmond market upon completion of the merger with Virginia BanCorp in April 2017. The Company considers the city of Richmond and the counties of Henrico and Chesterfield, Virginia to be its service area in the Greater Richmond area. The city of Richmond serves as the capital of Virginia and the economic center of the Richmond-Petersburg metropolitan statistical area. The Company believes that the area reflects a generally high quality of life as exemplified by relatively low cost of living, minimal traffic congestion, a physically attractive topography, and a diverse economy that typically experiences neither the highs nor the lows of national business cycles. The main demographic in the Companys Northern Neck market is smaller, retired households with relatively high per capita incomes. Health care, tourism, and related services are the major employment sectors in the Northern Neck and Middlesex County. 
 The Company had total assets of $970.6 million, deposits of $761.8 million, and shareholders equity of $114.6 million as of December 31, 2017. Its headquarters are currently located in Richmond, Virginia and its telephone number is 804-325-3775. The Companys website is www.baybanks.com. Information contained on the Companys website is not a part of or incorporated into this report or any other filing the Company makes with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
 Bay Services Company, Inc. The Bank has one wholly owned subsidiary, Bay Services Company, Inc., a Virginia corporation organized in 1994 (Bay Services). Bay Services owns an interest in Infinex Investments, Inc., which provides insurance and investment products for marketing via VCB Financial Group. Bay Services also owned an interest in Bankers Title of Shenandoah until April 1, 2017, when it was divested, which sells title insurance to mortgage loan customers, including customers of the Bank and the other financial institutions that have an ownership interest in the agency. 
 VCB Financial Group Inc. As of May 1, 2017, Bay Trust Company reorganized and became VCB Financial Group, which provides management services for personal and corporate trusts, including estate planning, estate settlement, and trust administration. Products include estate planning and settlement, revocable and irrevocable living trusts, testamentary trusts, custodial accounts, investment management accounts, managed and self-directed Individual Retirement Accounts, insurance and investments. 
 Through Virginia Commonwealth Bank and the VCB Financial Group, the Company provides a wide variety of financial services to its customers in its market areas. The primary products and services are summarized as follows.

Mortgage Loans on Real Estate. The Banks mortgage loans on real estate comprise the largest segment of its loan portfolio. The majority of the Banks real estate loans are mortgages on owner-occupied one-to-four family residential properties, including both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate structures. Residential mortgages are underwritten and documented within the guidelines of the regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the Federal Reserve). Home equity lines of credit are also offered. Construction loans with a twelve-month term are another component of the Banks portfolio. Underwritten at 80% loan to value, and to qualified builders and individuals, these loans are disbursed as construction progresses and verified by Bank inspection. The Bank also offers commercial loans that are secured by real estate. These mortgages are also typically written at a maximum of 80% loan to value. 
 The Company also offers secondary market residential loan origination. Through the Bank, customers may apply for home mortgages that are underwritten in accordance with the guidelines of either the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or the Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae). These loans are then sold into the secondary market on a loan-by-loan basis, usually directly to FNMA. The Bank earns origination and servicing fees from this service. 
 Commercial and Industrial Loans. Commercial lending activities include small business loans, asset based loans, and other secured and unsecured loans and lines of credit. Commercial and industrial loans may entail greater risk than residential mortgage loans, and are therefore underwritten with strict risk management standards. Among the criteria for determining the borrowers ability to repay is a cash flow analysis of the business and business collateral. 
 Consumer Loans. As part of its full range of services, the Banks consumer lending services include automobile and boat financing, home improvement loans, credit cards and unsecured personal loans. These consumer loans historically entail greater risk than loans secured by real estate, but also generate a higher return. The Bank sold its credit card portfolio in 2016. 
 Consumer Deposit Services. Consumer deposit products include checking accounts, savings accounts, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, telephone banking, online banking, mobile banking, mobile deposit, electronic statements and identity theft protection. The Banks Golden Advantage program offers special products and services to customers age 55 and over, and the Extreme Banking program offers a suite of electronic products. 
 Commercial Banking Services. The Bank offers a variety of services to commercial customers. These services include analysis checking, cash management deposit accounts, wire services, direct deposit payroll service, online banking, telephone banking, remote deposit, and a full line of commercial lending options. The Bank also offers Small Business Administration loan products under the 504 Program, which provides long-term funding for commercial real estate and long-lived equipment. This allows commercial customers to obtain favorable rate loans for the development of business opportunities, while providing the Bank with a partial guarantee of the outstanding loan balance. 
 Purchased Loans. The Bank acquired three purchased consumer loan pools and a commercial loan pool as part of the merger with Virginia BanCorp. The Bank is no longer purchasing loan pools. 
COMPETITION 
 The financial services industry is highly competitive. The Company competes for loans, deposits and financial services directly with other bank and nonbank institutions located within its markets, credit unions, internet-based banks, out-of-market banks and bank holding companies that advertise or otherwise serve its markets, along with money market and mutual funds, brokerage houses, mortgage companies, and insurance companies or other commercial entities that offer financial services products. Competition involves efforts to retain current customers and to obtain new loans and deposits, utilizing the scope and type of services offered, and interest rates paid on deposits and charged on loans. Many of the Companys competitors have competitive advantages, including greater financial resources, a wider geographic presence, more accessible branch office locations, the ability to offer additional services, more favorable pricing alternatives and lower origination and operating costs. The Company believes that its competitive pricing, personalized service and community involvement enable it to effectively compete in the communities in which it operates.SUPERVISION AND REGULATION 
 Bank holding companies and banks are extensively regulated under both federal and state laws. The following description briefly addresses certain provisions of federal and state laws and certain regulations, proposed regulations and the potential impacts on the Company and the Bank. To the extent statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals are described in this report, the description is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provisions or proposals. 
The Company 
 General. As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (the BHCA), the Company is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve. The Company is also registered under the bank holding company laws of Virginia and is subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Bureau of Financial Institutions of the Virginia State Corporation Commission (the Virginia BFI). 
 Permitted Activities. A bank holding company is limited to managing or controlling banks, furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiaries, and engaging in other activities that the Federal Reserve determines by regulation or order to be closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks. In determining whether a particular activity is permissible, the Federal Reserve must consider whether the 
 
4 
 
 performance of such an activity reasonably can be expected to produce benefits to the public that outweigh possible adverse effects. Possible benefits include greater convenience, increased competition, and gains in efficiency. Possible adverse effects include undue concentration of resources, decreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, and unsound banking practices. Despite prior approval, the Federal Reserve may order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any activity or to terminate ownership or control of any subsidiary when the Federal Reserve has reasonable cause to believe that a serious risk to the financial safety, soundness or stability of any bank subsidiary of that bank holding company may result from such an activity. 
 Banking Acquisitions; Changes in Control. The BHCA and related regulations require, among other things, the prior approval of the Federal Reserve in any case where a bank holding company proposes to (i) acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than 5% of the outstanding voting stock of any bank or bank holding company (unless it already owns a majority of such voting shares), (ii) acquire all or substantially all of the assets of another bank or bank holding company, or (iii) merge or consolidate with any other bank holding company. In determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition, the Federal Reserve will consider, among other factors, the effect of the acquisition on competition, the public benefits expected to be received from the acquisition, any outstanding regulatory compliance issues of any institution that is a party to the transaction, the projected capital ratios and levels on a post-acquisition basis, the financial condition of each institution that is a party to the transaction and of the combined institution after the transaction, the parties managerial resources and risk management and governance processes and systems, the parties compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money laundering requirements, and the acquiring institutions performance under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 and its compliance with fair housing and other consumer protection laws. 
 Subject to certain exceptions, the BHCA and the Change in Bank Control Act, together with the applicable regulations, require Federal Reserve approval (or, depending on the circumstances, no notice of disapproval) prior to any person or companys acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company. A conclusive presumption of control exists if an individual or company acquires the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of an insured depository institution or to vote 25% or more of any class of voting securities of any insured depository institution. A rebuttable presumption of control exists if a person or company acquires 10% or more but less than 25% of any class of voting securities of an insured depository institution and either the institution has registered its securities with the Securities and Exchange Commission under Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act) or no other person will own a greater percentage of that class of voting securities immediately after the acquisition. The Companys common stock is registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. 
 In addition, Virginia law requires prior approval from the Virginia BFI for (i) the acquisition by a Virginia bank holding company of more than 5% of the voting shares of a Virginia bank or any holding company that controls a Virginia bank, or (ii) the acquisition by a Virginia bank holding company of a bank or its holding company domiciled outside Virginia. 
 Source of Strength. Federal Reserve policy has historically required bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act) codified this policy as a statutory requirement. Under this requirement, the Company is expected to commit resources to support the Bank, including at times when the Company may not be in a financial position to provide such resources. Any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to depositors and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks. In the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment. 
 Safety and Soundness. There are a number of obligations and restrictions imposed on bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks by law and regulatory policy that are designed to minimize potential loss to the depositors of such depository institutions and the FDIC insurance fund in the event of a depository institution insolvency, receivership, or default. For example, under the Federal Deposit Insurance Company Improvement Act of 1991, to avoid receivership of an insured depository institution subsidiary, a bank holding company is required to guarantee the compliance of any subsidiary bank that may become undercapitalized with the terms of any capital restoration plan filed by such subsidiary with its appropriate federal bank regulatory agency up to the lesser of (i) an amount equal to 5% of the institutions total assets at the time the institution became undercapitalized, or (ii) the amount that is necessary (or would have been necessary) to bring the institution into compliance with all applicable capital standards as of the time the institution fails to comply with such capital restoration plan. 
 Under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA), the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines prescribing safety and soundness standards. These guidelines establish general standards relating to capital management, internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, information systems, data security loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, risk management, vendor management, corporate governance asset growth and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, the guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. 
 Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve imposes certain capital requirements on bank holding companies under the BHCA, including a minimum leverage ratio and a minimum ratio of qualifying capital to risk-weighted assets. These requirements are described below under The Bank  Capital Requirements. Subject to its capital requirements and certain other restrictions, the Company is able to borrow money to make a capital contribution to the Bank, and such loans may be repaid from dividends paid by the Bank to the Company. 
 Limits on Dividends and Other Payments. The Company is a legal entity, separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. A significant portion of the revenues of the Company result from dividends paid to it by the Bank. There are various legal limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by the Bank to the Company and to the payment of dividends by the Company to its shareholders. The Bank is subject to various statutory and regulatory restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to the Company. Under current regulations, prior approval from the Federal Reserve is required if cash dividends declared by the Bank in any given year exceed net income for that year, plus retained net profits of the two preceding years. The payment of dividends by the Bank or the Company may be limited by other factors, such as requirements to maintain capital above regulatory guidelines. Bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank or the Company from engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice in conducting its respective business. The payment of dividends, depending on the financial condition of the Bank, or the Company, could be deemed to constitute such an unsafe or unsound practice. 
 
5 
 
Under the FDIA, insured depository institutions such as the Bank, are prohibited from making capital distributions, including the payment of dividends, if, after making such distributions, the institution would become undercapitalized (as such term is used in the statute). Based on the Banks current financial condition, the Company does not expect this provision will have any impact on its ability to receive dividends from the Bank. The Companys non-bank subsidiary, the Financial Group, may pay dividends to the Company periodically, subject to certain statutory restrictions. 
 In addition to dividends it may receive from the Bank, the Company receives management fees from its affiliated companies for expenses incurred related to external financial reporting and audit fees, investor relations expenses, board of directors fees and legal fees related to corporate actions. These fees are charged to each subsidiary based upon various specific allocation methods measuring the estimated usage of such services by that subsidiary. The fees are eliminated from the financial statements in the consolidation process. 
 The Bank 
 General. The Bank is supervised and regularly examined by the Federal Reserve and the Virginia BFI. The various laws and regulations administered by the bank regulatory agencies affect corporate practices, such as the payment of dividends, incurrence of debt and acquisition of financial institutions and other companies; they also affect business practices, such as the payment of interest on deposits, the charging of interest on loans, types of business conducted and location of offices. Certain of these laws and regulations are referenced above under The Company. 
 Capital Requirements. The Federal Reserve and the other federal banking agencies have issued risk-based and leverage capital requirements applicable to U.S. banking organizations. Those regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth. 
 On June 7, 2012, the Federal Reserve issued a series of proposed rules intended to revise and strengthen its risk-based and leverage capital requirements and its method for calculating risk-weighted assets. The rules were proposed to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The proposed rules modified or left unchanged the components of regulatory capital, which are: (i) total capital, defined as core capital and supplementary capital less certain specified deductions from total capital such as reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital instruments and equity investments; (ii) Tier 1 capital, which consists principally of common and certain qualifying preferred shareholders equity (including grandfathered trust preferred securities) as well as retained earnings, less certain intangibles and other adjustments; and (iii) Tier 2 capital, which consists of cumulative preferred stock, long-term perpetual preferred stock, a limited amount of subordinated and other qualifying debt (including certain hybrid capital instruments), and a limited amount of the general loan loss allowance. The Federal Reserve also has established a minimum leverage capital ratio of Tier 1 capital to average adjusted assets (Tier 1 leverage ratio). 
 In July 2013, the Federal Reserve issued final rules that made the changes to its capital rules to align them with the Basel III regulatory capital framework and meet certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. Effective January 1, 2015, the final rules require the Bank to comply with the following minimum capital ratios: (i) a new Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets (increased from the prior requirement of 4.0%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets (unchanged from the prior requirement); and (iv) a leverage ratio of 4.0% of total assets (unchanged from the prior requirement). The following additional capital requirements related to the capital conservation buffer are being phased in over a four year period, which began on January 1, 2016. When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, the rules will require the Bank to maintain (i) a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, plus a 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 4.5% Common Equity Tier 1 ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0% upon full implementation), (ii) a minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 6.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 6.0% Tier 1 capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5% upon full implementation), (iii) a minimum ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.0%, plus the 2.5% capital conservation buffer (which is added to the 8.0% total capital ratio as that buffer is phased in, effectively resulting in a minimum total capital ratio of 10.5% upon full implementation), and (iv) a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%, calculated as the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average assets. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in as of January 1, 2016, at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets, increasing by the same amount each year until fully implemented at 2.5% on January 1, 2019. The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress. Banking institutions with a ratio of Common Equity Tier 1 to risk-weighted assets above the minimum but below the conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall. As of December 31, 2017, the Bank maintained Common Equity Tier 1 capital of $85.8 million, Tier 1 capital of $85.8 million, risk weighted assets of $736.4 million, and total capital of $93.5 million. As of December 31, 2017, all ratios were in excess of the fully phased-in requirements, with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio at 11.65% of risk-weighted assets, the Tier 1 capital ratio at 11.65% of risk-weighted assets, the total capital ratio at 12.70% of risk-weighted assets, and the Tier 1 leverage ratio at 8.97% of total assets. 
 Deposit Insurance. The deposits of the Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) of the FDIC. 
 Under the Dodd-Frank Act, a permanent increase in deposit insurance was authorized to $250,000 per depositor, per insured depository institution for each account ownership category.

The deposits of the Bank are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. Effective April 1, 2011, the FDIC began calculating assessments based on an institutions average total assets minus average tangible equity, pursuant to a rule issued by the FDIC as required by the Dodd-Frank Act, and utilizing a risk-based assessment system that imposed insurance premiums based upon a risk category matrix that took into account a banks capital level and supervisory rating. Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC again changed its deposit insurance pricing and eliminated all risk categories and now uses the financial ratios method based on CAMELS composite ratings to determine assessment rates for small established institutions with less than $10 billion in assets. The CAMELS rating system is a supervisory rating system designed to take into account and reflect all financial and operational risks that a bank may face, including capital adequacy, asset quality, management capability, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market risk (CAMELS). CAMELS composite ratings set a maximum assessment for CAMELS 1 and 2 rated banks, and set minimum assessments for lower rated institutions. 
 The FDICs reserve ratio of the DIF to total industry deposits reached its 1.15% target effective June 30, 2016. On March 15, 2016, the FDIC implemented by final rule certain Dodd-Frank Act provisions by raising the DIFs minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. The FDIC imposed a 4.5 basis point annual surcharge on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The new rule grants credits to smaller banks for the portion of their regular assessments that contribute to increasing the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%. Prior to when the new assessment system became effective, the Banks overall rate for assessment calculations was 9 basis points or less, which was within the range of assessment rates for the lowest risk category under the former FDIC assessment rules. In 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded expense of $580 thousand and $366 thousand, respectively, for FDIC insurance premiums. 
 All FDIC insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC at an annual rate of approximately one basis point of insured deposits to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Savings Association Insurance Fund. These assessments will continue until the bonds mature in 2019. 
 Transactions with Affiliates. Pursuant to Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation W, the authority of the Bank to engage in transactions with related parties or affiliates or to make loans to insiders is limited. Loan transactions with an affiliate generally must be collateralized and certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, including the sale of assets, the payment of money or the provision of services, must be on terms and conditions that are substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing for comparable nonaffiliated transactions. In addition, the Bank generally may not purchase securities issued or underwritten by affiliates. 
 Loans to executive officers, directors or to any person who directly or indirectly, or acting through or in concert with one or more persons, owns, controls or has the power to vote more than 10% of any class of voting securities of a bank (10% Shareholders), are subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and their corresponding regulations (Regulation O) and Section 13(k) of the Exchange Act relating to the prohibition on personal loans to executives (which exempts financial institutions in compliance with the insider lending restrictions of Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act). Among other things, these loans must be made on terms substantially the same as those prevailing on transactions made to unaffiliated individuals and certain extensions of credit to those persons must first be approved in advance by a disinterested majority of the entire board of directors. Section 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act prohibits loans to any of those individuals where the aggregate amount exceeds an amount equal to 15% of an institutions unimpaired capital and surplus plus an additional 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus in the case of loans that are fully secured by readily marketable collateral, or when the aggregate amount on all of the extensions of credit outstanding to all of these persons would exceed the Banks unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus. Section 22(g) of the Federal Reserve Act identifies limited circumstances in which the Bank is permitted to extend credit to executive officers. 
 Prompt Corrective Action. Federal banking regulators are authorized and, under certain circumstances, required to take certain actions against banks that fail to meet their capital requirements. The federal bank regulatory agencies have additional enforcement authority with respect to undercapitalized depository institutions. Well capitalized institutions may generally operate without additional supervisory restriction. With respect to adequately capitalized institutions, such banks cannot normally pay dividends or make any capital contributions that would leave it undercapitalized, they cannot pay a management fee to a controlling person if, after paying the fee, it would be undercapitalized, and they cannot accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the bank has applied for and been granted a waiver by the FDIC. 
 Immediately upon becoming undercapitalized, a depository institution becomes subject to the provisions of Section 38 of the FDIA, which: (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees; (ii) require that the appropriate federal banking agency monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital; (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan; (iv) restrict the growth of the institutions assets; and (v) require prior approval of certain expansion proposals. The appropriate federal banking agency for an undercapitalized institution also may take any number of discretionary supervisory actions if the agency determines that any of these actions is necessary to resolve the problems of the institution at the least possible long-term cost to the DIF, subject in certain cases to specified procedures. These discretionary supervisory actions include: (i) requiring the institution to raise additional capital; (ii) restricting transactions with affiliates; (iii) requiring divestiture of the institution or the sale of the institution to a willing purchaser; and (iv) any other supervisory action that the agency deems appropriate. These and additional mandatory and permissive supervisory actions may be taken with respect to significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized institutions. The Bank met the definition of being well capitalized as of December 31, 2017. 
 As described above in The Bank  Capital Requirements, the Federal Reserves final rules to implement the Basel III regulatory capital reforms incorporate new requirements into the prompt corrective action framework.

Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The Bank is subject to the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977. The CRA imposes on financial institutions an affirmative and ongoing obligation to meet the credit needs of the local communities they serve, including low and moderate income neighborhoods. The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of a bank, to assess the banks record in meeting such credit needs. Furthermore, such assessment is also required of banks that have applied, among other things, to merge or consolidate with or acquire the assets or assume the liabilities of an insured depository institution, or to open or relocate a branch. In the case of a bank holding company applying for approval to acquire a bank or another bank holding company, the record of each subsidiary bank of the applicant bank holding company is subject to assessment in considering the application. Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of outstanding, satisfactory, needs to improve, or substantial non-compliance. The Bank received a satisfactory CRA rating in its most recent examination. 
 Privacy Legislation. Several laws, including the Right To Financial Privacy Act, and related regulations issued by the federal bank regulatory agencies, provide protections against the transfer and use of customer information by financial institutions. A financial institution must provide to its customers information regarding its policies and procedures with respect to the handling of customers personal information. Each institution must conduct an internal risk assessment of its ability to protect customer information. These privacy provisions generally prohibit a financial institution from providing a customers personal financial information to unaffiliated parties without prior notice and approval from the customer. 
 Bank Secrecy Act. The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), which is intended to require financial institutions to develop policies, procedures and practices to prevent and deter money laundering, mandates that every bank have a written, board-approved program that is reasonably designed to assure and monitor compliance with the BSA. The program must, at a minimum: (i) provide for a system of internal controls to assure ongoing compliance; (ii) provide for independent testing for compliance; (iii) designate an individual responsible for coordinating and monitoring day-to-day compliance; and (iv) provide training for appropriate personnel. In addition, banks are required to adopt a customer identification program as part of its BSA compliance program. Financial institutions are generally required to report cash transactions involving more than $10,000 to the U.S. Treasury Department. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, enacted in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, requires bank regulators to consider a financial institutions compliance with the BSA when reviewing applications from a financial institution. In May 2016, the regulations implementing the BSA were amended to explicitly include risk-based procedures for conducting ongoing customer due diligence, to include understanding the nature and purpose of customer relationships for the purpose of developing a customer risk profile. In addition, banks must identify and verify the identity of the beneficial owners of all legal entity customers (other than those that are excluded) at the time a new account is opened (other than accounts that are exempted). The Bank must comply with these amendments and new requirements by May 11, 2018. 
 Office of Foreign Assets Control. The U.S. Treasury Departments Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) is responsible for administering and enforcing economic and trade sanctions against specified foreign parties, including countries and regimes, foreign individuals and other foreign organizations and entities. OFAC publishes lists of prohibited parties that are regularly consulted by the Bank in the conduct of its business in order to assure compliance. The Bank is responsible for, among other things, blocking accounts of, and transactions with, prohibited parties identified by OFAC, avoiding unlicensed trade and financial transactions with such parties and reporting blocked transactions after their occurrence. Failure to comply with OFAC requirements could have serious legal, financial and reputational consequences for the Bank. 
 Consumer Financial Protection. The Bank is subject to a number of federal and state consumer protection laws that extensively govern its relationship with its customers. These laws include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Savings Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, the Expedited Funds Availability Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, the Service Members Civil Relief Act, laws governing flood insurance, federal and state laws prohibiting unfair and deceptive business practices, foreclosure laws, and various regulations that implement some or all of the foregoing. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. If the Bank fails to comply with these laws and regulations, it may be subject to various penalties. Failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also result in failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions the Bank may wish to pursue or being prohibited from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required. 
 The Dodd-Frank Act centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating a new agency, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the CFPB), and giving it responsibility for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer protection laws. The CFPB focuses on (i) risks to consumers and compliance with the federal consumer financial laws, (ii) the markets in which firms operate and risks to consumers posed by activities in those markets, (iii) depository institutions that offer a wide variety of consumer financial products and services, and (iv) non-depository companies that offer one or more consumer financial products or services. The CFPB is responsible for implementing, examining and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws for institutions with more than $10 billion of assets. While the Bank, like all banks, is subject to federal consumer protection rules enacted by the CFPB, because the Company and the Bank have total consolidated assets of $10 billion or less the Federal Reserve oversees the application to the Bank of most consumer protection aspects of the Dodd-Frank act and other laws and regulations.

The CFPB has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks, including, among other things, the authority to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices. Abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumers ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumers (i) lack of financial savvy, (ii) inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services, or (iii) reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumers interests. The CFPB can issue cease-and-desist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws. The CFPB may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or injunction. Further regulatory positions taken by the CFPB may influence how other regulatory agencies may apply the subject consumer financial protection laws and regulations. 
 Ability-to-Repay and Qualified Mortgage Rule. Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the CFPB issued a final rule on January 10, 2013 (effective on January 10, 2014), amending Regulation Z as implemented by the Truth in Lending Act, requiring mortgage lenders like the Bank to make a reasonable and good faith determination based on verified and documented information that a consumer applying for a mortgage loan has a reasonable ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Mortgage lenders are required to determine consumers ability to repay in one of two ways. The first alternative requires the mortgage lender to consider the following eight underwriting factors when making the credit decision: (i) current or reasonably expected income or assets; (ii) current employment status; (iii) the monthly payment on the covered transaction; (iv) the monthly payment on any simultaneous loan; (v) the monthly payment for mortgage-related obligations; (vi) current debt obligations, alimony, and child support; (vii) the monthly debt-to-income ratio or residual income; and (viii) credit history. Alternatively, the mortgage lender can originate qualified mortgages, which are entitled to a presumption that the creditor making the loan satisfied the ability-to-repay requirements. In general, a qualified mortgage is a mortgage loan without negative amortization, interest-only payments, balloon payments, or terms exceeding 30 years. In addition, to be a qualified mortgage the points and fees paid by a consumer cannot exceed 3% of the total loan amount. Qualified mortgages that are higher-priced (e.g. subprime loans) garner a rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability-to-repay rules, while qualified mortgages that are not higher-priced (e.g. prime loans) are given a safe harbor of compliance. The Bank is predominantly an originator of compliant qualified mortgages. 
 Cybersecurity. In March 2015, federal regulators issued two related statements regarding cybersecurity. One statement indicates that financial institutions should design multiple layers of security controls to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes also address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials, including security measures to reliably authenticate customers accessing internet-based services of the financial institution. The other statement indicates that a financial institutions management is expected to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure the rapid recovery, resumption and maintenance of the institutions operations after a cyber-attack involving destructive malware. A financial institution is also expected to develop appropriate processes to enable recovery of data and business operations and address rebuilding network capabilities and restoring data if the institution or its critical service providers fall victim to this type of cyber-attack. If the Company or the Bank fails to observe the regulatory guidance, it could be subject to various regulatory sanctions, including financial penalties. To date, neither the Company nor the Bank has experienced a significant compromise, significant data loss or any material financial losses related to cybersecurity attacks, but its systems and those of its customers and third-party service providers are under constant threat and it is possible that the Company or the Bank could experience a significant event in the future. Risks and exposures related to cybersecurity attacks are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future due to the rapidly evolving nature and sophistication of these threats, as well as due to the expanding use of Internet banking, mobile banking and other technology-based products and services by the Company and the Bank and its respective customers. 
 Incentive Compensation. In June 2010, the federal bank regulatory agencies issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of financial institutions do not undermine the safety and soundness of such institutions by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The Interagency Guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of financial institutions, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a financial institutions incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the institutions ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the financial institutions board of directors. 
 The Federal Reserve will review, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of financial institutions, such as the Company and the Bank, that are not large, complex banking organizations. These reviews will be tailored to each financial institution based on the scope and complexity of the institutions activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the institutions supervisory ratings, which can affect the institutions ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a financial institution if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the institutions safety and soundness and the financial institution is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies. At December 31, 2017, the Company and the Bank have not been made aware of any instances of non-compliance with the final guidance. 
 Tax Reform 
 On December 22, 2017, the President of United States signed into law the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017 (the Tax Reform Act). The legislation made key changes to the U.S. tax law, including the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the reduction in the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% under the Tax Reform Act, the Company revalued its ending net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2017 and recognized a provisional $1.3 million tax expense in the Companys consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017. The Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the new law and refining its calculations, which could affect the measurement of these assets and liabilities or give rise to new deferred tax amounts. The accounting is expected to be complete when the 2017 U.S. corporate income tax return is filed in 2018. 
Effect of Governmental Monetary Policies 
 The Companys operations are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the policies of various regulatory authorities. In particular, the Federal Reserve regulates money and credit conditions and interest rates to influence general economic conditions. These policies have a significant impact on overall growth and distribution of loans, investments and deposits; they affect interest rates charged on loans or paid for time and savings deposits. Federal Reserve monetary policies have had significant effects on the operating results of commercial banks, including the Bank, in the past and are expected to do so in the future. New appointments to the Federal Reserve could affect monetary policy and interest rates, and changes in fiscal policy could affect broader patterns of trade and economic growth.

Future Legislation and Regulation 
 Congress may enact legislation from time to time that affects the regulation of the financial services industry, and state legislatures may enact legislation from time to time affecting the regulation of financial institutions chartered by or operating in those states. Federal and state regulatory agencies also periodically propose and adopt changes to their regulations or change the manner in which existing regulations are applied. The substance or impact of pending or future legislation or regulation, or the application thereof, cannot be predicted, although enactment of the proposed legislation could impact the regulatory structure under which the Company and the Bank operate and may significantly increase costs, impede the efficiency of internal business processes, require an increase in regulatory capital, require modifications to business strategy, and limit the ability to pursue business opportunities in an efficient manner. A change in statutes, regulations or regulatory policies applicable to the Company or the Bank could have a material, adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of the Company and the Bank. 
Reporting Obligations under Securities Laws 
 The Company is subject to the periodic and other reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, including the filing of annual, quarterly and other reports with the SEC. The Company provides access to its SEC filings through the Regulatory Filings section of the Companys website at www.baybanks.com. The Companys SEC filings are posted and available at no cost on its website as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed electronically with the SEC.
