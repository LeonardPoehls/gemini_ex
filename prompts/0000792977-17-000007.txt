ITEM 1. BUSINESS:
Overview
AMAG Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was founded in 1981. We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and delivering important therapeutics, conducting clinical research in areas of unmet need and creating education and support programs for the patients and families we serve. Our currently marketed products support the health of patients in the areas of women’s health, anemia management and cancer supportive care, including Makena® (hydroxyprogesterone caproate injection), Feraheme® (ferumoxytol) for Intravenous (“IV”) use and MuGard® Mucoadhesive Oral Wound Rinse. Through services related to the preservation of umbilical cord blood stem cell and cord tissue units (the “CBR Services”) operated through Cord Blood Registry® (“CBR”), we also help families to preserve newborn stem cells, which are used today in transplant medicine for certain cancers and blood, immune and metabolic disorders, and which we believe have the potential to play a valuable role in the ongoing development of regenerative medicine. In addition, on February 2, 2017, we closed a license agreement in which we received the rights to research, develop and commercialize RekyndaTM (bremelanotide), which is being developed for the treatment of hypoactive sexual desire disorder (“HSDD”) in pre-menopausal women. On February 13, 2017, we signed a license agreement in which we will acquire the rights to market IntrarosaTM (prasterone) in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia, a common symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (“VVA”), due to menopause.
We intend to continue to expand the impact of these and future products and services for patients by delivering on our growth strategy, which includes organic growth, as well as the pursuit of products and companies that align with our existing therapeutic areas or those that could benefit from our proven core competencies. Currently, our primary sources of revenue are from product sales of Makena and Feraheme and service revenue from the CBR Services.
Our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the trading symbol “AMAG.”

Makena
Overview
Makena is the only FDA-approved drug indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth. We acquired the rights to Makena in connection with our acquisition of Lumara Health Inc. (“Lumara Health”) in November 2014. Additional details regarding our acquisition of Lumara Health can be found in Note C, “Business Combinations,” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Makena is an intramuscular injection administered weekly by a healthcare professional at a dose of 250 mg (1 mL) with treatment beginning between 16 weeks and 20 weeks and six days of gestation and continuing until 36 weeks and six days of gestation or delivery, whichever happens first. Makena is a progestin whose active ingredient is hydroxyprogesterone caproate (“HPC”), which is a synthetic chemical structurally related to progesterone. Progestins, such as HPC, and progesterone belong to a class of drugs called progestogens. Progestogens have been studied to reduce preterm birth and have shown varying results depending upon the subjects enrolled. The Society for Maternal Fetal Medicine (the “SMFM”) Publications Committee published clinical guidelines for the use of progestogens to reduce the risk of preterm birth in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in May 2012, and which were affirmed in 2014. The SMFM Clinical Guidelines recommend the use of an intramuscular HPC injection, such as Makena, to reduce the risk of recurrent preterm birth for clinically indicated patients. Further, in January 2017, the SMFM stated that vaginal progesterone should not be considered a substitute for hydroxyprogesterone caproate in women with a history of spontaneous preterm birth.
We sell Makena primarily to specialty pharmacies, specialty distributors, home infusion companies and pharmacies which, in turn, sell Makena to healthcare providers, hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery systems. In 2016, sales of Makena accounted for approximately 63% of our total net revenues. Makena was approved by the FDA in February 2011 and was granted orphan drug exclusivity through February 3, 2018. 
Preterm Birth
Preterm birth is defined as a birth prior to 37 weeks of pregnancy. According to the National Center for Health Statistics Report, in 2015, preterm births affected nearly 400,000 babies, or one of every ten infants born in the U.S. Although the causes of preterm births are not fully understood, certain women are at a greater risk for preterm birth, including those who have had a previous preterm birth, are pregnant with multiples or have certain uterine or cervical problems. High blood pressure, pregnancy complications (such as placental problems) and certain other health or lifestyle factors may also be contributing factors. Makena is indicated only for women with a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth who are pregnant with a single baby, which accounts for approximately 140,000 pregnancies annually in the U.S. 
Preterm birth can increase the risk of infant death and can also result in serious long-term health issues for the child, including respiratory problems, gastrointestinal conditions, cerebral palsy, developmental delays, and vision and hearing impairments. According to a 2007 report by the Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Understanding Premature Birth and Assuring Healthy Outcome, the annual societal economic cost associated with preterm birth is at least $26.2 billion and includes medical and healthcare costs for the baby, labor and delivery costs for the mother, early intervention and special education services, and costs associated with lost work and pay.
Post-Approval Commitments for Makena
Makena was approved under the provisions of the FDA’s “Subpart H” Accelerated Approval regulations. The Subpart H regulations allow certain drugs, for serious or life-threatening conditions, to be approved on the basis of surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval under Subpart H, the FDA required that Makena’s sponsor perform certain adequate and well-controlled post-approval clinical studies to verify and describe the clinical benefit of Makena as well as fulfill certain other post-approval commitments. We have completed a pharmacokinetic (“PK”) study of women taking Makena. In addition, the following clinical studies for Makena are currently ongoing: (a) an efficacy and safety clinical study of Makena and (b) a follow-up study of the babies born to mothers from the efficacy and safety clinical study. Given the patient population (i.e., pregnant women who are at high risk for recurrent preterm delivery based on their pregnancy history) and the informed risk of receiving a placebo instead of the active approved drug, the pool of prospective subjects for such clinical trials in the U.S. is small and we have therefore sought enrollment on a global scale. In response to our request to extend our agreed-upon completion dates for the ongoing clinical studies, the FDA approved a two-year extension to December 2018 and October 2020.

Next Generation Development Programs
We continue to advance our next generation development program for Makena, seeking to enhance the product profile for patients and their healthcare providers. As part of this program, in February 2016 the FDA approved a single-dose preservative-free formulation of Makena manufactured by the Pfizer CentreOne group of Pfizer, Inc., (“Pfizer”) (formerly Hospira, Inc.), who also manufactures our multidose vial of Makena. We began promoting the single-dose preservative-free formulation of Makena to physicians in the second quarter of 2016. In July 2016, we received approval of our prior approval supplement for Piramal Pharma Solutions (formerly Coldstream Laboratories, Inc.) to also manufacture the single-dose preservative-free formulation of Makena. 
We are developing an auto-injector device for subcutaneous administration of Makena (the “Makena auto-injector”), including chemistry, manufacturing and controls (“CMC”) development with Antares. During 2016, we met with the FDA to discuss our proposed development and regulatory strategy, focusing on our plans to conduct a definitive PK study designed to demonstrate comparable bioavailability of the subcutaneous Makena auto-injector to the current intramuscular (“IM”) injection form of Makena. We believe that demonstrating bioequivalence for area under the curve is the most relevant PK parameter for Makena. In October 2016, we initiated an open label parallel study which enrolled approximately 120 healthy post-menopausal women in a 1:1 randomization. In February 2017, we announced topline results from this definitive PK study. Makena administered subcutaneously demonstrated bioequivalence to the IM injection on area under the curve (“AUC”) (AUC0-to-inf 2,386 ng/mL compared to 2,086 ng/mL) with the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of AUC (105.17 to 124.39) falling within the 80% to 125% range, which the FDA uses to define bioequivalence. The mean maximum or peak plasma concentration (“Cmax”) for Makena administered subcutaneously was slightly higher than for the IM (7.3 ng/mL compared to 6.3 ng/mL) with the 90% confidence interval for the ratio of Cmax (96.6% to 138.7%) falling outside of the bioequivalence range of 80% to 125%. No serious adverse events were reported and the drug was generally well tolerated, although there was a higher reporting rate of injection site related adverse events (e.g. transient burning/stinging sensation), in the subcutaneous injection arm of the study. Similar observations were also reported in the subcutaneous arm of our open label, parallel comparative pain study (also initiated in October 2016), which we recently elected to discontinue. We will not be requesting orphan exclusivity as part of the sNDA filing and, therefore, anticipate a six-month FDA review timeline. There are multiple device and drug-device combination patents and patent applications in-licensed from Antares which relate to the subcutaneous Makena auto-injector and we intend to request Orange Book listing of eligible Antares drug-device patents. We expect to file an sNDA for approval of the Makena auto-injector in the second quarter of 2017. 
CBR Services
Overview
CBR is the largest private newborn stem cell bank in the world and offers pregnant women and their families the ability to preserve their newborns’ umbilical cord blood and cord tissue for potential future use (the “CBR Services”). We acquired CBR from CBR Acquisition Holdings in August 2015. Additional details regarding our acquisition of CBR can be found in Note C, “Business Combinations,” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
We market and sell the CBR Services directly to consumers, who pay for the services directly, as third-party insurance and reimbursement are not available. Even though our business is limited to the sale of our services required to collect, process, and store umbilical cord blood stem cells and cord tissue, the FDA regulates them as products. 
The CBR Services include the collection, processing and storage of both umbilical cord blood and cord tissue. As of December 31, 2016, CBR stored approximately 665,000 umbilical cord blood and cord tissue units, which we estimate to represent approximately more than half of all privately stored cord blood and cord tissue units in the U.S. In 2016, revenue from the CBR Services accounted for approximately 19% of our total net revenues.
CBR is the first family newborn stem cell bank to partner with reputable research institutions on FDA-regulated clinical trials exploring the potential regenerative ability of cord blood stem cells to help treat conditions that have no cure today, including acquired hearing loss, autism and cerebral palsy. In addition, in an effort to realize the full potential of newborn stem cells, CBR’s Newborn Possibilities Program® provides free processing and five years of free storage of cord blood and cord tissue for families with a qualifying medical need, as further discussed below. 
In 2005, the Institute of Medicine (“IOM”) issued a comprehensive report to Congress on cord blood banking. The report contained clear recommendations that healthcare professionals should provide all expectant parents with fair and balanced education on cord blood preservation prior to labor and delivery, thereby enabling families to make an informed decision regarding their options: preserve their newborns’ stem cells for potential future family use, donate the cells for public use or 
5

research, or dispose of the cord blood. The IOM report has helped guide health policy at the state level and to date, 29 states have passed some form of cord blood education legislation, the majority of which follow the IOM recommendations. Several other states are in various stages of developing similar legislation to help inform healthcare providers and expectant parents of all medically appropriate options for preserving cord blood stem cells In support of this legislation, CBR collaborates with outside organizations to develop education initiatives to provide quality, relevant information to expectant parents, and medical professionals, including courses where continuing medical education credits can be earned, regarding new parents’ options for newborn stem cell preservation. 
CBR has been accredited by the AABB (formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks) since 1998 and the company’s quality standards have been recognized through International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 9001:2008 certification - the global business standard for quality. In addition, CBR is also certified by CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments), a federal program to ensure quality laboratory testing. We believe that maintaining these accreditations, while not a requirement for preserving stem cells, are an important indicator of the quality of our services and the CBR brand.
Cord Blood and Cord Tissue
Cord blood comes from a newborn’s umbilical cord and can only be collected immediately after birth. It contains hematopoietic stem cells, which have been used in the treatment of over 80 diseases, including various cancers, blood disorders, immune disorders and metabolic disorders. Cord blood also contains a variety of other types of stem cells and monocytes that are being investigated for a variety of other therapeutic applications. Cord tissue contains mesenchymal stem cells, which are unique stem cells that are being investigated for their ability to help repair and heal the body in different ways than cord blood stem cells. Although there are not yet any conditions proven to be treatable with cord tissue, these cells have potential for use in regenerative medicine and are currently being evaluated in over 30 clinical trials outside of the U.S. for their potential to treat heart disease, stroke and spinal cord damage, among other conditions. Approximately 79% of the stem cell units released by CBR have been used for experimental regenerative therapies.
Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in patients with CKD
Overview
Feraheme was approved for marketing by the FDA in June 2009 for use as an IV iron replacement therapy for the treatment of IDA in adult patients with CKD. 
While Feraheme is approved for IDA in all stages of CKD, beginning in 2010, due to changes in the way the federal government reimburses providers for the care of dialysis patients, the utilization of Feraheme shifted to non-dialysis patients. The non-dialysis CKD IDA market is made up of a range of healthcare providers who administer IV iron, including hematologists and oncologists and nephrologists, both in outpatient and hospital settings and other end-users who treat IDA patients with CKD. We anticipate the majority of all Feraheme utilization will continue to be in the non-dialysis CKD patient population if and until Feraheme receives a broader label to include non-CKD patients. We began selling Feraheme in the U.S. in July 2009 through our commercial organization, including a specialty sales force. We sell Feraheme to authorized wholesalers and specialty distributors, who, in turn, sell Feraheme to healthcare providers who administer Feraheme primarily within hospitals, hematology and oncology centers and nephrology clinics. In 2016, sales of Feraheme accounted for approximately 18% of our total net revenues. 
On February 5, 2016, we received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter regarding an Abbreviated New Drug Application (an “ANDA”) submitted to the FDA by Sandoz Inc. (“Sandoz”) requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use and sale of a generic version of ferumoxytol. A generic version of Feraheme can be marketed only with the approval of the FDA of the respective application for such generic version. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, as amended (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”) requires an ANDA applicant whose proposed drug is a generic version of a previously-approved drug listed in the FDA publication, “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also known as the “Orange Book,” to certify to any patents listed in the Orange Book for the previously-approved drug and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification, to notify the owner of the approved application and the relevant patent-holder. The Paragraph IV certification notice is required to contain a detailed factual and legal statement explaining the basis for the applicant’s opinion that the proposed product does not infringe the subject patents, that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, or both. If a patent infringement suit is filed within 45 days of receipt of the Paragraph IV notice, a so-called 30-month stay is triggered that generally prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the expiration of the 30-month stay period, conclusion of the litigation in the generic applicant’s favor, or expiration of the patent, whichever is earlier. In its notice letter, Sandoz claims that our ferumoxytol patents are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed by Sandoz’s manufacture, 
6

use, sale or offer for sale of the generic version. In March 2016, we initiated a patent infringement suit alleging that Sandoz’ ANDA filing itself constituted an act of infringement and that if it is approved, the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or importation of Sandoz’ ferumoxytol products would infringe our patents. By the filing of this complaint, we believe a 30-month stay was triggered and that the FDA is prohibited from granting approval of Sandoz’ application until the earliest of 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice of certification by the patent owner, the conclusion of litigation in the generic’s favor, or expiration of the patent(s). If the litigation is resolved in favor of the applicant or the challenged patent expires during the 30 months stay period, the stay is lifted and the FDA may thereafter approve the application based on the applicable standards for approval. On May 2, 2016, Sandoz filed a response to our patent infringement suit and the trial is scheduled for March 12, 2018. Any future unfavorable outcome in this matter could negatively affect the magnitude and timing of future Feraheme revenues. We intend to vigorously enforce our intellectual property rights relating to ferumoxytol. The ANDA process is discussed in more detail below under the heading “Pharmaceutical Product Approval Process - Abbreviated New Drug Application.”
Chronic kidney disease, anemia, and iron deficiency 
CKD is a progressive condition that leads to chronic and permanent loss of kidney function. It contributes to the development of many complications, including anemia, hypertension, fluid and electrolyte imbalances, acid/base abnormalities, bone disease and cardiovascular disease. According to the National Kidney Foundation, 26 million Americans are living with CKD and millions of others are at risk. Anemia, a common condition among CKD patients, is associated with cardiovascular complications, decreased quality of life, hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Anemia develops early during the course of CKD and worsens with advancing kidney disease. Patients with anemia can look pale, feel fatigued, experience shortness of breath, low energy, headaches, palpitations or chest pains, and have a loss of appetite, trouble sleeping and trouble concentrating. Anemia in CKD patients is most often caused by an insufficient production of erythropoietin, a hormone made by the kidneys which tells the body to produce red blood cells, and iron deficiency, due to inadequate iron intake, blood loss or because the body cannot use iron stores. Regardless of the cause of the iron deficiency, iron replacement therapy is essential to increase iron stores and raise hemoglobin levels. Iron is also essential for effective treatment with erythropoiesis stimulating agents (“ESAs”), which are commonly used in anemic patients to stimulate red blood cell production. Based on data contained in a 2009 publication in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, we estimate that there are at least 1.6 million adults in the U.S. diagnosed with IDA in stages 3 through 5 of CKD, who are patients in the mid to later stages of CKD but not yet on dialysis and could therefore benefit from receiving IV iron.
Currently there are two methods of iron therapy used to treat IDA in CKD patients: oral iron supplements and IV iron. The National Kidney Foundation’s Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines recommend either oral or IV iron for peritoneal dialysis patients and non-dialysis patients with stages 1 through 5 of CKD. Oral iron is currently the first-line iron replacement therapy for most physicians. However, oral iron supplements are poorly absorbed by many patients, which may adversely impact their effectiveness, and are associated with certain side effects, such as constipation, diarrhea, and cramping, that may adversely affect patient compliance in using such products. In addition, it can take an extended time for hemoglobin levels to improve following the initiation of oral iron treatment, and even then the targeted hemoglobin levels may not be reached. Conversely, iron given intravenously allows larger amounts of iron to be provided to patients in a shorter time frame while avoiding many of the side effects and treatment compliance issues associated with oral iron, and can result in faster rises in hemoglobin levels. The administration of IV iron has been shown to be effective in treating anemia either when used alone or in combination with an ESA. Current treatment guidelines indicate that treating first with IV iron alone may delay or reduce the need for ESA therapy. Iron supplementation is widely used in CKD patients to treat iron deficiency, prevent its development in ESA-treated patients, raise hemoglobin levels in the presence or absence of ESA treatment, and reduce ESA doses in patients receiving ESA treatment. We believe that IV iron is underutilized in non-dialysis CKD patients who are diagnosed with IDA, and thus a significant opportunity remains to grow the market for IV iron in this patient population.
Post-Marketing Commitments of Feraheme in CKD 
We had initiated a randomized, active-controlled pediatric study of Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in pediatric CKD patients to meet our FDA post-approval Pediatric Research Equity Act requirement to support pediatric labeling of Feraheme in the U.S. The study covered both dialysis-dependent and non-dialysis dependent CKD pediatric patients and was intended to assess the safety and efficacy of Feraheme treatment as compared to oral iron in approximately 288 pediatric patients. During 2015, we terminated this trial due to difficulty in enrollment. In December 2016, we met with the FDA to develop a plan forward in order to satisfy this post-approval commitment for Feraheme and recently proposed a protocol to the FDA for a new pediatric study.

Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in a broad range of patients
IDA not associated with CKD is widely prevalent in many different patient populations. For many of these patients, treatment with oral iron is unsatisfactory. In the U.S., over one million grams of IV iron were administered for the treatment of non-dialysis patients with IDA in 2016. We believe that approximately half, or 500,000 grams, of the IV iron administered was for the treatment of non-dialysis patients with CKD and the other half was for non-CKD patients with IDA due to other causes, including patients with gastrointestinal diseases or disorders, abnormal uterine bleeding, inflammatory diseases, and chemotherapy-induced anemia. It is estimated that more than 4.5 million patients in the U.S. have IDA (CKD and non-CKD) and we estimate that a small fraction of these non-dialysis patients who are diagnosed with IDA regardless of the underlying cause are currently being treated with IV iron. 
In December 2016, in order to support an sNDA seeking approval for Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in adult patients who had failed or could not tolerate oral iron, or in whom oral iron was contraindicated, we completed enrollment in a randomized, double-blind multicenter non-inferiority trial that will evaluate the incidence of moderate-to-severe hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylaxis) and moderate-to-severe hypotension with Feraheme compared to ferric carboxymaltose infusion (the “Feraheme comparator trial”). Approximately 2,000 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into one of two treatment groups, those receiving 1.02 grams of Feraheme IV infusion or those receiving 1.5 grams of ferric carboxymaltose IV infusion. As background, in December 2012, we submitted an sNDA to the FDA seeking approval for this broader label, which included data from two controlled, multi-center Phase 3 clinical trials, including more than 1,400 patients, which evaluated the safety and efficacy of ferumoxytol for the treatment of IDA in this broader patient population. Both studies met the primary efficacy endpoints related to improvements in hemoglobin. In January 2014, we received a complete response letter from the FDA for the sNDA informing us that our sNDA could not be approved in its present form and stating that we had not provided sufficient information to permit labeling of Feraheme for safe and effective use for the proposed broader indication. The FDA suggested, among other things, that we submit additional clinical trial data in the proposed broad IDA patient population and, following discussions with the FDA, we determined to undertake the Feraheme comparator trial in pursuit of the broader indication. We currently expect to file an sNDA for this broader indication in mid-2017. 

MuGard
MuGard is indicated for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis (that may be caused by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) and all types of oral wounds (mouth sores and injuries), including certain ulcers/canker sores and traumatic ulcers, such as those caused by oral surgery or ill-fitting dentures or braces. We acquired the U.S. commercial rights to MuGard under a license agreement with Abeona in June 2013. (the “MuGard Rights”) MuGard was launched in the U.S. by Abeona in 2010 after receiving 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Additional details regarding the acquisition of the MuGard Rights can be found in Note Q, “Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements,” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Based on interactions with government payors during 2016, we determined that broader reimbursement coverage for MuGard by was unlikely and we assessed the MuGard Rights for potential impairment. From this assessment, we concluded that based on the lack of broad reimbursement and insurance coverage for MuGard and the resulting decrease in expected revenues and cash flows, the projected undiscounted cash flows were less than the book value, indicating impairment of this intangible asset. As a result of an analysis of the fair value of the net MuGard Rights intangible asset as compared to its recorded book value, we recognized an impairment charge for the full $15.7 million net intangible asset in 2016. 
Rekynda
Overview
On January 8, 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Palatin License Agreement”) with Palatin Technologies, Inc. (“Palatin”) under which we acquired (a) an exclusive license in all countries of North America (the “Rekynda Territory”), with the right to grant sub-licenses, to research, develop and commercialize Rekynda and any other products containing bremelanotide (collectively, the “Rekynda Products”), an investigational product designed to be an on-demand treatment for HSDD in pre-menopausal women, (b) a worldwide non-exclusive license, with the right to grant sub-licenses, to manufacture the Rekynda Products, and (c) a non-exclusive license in all countries outside the Rekynda Territory, with the right to grant sub-licenses, to research, develop and manufacture (but not commercialize) the Rekynda Products. Following the satisfaction of the conditions to closing under the Palatin License Agreement, the transaction closed on February 2, 2017. Additional details regarding the Palatin License Agreement can be found below under the heading “Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements-Palatin.”

Rekynda, bremelanotide, is a melanocortin-4 receptor agonist designed to activate pathways in the brain that are involved in the body’s normal sexual responses, which is currently being developed for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women. Rekynda is designed to be an on-demand therapy given prior to anticipated sexual activity and is self-administrated by the patient in the thigh or abdomen via a single-use subcutaneous auto-injector. Two recently completed Phase 3 Rekynda studies conducted by Palatin for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women met the pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints of median improvement in desire and decrease in distress associated with low sexual desire as measured using validated patient-reported outcome instruments. Both trials consisted of double-blind placebo-controlled, randomized parallel group studies comparing a subcutaneous dose of 1.75 mg Rekynda versus placebo, in each case, delivered via an auto-injector. The co-primary endpoints for these trials were evaluated using Question One and Two of the Female Sexual Function Index: Desire Domain (“FSFI-D”) and Female Sexual Distress Scale-Desires/Arousal/Orgasm (“FSDS-DAO”) Item 13 scores. For women taking Rekynda compared to placebo, the change in FSFI-D was measured using the median change and showed statistically significant improvement in measures of desire in both Phase 3 studies, with one study demonstrating a median change of 0.60 vs. 0.00 and p=0.0002, and the other study demonstrating a median change of 0.60 vs. 0.00 and p<0.0001. These studies also demonstrated statistically significant mean changes in FSFI-D for women taking Rekynda compared to placebo of 0.54 vs. 0.24 and 0.63 vs. 0.21. The FSDS-DAO Item 13 scores were also measured using the median change and showed statistically significant decreases in measures of distress related to low sexual desire in both Phase 3 studies for women taking Rekynda compared to placebo, with one study demonstrating a median change of -1.0 vs. 0.0 and p<0.0001, and the other study demonstrating a median change of -1.0 vs. 0.0 and p=0.0057. These studies also demonstrated statistically significant mean changes in FSDS-DAO Item 13 scores for women taking Rekynda compared to placebo of -0.74 vs. -0.35 and -0.71 vs. -0.41. The change in the number of satisfying sexual events, a key secondary endpoint, was not significantly different from placebo in either clinical trial. Each trial consisted of over 600 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the treatment arm or placebo, each with a 24 week evaluation period. The most frequent adverse events were nausea, flushing and headache, which were generally mild-to-moderate in severity. Approximately 18% of patients discontinued participation in the Rekynda arm due to adverse events in both studies. Women in the trials had the option, after completion of the randomized trial, to continue in an ongoing open-label safety extension study for an additional 52 weeks, which is intended to gather additional data on the safety of long-term and repeated use of Rekynda. Nearly 80% of patients who completed the randomized portion of the study elected to remain in the ongoing open-label portion of the study. All of the patients in the extension study are receiving Rekynda. Palatin is continuing to oversee the conduct of the extension study, which we expect to be completed in the second half of 2017. We currently expect to submit an NDA in early 2018 following completion of multiple Phase 1 drug interaction and safety pharmacology studies, including an abuse-liability study and drug-to-drug interaction studies with anti-hypertensive and anti-arrhythmic therapies, as well as certain chemistry, manufacturing and controls activities, including drug product process validation studies by Palatin. Palatin will continue to conduct the remaining studies through clinical research organizations, and we will oversee such development work to support our filing an NDA for Rekynda for the treatment of HSDD.
The Phase 3 Rekynda studies were predicated on the results of a Phase 2b clinical study of bremelanotide conducted by Palatin. The Phase 2b clinical study was a multicenter, placebo-controlled, randomized, parallel group, dose-finding trial testing three dose levels, 0.75 mg, 1.25 mg and 1.75 mg, of subcutaneously administered bremelanotide against placebo in pre-menopausal women diagnosed with HSDD, female sexual arousal disorder or both. Palatin reported that the 1.75 mg dose demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant results for all predefined endpoints and was well-tolerated. 
Female Sexual Dysfunction and Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder
Female sexual dysfunction (“FSD”) is defined as persistent or recurring problems during one or more of the stages of a woman's sexual response, which, as a result, causes distress. HSDD is the most common type of FSD and is characterized by a decreased sexual desire with significant personal distress or interpersonal difficulties as a result of the lack of desire. Studies suggest that approximately 15 million women in the U.S. are affected by HSDD and approximately 5.8 million of these women are pre-menopausal and have a primary diagnosis of HSDD. Despite one FDA-approved HSDD therapy on the market today for pre-menopausal women, we believe that patient awareness and understanding of the condition is extremely low, and that few women currently seek treatment. HSDD may go undiagnosed due to various factors such as embarrassment or stigma, lack of awareness of low sexual desire as a medical condition or attribution to other external factors, such as stress or fatigue. Recent market research commissioned by Palatin indicates that 95% of pre-menopausal women suffering from HSDD are unaware that it is a treatable medical condition. As a result, assuming FDA approval of our NDA, we expect that the initial focus of our Rekynda commercialization efforts will be raising awareness and education about the disease for both healthcare professionals and patients with this disorder.

Intrarosa
Overview
On February 13, 2017, we entered into a license agreement (the “Endoceutics License Agreement”) with Endoceutics, Inc. (“Endoceutics”) pursuant to which Endoceutics has agreed to grant to us rights to Intrarosa, an FDA-approved product for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia (pain during sexual intercourse), a symptom of VVA due to menopause. The Endoceutics License Agreement grants us the right to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing dehydroepiandrosterone (“DHEA”), including Intrarosa, at dosage strengths of 13 mg or less per dose and formulated for intravaginal delivery, excluding any dosage strengths over 13 mg per dose and combinations with other active pharmaceutical ingredients, in the U.S. for the treatment of VVA and FSD. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Endoceutics License Agreement is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. At closing, we and Endoceutics will also enter into an exclusive commercial supply agreement, under which Endoceutics will supply Intrarosa to us. 
In addition to commercializing Intrarosa for VVA, we have also committed to co-fund a Phase 3 clinical program, which would be conducted by Endoceutics to support regulatory approval of Intrarosa for the treatment of certain types of FSD in post-menopausal women. We and Endoceutics have agreed to share the direct costs related to such studies with our investment not to exceed $20.0 million. In addition, we have also committed to a minimum marketing spend in 2017 for Intrarosa. Additional details regarding the Endoceutics License Agreement can be found below under the heading “Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements-Pending Endoceutics License Agreement.”
Intrarosa is the only FDA-approved, vaginally administered, daily non-estrogen steroid, which is prescribed for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia. Intrarosa contains prasterone, also known as DHEA. DHEA is an inactive endogenous precursor of hormones, which is converted locally into androgens and estrogens to help restore the vaginal tissue as indicated by improvements in the percentage of superficial cells, parabasal cells, and pH. The mechanism of action is not fully established. The effectiveness of Intrarosa on moderate-to-severe dyspareunia was examined in two primary 12-week placebo-controlled efficacy trials. All women in both studies were assessed for improvement from baseline to week 12 for four co-primary efficacy endpoints: most bothersome moderate-to-severe symptom of dyspareunia, the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, the percentage of parabasal cells, and vaginal pH. All primary endpoints were statistically significant. Women taking Intrarosa experienced a significant reduction in moderate-to-severe dyspareunia, as well as statistically significant improvements in the percentage of vaginal superficial cells, parabasal cells and vaginal pH. 
A 52-week long-term safety study of 422 post-menopausal women showed no evidence of endometrial hyperplasia, a potential precursor to endometrial cancer that is associated with the use of unopposed estrogen. Vaginal discharge and atypical pap smears were the most common adverse reactions and were were reported as a treatment-emergent adverse reaction in at least 2% of women taking Intrarosa. Intrarosa is contraindicated in women with undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding. In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions were vaginal discharge and abnormal pap smear. The label for Intrarosa contains a precaution that it has not been studied in women with a history of breast cancer. 
Vulvar and Vaginal Atrophy
In the U.S., there are an estimated 64 million post-menopausal women, with approximately half, or 32 million, of those women suffering from symptoms VVA, which we estimate is an approximately $1.0 billion-a-year market. Of the 32 million women who suffer from symptoms of VVA, there are an estimated 44% to 78% who report symptoms of dyspareunia, a common symptom of VVA. 
As a non-estrogen-based product, Intrarosa is not subject to the labeling restrictions associated with the results of the Women’s Health Initiative (WHI), led to class labeling for all estrogen containing products, including a boxed safety warning of the increased risk of certain types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and probable dementia associated with the use of exogenous estrogen. Intrarosa is not subject to the boxed warning and dosing restrictions of all other currently approved prescription products to treat VVA.
We plan to invest in a new sales force of approximately 150 sales representatives dedicated to support the Intrarosa launch, which we anticipate to take place in mid-2017. This new sales force will also allow for additional flexibility as our portfolio evolves, including opportunities for Intrarosa label expansion, preparing for the potential launch of Rekynda and for future products acquired in the women’s health space over time.

Collaboration, License and Other Strategic Agreements 
Palatin
Under the terms of the Palatin License Agreement, which closed on February 2, 2017, we paid Palatin $60.0 million as a one-time upfront payment. We will also reimburse Palatin up to an aggregate amount of $25.0 million for all reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket expenses incurred by Palatin in connection with the development and regulatory activities necessary to submit an NDA for Rekynda for the treatment of HSDD, which we expect to incur in 2017. In addition, the Palatin License Agreement provides for future contingent payments of (a) up to $80.0 million upon achievement of certain regulatory milestones, including FDA approval, and (b) up to $300.0 million of aggregate sales milestone payments upon the achievement of certain annual net sales milestones over the course of the license. The first sales milestone of $25.0 million will be triggered when Rekynda annual net sales exceed $250.0 million. We are also obligated to pay Palatin tiered royalties on annual net sales of the Rekynda Products, on a product-by-product basis, in the Rekynda Territory ranging from the high-single digits to the low double-digits. The royalties will expire on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the latest to occur of (a) the earliest date on which there are no valid claims of Palatin patent rights covering such Rekynda Product in such country, (b) the expiration of the regulatory exclusivity period for such Rekynda Product in such country and (c) 10 years following the first commercial sale of such Rekynda Product in such country. These royalties are subject to reduction in the event that: (i) we must license additional third party intellectual property in order to develop, manufacture or commercialize a Rekynda Product or (ii) generic competition occurs with respect to a Rekynda Product in a given country, subject to an aggregate cap on such deductions of royalties otherwise payable to Palatin. After the expiration of the applicable royalties for any Rekynda Product in a given country, the license for such Rekynda Product in such country would become a fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual and irrevocable license.
The Palatin License Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations due thereunder unless earlier terminated in accordance with the agreement. In addition, we have the right to terminate the Palatin License Agreement without cause, in its entirety or on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon at least 180 days’ prior written notice to Palatin. Either party may terminate the Palatin License Agreement for cause if the other party materially breaches or defaults in the performance of its obligations, and, if curable, such material breach remains uncured for 90 days.
Velo 
In July 2015, we entered into an option agreement with Velo, a privately held life-sciences company that granted us an option to acquire the rights to an orphan drug candidate, DIF, a polyclonal antibody in clinical development for the treatment of severe preeclampsia in pregnant women. We made an upfront payment of $10.0 million in the third quarter of 2015 for the option to acquire the global rights to the DIF program (the “DIF Rights”). DIF has been granted both orphan drug and fast-track review designations by the FDA for use in treating severe preeclampsia. Under the option agreement, Velo will complete a dose ranging study and a Phase 2b/3a clinical study, which we expect to begin in the first quarter of 2017. Following the conclusion of the DIF Phase 2b/3a study, we may terminate, or, for additional consideration, exercise or extend, our option to acquire the DIF Rights. If we exercise the option to acquire the DIF Rights, we would be responsible for additional costs in pursuing FDA approval, and would be obligated to pay to Velo certain milestone payments and single-digit royalties based on regulatory approval and commercial sales of the product. If we exercise the option, we will be responsible for payments totaling up to $65.0 million (including the payment of the option exercise price and the regulatory milestone payments) and up to an additional $250.0 million in sales milestone payments based on the achievement of annual sales milestones at targets ranging from $100.0 million to $900.0 million. 
Antares
Through our acquisition of Lumara Health, we are party to a development and license agreement with Antares (the “Antares Agreement”), which grants us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license, with the right to sublicense, to certain intellectual property rights, including know-how, patents and trademarks, to develop, use, sell, offer for sale and import and export the Makena auto-injector, an Antares’ auto-injection system for use with HPC. In consideration for the license, to support joint meetings and a development strategy with the FDA, and for initial tooling and process validation, Lumara Health paid Antares an up-front payment in October 2014. Under the Antares Agreement, we are responsible for the clinical development and preparation, submission and maintenance of all regulatory applications in each country where we desire to market and sell the Makena auto-injector, including the U.S. We are required to pay royalties to Antares on net sales of the Makena auto-injector commencing on the launch of the Makena auto-injector in a particular country until the Makena auto-injector is no longer sold or offered for sale in such country (the “Antares Royalty Term”). The royalty rates range from high single digit to low double digits and are tiered based on levels of net sales of the Makena auto-injector and decrease after the expiration of licensed patents or where there are generic equivalents to the Makena auto-injector being sold in a particular 
11

country. Antares is the exclusive supplier of our requirements for the auto-injection system devices for the Makena auto-injector and Antares remains responsible for the manufacture and supply of the devices and assembly of the Makena auto-injector. We are responsible for the supply of the drug in pre-filled syringes to be used in the assembly of the finished auto-injector product. The development and license agreement terminates at the end of the Antares Royalty Term, but is subject to early termination by us for convenience, by Antares if we do not submit regulatory filings in the U.S. by a certain date and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party.
Abeona
In June 2013, we entered into a license agreement (the "MuGard License Agreement") with under which Abeona granted us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, with the right to grant sublicenses, to certain intellectual property rights, including know-how, patents and trademarks, to use, import, offer for sale, sell, manufacture and commercialize MuGard in the U.S. and its territories (the “MuGard Territory”) for the management of oral mucositis/stomatitis (that may be caused by radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy) and all types of oral wounds (mouth sores and injuries), including certain ulcers/canker sores and traumatic ulcers, such as those caused by oral surgery or ill-fitting dentures or braces.
In consideration for the license, we paid Abeona an upfront license fee of $3.3 million in June 2013. We are required to pay royalties to Abeona on net sales of MuGard until the later of (a) the expiration of the licensed patents or (b) the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale of MuGard in the MuGard Territory (the “MuGard Royalty Term”). These tiered, double-digit royalty rates decrease after the expiration of the licensed patents and are subject to off-set against certain of our expenses. After the expiration of the MuGard Royalty Term, the license shall become a fully paid-up, royalty-free and perpetual license in the MuGard Territory.
Abeona remains responsible for the manufacture of MuGard and we have entered into a quality agreement and a supply agreement under which we purchase MuGard inventory from them. Our inventory purchases are at the price actually paid by Abeona to purchase it from a third-party plus a mark-up to cover administration, handling and overhead.
Abeona is responsible for maintenance of the licensed patents at its own expense, and we retain the first right to enforce any licensed patent against third-party infringement. The MuGard License Agreement terminates at the end of the MuGard Royalty Term, but is subject to early termination by us for convenience and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party.
Pending Endoceutics License Agreement 
Under the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, which we entered into with Endoceutics on February 13, 2017, Endoceutics has agreed to grant to us rights to Intrarosa, an FDA-approved product for the treatment of moderate-to-severe dyspareunia. The Endoceutics License Agreement grants us the right to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products containing DHEA, including Intrarosa, at dosage strengths of 13 mg or less per dose and formulated for intravaginal delivery, excluding any dosage strengths over 13 mg per dose and combinations with other active pharmaceutical ingredients, in the U.S. for the treatment of VVA and FSD. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the Endoceutics License Agreement (the “Effective Date”) is subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. 
Subject to the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, Endoceutics has agreed to conduct clinical studies for the use of Intrarosa in FSD to support an application for regulatory approval for Intrarosa for the treatment of FSD in the U.S. We and Endoceutics have agreed to share the direct costs related to such studies based upon a negotiated allocation with us funding up to $20.0 million. We may, with Endoceutics’ consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), conduct any other studies of Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA and FSD anywhere in the world for the purpose of obtaining or maintaining regulatory approval of or commercializing Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA or FSD in the U.S. All data generated in connection with the above described studies would be owned by Endoceutics and licensed to us pursuant to the Endoceutics License Agreement.
We will have the exclusive right to commercialize Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA or FSD in the U.S., subject to the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, including having final decision making authority with respect to commercial strategy, pricing and reimbursement and other commercialization matters. We have agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to market, promote and otherwise commercialize Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA or FSD in the U.S., including a commitment to a minimum marketing spend for Intrarosa in 2017. Endoceutics has the right to directly conduct, itself or through its affiliates or subcontractors, additional commercialization activities for Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA or FSD in the U.S., which scope of activities will be agreed to by the parties acting reasonably and in good faith, and has the right to 
12

conduct activities related generally to the field of intracrinology, in each case, subject to our right to withhold approval in certain instances. 

Upon Closing, we will make an upfront payment of $50.0 million and, subject to certain conditions, will issue 600,000 shares of unregistered common stock, to Endoceutics, 300,000 of which will be subject to a 180-day lock-up provision, and the other 300,000 of which will be subject to a one-year lock-up provision. We have also agreed to make a payment to Endoceutics of up to $10.0 million upon the delivery of launch quantities of Intrarosa and a payment of $10.0 million on the first anniversary of the closing. In addition, we have also agreed to pay tiered royalties to Endoceutics equal to a percentage of net sales of Intrarosa in the U.S. ranging from mid-teens (for calendar year net sales up to $150.0 million) to mid twenty percent (for any calendar year net sales that exceed $1 billion) (such royalty rate to be dependent on the aggregate annual net sales of Intrarosa) for the commercial life of Intrarosa, with deductions (a) after the later of (i) the expiration date of the last to expire of a licensed patent containing a valid patent claim or (ii) ten years after the first commercial sale of Intrarosa for the treatment of VVA or FSD in the U.S., (b) for generic competition and (c) for third party payments. Endoceutics is also eligible to receive certain sales milestone payments, including a first sales milestone payment of $15.0 million, which would be triggered when Intrarosa annual net U.S. sales exceed $150.0 million, and a second milestone payment of $30.0 million, which would be triggered when annual net U.S. sales exceed $300.0 million. If annual net U.S. sales exceed $500.0 million, there are additional sales milestone payments totaling up to $850.0 million, which would be triggered at various increasing sales thresholds. 
In connection with the Endoceutics License Agreement, we and Endoceutics have agreed to enter into an exclusive commercial supply agreement on or about the Effective Date, pursuant to which Endoceutics, itself or through affiliates or contract manufacturers, would agree to manufacture and supply Intrarosa to us (the “Supply Agreement”) and would be our exclusive supplier of Intrarosa in the U.S., subject to certain rights for us to manufacture and supply Intrarosa in the event of a cessation notice or supply failure (as such terms are defined in the Supply Agreement). Under the Supply Agreement, Endoceutics would maintain at all times a second source supplier for the manufacture of DHEA and the drug product and identify and validate and transfer manufacturing intellectual property to the second source supplier within two years of the Effective Date. The Supply Agreement will remain in effect until the termination of the Endoceutics License Agreement, unless terminated earlier by either party for an uncured material breach or insolvency of the other party, or by us if we exercise our rights to manufacture and supply Intrarosa following a cessation notice or supply failure. 
Under the Endoceutics License Agreement, except as permitted under the Endoceutics License Agreement or the Supply Agreement, and except for any compounds or products affecting the melanocortin receptor pathway, including without limitation, bremelanotide (collectively, “Excluded Product”), we will not be permitted to research, develop, manufacture, or commercialize (i) DHEA for delivery by any route of administration anywhere in world, (ii) any compound (including DHEA) or product for use in VVA anywhere in the world, or (iii) commencing on the date of an approval of Intrarosa for the treatment of FSD in the U.S. and continuing for the remainder of the term of the Endoceutics License Agreement, any compound (including DHEA) for use in FSD (each, a “Competing Product”). Any compound or product for use in FSD that would be a Competing Product in the United States but that (i) does not contain DHEA and (ii) was acquired or licensed or for which the research, development, manufacture or commercialization of such compound or product is initiated by us or our affiliates, in each case, prior to the date of an approval of Intrarosa for the treatment of FSD in the U.S., will be an Excluded Product and will not be subject to the exclusivity obligations under the Endoceutics License Agreement in the treatment of FSD, subject to certain restrictions in the Endoceutics License Agreement. These noncompete restrictions are subject to certain exclusions relating to the acquisition of competing programs.
The Endoceutics License Agreement expires on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations due thereunder unless earlier terminated in accordance with the Endoceutics License Agreement. The Endoceutics License Agreement may be terminated by either Party if the Effective Date has not occurred within 180 days following the execution date or such date as the parties may mutually agree. The Endoceutics License Agreement may be terminated by either Party for material breach that is either uncured after a 90-day notice period, or if such breach cannot be cured within such 90-day period, if the breaching party does not commence appropriate and material actions to cure such breach within the notice period and continue to diligently cure such breach for a period not to exceed 90 days, in either case, subject to tolling or determination of the arbitrators, if dispute resolution procedures are initiated within 30 days’ of the termination notice. We have the ability to elect not to terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement in the case of a material breach, in which case future milestone and royalty payments owed to Endoceutics would be reduced by a negotiated percentage or by an amount determined by arbitration. Either party may terminate under certain situations relating to the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. We may terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement for a valid business reason upon 365 days prior written notice to Endoceutics; or upon 60 days written notice in the event we reasonably determine in good faith, after due inquiry and after discussions with Endoceutics, that we cannot reasonably continue to develop or commercialize any Product as a result of a safety issue regarding the use of Intrarosa. We may also terminate the Endoceutics License Agreement upon 180 days’ notice if there is a change of control of 
13

AMAG and the acquiring entity (alone or with its affiliates) is engaged in a competing program (as defined in the Licensed Agreement) in the U.S. or in at least three countries within the European Union. 
Manufacturing 
Overview
We do not own or operate, and currently do not plan to own or operate, facilities for the manufacture of our commercially distributed products, product candidates or for any commercial products or product candidates we may acquire or in-license. We rely solely on third-party contract manufacturers and our licensors (who, in turn, may also rely on third-party contract manufacturers) to manufacture our products for our commercial and clinical use and for certain materials required to support the CBR Services. The business model for CBR Services is limited to charging customers for our services related to the collection, processing and storage of umbilical cord blood stem cells and cord tissues. Nevertheless, the FDA considers those services to constitute manufacturing of products, and enforces regulations to ensure that establishments that perform such services do so in accordance with current Good Tissue Practices. Our third-party contract manufacturing facilities, and those of our licensors, are subject to current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) and regulations enforced by the FDA through periodic inspections to confirm such compliance. We target to maintain, where possible, second source suppliers and/or sufficient inventory levels throughout our supply chain to meet our projected near-term demand for all of our drug products in order to minimize risks of supply disruption at points in our single source supply chain. For example, although we do not currently have a manufacturer for the production of Makena drug substance, our supply chain practices have resulted in inventory of Makena drug substance which we believe to be sufficient to meet demand until we can qualify a new drug substance manufacturer. We also rely upon third-party contractors to assist in supporting the CBR Services, including to supply proprietary materials, some of whom are sole source providers. We intend to continue to outsource the manufacture and distribution of our products for the foreseeable future, and we believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct more of our financial resources to the commercialization and development of our products and services. 
To support the commercialization and development of our products and services, we have developed a fully integrated manufacturing support system, including quality assurance, quality control, regulatory affairs and inventory control policies and procedures. These support systems are intended to enable us to maintain high standards of quality for our products and services.
Makena
The Makena drug product for our commercial and clinical use is currently manufactured by Pfizer under a Development and Supply Agreement (as amended and restated, the “Pfizer Agreement”). The Pfizer Agreement requires that we satisfy certain minimum purchase requirements but we are not obligated to use Pfizer as our sole supplier of drug product. The Pfizer Agreement expires on December 31, 2022, which term may be automatically extended thereafter for additional 18 month periods, unless cancelled by us or Pfizer within an agreed-upon notice period. 
Antares is the exclusive supplier of our requirements for the auto-injection system devices for the Makena auto-injector and Antares remains responsible for the manufacture and supply of the devices and assembly of the Makena auto-injector. We are responsible for the supply of the drug in pre-filled syringes to be used in the assembly of the finished auto-injector product. The Antares Agreement terminates at the end of the Antares Royalty Term, but is subject to early termination by us for convenience, by Antares if we do not submit regulatory filings in the U.S. by a certain date and by either party upon an uncured breach by or bankruptcy of the other party.
Feraheme
We are party to a Commercial Supply Agreement with Sigma-Aldrich, Inc. (“SAFC”) pursuant to which SAFC agreed to manufacture and we agreed to purchase from SAFC the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for use in the finished product of ferumoxytol for commercial sale as well as for use in clinical trials (as amended, the “SAFC Agreement”). Subject to certain conditions, the SAFC Agreement provides that we purchase exclusively all of our API from SAFC. In addition, the prices for each batch will decline as batches are produced in greater quantities throughout each year of the agreement. The SAFC Agreement has an initial term that ends December 31, 2020, which may be automatically extended thereafter for additional two year periods, unless cancelled by us or SAFC within an agreed-upon notice period.
We are party to a Pharmaceutical Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Patheon, Inc. (“Patheon”) pursuant to which Patheon agreed to manufacture ferumoxytol finished drug product for commercial sale and for use in clinical trials at a fixed price per vial (as amended, the “Patheon Agreement”). The Patheon Agreement will continue in force until December 31, 2020. 
14

The Patheon Agreement may be terminated at any time upon mutual written agreement by us and Patheon or at any time by us subject to certain notice requirements and early termination fees. In addition, the Patheon Agreement may be terminated by either us or Patheon in the event of a material breach of the agreement by the other party provided that the breaching party fails to cure such breach within an agreed-upon notice period. 
MuGard
Under the terms of the MuGard License Agreement, Abeona is responsible for all aspects of manufacturing MuGard. We have entered into a quality agreement and a supply agreement with Abeona under which we purchase MuGard inventory from Abeona.
Rekynda
Rekynda is a synthetic peptide and while the production process involves well-established technology, there are few manufacturers capable of scaling up to commercial quantities under cGMP at acceptable costs. Under the Palatin License Agreement, we assumed a long-term commercial supply agreement for fill, finish, and packaging services for Rekynda. We are currently negotiating other manufacturing and supply agreements for the drug substance and auto-injector sub-assemblies and may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms, if at all. 
Raw Materials
We, our licensors and our respective third-party product manufacturers currently purchase certain raw and other materials used to manufacture our products from third-party suppliers and, at present, do not have long-term supply contracts with most of these third parties. We also rely upon third-party contractors to assist in providing the CBR Services, including to supply proprietary materials. Although certain of our raw or other materials are readily available, others may be obtained only from qualified suppliers. The qualification of an alternative source may require repeated testing of the new materials and generate greater expenses to us or our licensors if materials that we test do not perform in an acceptable manner. In addition, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers sometimes obtain raw or other materials from one vendor only, even where multiple sources are available, to maintain quality control and enhance working relationships with suppliers, which could make us susceptible to price inflation by the sole supplier, thereby increasing our production costs. As a result of the high-quality standards imposed on our raw or other materials, we, our licensors or our respective third-party manufacturers may not be able to obtain such materials of the quality required to manufacture Feraheme or Makena or support the CBR Services from an alternative source on commercially reasonable terms, or in a timely manner, if at all. 
Patents, Trademarks and Trade Secrets 
We consider the protection of our technology to be material to our business. Because of the substantial length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through development and regulatory approval to the marketplace, we place considerable importance on obtaining patent protection and maintaining trade secret protection for our products. Our success depends, in large part, on our ability, and the ability of our licensors, collaborators and other business partners to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology and other trade secrets. To do so, we must prosecute and maintain existing patents, obtain new patents and ensure trade secret protection. We must also operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties or allowing third parties to infringe our rights.
Our policy is to aggressively protect our competitive technology position by a variety of means, including applying for patents in the U.S. and in appropriate foreign countries. We currently hold a number of U.S. patents for Feraheme, which expire at various times through 2023. One of our U.S. Feraheme patents is subject to a patent term extension under U.S. patent law and FDA regulations and will expire in June 2023. There are no issued patents covering Makena or the CBR Services. We have a license to two U.S. patents relating to MuGard, which expire in 2022. We have licenses to issued patents and pending applications that will provide protection for the Makena auto-injector we are developing. In addition, we have entered into an agreement that gives us an exclusive option to acquire the rights to an orphan drug candidate for the treatment of severe preeclampsia in pregnant women. Under the option agreement, at the conclusion of a Phase 2b/3a clinical trial, we may exercise, extend or terminate the acquisition option, at which time we have the right to purchase all intellectual property of Velo related to the DIF Rights. 
We have pending patent applications in the U.S. directed to Makena and Feraheme. Although further patents may be issued on pending applications, we cannot be sure that any such patents will be issued on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages or may be challenged by others, and the existing or future patents of third parties may limit our ability to commercialize our products. 
15

Under the Palatin License Agreement, we have exclusive rights to a number of issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents related to bremelanotide that are owned by Palatin. Certain of Palatin's U.S. patents include claims directed to the bremelanotide drug composition and methods of use thereof with terms expiring in 2020, and another patent includes claims covering methods of treating FSD using subcutaneous administration of compositions that include bremelanotide with a term expiring in 2033, any one of which may be subject to patent term extension for a maximum period of up to five years but no longer than 14 years after regulatory approval as compensation for patent term lost during drug development and the FDA regulatory review process, pursuant to the Hatch-Waxman Act. Whether we, together with Palatin, will be able to obtain patent term extensions under the Hatch-Waxman Act and the length of any such extension cannot be determined until a product covered by such patents receives FDA approval. In addition, the claims of issued patents covering Rekynda may not provide meaningful protection and further, third parties may challenge the validity or scope of any such issued patents.
Under the terms of the Endoceutics License Agreement, we received rights to Endoceutics’ three U.S. patents related to Intrarosa, including drug-product patent claims with a term which expires in 2031 and two additional patents, including method of use claims and pharmaceutical dosage form claims with terms which expire in 2028. 
We also have numerous U.S. and foreign trademark registrations directed to our corporate and affiliate names, as well as our products, compliance programs and services. These marks help to further distinguish our products and services and enhance our overall intellectual property position.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and cord blood banking industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change. For Makena, most of our competition comes from pharmacies that compound a non-FDA approved version of Makena, which is sold at a much lower list price than Makena. Many of our competitors for Feraheme are large, well-known pharmaceutical companies and may benefit from significantly greater financial, sales and marketing capabilities, greater technological or competitive advantages, and other resources. For the CBR Services, competition in the private cord blood and cord tissue banking business is already intense and is likely to increase as the number of competitors continues to grow given the relatively low barriers to entry. We also expect to face competition for Rekynda, including from an FDA-approved product for treatment of HSDD. Our existing or potential competitors may develop products or services that are more widely accepted than ours and may receive patent protection that dominates, blocks, makes obsolete or adversely affects our product development or business. 
Makena
Although Makena is the only FDA-approved drug indicated to reduce the risk of preterm birth in women pregnant with a single baby who have a history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth, it competes for market share primarily with compounding pharmacies. HPC is the active ingredient in Makena. Compounding pharmacies have been manufacturing formulations of HPC (which compounded formulations we refer to as “c17P”) for many years and c17P formulations will likely remain available at a lower cost to Makena even though Makena has been granted orphan drug exclusivity until February 2018. In November 2013, the FDA implemented the Drug Quality and Security Act (“DQSA”), which amended the FDC Act with respect to the regulation and monitoring of the manufacturing of compounding drugs. Although the FDA has issued a public statement recommending the use of Makena instead of a compounded drug except when there is a specific medical need (i.e., an allergy) that cannot be met by the approved drug and has stated that when it identifies a pharmacist that compounds regularly or in inordinate amounts of any drug products that are essentially copies of Makena, it intends to take enforcement action as it deems appropriate, doctors continue to prescribe and compounders continue to manufacture and sell c17P. 
Makena is priced at a premium to c17P, which has negatively impacted coverage of Makena by some state Medicaid programs and certain commercial payers. Although we are undertaking efforts to educate physicians and patients about progress made toward expanding coverage of Makena and about the benefits of Makena, certain doctors continue to choose to prescribe non-FDA approved purported substitute products made by pharmacy compounders in lieu of prescribing Makena. 
Based on market research we have conducted, we estimate that the following represents the 2016 and 2015 U.S. market share allocation of the Makena at-risk patient population (as calculated by shipments to physicians), including patients treated with Makena, patients treated with c17P, and the patient population being treated either with other therapies, such as vaginal progesterone, that are not approved for women pregnant with a single baby with a prior history of singleton spontaneous preterm birth, or not treated at all.

 | 2016 | | 2015
Makena | 42 | % | | 30 | %
c17P | 28 | % | | 40 | %
Other therapies or untreated | 30 | % | | 30 | %

Prior to the February 2016 approval of the single-dose preservative-free formulation of Makena, many healthcare providers who preferred a single-dose or preservative-free option were utilizing non-FDA-approved compounded versions of hydroxyprogesterone caproate. The launch of the single-dose formulation allowed us to capture market share from these compounders, increase the number of compounders in our distributor network and partner with organizations formerly using compounded product.
Additionally, in 1956, the FDA approved the drug Delalutin, which contained the same active ingredient as Makena. Delalutin was approved for conditions other than reducing the risk of preterm birth and was marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb (“BMS”). BMS stopped marketing and manufacturing Delalutin and it was withdrawn from the market in 1999. In 2010, the FDA determined that Delalutin was not withdrawn from sale for reasons of safety or efficacy. As such, generic drug applications may reference the withdrawn Delalutin NDA. In August 2015, the FDA approved an ANDA for HPC, which was submitted by McGuff Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“McGuff”) in 2009, and which was subsequently transferred to Aspen Global Incorporated (“Aspen”) in 2015. The ANDA label approved by the FDA for the McGuff product is for the same patient population and indications as Delalutin (i.e., it is approved only for use in non-pregnant women with indications such as uterine cancer or abnormal uterine bleeding). In June 2016, ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“ANI”), Aspen’s exclusive distributor, launched HPC in 5 mL vials in the U.S. Although Aspen’s generic version of Delalutin is not indicated for pregnant women and is not therapeutically equivalent to Makena, doctors may elect to prescribe this product off-label for Makena’s orphan-protected indication, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. In addition, if such generic Delalutin product is priced at a discount to Makena, commercial or government insurers could prefer or encourage the use of the generic Delalutin product for patients who are indicated for Makena.
In addition, generic Makena competitors could enter the market through approval of ANDAs that use Makena as a reference listed drug, which would allow generic competitors to rely on Makena’s safety and efficacy trials instead of conducting their own studies. Because entry into the market can occur upon the expiration of the reference listed drug’s exclusivity, we could face such competition when Makena’s orphan drug exclusivity expires in February 2018. 
For a detailed discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties related to competition for Makena, please refer to our Risk Factors, “Our ability to successfully commercialize Makena is dependent upon a number of factors, including maintaining the benefits of Makena’s orphan drug exclusivity and the length of time before competitors begin selling generic versions of Makena” and “If we are unsuccessful in differentiating Makena from compounded HPC products, sales of Makena, and thus our profitability, could be materially adversely affected.” 
CBR Services
In the past ten years, the cord blood banking industry has seen significant change. For example, in 2013 approximately 2.6% of U.S. parents were privately storing cord blood as compared to 2004 when only 0.2% of parents were privately storing cord blood. Similarly, the storage of umbilical cord tissue has grown substantially from when it was first offered to the public as a commercial option. CBR was the first major company in the U.S. to offer umbilical cord tissue storage in 2010 and in 2016, most private U.S. cord blood banks offer this service. The barriers to entry into the cord blood and cord tissue banking business are relatively low. We face competition from new entrants to the market, which could affect our market share or put downward pressure on the pricing of the CBR Services. Furthermore, new market entrants may not abide by industry guidelines, regulations and standards, including quality, compliance and marketing standards. New entrants may also offer and promote similar services at lower prices and/or engage in marketing behaviors that communicate false or misleading information. In addition to having a potential adverse impact on our business, these behaviors of such competitors could create a negative perception of our industry if they violate regulations or pursue questionable business practices. Though the barriers to entry are low, we believe that establishing a high-quality brand and nationwide reputation like CBR’s, and growing a bank to a size where long-term stability of operations is not a primary concern for customers, gives CBR an advantage in the market.

17

In the U.S., CBR is considered the largest private cord blood bank based on the number of cord blood and cord tissue units banked. CBR’s largest U.S. competitor is ViaCord®, a subsidiary of PerkinElmer, Inc. Two other banks, Cryo-Cell International, Inc.® and StemCyte™, are significantly smaller than either CBR or ViaCord®, but maintain a national footprint. In addition to these three competitors, CBR competes with more than 20 other blood banks in the U.S., most of whom have regional focuses. CBR differentiates itself from almost all of its competitors through its size and financial stability, its investments in research and its commercial reach. 

For a detailed discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties related to competition for CBR, please refer to our Risk Factor, “Competition in the cord blood and cord tissue banking business is significant and may be increasing. If we are unable to maintain our position as the market leader, our CBR business may decline and our results of operations could suffer.”
Feraheme
Feraheme is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of IDA in adult patients with CKD, including both dialysis and non-dialysis CKD patients. Our commercial strategy is entirely focused on growing the utilization of Feraheme in non-dialysis dependent adult CKD patients who are diagnosed with IDA. We believe there is a significant opportunity for Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in CKD patients not yet on dialysis. The non-dialysis IV iron market is comprised primarily of three sites of care where a substantial number of CKD patients are treated: hospitals, hematology and oncology centers, and nephrology clinics.
Feraheme currently competes primarily with the following IV iron replacement therapies for the treatment of IDA in CKD patients:

• | Venofer®, an iron sucrose complex, which is approved for use in hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, non-dialysis dependent CKD patients and pediatric CKD patients and is marketed in the U.S. by Fresenius Medical Care North America and American Regent Laboratories, Inc. (“American Regent”), a subsidiary of Luitpold Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Venofer® is typically administered as a slow intravenous injection over two to five minutes in doses of 100 to 200 milligrams, thus requiring five to ten physician visits to reach a standard one gram therapeutic course.


• | Injectafer®, a ferric carboxymaltose injection, was approved in the U.S. in July 2013 to treat IDA in adult patients who have intolerance to oral iron or have had an unsatisfactory response to oral iron. Injectafer® is also indicated for IDA in adult patients with non-dialysis dependent CKD. Injectafer® is marketed in the U.S. by American Regent, the same distributor of Venofer®. The labeled administration of Injectafer® is two slow injections or infusion of 750 milligrams each separated by at least seven days for a total cumulative dose of 1.50grams, or one and a half grams per therapeutic course;


• | Ferrlecit®, a sodium ferric gluconate, which is marketed by Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC, is approved for use only in hemodialysis patients. The recommended dose of Ferrlecit® and the generic version of Ferrlecit® is 125 milligrams administered by intravenous infusion over one hour per dialysis session or undiluted as a slow intravenous injection per dialysis session, thus requiring eight physician visits to reach a standard one gram therapeutic course;


• | A generic version of Ferrlecit® marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and


• | INFeD®, an iron dextran product marketed by Allergan, Inc. which is approved in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with documented iron deficiency in whom oral iron administration is unsatisfactory or impossible. The recommended dose of INFeD® is a slow push in 100 milligram doses, which would require up to ten physician visits to receive a standard one gram therapeutic course.

As compared to the dosing regimens described above for Feraheme’s competitors, Feraheme is currently administered as a 510 milligram infusion followed by a second 510 milligram infusion three to eight days later, thereby making it possible for the patient to receive a full gram of iron in as few as three days. In March 2015, following discussions with the FDA and, in an effort to strengthen the warnings and precautions section of the label and mitigate the risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, we updated our Feraheme label to include (a) the addition of a boxed warning related to the risks of serious hypersensitivity reactions or anaphylaxis, which were previously described only in the Warnings and Precautions section; (b) revisions to the Dosing and Administration section to indicate that Feraheme should only be administered by IV infusion; and (c) modifications to the Warnings and Precautions section to include a statement that patients with a history of multiple drug allergies may have a greater risk of anaphylaxis with any parenteral iron products. These or any future changes to the label/package could adversely impact our ability to successfully compete in the IV iron market.
18

In addition to the currently marketed products described above, Feraheme may also compete with AuryxiaTM (ferric citrate), an oral treatment, which is in development to treat IDA in adults with non-dialysis CKD. In January 2017, Keryx Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. announced that it has submitted an sNDA for AuryxiaTM to the FDA. Further, Akebia Therapeutics, Inc. is developing Vadadustat, an oral HIF stabilizer, to treat anemia related to CKD and has recently commenced a Phase 3 trial. 
Feraheme may also face future competition from generic IV iron replacement therapy products. For example, as discussed above, in February 2016, we received a Paragraph IV certification notice letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Sandoz requesting approval to engage in commercial manufacture, use and sale of a generic version of ferumoxytol. In March 2016, we initiated a patent infringement suit alleging that Sandoz’ ANDA filing itself constituted an act of infringement and that if it is approved, the manufacture, use, offer for sale, sale or importation of Sandoz’ ferumoxytol products would infringe our patents. By the filing of this complaint, the FDA is prohibited from granting approval of Sandoz’ application until the earliest of 30 months from the date of receipt of the notice of certification by the patent owner, the conclusion of litigation in the generic’s favor, or expiration of the patent(s). If the litigation is resolved in favor of the applicant or the challenged patent expires during the 30 months stay period, the stay is lifted and the FDA may thereafter approve the application based on the applicable standards for approval. In May 2016, Sandoz filed a response to our patent infringement suit and the trial is scheduled for March 12, 2018. 
Further, in 2011, a generic version of Ferrlecit® was launched in the U.S. for the treatment of IDA in adult patients and in pediatric patients ages six years and older undergoing chronic hemodialysis who are receiving supplemental epoetin therapy. 
Companies that manufacture generic products typically invest far fewer resources in research and development than the manufacturers of branded products and can therefore price their products significantly lower than those branded products already on the market. Therefore, competition from generic IV iron products could limit our sales.
Based on sales data provided to us in January 2017 by IMS Health Incorporated (“IMS”), we estimate that the size of the total 2016 U.S. non-dialysis IV iron replacement therapy market was approximately 1.1 million grams, which represents an increase of approximately 11% over 2015. Feraheme currently competes in the CKD portion of this market, which we estimate is approximately half of the total market. Based on this IMS data, the following represents the 2016 and 2015 U.S. market share allocation of the total non-dialysis IV iron market based on the volume of IV iron administered:

 | 2016 U.S. Non-dialysis | | 2015 U.S. Non-dialysis
 | IV Iron Market | | IV Iron Market 
 | (1,114,000 grams) | | (1,000,000 grams) 
Venofer® | 38 | % | | 40 | %
Injectafer® | 21 | % | | 14 | %
INFeD® | 15 | % | | 18 | %
Feraheme | 13 | % | | 14 | %
Generic sodium ferric gluconate | 9 | % | | 9 | %
Ferrlecit® | 4 | % | | 5 | %

The market share data listed in the table above is not necessarily indicative of the market shares in dollars due to the variations in selling prices among the IV iron products.
MuGard 
There are currently few effective treatments for the treatment or management of oral mucositis. The market for treating oral mucositis is driven primarily by convenience, price and reimbursement and the products in this market remain mostly undifferentiated. There are a number of approaches used to treat or manage oral mucositis, including the use of ice chips during chemotherapy treatments, various medicinal mouthwashes, topical anesthetics and analgesics, and oral gel treatments. For example, many physicians use what is commonly known as “magic mouthwash”, which may currently be the most commonly prescribed medication to manage oral mucositis. Magic mouthwash is a combination of generic ingredients which are typically compounded in a pharmacy and is preferred by many physicians because of the availability of less expensive generic ingredients used to formulate the mouthwash. 
19

Rekynda
If Rekynda is approved for marketing by the FDA and if we are successful in launching and commercializing it, we expect Rekynda will face competition. Addyi® (flibanserin) was approved by the FDA for commercial use in the U.S. in August 2015 for the treatment of HSDD in pre-menopausal women and is marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. (“Valeant”). Addyi® is only available through a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”) program because of an increased risk of severe hypotension and syncope due to the interaction between Addyi® and alcohol. In addition, Addyi® was approved with a boxed warning to highlight the risks of severe hypotension and syncope in patients who drink alcohol during treatment with Addyi®, in patients who use Addyi® with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, or in patients who have liver impairment. 
We are not aware of any company actively developing another melanocortin receptor agonist drug for the treatment of HSDD. However, we are aware of several other drugs at various stages of development, most of which are taken on a chronic, typically once-daily, basis. LorexysTM, an oral, non-hormonal, fixed-dose combination of two antidepressants, bupropion and trazodone, is being developed by S1 Biopharma, Inc. (“S1 Biopharma”). S1 Biopharma intends to seek approval of LorexysTM utilizing a 505(b)(2) strategy, which may allow S1 Biopharma an accelerated regulatory pathway as well as decreased development costs. Emotional Brain BV is developing two different oral fixed-dose, on-demand combination drugs, one a combination of sildenafil and testosterone and the other a combination of testosterone and buspirone hydrochloride, and has conducted Phase 2 studies. Libigel®, a testosterone gel being developed by ANI, completed two Phase 3 efficacy trials for treatment of FSD in surgically post-menopausal women but ANI reported that it did not show a statistically significant difference from placebo in those trials. Intrinsa, a transdermal testosterone patch, successfully completed a Phase 3 clinical program, but was not approved in the U.S. based on potential long-term use safety risks of cancer and cardiovascular adverse events. There may be other companies developing new drugs for FSD indications, some of which may be in clinical trials in the U.S. or elsewhere. In addition, other companies may sell their products off-label for indications other than HSDD. 
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
Makena
We currently have sales representatives dedicated exclusively to Makena and the CBR Services, who are focused on calling on approximately 16,000 obstetricians and maternal fetal medicine specialists in the U.S. Makena prescriptions are dispensed via the payer-preferred pharmacy or purchased directly by hospitals, government agencies and integrated delivery systems.
Based on market research we conducted, we estimate that Makena is currently used to treat approximately 42% of the at-risk patient population, allowing for significant potential to increase its market share. Our sales and marketing teams use a variety of strategies and focused, multi-channel methods to promote Makena, including dedicating a separate managed care team to focus on health plans, including commercial payers, pharmacy benefit managers, and managed Medicaid plans as well as fee-for-service Medicaid programs.
In addition, we offer customer support through the Makena Care Connection, which is designed to help the prescriber and patient navigate each individual patient’s needs throughout the Makena prescription process. Maternity insurance benefits vary in terms of insurance coverage for certain medications, required copays, coinsurance or deductibles, and how medications are dispensed. The Makena Care Connection provides customer support to patients in processing the prescription, including confirming insurance coverage, assisting with prior authorizations (when applicable), and working in collaboration with the payer-preferred pharmacy and home health agency to help ensure timely initiation of therapy.
The Makena Care Connection also screens and enrolls patients in financial assistance programs including our copay assistance program, which helps lower the out-of-pocket cost for commercially insured patients whose plan covers Makena. The copay assistance program applies to copays, coinsurance and deductibles with no upper level income cap. The Makena Care Connection also screens and enrolls patients in our patient assistance program, which provides a full course of therapy at no charge to eligible uninsured patients, with no upper level income cap. To be eligible for these programs, the patient must meet the FDA-approved indication. In compliance with federal regulations, patients insured by a government-funded program are not eligible to participate. 
Our My Adherence Program, a telephonic 24/7 nursing services program to assist with increasing patient compliance, encourages adherence to the weekly Makena injection schedule, helps identify challenges that may interfere with patient compliance in receiving the weekly injection and offers potential solutions, provides educational materials that address important topics during pregnancy, and empowers patients to take an active role in their health. Program participants are paired 
20

with a dedicated maternal health nursing specialist to support them throughout their pregnancy. To be eligible for the My Adherence Program, patients must meet the FDA-approved indication.
During 2016, we entered into an agreement with a leading provider of home nursing services (which had previously utilized compounded hydroxyprogesterone caproate) pursuant to which the provider performs at-home administration of Makena and, in connection with a recent amendment, also co-promotes Makena to certain healthcare providers. 
CBR Services
In addition to calling on physicians, we directly market CBR Services to pregnant women and their families through various digital marketing channels, including social media, email and web properties, and believe that we have the potential to reach approximately two million pregnant women each year, representing approximately half of the pregnancies in the U.S. The CBR consumer sales team educates expectant parents on their cord blood banking options and the benefits of preserving their newborn’s stem cells. This team of inside sales representatives uses both telephone and online chat to interact with consumers and is central to CBR’s direct-to-consumer approach that is coordinated with our digital marketing lead generation and qualification expertise and with detailing efforts by our women's health field force. Additionally, we nurture and develop customer referrals from an existing base of over 385,000 families through our customer service team and digital and social media marketing efforts.
We also offer the Newborn Possibilities Program®, which provides free processing and five years of free storage for cord blood and cord tissue to families with a qualifying medical need. To date, over 7,500 families have been enrolled. Further, the Newborn Possibilities Program has been expanded with the launch of the first registry aimed at collecting family health data on diseases and conditions common among registry participants to help target medical research on those that may be treatable with newborn stem cell therapy. Currently, over 150,000 families are participating in the Family Health Registry™. 
Feraheme
We sell Feraheme to authorized wholesalers and specialty distributors who, in turn, sell Feraheme to healthcare providers who administer Feraheme primarily within hospitals, hematology and oncology centers and nephrology clinics. Since many hospitals and hematology, oncology and nephrology practices are members of group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”), which leverage the purchasing power of a group of entities to obtain discounts based on the collective bargaining power of the group, we also routinely enter into pricing agreements with GPOs in these markets so the members of the GPOs have access to Feraheme and to the related discounts or rebates. 
Our sales and marketing organization uses a variety of common pharmaceutical marketing strategies and methods to promote Feraheme including sales calls to purchasing entities, such as hospitals, hematology and oncology centers and nephrology practices in addition to individual physicians or other healthcare professionals, medical education symposia, personal and non-personal promotional materials, local and national educational programs, scientific meetings and conferences and informational and disease state awareness websites. In addition, we provide customer service and other related programs for Feraheme including reimbursement support services, a patient assistance program for uninsured or under-insured patients and a customer service call center. 
Our commercial strategy currently focuses on the non-dialysis dependent CKD market in the U.S. We believe this segment of patients is under-diagnosed and under-treated and there is a significant opportunity in this market to provide IV iron to non-dialysis CKD patients. Our sales team has been working to educate HCPs who manage CKD patients on the benefits of IV iron and the advantages of Feraheme, in order to identify appropriate CKD patients and expand the IV iron use in physicians’ offices, clinics, and hospitals where CKD patients are treated for IDA.
MuGard
Our commercial team uses a variety of common pharmaceutical marketing strategies and methods to promote MuGard, including sales calls to providing entities, such as hematology and oncology centers and hospitals. In addition, other tactical programs may include personal and non-personal promotional materials to individual physicians or other healthcare professionals, sponsoring local and national educational programs, participation in scientific meetings and conferences and implementing informational product specific websites.
We market and sell MuGard to wholesalers and specialty pharmacies. Patients primarily receive MuGard through specialty pharmacies, which receive prescriptions from either our MuGard patient reimbursement and support center (the “HUB”) or from physicians directly. We utilize the HUB as a centralized patient intake and referral management center to process 
21

insurance coverage issues and administer our patient assistance program. In order to make MuGard available to patients as soon as possible, we provide a starter kit to clinicians, including a sample bottle and all pertinent information that the patient or caregiver needs to immediately begin MuGard therapy.
Product Supply Chain
We outsource a number of our product supply chain services for our products to third-party logistics providers, including services related to warehousing and inventory management, distribution, chargeback processing, accounts receivable management, sample distribution to our sales force, and customer service call center management.
Major Customers
The following table sets forth customers who represented 10% or more of our total revenues for 2016, 2015, and 2014. Revenues from Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda”), our former partner for the commercialization of Feraheme outside of the U.S., included payments under the license, development and commercialization agreement with Takeda and in connection with its subsequent 2015 termination. 

 | Years Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation | 22 | % | | 25 | % | 34 | %
McKesson Corporation | 11 | % | | 11 | % | 21 | %
Takeda Pharmaceuticals Company Limited | — | % | | 12 | % | 11 | %
Cardinal Health, Inc. | <10 | % | | <10 | % | 15 | %

The loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse effect on our business.
Government Regulation 
Overview
Our activities are subject to extensive regulation by numerous governmental authorities in the U.S. The FDC Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research and development, manufacturing, quality control, labeling, recordkeeping, approval, storage, distribution, and advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products and medical devices. In addition, under the Public Health Service Act and its implementing regulations, we are required to register with the FDA, which governs all aspects of cord blood preservation, including the recovery, screening, testing, processing, storage, labeling, packaging and distribution of cord blood stem cells. 
Failure to comply with any of the applicable U.S. requirements may result in a variety of administrative or judicially imposed sanctions including, among other things, the regulatory agency’s refusal to approve pending applications, suspension, variations or withdrawals of approval, clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical Product Approval Process
Clinical Development
Before we may market a new drug product, we must obtain FDA approval of an NDA for that product. The FDA may approve an NDA if the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate can be established based on the results of pre-clinical and clinical studies.
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practice regulations. Clinical testing typically proceeds in three phases, which may overlap or be combined. Phase 1 trials seek to collect initial data about safety, tolerability, and optimal dosing of the drug candidate in healthy human subjects or, less commonly, in patients with the target disease or condition. The goal of Phase 2 trials is to provide preliminary evidence about the desired therapeutic efficacy of the product candidate in limited studies with small numbers of carefully selected subjects with the target disease or condition. Phase 3 trials generally consist of expanded, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, multi-center studies of the safety and efficacy of the product in the target patient population and are used as the primary basis for regulatory approval. 
22

Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination at www.clinicaltrials.gov.
Submission and FDA Review of NDAs and sNDAs
Following the successful completion of clinical trials, the sponsor submits the results to the FDA as part of an NDA. The NDA must also include the results of pre-clinical tests and studies, information related to the preparation and manufacturing of the drug candidate, analytical methods, and proposed packaging and labeling. Pursuant to agreements reached during reauthorization of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”), the FDA has a goal of acting on most original NDAs within six months or ten months of the application submission or filing date, depending on the nature of the drug. For drug candidates intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases and conditions, the FDA has a number of programs intended to help expedite testing, review, and approval. For example, under the provisions of the FDA’s Subpart H Accelerated Approval regulations, accelerated approval is permitted based on a surrogate endpoint for a new drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and that provides a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments.
If the FDA’s evaluations of the NDA and of the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will issue an approval letter, and the sponsor may begin marketing the drug for the approved indications, subject to any post-approval requirements, described further below. If the FDA determines it cannot approve the NDA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter indicating that the application will not be approved in its current form. The complete response letter usually describes the specific deficiencies that the FDA identified in the application and may require additional clinical or other data or impose other conditions that must be met in order to obtain approval of the NDA. Addressing the deficiencies noted by the FDA could be impractical, and it is possible that the sponsor could withdraw its application or approval may not be obtained or may be costly and may result in significant delays prior to approval.
Where a sponsor wishes to expand the originally approved prescribing information, such as adding a new indication, it must submit and obtain approval of an sNDA. Changes to an indication generally require additional clinical studies, which can be time-consuming and require the expenditure of substantial additional resources. Under PDUFA, the target timeframe for the review of an sNDA to add a new clinical indication is six or ten months from the receipt date, depending on whether or not the sNDA has priority review. As with an NDA, if the FDA determines that it cannot approve an sNDA in its current form, it will issue a complete response letter as discussed above. See the discussion above under “Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in a broad range of patients” for our ongoing post-marketing activities for Feraheme.
Abbreviated New Drug Application
An ANDA is filed when approval is sought to market a generic equivalent of a drug product previously approved under an NDA and listed in the Orange Book. Rather than directly demonstrating the product’s safety and efficacy, as is required of an NDA, an ANDA must show that the proposed generic product is the same as the previously approved product in terms of active ingredient(s), strength, dosage form, route of administration and bioavailability. In addition, with certain exceptions, the generic product must have the same labeling as the product to which it refers.
NDA applicants and holders must provide certain information about patents related to the branded drug for listing in the Orange Book. When an ANDA application is submitted, it must contain one of several possible certifications regarding each of the patents listed in the Orange Book for the branded product that is the reference listed drug. A certification that a listed patent is invalid, unenforceable, or will not be infringed by the sale of the proposed product is called a Paragraph IV Certification. See the discussion above under “Feraheme for the treatment of IDA in patients with CKD - Overview” for a Paragraph IV certification notice letter regarding an ANDA submitted to the FDA by Sandoz. 
Adverse Event Reporting
The FDA requires a sponsor to submit reports of certain information on side effects and adverse events associated with its products that occur either during clinical trials or after marketing approval. These requirements include specific and timely notification of certain serious, unexpected and/or frequent adverse events, as well as regular periodic reports summarizing adverse drug experiences. Failure to comply with these FDA safety reporting requirements may result in FDA regulatory action that may include civil action or criminal penalties. In addition, as a result of these reports, the FDA could create a Tracked Safety Issue for a product in the FDA’s Document Archiving, Reporting and Regulatory Tracking System, place additional limitations on an approved product’s use, such as through labeling changes, or, potentially, could require withdrawal or suspension of the product from the market. In addition, FDA could require post-market studies or impose distribution and use restrictions and other requirements via a REMS based upon new safety information obtained through adverse event reporting (discussed further below).
23

FDA Post-Approval Requirements
Even if initial approval of an NDA or sNDA is granted, such approval may be subject to post-market regulatory requirements, any or all of which may adversely impact a sponsor’s ability to effectively market and sell the approved product. The FDA may require the sponsor to conduct Phase 4 clinical trials, also known as post-marketing requirements or post-marketing commitments, to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. The results of such post-marketing studies may be negative and could lead to limitations on the further marketing of a product, including safety labeling changes. Also, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, the FDA may require pediatric assessment of certain drugs unless waived or deferred due to the fact that necessary studies are impossible or highly impractical to conduct or where the drug is not likely to be used in a substantial number of pediatric patients. In addition, the FDA may require a sponsor to implement a REMS, which may include distribution or use restrictions to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with the product. Failure to comply with REMS requirements may result in civil penalties. Further, if an approved product encounters any safety or efficacy issues, including drug interaction problems, the FDA has broad authority to force the sponsor to take any number of actions, including but not limited to, undertaking post-approval clinical studies, implementing labeling changes, adopting a REMS, issuing Dear Health Care Provider letters, or removing the product from the market.
FDA Regulation of our Products and Services
FDA Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion
The FDA also regulates all advertising and promotional activities for prescription drugs, both prior to and after approval. Approved drug products must be promoted in a manner consistent with their terms and conditions of approval, including the scope of their approved use. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product (“off-label promotion”) or for other violations of its advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements could lead to, among other things, adverse publicity, product seizures, civil or criminal penalties, or regulatory letters, which may include warnings and require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals.
Under the Subpart H regulations, until the Makena confirmatory post-marketing clinical trial is completed, we are subject to a special 30-day promotional material review by the FDA’s Office of Promotional Drug Products. This extra requirement means that there is a longer lead time before we are able to introduce new promotional material to the market for Makena and we are subject to increased scrutiny prior to using promotional pieces to ensure fair balance.
FDA Regulation of Manufacturing Facilities 
Manufacturing procedures and quality control for approved drugs must conform to cGMP. Domestic manufacturing establishments must follow cGMP at all times, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA in order to assess, among other things, cGMP compliance. In addition, prior to approval of an NDA or sNDA, the FDA will often perform a pre-approval inspection of the sponsor’s manufacturing facility, including its equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes, to determine the facility’s compliance with cGMP and other rules and regulations. Vendors that supply finished products or components to the sponsor that are used to manufacture, package, and label products are subject to similar regulation and periodic inspections. If the FDA identifies deficiencies during an inspection, it may issue a formal notice, which may be followed by a warning letter if observations are not addressed satisfactorily. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter be issued only for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action. 
Product approval may be delayed or denied due to cGMP non-compliance or other issues at the sponsor’s manufacturing facilities or contractor sites or suppliers included in the NDA or sNDA, and the complete resolution of these inspectional findings may be beyond the sponsor’s control. If the FDA determines that the sponsor’s equipment, facilities, laboratories or processes do not comply with applicable FDA regulations and conditions of product approval, the FDA may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions and/or remedies against the sponsor, including suspension of its manufacturing operations.
Orphan Drug Exclusivity
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined, in part, as a patient population of fewer than 200,000. The company that first obtains FDA approval for a designated orphan drug for the specified rare disease or condition receives orphan drug marketing exclusivity for that drug for a period of seven years. This orphan drug exclusivity prevents the FDA from approving another application for the same drug for the same orphan indication during the exclusivity period, except in very limited circumstances. A designated 
24

orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity for an approved indication if that indication is for the treatment of a condition broader than that for which it received orphan designation. In addition, orphan drug exclusivity marketing rights may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Finally, the FDA may approve a subsequent drug that is otherwise the same as a currently approved orphan drug for the same orphan indication during the exclusivity period if the sponsor of the subsequent drug can demonstrate that the drug is clinically superior to the already approved drug. According to the FDA, clinical superiority may be demonstrated by showing that a drug is more effective in a clinical trial, safer in a substantial portion of the target population, or provides a major contribution to patient care relative to the currently approved drug. 
Drug Quality and Security Act
In November 2013, the DQSA legislation was enacted to amend the FDC Act with respect to the regulation and monitoring of the manufacturing of compounded drugs. Among other provisions of the DQSA, compounding pharmacies may now elect to register as an “outsourcing facility” under FDC Act 503B. Registration as an outsourcing facility requires that drugs be compounded according to cGMP standards; that facilities report adverse events to the FDA; and that facilities be subject to a risk-based inspection schedule, among other requirements. Additionally, FDC Act 503A describes the conditions that must be satisfied for drug products compounded by a licensed pharmacist or licensed physician to be exempt from approval, labeling, and cGMP requirements. To qualify for these exemptions, a compounded drug product must, among other things, be compounded for an identified patient based on a valid prescription or in limited quantities before the receipt of a prescription for such individual patient in certain circumstances. Under both 503A and 503B of the FDC Act, compounding pharmacies may not compound regularly or in inordinate amounts any drug products that are “essentially copies of commercially available drug products.” 
Fraud and Abuse Regulation
Our general operations, and the research, development, manufacture, sale, and marketing of our products, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation, including but not limited to FDA regulations, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the Federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), and their state analogues, and similar laws in countries outside of the U.S., laws governing sampling and distribution of products and government price reporting laws.

• | The AKS makes it illegal to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for, or to induce, purchasing, ordering, arranging for, or recommending the purchase or order of any item or service, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug, that is reimbursed by a federal healthcare program. Liability may be established without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, federal law now provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the AKS constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA, described below. Violations of the AKS carry potentially significant civil and criminal penalties, including imprisonment, fines, and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Many states have enacted similar anti-kickback laws, including in some cases laws that prohibit paying or receiving remuneration to induce a referral or recommendation of an item or service reimbursed by any payer, including private payers.


• | The FCA prohibits, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for reimbursement of drugs or services to government payers such as Medicare or Medicaid, or other claims for payment of government funds, where those claims are false or fraudulent. The FCA also prohibits knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or having possession, custody, or control of property or money used, or to be used, by the federal government and knowingly delivering or causing to be delivered, less than all of that money or property. The FCA permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring an action on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have asserted liability under the FCA for, among other things, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or for medically unnecessary items or services, kickbacks, promotion of off-label uses, and misreporting of drug prices to federal agencies. Many states have enacted similar false claims laws, including in some cases laws that apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer, not just government programs.


• | The FCPA prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making, or offering or promising to make improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or otherwise seeking favorable treatment.

Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Federal and state authorities continue to devote significant attention and resources to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in bringing lawsuits on behalf of the government under the FCA. We have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are current best practices in the pharmaceutical industry; however, these laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance, or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws in the context of particular industry practices. We cannot guarantee that we, our employees, our consultants, or our contractors are or will be in compliance will all federal, state, and foreign regulations. If we or our representatives fail to comply with any of these laws or regulations, a range of fines, penalties, and/or other sanctions could be imposed on us, including, but not limited to, restrictions on how we market and sell our products, significant fines, exclusions from government healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, litigation, or other sanctions. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could also have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Such investigations or suits may also result in related shareholder lawsuits, which can also have an adverse effect on our business.
Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
Several states have enacted legislation requiring pharmaceutical companies operating within the state to establish marketing and promotional compliance programs or codes of conduct and/or file periodic reports with the state or make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities. In addition, as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the “Affordable Care Act”) manufacturers of drugs and medical devices are required to publicly report gifts and other payments or transfers of value made to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals. Several states have also adopted laws that prohibit certain marketing-related activities, including the provision of gifts, meals or other items to certain healthcare providers. Many of these requirements are new and uncertain, and the likely extent of future enforcement for failure to comply with these requirements is unclear. However, compliance with these laws is difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and if we are found not to be in full compliance with these laws, we may face enforcement actions, fines, and other penalties, and we could receive adverse publicity which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
We are also subject to data protection laws and regulations (i.e., laws and regulations that address privacy and data security). The legislative and regulatory landscape for data protection continues to evolve, and in recent years there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data security issues. In the U.S., numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil or criminal penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties (i.e., healthcare providers who prescribe our products) that are subject to privacy and security requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HIPAA”). Although we are not directly subject to HIPAA (other than potentially with respect to providing certain employee benefits) we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. We are also subject to laws and regulations covering data privacy and the protection of health-related and other personal information. We obtain patient health information from most healthcare providers who prescribe our products and research institutions we collaborate with, and they are subject to privacy and security requirements that may affect us. Claims that we have violated individuals’ privacy rights or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business. For example, through April 29, 2033, CBR is required to comply with a Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) Order (the “FTC Order”). The FTC Order requires CBR, among other things, to implement and maintain a comprehensive information security program and conduct a biennial assessment of its information security program. CBR is also required not to make any misrepresentations, expressly or by implication, regarding its privacy practices or its information security program. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, these obligations are substantial and may impede our performance and our ability to develop the CBR Services, or lead to significant fines, penalties or liabilities for noncompliance.
Regulation of Cord Blood and Cord Tissue Banking
Human tissues intended for transplantation, including umbilical cord blood stem cells and cord tissue, are subject to comprehensive regulations that address activities associated with human cells, tissues and cellular and tissue-based products 
26

(“HCT/Ps”). One set of regulations requires that companies that engage in the recovery, processing, storage, labeling, packaging, or distribution of any HCT/Ps, or the screening or testing of a cell or tissue donor, register with the FDA. This set of regulations also includes the criteria that must be met in order for the HCT/P to be eligible for distribution solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act (the “PHSA”), and the regulations in 21 CFR Part 1271, rather than under the drug or device provisions of the FDC Act or the biological product licensing provisions of the PHSA. Another set of regulations provides criteria that must be met for donors to be eligible to donate HCT/Ps and is referred to as the “Donor Eligibility” rule. A third set of provisions governs the processing and distribution of the tissues and is often referred to as the “Current Good Tissue Practices” rule. The Current Good Tissue Practices rule covers all stages of HCT/P processing, from procurement to distribution of final allografts. Together these regulations are designed to ensure that sound, high quality practices are followed to reduce the risk of tissue contamination and of communicable disease transmission to recipients. 
CBR is registered with the FDA as an HCT/P establishment that screens, packages, processes, stores, labels and distributes umbilical cord blood stem cell and cord tissue by virtue of the services it provides to expectant parents as a private cord blood and cord tissue bank. The FDA periodically inspects such registered establishments to determine compliance with HCT/P requirements. If the FDA determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, or any future regulatory requirements or standards, it can impose or initiate a variety of enforcement actions, including but not limited to, public warning or untitled letters, written recall or destruction orders, written cease manufacturing orders, court-ordered seizures, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, or criminal prosecutions. 
Some states impose additional regulation and oversight of cord blood and cord tissue banks and of clinical laboratories operating within their borders and impose regulatory compliance obligations on out-of-state laboratories providing services to their residents, and many states in which we and our business partners operate have licensing requirements that must be complied with. 
Medical Device Regulation 
Medical devices, such as MuGard, are similarly subject to FDA clearance or approval and extensive post-approval regulation under the FDC Act. Authorization to commercially distribute a new medical device in the U.S. is generally received in one of two ways. The first, known as premarket notification (the “510(k) process”), requires a sponsor to demonstrate that the new medical device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed medical device that is not subject to premarket approval. The second, more rigorous process, known as premarket approval, requires a sponsor to independently demonstrate that the new medical device is safe and effective.
Both before and after a device is commercially released, there are ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. The FDA reviews design and manufacturing practices, labeling and record keeping, and manufacturers’ required reports of adverse experiences and other information to identify potential problems with marketed medical devices, similar to the reviews conducted in connection with drug product discussed above. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health, order a recall, repair, replacement, or refund of such devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, or ban such medical devices. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us.
MuGard was launched in the U.S. by Abeona in 2010 after receiving 510(k) clearance from the FDA. Under the terms of the MuGard License Agreement, Abeona continues to hold the 510(k). MuGard is categorized as a pre-amendments device. This type of device has not been classified per se, but continues to be subject to regulatory review under the 510(k) premarket clearance process.
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Reimbursement
Our ability to successfully commercialize our products is dependent, in significant part, on the availability and extent of reimbursement to end-users from third-party payers for the use of our products, including governmental payers, health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”), managed care organizations, and private health insurers. The federal government provides health insurance for people who are 65 or older, and certain people with disabilities or certain conditions, irrespective of their age through the Medicare program, which is administered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”). Certain prescription drugs, including Makena and Feraheme, are covered under Medicare Part B. Coverage and reimbursement for products and services under Medicare are determined in accordance with the Social Security Act and pursuant to regulations promulgated by CMS, as well as the agency’s subregulatory coverage and reimbursement guidance and 
27

determinations. Medicaid is a health insurance program for low-income children, families, pregnant women, and people with disabilities that is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, but administered by the states. In general, state Medicaid programs are required to cover drugs and biologics of manufacturers that have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, although such drugs and biologics may be subject to prior authorization or other utilization controls. CMS also administers the Medicaid program through regulatory and policy guidance to the states. 
We participate in and have certain price reporting obligations to the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, and we have obligations to report Average Sales Price (“ASP”) for the Medicare program. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program, we are required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Those rebates are based on pricing data reported by us on a monthly and quarterly basis to CMS. These data include the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) and, in the case of innovator products such as Makena and Feraheme, the best price for each drug.
Federal law also requires that a company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program report ASP information to CMS for certain categories of drugs that are paid under Part B of the Medicare program, such as Makena and Feraheme. This ASP information forms the basis for reimbursement for the majority of our current Feraheme business, and to a lesser extent, for our Makena business. Manufacturers calculate ASP based on a statutorily defined formula and interpretations of the statute by CMS as to what should or should not be considered in computing ASP. An ASP for each National Drug Code for a product that is subject to the ASP reporting requirement must be submitted to CMS no later than 30 days after the end of each calendar quarter. CMS uses these submissions to determine payment rates for drugs under Medicare Part B. Changes affecting the calculation of ASP could affect the ASP calculations for our products and the resulting Medicare payment rate, and could negatively impact our results of operations. Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients. The 340B ceiling price is calculated using a statutory formula, which is based on AMP and rebate amount for the covered outpatient drug as calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate program. As described below, the Affordable Care Act introduced changes to the definition of AMP and the Medicaid rebate formula and made changes to the 340B drug pricing program as well. 
The Affordable Care Act also expanded the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program to include additional types of covered entities: certain free-standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals, rural referral centers and sole community hospitals, each as defined by the Affordable Care Act. For example, the percentage of Feraheme sold to 340B institutions has grown from 11% in 2011 to 20% in 2016. Since these institutions are granted lower prices than those offered to our other customers, any further growth in our 340B business may have a negative impact on our sales price per gram and operating margins. The Affordable Care Act exempts “orphan drugs,” such as Makena, from the ceiling price requirements for the covered entity types newly added to the program by the Affordable Care Act.
The Affordable Care Act obligates the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”), the agency that administers the 340B program, to create regulations and processes to improve the integrity of the 340B drug pricing program and to update the agreement that manufacturers must sign to participate in the 340B drug pricing program to obligate a manufacturer to offer the 340B price to covered entities if the manufacturer makes the drug available to any other purchaser at any price and to report to the government the ceiling prices for its drugs. In January 2017, HRSA issued a final rule regarding the calculation of the 340B ceiling price and the imposition of civil monetary penalties on manufacturers that knowingly and intentionally overcharge covered entities. We do not believe this rule will have a material impact on our business or results of operations. Additionally, in order to be eligible to have our products paid for with federal funds under the Medicaid and Medicare Part B programs and purchased by certain federal agencies and grantees, we participate in the Department of Veterans Affairs (the “VA”), Federal Supply Schedule (the “FSS”) pricing program. As part of this program, we are obligated to make our products available for procurement on an FSS contract under which we must comply with standard government terms and conditions and charge a price that is no higher than the statutory Federal Ceiling Price (the “FCP”) to four federal agencies (VA, U.S. Department of Defense, DoD, Public Health Service, and Coast Guard, the “Big Four”). The FCP is based on the non-federal AMP (the “Non-FAMP”), which we calculate and report to the VA on a quarterly and annual basis. Pursuant to applicable law, knowing provision of false information in connection with a Non-FAMP filing can subject a manufacturer to penalties of $100,000 for each item of false information. These obligations also contain extensive disclosure and certification requirements. Under Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, we are also required to pay 
28

quarterly rebates on utilization of innovator products that are dispensed through the Tricare Retail Pharmacy network to Tricare beneficiaries. The rebates are calculated as the difference between the annual Non-FAMP and FCP. 
Reimbursement by private third-party payers depends on a number of factors, including the third-party’s determination that the product is competitively priced, safe and effective, appropriate for the specific patient, and cost-effective. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for pharmaceutical products, and have instituted and continue to institute cost containment measures to control or significantly influence the purchase of pharmaceutical products. For example, to reduce expenditures associated with pharmaceutical products, many third-party payers use cost containment methods, including: (a) formularies, which limit coverage for drugs not included on a predetermined list; (b) variable copayments, which may make a certain drug more expensive for patients as compared with a competing drug; (c) utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization before the payer will cover the drug and limits on the number of prescriptions that will be paid over a set time period; and (d) other coverage policies that limit access to certain drugs for certain uses based on the payer-specific coverage policy.
In addition, federal and state governments continue to attempt to curb healthcare costs through legislation, including legislation aimed at reducing the pricing and reimbursement of pharmaceutical products. The Affordable Care Act includes certain cost containment measures including an increase to the minimum rebates for products covered by Medicaid programs from 15.1% to 23.1% of AMP for most innovator products, and the expansion of the 340B Drug pricing program under the Public Health Service Act. Effective March 2010, the Affordable Care Act expanded manufacturer rebate liability under the Medicaid program from fee-for-service Medicaid utilization to include the utilization of Medicaid managed care organizations as well. In addition, the Affordable Care Act and subsequent legislation changed the definition of AMP. Further, federal budgetary concerns could result in the implementation of significant federal spending cuts, including cuts in Medicare and other health related spending in the near-term. For example, past legislative enactments resulted in Medicare payments being subject to a two percent reduction, referred to as sequestration, until 2025. Finally, the Affordable Care Act required pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs to pay a branded prescription drug fee to the federal government. Each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer pays a prorated share of the branded prescription drug fee of $3.0 billion in 2016, based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to certain federal programs identified in the law. “Orphan drugs” are specifically defined for purposes of the fee. For each indication approved by the FDA for the drug, such indication must have been designated as orphan by the FDA under section 526 of the FDCA, an orphan drug tax credit under section 45C of the Internal Revenue Code must have been claimed with respect to such indication, and such tax credit must not have been disallowed by the Internal Revenue Service. Finally, the FDA must not have approved the drug for any indication other than an orphan indication for which a section 45C orphan drug tax credit was claimed (and not disallowed). Makena was excluded from the branded prescription drug fee in 2015 and 2016. On December 13, 2016, President Obama signed into law the 21st Century Cures Act which, among other things, expands the scope of health care economic information that manufacturers may use to promote drugs to payers, formulary committees and similar entities. 
In addition, the heightened focus on the healthcare industry by the federal government could result in the implementation of significant federal spending cuts including cuts in Medicare and other health related spending in the near-term. In recent years, some states have also passed legislation to control the prices of drugs as well as begun a move toward managed care to relieve some of their Medicaid cost burden. These and any future changes in government regulation or private third-party payers’ reimbursement policies may reduce the extent of reimbursement for our products and adversely affect our future operating results. For example, since approximately half of Makena patients are Medicaid beneficiaries in 2016, the impact of future legislative changes may have a significant impact on Makena sales. Payers also are increasingly considering new metrics as the basis for reimbursement rates, such as average sales price, average manufacturer price, actual acquisition cost and value-based programs that may require cost effectiveness data and analyses, along with expanded packaging of products and services in alternative payment models. The existing data for reimbursement based on these metrics is relatively limited, although certain states have begun to survey acquisition cost data for the purpose of setting Medicaid reimbursement rates. CMS surveys and publishes retail community pharmacy acquisition cost information in the form of National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (“NADAC”) files, which reflect retail community pharmacy invoice costs, and National Average Retail Price (“NARP”) files to provide state Medicaid agencies with a basis of comparison for their own reimbursement and pricing methodologies and rates. It may be difficult to project the impact of these evolving reimbursement mechanics on the willingness of payers to cover our products. Any failure to cover our products appropriately, in addition to legislative and regulatory changes and others that may occur in the future, could impact our ability to maximize revenues in the federal marketplace.
Currently, in physician clinic and hospital settings, Medicare Part B generally reimburses for physician-administered drugs at a rate of 104.3% of the drug’s ASP. ASP is defined by statute based on sales and price concession data, including rebates and chargebacks, for a defined period of time. As noted above, we submit the required information to CMS on a quarterly basis. In advance of the quarter in which the payment limit for drugs reimbursed under Medicare Part B program will go into effect, CMS calculates and publishes the payment limit. Under this methodology, payment rates change on a quarterly basis, and 
29

significant downward fluctuations in ASP, and therefore reimbursement rates, could negatively impact sales of a product. Because the ASP-based payment rate is defined by statute, and changes to Medicare payment methodologies require legislative change, it is unclear if and when ASP reimbursement methodology will change for the physician office setting. While the statute requires Medicare Part B payments for most drugs furnished in the physician office setting to be at 104.3% of ASP, the statute does not have a similar requirement for hospital outpatient departments. For that setting, the Medicare payment for many covered Part B drugs also is at 104.3% of ASP, but CMS could change that through regulations, without any intervening legislation. While Medicare is the predominant payer for Feraheme for treatment of patients with CKD, Medicare payment policy, in time, can also influence pricing and reimbursement in the non-Medicare markets, as private third-party payers and state Medicaid plans frequently adopt Medicare principles in setting reimbursement methodologies and payment levels. We cannot predict the impact that any changes in reimbursement policies may have on our ability to compete effectively.
For example, in the U.S. hospital inpatient setting, most drugs are not reimbursed separately within the Medicare prospective payment system, based largely on the drug costs, but are bundled as a per discharge reimbursement based on the diagnosis and/or procedure rather than actual costs incurred in patient treatments, thereby increasing the incentive for a hospital to limit or control expenditures. As a result, we do not expect premium priced products, such as Feraheme, to be broadly used in the hospital inpatient setting.
We believe reimbursement for HSDD will be similar to approved products treating erectile dysfunction. If this is the case, we expect that commercial payors with a tiered formulary will place Rekynda into a Tier 3, which normally requires a higher co-pay or deductible than Tier 1 or 2 category drugs. As a result, patients would be unlikely to receive full reimbursement by third-party commercial payers and may not receive any reimbursement from governmental healthcare programs.  
Additionally, a key focus of the recent presidential election was “repeal and replacement” of the Affordable Care Act. The extent, timing and details of the changes are not known, but the federally funded health care landscape could face significant changes during the current presidential administration, including in the near-term, and could impact state and local healthcare programs, including Medicaid and Medicare through reductions in payment levels for drugs.
If adequate reimbursement levels are not maintained by government and other third-party payers for our products, our ability to sell our products may be limited and/or our ability to establish acceptable pricing levels for our products may be impaired, thereby reducing anticipated revenues and our profitability.
Backlog
We had a $7.1 million and $3.7 million product sales backlog as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect to recognize the $7.1 million in the first quarter of 2017, net of any applicable rebates or credits. These backlogs were largely due to timing of orders received from our third-party logistics providers. Generally, product orders from our customers are fulfilled within a relatively short time of receipt of a customer order.
Employees
As of February 13, 2017, we had 545 employees. We also utilize consultants and independent contractors on a regular basis to assist in the development and commercialization of our products and services. Our success depends to a significant extent on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified sales, technical and laboratory operations, managerial, scientific and medical personnel of all levels. Although we believe we have been relatively successful to date in obtaining and retaining such personnel, we may not be successful in the future. During 2016 and 2015, we expanded our leadership team and strengthened our commercial organization. We expect to continue these efforts in 2017 to support the growth of our business.
None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Foreign Operations
We have no foreign operations. We did not have material revenues from customers outside of the U.S. in 2016. Revenues from customers outside of the U.S. amounted to approximately 12% of our total revenues for both 2015 and 2014 and were principally related to collaboration revenues recognized in connection with our former agreement with Takeda, which is headquartered in Japan, and which was terminated in June 2015 following a six-month transition period. We do not currently expect any material future sales outside of the U.S.

Research and Development
We have dedicated a significant portion of our resources over the last several years to our efforts to develop our products and product candidates, including both Feraheme and Makena. We incurred research and development expenses of $66.1 million, $42.9 million, and $24.2 million during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 mostly due to additional expenses associated with research and development related to our commercial products, up to $25.0 million in clinical development and regulatory costs associated with our obligations under the Rekynda License Agreement and related anticipated increase in expenses in our regulatory and clinical functions, and a $60.0 million upfront payment made to Palatin in February 2017. 
Segment Reporting
We conduct our operations in one business segment as further described in Note O, “Business Segments,” to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
