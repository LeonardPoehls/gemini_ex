ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
 We were incorporated in 1992 as a Texas corporation and are headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas. From our facilities in North America, Europe and Asia, we produce and distribute specialty chemicals and performance materials for the semiconductor, industrial wood preservation and pipeline and energy markets. We operate three business platforms: electronic chemicals, pipeline performance and wood treating chemicals. In our electronic chemicals platform, we are the leading global supplier of high-purity process chemicals, serving semiconductor manufacturers in the United States, Europe and Asia. We formulate, purify and blend acids, solvents and other wet chemicals used to etch and clean silicon wafers in the production of semiconductors, photovoltaics (solar cells) and flat panel displays. In our pipeline performance platform, we are a leading global provider of products, services and solutions for optimizing pipeline throughput and maximizing performance and safety. Our pipeline performance products include drag-reducing agents, valve lubricants, cleaners and sealants, and related equipment. We also provide routine and emergency maintenance services and training for pipeline operators worldwide. Our wood treating chemicals, based on pentachlorophenol, or penta, are sold to industrial customers who use these products to extend the useful life of wood utility poles and crossarms. 
 For the year ended July 31, 2017, we generated revenues of $333.4 million and net income of $23.6 million. On July 31, 2017, we had total long-term debt, net of current maturities, of $523.1 million, cash and cash equivalents of $20.7 million and total stockholders’ equity of $173.7 million. 
 Business Strategy
 We seek to build long-term shareholder value through smart and efficient management of our existing operations, and through the effective integration and optimization of acquired businesses. Our actions are guided by our core values, which emphasize a passion for excellence, the value of our people, and that character and teamwork are critical. Three fundamental principles are at the core of our growth strategy:

• | Operate. We seek to maximize cash flow by managing our plants efficiently and driving continual improvement throughout our global operations. We enhance the value of our operations by concentrating on customer satisfaction and efficient management of our resources to increase our profitability and cash flows.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Acquire. The cash flows generated by the businesses that we operate provide us with the ability to pursue further acquisitions in order to build on our existing segments, and to establish new business platforms for future growth. We employ a methodical approach to identify and evaluate potential acquisitions, only pursuing those that meet our financial and strategic criteria. Our discipline throughout the acquisition process maximizes the potential for long-term success and value creation.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Integrate. We have consistently improved our ability to integrate progressively larger and more complex acquisitions. Our focus is to maintain reliable service to our customers during the integration period, realize operational and commercial synergies, and efficiently absorb acquired businesses. An effective integration strategy is an essential precondition for our operational success.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our growth strategy focuses on niche segments of larger markets where we can establish leading market positions through consolidation and organic growth. We seek to acquire and operate unique businesses with value-added products that provide essential performance enhancements or provide important safety benefits, yet represent a minimal portion of the end product cost. We focus on purchasing product lines and businesses that operate in segments of the specialty chemical industry that meet our specific financial and strategic criteria including:
  
• | unique products with higher value applications;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | barriers to entry;
--+-------------------


• | proven management team with a track record of performance; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | strong cash flow.

Business Segments 
 Electronic Chemicals. Our electronic chemicals platform sells high-purity process chemicals to semiconductor manufacturers in the United States, Europe and Asia. We formulate, purify and blend acids, solvents and other wet chemicals used to etch and clean silicon wafers in the production of semiconductors, photovoltaics (solar cells) and flat panel displays. Our electronic chemicals business accounted for 83.0% of our net sales in fiscal year 2017, 87.8% in fiscal year 2016 and 82.9% in fiscal year 2015.

The electronic chemicals business was acquired initially in December 2007 from Air Products and Chemicals, Inc., and expanded with our purchases in March 2010 and in May 2013 of similar businesses from General Chemical Performance Products LLP and OM Group, Inc., respectively. On April 4, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Nagase Finechem Singapore (Pte) Ltd., a Singapore-based manufacturer of electronic chemicals. Our products include sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric and hydrofluoric acids, ammonium hydroxide, hydrogen peroxide, isopropyl alcohol, other specialty organic solvents and various blends of chemicals. We operate our electronic chemicals business through KMG Electronic Chemicals, Inc. in North America and through KMG Italia, S.r.l. and KMG Electronic Chemicals Luxembourg Holdings S.a.r.l. (and its subsidiaries) in Europe and Asia and have facilities in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Italy and Singapore. Our customers rely on us to provide products with very low levels of contaminants and particles, in some cases at less than 100 parts per trillion levels. We purchase raw material chemicals from various suppliers and blend, package and purify them for distribution to our customers. We are responsible for product purity levels and analytical testing. Our products are sold in bulk and in containers, including bottles, drums and totes. This purification and distribution process is largely accomplished at our facilities in the United States, Europe and Singapore.
 Performance Materials. Our performance materials segment includes our pipeline performance business and our wood treating chemicals business. Our performance materials segment constituted about 17.0% of our net sales in fiscal year 2017, 12.2% in fiscal year 2016 and 17.1% in fiscal year 2015.
 In our pipeline performance business, we supply drag-reducing agents, industrial valve lubricants, cleaners and sealants, and related services and equipment, including routine and emergency valve maintenance services and training, to the pipeline and energy services market. Our pipeline performance products and services provide value-added specialty products that optimize pipeline efficiency, lower operating costs and enhance safety. The pipeline performance business was established with the acquisition of Valves Incorporated of Texas in May 2015, and expanded with the acquisition of the assets of Sealweld Corporation in February 2017 and the acquisition of Flowchem LLC (“Flowchem”) in June 2017. We operate our performance materials business through KMG Val‑Tex, LLC (“Val-Tex”), Sealweld (USA), Inc. and Flowchem (and its subsidiaries) in the United States, and through KMG Industrial Lubricants Canada, Inc. in Canada. We operate facilities for the manufacture, formulation and distribution of our pipeline performance products in the United States, Canada and the Middle East.
 In our wood treating chemicals business, we supply penta to industrial customers who use this preservative to pressure treat wood products, primarily utility poles and crossarms, to extend their useful life by protecting against insect damage and decay. Our penta products include solid blocks and concentrated solutions. We manufacture solid penta blocks at our facility in Matamoros, Mexico through KMG de Mexico S.A. de C.V., a Mexican corporation which is a wholly owned subsidiary of KMG‑Bernuth, Inc. We sell penta products in the United States, Canada and Mexico. We also sell hydrochloric acid, which is a byproduct of penta production for use in the steel and oil well service industries.
 Suppliers
 In our electronic chemicals segment, we rely on a variety of suppliers for our raw materials, some of which we purchase on open account and others which we purchase under supply contracts. The number of suppliers is often limited, particularly as to the specific grade of raw material required by us to supply high purity products to our customers.
 In our performance materials segment, our pipeline performance products and wood treating chemicals depend on outside suppliers for all of the raw materials needed to produce our products, and are subject to fluctuations in the price of those materials. The principal raw materials used are olefin and catalysts for our drag-reducing agents and chlorine, phenol and co-solvent for our penta products, each of which we purchase from a limited number of suppliers. 
 No assurance can be given that the loss of a supplier would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.
 Customers
 One of our electronic chemicals customers, Intel Corporation, accounted for 10% or more of our revenues in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015. No other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in fiscal years 2017, 2016 or 2015. The loss of the Intel business would have a material adverse effect on sales of our electronic chemicals.
Marketing
 We sell to our electronic chemicals customers through a combination of an internal sales force and distributors organized by geographic region. Our performance materials are sold through an internal sales force, distributors and independent agents.

Geographical Information
 Sales made to customers in the United States were 54.0% of total revenues in fiscal year 2017, 54.5% in 2016 and 57.2% in 2015. Sales made outside of the United States were primarily electronic chemicals sold in Europe, Israel and Singapore. As of the end of fiscal year 2017, our property, plant and equipment were allocated, based on net book value, 64.0% in the United States and 36.0% elsewhere.
Competition
 There are competitors spread geographically that compete with us in the sale of electronic chemicals in various regions. There are only a few firms competing with us in the sale of our drag-reducing agents and wood treating chemical products. For our industrial lubricants products, we compete with many other firms. We compete by selling our products at competitive prices and maintaining a strong commitment to product quality and customer service.
 In electronic chemicals in North America, we believe that we have a significant market share, and our principal competitors include Honeywell, Kanto Corporation and Avantor (formerly Mallinckrodt Baker). Internationally, we compete in Europe primarily with BASF, Technic and Honeywell, and in Asia with BASF, Kanto Corporation and others. We believe our market share in Europe is comparable to our competitors, and we do not participate materially in the market in Asia outside of Singapore.
 In our electronic chemicals business, our customers demand that each of their suppliers and each product used to make their semiconductors go through a rigorous qualification process. Once a customer has qualified one or more suppliers and their products for one of its fabrication facilities, there is often reluctance to switch to suppliers who are not qualified.
 In our pipeline performance business, we have two primary competitors in the manufacture of drag-reducing agents in the United States, Lubrizol Specialty Products, Inc. and Baker Hughes Incorporated. For our industrial lubricants products, competitors include over twenty other businesses that serve the oil and gas storage, pipeline and gas distribution markets, none of which have a dominant market position. Our principal competitors for industrial lubricants include Flowserve Corporation and JetLube, Inc.
 The principal wood preserving chemicals for industrial applications are penta, creosote and chromated copper arsenate, or CCA. We supply customers in the United States with penta, but not creosote or CCA. We are the only manufacturer of penta-based preservatives in North America. Penta is used primarily to treat electric, telephone and other utility poles, to protect them from insect damage and decay, extending their useful life by many years. We estimate that approximately four million treated wood utility poles are purchased each year by utility companies in the United States. Of that amount, we estimate approximately 45% are treated with penta. The remaining poles are treated primarily with creosote or CCA.
 Our wood treating chemicals must be registered prior to sale under United States law. See “Environmental and Safety Matters — Licenses, Permits and Product Registrations.” As a condition to registration, any company wishing to manufacture and sell these products must provide substantial scientific research and testing data regarding the chemistry and toxicology of the products to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). This data must be generated by the applicant, or the applicant must purchase access to the information from other data providers. We believe that the cost of satisfying the data submission requirement serves as an impediment to the entry of new competitors, particularly those with lesser financial resources. While we have no reason to believe that the product registration requirement will be materially modified, we cannot give any assurances as to the effect of such a discontinuation or modification on our competitive position.
 Employees
 As of the end of fiscal year 2017, we had a total of 751 full-time employees. We employed 485 employees in our electronic chemicals segment, 202 employees in our performance materials segment, and 64 employees in administration and corporate.
Environmental and Safety Matters
 Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances in the United States and abroad relating to the protection of the environment and human health and to safety, including those pertaining to chemical manufacture and distribution, waste generation, storage and disposal, discharges to waterways, and air emissions and various other health and safety matters. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violators may be subject to civil, criminal and administrative penalties, injunctions or both. We devote significant financial resources to ensure compliance with safety and environmental laws. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
 We anticipate that the regulation of our business operations under federal, state and local environmental laws in the United States and abroad will increase and become more stringent over time. We cannot estimate the impact of increased and more stringent regulation on our operations, future capital expenditure requirements or the cost of compliance.
