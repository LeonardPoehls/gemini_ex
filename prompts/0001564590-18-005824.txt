Item 1.  Business
Overview
 Earthstone Energy, Inc., a Delaware corporation (together with our consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” “our,” “we,” “us,” “Earthstone” or similar terms), is a growth-oriented independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition and development of oil and gas reserves through activities that include the acquisition, drilling and development of undeveloped leases, asset and corporate acquisitions and mergers and, to a lesser extent, exploration activities. Our operations are all in the upstream segment of the oil and natural gas industry and all our properties are onshore in the United States.  At present, our primary assets are located in the Midland Basin of west Texas and the Eagle Ford Trend of south Texas. 
 Historically, we have operated in multiple basins in order to enable us to benefit from regional differences in realized prices and the availability and cost of equipment and services.  Starting in May 2017, with the closing of the Bold Transaction (more fully described below), our focus has been primarily in the Midland Basin of west Texas where our acreage has multiple stacked pay intervals in the Wolfcamp and, to a lesser extent the Spraberry formations. We believe the area is characterized by high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons and high drilling success rates. Since May 2017, we have used one drilling rig and successfully drilled nine wells in the Midland Basin. With approximately 943 potential gross drilling locations in the Midland Basin, our future development will be focused predominately on horizontal development drilling in the area. We currently intend to run one rig continuously in the Midland Basin and are considering deploying another rig in the second half of 2018, depending on commodity prices and the cost and availability of quality services. Our second area of focus is the Eagle Ford Trend where we have locations in the Eagle Ford and Austin Chalk formations. During 2017, we used one drilling rig and successfully drilled 11 Eagle Ford wells. We plan to have a similar drilling program in 2018 which should allow us to maintain our acreage positions. We have approximately 161 potential gross operated drilling locations in the Eagle Ford Trend for future development. In order to allow us to focus on the Midland Basin, during 2017, we divested our Bakken and other non-core properties and reduced our working interest in certain wells that we drilled in the Eagle Ford through joint development agreements while maintaining operatorship and our acreage positions.  
 Currently, our reserve portfolio primarily consists of assets in the Midland Basin of west Texas and the Eagle Ford Trend of south Texas. We have 26,665 net acres in the core of the Midland Basin, of which 77% is operated and 23% is non-operated.  We hold an approximately 87% working interest in our operated acreage and an approximately 38% working interest in our non-operated acreage.  Our operated acreage in the Midland Basin is primarily located in Reagan, Upton and Midland counties. Our non-operated acreage in the Midland Basin is located primarily in Howard, Glasscock, Martin and Midland counties. In total, we have an interest in approximately 195 gross producing wells in the Midland Basin.  We have 19,856 net leasehold acres in the Eagle Ford Trend of south Texas, including 16,045 operated net leasehold acres in the crude oil window in Fayette, Gonzales and Karnes counties, with working interests ranging from approximately 16% to 50%, and 2,863 non-operated net leasehold acres located in the natural gas and condensate window in La Salle County, with an average working interest of approximately 13%. Our 948 remaining net leasehold acres located in the Eagle Ford Trend, reside in Frio and Wilson counties. In total, we have an interest in approximately 165 gross producing wells in the Eagle Ford Trend.  
 At December 31, 2017, our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves were approximately 79,976 MBOE based on the reserve report prepared by Cawley, Gillespie & Associates, Inc. (“CG&A”), our independent reserve engineers. Based on this report, at December 31, 2017, our proved reserve quantities were approximately 59% oil, 19% natural gas, 22% NGLs and 25% classified as proved developed. The calculated percentages include proved developed non-producing reserves. Of these interests, approximately 45,346 MBOE are attributable to noncontrolling interests. See Note 8. Noncontrolling Interests in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our current business strategy is to focus on the economic development of our existing acreage, increase our acreage and well locations in oil-rich areas of the Midland Basin and increase stockholder value through the following:

• | pursue value-accretive acquisition and corporate merger opportunities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | profitably increase cash flows, production and reserves by selectively developing our acreage base;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expand our acreage positions and drilling inventory in our areas of primary interest through acquisitions and farm-in opportunities, with an emphasis on operated position and selective non-operated participations with capable operators;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | block up acreage to allow for 10,000-foot horizontal lateral drilling locations which provide higher economic returns;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain operating control over the majority of our production, development and undeveloped acreage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8


 
• | cost-effectively produce, develop and exploit of our existing acreage positions; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maintain a strong balance sheet and financial flexibility.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------

Our Strengths
 We believe that the following strengths will be beneficial in achieving our business goals:
  
• | extensive horizontal development potential in one of the most oil rich basins of the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experienced management team with substantial technical and operational expertise and a history of successful acquisition and merger transactions;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | operating control over the majority of our production and development activities; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | conservative balance sheet.

Recent Developments
 Bold Contribution Agreement
 In May, 2017, Earthstone completed a contribution agreement dated as of November 7, 2016 and as amended on March 21, 2017 (the “Bold Contribution Agreement”), by and among Earthstone, Earthstone Energy Holdings, LLC (“EEH”), Lynden US, Lynden USA Operating, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Lynden Op”), Bold Energy Holdings, LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Bold Holdings”), and Bold Energy III LLC, a Texas limited liability company (“Bold”). The purpose of the Bold Contribution Agreement was to provide for, among other things described below, the business combination between Earthstone and Bold, which owned significant developed and undeveloped oil and natural gas properties in the Midland Basin of Texas (the “Bold Transaction”).
 The Bold Transaction was structured in a manner commonly known as an “Up-C.” Under this structure and the Bold Contribution Agreement, (i) Earthstone recapitalized its common stock into two classes – Class A common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), and Class B common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Class B Common Stock”), and all of Earthstone’s existing outstanding common stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Common Stock”), was recapitalized on a one-for-one basis for Class A Common Stock (the “Recapitalization”); (ii) Earthstone transferred all of its membership interests in Earthstone Operating, LLC, Sabine River Energy, LLC, EF Non-Op, LLC and Earthstone Legacy Properties, LLC (formerly Earthstone GP, LLC) and $36,071 in cash from the sale of Class B Common Stock to Bold Holdings (collectively, the “Earthstone Assets”) to EEH, in exchange for 16,791,296 membership units of EEH (the “EEH Units”); (iii) Lynden US transferred all of its membership interests in Lynden Op to EEH in exchange for 5,865,328 EEH Units; (iv) Bold Holdings transferred all of its membership interests in Bold to EEH in exchange for 36,070,828 EEH Units and purchased 36,070,828 shares of Class B Common Stock issued by Earthstone for $36,071; and (v) Earthstone granted an aggregate of 150,000 fully vested shares of Class A Common Stock under Earthstone’s 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the “2014 Plan”), to certain employees of Bold. Each EEH Unit, together with one share of Class B Common Stock, are convertible into one share of Class A Common Stock. 
 Upon closing of the Bold Transaction on May 9, 2017, Bold Holdings owned approximately 61.4% of the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, on a fully diluted, as converted basis. The EEH Units and the shares of Class B Common Stock issued to Bold Holdings were not registered under the Securities Act but were issued by EEH and Earthstone in reliance on the exemption provided under Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.
 Pursuant to the terms of the Bold Contribution Agreement, at the closing of the Bold Transaction, Earthstone, Bold Holdings, and the unitholders of Bold Holdings entered into a registration rights agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) relating to the shares of Class A Common Stock issuable upon the exchange of the EEH Units and Class B Common Stock held by Bold Holdings or its unitholders. In accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement, Earthstone filed a registration statement (the “Registration Statement”) with the SEC to permit the public resale of the shares of Class A Common Stock issued by Earthstone to Bold Holdings or its unitholders in connection with the exchange of Class B Common Stock and EEH Units in accordance with the terms of the First Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement of EEH (the “EEH LLC Agreement”). On October 18, 2017, the Registration Statement was declared effective by the SEC.
 On May 9, 2017, in connection with the closing of the Bold Contribution Agreement, Earthstone, EnCap Investments L.P. (“EnCap”), Oak Valley Resources, LLC (“OVR”), and Bold Holdings entered into a voting agreement (the “Voting Agreement”), pursuant to which EnCap, OVR, and Bold Holdings agreed not to vote any shares of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock held by them in favor of any action, or take any action that would in any way alter the composition of the board of directors of Earthstone (the “Board”) from its composition immediately following the closing of the Bold Contribution Agreement as long as the Voting Agreement is in effect.
 9


Immediately following the closing of the Bold Contribution Agreement, the Board was increased to nine members from eight members, four of which are designated by EnCap, three of which are independent, and two of which are members of our management, including Earthstone’s Chief Executive Officer. At any time during the effectiveness of the Voting Agreement during which EnCap’s collective ownership of Earthstone exceeds 50% of the total issued and outstanding voting stock, EnCap may remove and replace one director that was not originally designated by EnCap, and his or her successors. Any such removal and replacement must be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Earthstone’s certificate of incorporation and bylaws then in effect. The Voting Agreement terminates on the earlier of (i) the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the Bold Contribution Agreement and (ii) the date upon which EnCap, OVR, and Bold Holdings collectively own, of record and beneficially, less than 20% of Earthstone’s outstanding voting stock.
 On May 9, 2017, the closing sale price of the Class A Common Stock was $13.58 per share. On May 10, 2017, the Class A Common Stock was uplisted from the NYSE American, LLC (formerly the NYSE MKT) (the “NYSE American”) to the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) where it is listed under the symbol “ESTE.”
 Credit Agreement 
 On May 9, 2017, in connection with the closing of the Bold Transaction, the Company exited its credit agreement dated December 19, 2014, by and among Earthstone and its subsidiaries, BOKF, NA dba Bank of Texas, and the Lenders party thereto (as amended, modified or restated from time to time, the “ESTE Credit Agreement”). At that time, all outstanding borrowings of $10.0 million under the ESTE Credit Agreement were repaid and $0.5 million of remaining unamortized deferred financing costs were expensed and included in Write-off of deferred financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.  
 On May 9, 2017, EEH (the “Borrower”), Earthstone Operating, LLC, EF Non-Op, LLC, Sabine River Energy, LLC, Earthstone Legacy Properties, LLC, Lynden Op, Bold, Bold Operating, LLC (the “Guarantors”), BOKF, NA dba Bank of Texas, as Agent and Lead Arranger, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association as Syndication Agent and the Lenders party thereto (the “Lenders”), entered into a credit agreement (as amended, modified or restated from time to time, the “EEH Credit Agreement”).
 The borrowing base under the EEH Credit Agreement is currently $185.0 million and is subject to redetermination on or about November 1st and May 1st of each year. The amounts borrowed under the EEH Credit Agreement bear annual interest rates at either (a) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 2.25% to 3.25% or (b) the prime lending rate of the Bank of Texas plus 1.25% to 2.25%, depending on the amounts borrowed under the EEH Credit Agreement. Principal amounts outstanding under the EEH Credit Agreement are due and payable in full at maturity on May 9, 2022. All of the obligations under the EEH Credit Agreement, and the guarantees of those obligations, are secured by substantially all of EEH’s assets. Additional payments due under the EEH Credit Agreement include paying a commitment fee of 0.50% per year to the Lenders in respect of the unutilized commitments thereunder, as well as certain other customary fees.
 The EEH Credit Agreement contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, EEH’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, create liens on assets, make investments, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, pay dividends and make distributions or repurchase its limited liability interests, engage in mergers or consolidations, sell certain assets, sell or discount any notes receivable or accounts receivable and engage in certain transactions with affiliates.
 In addition, the EEH Credit Agreement requires EEH to maintain the following financial covenants: a current ratio of not less than 1.0 to 1.0 and a leverage ratio of not greater than 4.0 to 1.0. Leverage ratio means the ratio of (i) the aggregate debt of EEH and its consolidated subsidiaries as at the last day of the fiscal quarter (excluding any debt from obligations relating to non-cash losses under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (FASB ASC 815”) as a result of changes in the fair market value of derivatives) to (ii) the product of EBITDAX for such fiscal quarter multiplied by four. The term “EBITDAX” means, for any period, the sum of consolidated net income for such period plus (a) the following expenses or charges to the extent deducted from consolidated net income in such period: (i) interest, (ii) taxes, (iii) depreciation, (iv) depletion, (v) amortization, (vi) non-cash losses under FASB ASC 815 as a result of changes in the fair market value of derivatives, (vii) exploration expenses, (viii) impairment expenses, and (ix) non-cash compensation expenses and minus (b) to the extent included in consolidated net income in such period, non-cash gains under FASB ASC 815 as a result of changes in the fair market value of derivatives.
 The EEH Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative covenants and defines events of default to include failure to pay principal or interest, breach of covenants, breach of representations and warranties, insolvency, judgment default, and if Frank A. Lodzinski ceases to serve and function as Chief Executive Officer of EEH and the majority of the Lenders do not approve of Mr. Lodzinski’s successor. Upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default, the Lenders have the right to accelerate repayment of the loans and exercise their remedies with respect to the collateral. 
 10


On December 1, 2017, EEH entered into an amendment (the “Amendment”) to the EEH Credit Agreement. Among other things, the Amendment (i) increased the borrowing base from $150.0 million to $185.0 million; (ii) eliminated the limitation on the Borrower to request a loan when the consolidated cash held by the Company exceeds a certain threshold; (iii) reduced the frequency of reporting of hedging agreements by the Borrower to the Lenders; (iv) allows for the sale or transfer of any oil and gas property or any interest in any oil and natural gas property in excess of 5% of the value of the Company’s proved developed producing reserves, subject to a redetermination of the borrowing base; and (v) allows the Borrower to enter into hedging agreements pertaining to oil and natural gas properties to be acquired pursuant to a proposed acquisition and, if terminated, liquidated within ten business days. 
 Class A Common Stock Offering
 In October 2017, we completed a public offering of 4,500,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, at a public offering price of $9.25 per share, receiving net proceeds of $39.4 million, after deducting underwriters’ fees and offering expenses of $2.2 million. The net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under the EEH Credit Agreement. 
Bakken Divestiture
 In December 2017, we closed the sale of all of our oil and natural gas leases, oil and natural gas wells and associated assets located in the Williston Basin in North Dakota (the “Bakken Sale”) for a net cash consideration of approximately $26.4 million after normal and customary purchase price adjustments of $0.9 million to account for net cash flows from the effective date to the closing date. The sale resulted in a net gain of approximately $3.0 million recorded in Gain on sale of oil and gas properties in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The effective date of the sale was December 1, 2017.  The net proceeds were used to repay $25.0 million of outstanding borrowings under the EEH Credit Agreement and the remaining $1.4 million retained in cash for current operating funds.
Organizational Structure
 Earthstone is the sole managing member of EEH, with a controlling interest in EEH. Earthstone, together with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Lynden Energy Corp., a corporation organized under the laws of British Columbia (“Lynden Corp”), and Lynden Corp’s wholly-owned consolidated subsidiary, Lynden US and also a member of EEH, consolidates the financial results of EEH and records a noncontrolling interest in the Consolidated Financial Statements representing the economic interests of EEH's members other than Earthstone and Lynden US.      Our Operations
 We are currently the operator of properties containing approximately 70% of our proved oil and natural gas reserves and 73% of our proved PV-10 as of December 31, 2017 (see reconciliation of PV-10 to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows in Item 2. Properties). As operator, we manage and are able to directly influence development and production of operations of our operated properties. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities.  We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work on improving operating cost, production rates and reserves. Our producing properties have reasonably predictable production profiles and cash flows, subject to commodity price fluctuations. Our status as an operator has allowed us to pursue the development of undeveloped acreage, further develop existing properties and generate new projects. 
 As is common in our industry, we participate in non-operated properties on a selective basis. Decisions to participate in non-operated properties are dependent upon the technical and economic nature of the projects and the operating expertise and financial standing of the operators.
 Operational Risks
 Oil and natural gas exploitation, development and production involve a high degree of risk, which even a combination of experience, knowledge and careful evaluation may not be able to overcome. There is no assurance that we will acquire, discover or produce additional oil and natural gas in commercial quantities. Oil and natural gas operations also involve the risk that well fires, blowouts, equipment failure, human error and other events may cause accidental leakage or spills of toxic or hazardous materials, such as petroleum liquids or drilling fluids into the environment or cause significant injury to persons or property. In such event, substantial liabilities to third parties or governmental entities may be incurred, the satisfaction of which could substantially reduce our available cash and possibly result in loss of oil and natural gas properties. Such hazards may also cause damage to or destruction of wells, producing formations, production facilities and pipeline or other processing facilities.
 As is common in the oil and natural gas industry, we do not insure fully against all risks associated with our business either because such insurance is not available or because we believe the premium costs are prohibitive. A loss not fully covered by insurance could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position and cash flows. For further discussion of these risks see Item 1A. Risk Factors of this report.
 11


Marketing and Customers
 We market the majority of the production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties. We sell our production to purchasers at market prices.
 We normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business. For the year ended December 31, 2017, three purchasers accounted for 18%, 14% and 14%, respectively, of our revenue during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2016, two purchasers accounted for 41% and 19%, respectively, of our revenue during the period. For the year ended December 31, 2015, one purchaser accounted for 62% of our revenue during the period. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. If a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us, revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. However, we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers.
 Transportation
 During the planning stage of our fields, we consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production. Our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems. The purchaser of our oil takes delivery of the oil at the tank batteries and transports the oil by truck on a frequent interval, from which point it is transported by various modes by the purchaser to the eventual refining facility. Our natural gas is transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s meter and pipeline interconnection point through our gathering systems.
 In addition, we move the majority of our produced water by pipeline connected to our operated salt water disposal wells rather as wells as by truck to a final disposal destination. 
 Competition
 The domestic oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive in the exploration for and acquisition of reserves and in the producing and marketing of its production. Our competitors include national oil companies, major oil and natural gas companies, independent oil and natural gas companies, drilling partnership programs, individual producers, natural gas marketers, and major pipeline companies, as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to consumers. Many of our competitors are large, well-established companies. They may be able to pay more for seismic information and lease rights on oil and natural gas properties and to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties, than our financial or human resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional properties in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate related transactions in a highly competitive environment.
 There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
 Segment Information and Geographic Area
 Operating segments are defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as components of an enterprise that (i) engage in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (ii) for which separate operational financial information is available and is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance.
 Based on our organization and management, we have only one reportable operating segment, which is oil and natural gas acquisition, exploration and production. We consider drilling rig services ancillary to our oil and natural gas exploration and producing activities and manage these services to support such activities. All of our operations are currently conducted in Texas.
 Seasonality of Business
 Weather conditions often affect the demand for, and prices of, natural gas and can also delay oil and natural gas drilling activities, disrupting our overall business plans. Demand for natural gas is typically higher during the winter, resulting in higher natural gas prices for our natural gas production during our first and fourth fiscal quarters. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, our results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that we may realize on an annual basis.
 12


Markets for Sale of Production
 Our ability to market oil and natural gas found and produced, if any, will depend on numerous factors beyond our control, the effect of which cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated. Some of these factors include, without limitation, the availability of other domestic and foreign production, the marketing of competitive fuels, the proximity and capacity of pipelines, fluctuations in supply and demand, the availability of a ready market, the effect of United States federal and state regulation of production, refining, transportation and sales and general national and worldwide economic conditions. Additionally, we may experience delays in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices and our marketing professionals may experience short-term delays in marketing oil due to trucking and refining constraints. There is no assurance that we will be able to market any oil or natural gas produced, or, if such oil or natural gas is marketed, that favorable prices can be obtained.  
 The United States natural gas market has undergone several significant changes over the past few decades. The majority of federal price ceilings were removed in 1985 and the remainder were lifted by the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989. Thus, currently, the United States natural gas market is operating in a free market environment in which the price of gas is determined by market forces rather than by regulations. At the same time, the domestic natural gas industry has also seen a dramatic change in the manner in which gas is bought, sold and transported. In most cases, natural gas is no longer sold to a pipeline company. Instead, the pipeline company now primarily serves the role of transporter and gas producers are free to sell their product to marketers, local distribution companies, end users or a combination thereof.
 In recent years, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices have been under considerable pressure due to oversupply and other market conditions. Specifically, increased foreign production and increased efficiencies in horizontal drilling, combined with exploration of newly developed shale fields in North America, have dramatically increased global oil and natural gas production, which has led to significantly lower market prices for these commodities. In view of the many uncertainties affecting the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, we are unable to accurately predict future oil, natural gas and NGLs prices or the overall effect, if any, that the decline in demand for and the oversupply of such products will have on our financial condition or results of operations.
 Title to Properties
 We believe that the title to our oil and natural gas properties is good and defensible in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry, subject to such exceptions which, in our opinion, are not so material as to detract substantially from the use or value of our oil and natural gas properties. Our oil and natural gas properties are typically subject, in one degree or another, to one or more of the following:

• | royalties and other burdens and obligations, express or implied, under oil and natural gas leases;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | overriding royalties and other burdens created by us or our predecessors in title;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a variety of contractual obligations (including, in some cases, development obligations) arising under operating agreements, farmout agreements, participation agreements, production sales contracts and other agreements that may affect the properties or their titles;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | back-ins and reversionary interests existing under various agreements and leasehold assignments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | liens that arise in the normal course of operations, such as those for unpaid taxes, statutory liens securing obligations to unpaid suppliers and contractors and contractual liens under operating agreements;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pooling, unitization and other agreements, declarations and orders; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | easements, restrictions, rights-of-way and other matters that commonly affect property.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 To the extent that such burdens and obligations affect our rights to production revenues, they have been taken into account in calculating our net revenue interests and in estimating the quantity and value of our reserves. We believe that the burdens and obligations affecting our oil and natural gas properties are common in our industry with respect to the types of properties we own.
 Operational Regulations 
 All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory and regulatory provisions affecting drilling, completion, and production activities, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process, and the plugging and abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These laws and regulations govern the size of drilling and spacing units, the density of wells that may be drilled in oil and natural gas properties and the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties. In this regard, while some states allow the forced pooling or integration of land and leases to facilitate development, other states including Texas, where we operate, rely primarily or exclusively on voluntary pooling of land and leases. Accordingly, it may be difficult for us to form spacing units and therefore difficult to develop a project if 
 13


we own or control less than 100% of the leasehold. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose specified requirements regarding the ratability of production. On some occasions, local authorities have imposed moratoria or other restrictions on exploration, development and production activities pending investigations and studies addressing potential local impacts of these activities before allowing oil and natural gas exploration, development and production to proceed.
 The effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill, although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction.
 Regulation of Transportation of Natural Gas
 The transportation and sale, or resale, of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”), the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”) and regulations issued under those statutes. FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
 Intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies. The basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state. Insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis, we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors. Like the regulation of interstate transportation rates, the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
 Regulation of Sales of Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids
 The prices at which we sell oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids are not currently subject to federal regulation and, for the most part, are not subject to state regulation. FERC, however, regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, and terms and conditions of transportation service, which affects the marketing of the natural gas we produce, as well as the prices we receive for sales of our natural gas. Similarly, the price we receive from the sale of oil and natural gas liquids is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market.  FERC regulates the transportation of oil and liquids on interstate pipelines under the provision of the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and regulations issued under those statutes.  Intrastate transportation of oil, natural gas liquids, and other products, is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes. In addition, while sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate, and natural gas liquids can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices, Congress could reenact price controls in the future. 
 Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas producers, gatherers and marketers with which we compete.

 Our operations are also subject to stringent federal, state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to health and safety or the protection of the environment. Numerous governmental agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) issue regulations to implement and enforce these laws, which often require difficult and costly compliance measures. Among other things, environmental regulatory programs typically govern the permitting, construction and operation of a well or production related facility. Many factors, including public perception, can materially impact the ability to secure an environmental construction or operation permit. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations may result in the assessment of substantial administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as the issuance of injunctions limiting or prohibiting our activities. In addition, some laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, which could result in liability for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on our part.
 Beyond existing requirements, new programs and changes in existing programs, may affect our business including oil and natural gas exploration and production, air emissions, waste management, and underground injection of waste material. Environmental laws and regulations have been subject to frequent changes over the years, and the imposition of more stringent requirements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The following is a summary of the more significant existing environmental, health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance in the future may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position.

Hazardous Substances and Wastes
 The federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain categories of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons may include the current or former owner or operator of the site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at the site. Under CERCLA, these potentially responsible persons may be subject to strict, joint and several liability for the costs of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment. We are able to control directly the operation of only those wells with respect to which we act as operator. Notwithstanding our lack of direct control over wells operated by others, the failure of an operator other than us to comply with applicable environmental regulations may, in certain circumstances, be attributed to us. We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances but we are not presently aware of any liabilities for which we may be held responsible that would materially or adversely affect us. 
 The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, treatment, storage, transportation, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and solid (non-hazardous) wastes. With the approval of the EPA, the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s solid (non-hazardous) waste provisions. However, legislation has been proposed from time to time and various environmental groups have filed lawsuits that, if successful, could result in the reclassification of certain oil and natural gas exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make such wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. For example, in response to a lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and natural gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and natural gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in our, as well as the oil and natural gas E&P industry’s, costs to manage and dispose of generated wastes, which could have a material adverse effect on the industry as well as on our business.
 From time to time, releases of materials or wastes have occurred at locations we own or at which we have operations. These properties and the materials or wastes released thereon may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under these laws, we have been and may be required to remove or remediate such materials or wastes.
 Water Discharges
 The federal Clean Water Act and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, a new EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rule defining the scope of federal jurisdiction over wetlands and other waters became effective. To the extent the rule expands the range of properties subject to the Clean Water Act’s jurisdiction, certain energy companies could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. The rule has been challenged in court on the grounds that it unlawfully expands the reach of Clean Water Act programs, and implementation of the rule has been stayed pending resolution of the court challenge. In addition, following the issuance of a presidential executive order to review the rule, on July 27, 2017, the EPA proposed to repeal the rule and also separately announced its intent to conduct a substantive re-evaluation of the definition of “waters of the United States” in a future rulemaking. As a result, future implementation of the rule is uncertain at this time. 
 The process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay our operations. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges.

Our oil and natural gas production also generates salt water, which we dispose of by underground injection. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control (“UIC”) program, and related state programs regulate the drilling and operation of salt water disposal wells. The EPA directly administers the UIC program in some states, and in others it is delegated to the state for administering. Permits must be obtained before drilling salt water disposal wells, and casing integrity monitoring must be conducted periodically to ensure the casing is not leaking salt water to groundwater. Contamination of groundwater by oil and natural gas drilling, production, and related operations may result in fines, penalties, and remediation costs, among other sanctions and liabilities under the SDWA and state laws. In addition, third party claims may be filed by landowners and other parties claiming damages for alternative water supplies, property damages, and bodily injury.
 Hydraulic Fracturing
 Our completion operations are subject to regulation, which may increase in the short- or long-term. In particular, the well completion technique known as hydraulic fracturing is used to stimulate production of oil and natural gas has come under increased scrutiny by the environmental community, and many local, state and federal regulators. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and additives under pressure, usually down casing that is cemented in the wellbore, into prospective rock formations at depths to stimulate oil and natural gas production. We engage third parties to provide hydraulic fracturing or other well stimulation services to us in connection with substantially all of the wells for which we are the operator.
 The SDWA regulates the underground injection of substances through the UIC program. Hydraulic fracturing is generally exempt from regulation under the UIC program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions. However, legislation has been proposed in recent sessions of Congress to amend the SDWA to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection,” to require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, and to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process.
 Furthermore, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the fracturing process. For example, the EPA has taken the position that hydraulic fracturing with fluids containing diesel fuel is subject to regulation under the UIC program, specifically as “Class II” UIC wells.
 In addition, the EPA previously announced plans to develop a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking by June 2018, which would describe a proposed mechanism, regulatory, voluntary, or a combination of both, to collect data on hydraulic fracturing chemical substances and mixtures. Also, on June 28, 2016, the EPA published a final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. The EPA is also conducting a study of private wastewater treatment facilities (also known as centralized waste treatment (“CWT”) facilities) accepting oil and natural gas extraction wastewater. The EPA is collecting data and information related to the extent to which CWT facilities accept such wastewater, available treatment technologies (and their associated costs), discharge characteristics, financial characteristics of CWT facilities, and the environmental impacts of discharges from CWT facilities.
 In addition, on March 26, 2015, the Bureau of Land Management (the “BLM”) published a final rule governing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. Also, on November 15, 2016, the BLM finalized a rule to reduce the flaring, venting and leaking of methane from oil and natural gas operations on federal and Indian lands. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order directing the BLM to review the above rules and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them. Accordingly, on December 29, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to rescind the 2015 hydraulic fracturing rule. Also, on December 8, 2017, the BLM published a final rule to suspend or delay certain requirements of the 2016 methane rule until January 17, 2019. Further legal challenges are expected. At this time, it is uncertain when, or if, the rules will be implemented or modified, and what impact they would have on our operations.
 Furthermore, there are certain governmental reviews either underway or being proposed that focus on environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing practices. On December 13, 2016, the EPA released a study examining the potential for hydraulic fracturing activities to impact drinking water resources, finding that, under some circumstances, the use of water in hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources. Also, on February 6, 2015, the EPA released a report with findings and recommendations related to public concern about induced seismic activity from disposal wells. The report recommends strategies for managing and minimizing the potential for significant injection-induced seismic events. Other governmental agencies, including the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Geological Survey, and the U.S. Government Accountability Office, have evaluated or are evaluating various other aspects of hydraulic fracturing. These ongoing or proposed studies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing and could ultimately make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing and increase our costs of compliance and doing business.
 Some states and local jurisdictions in which we operate or hold oil and natural gas interests have adopted or are considering adopting regulations that could restrict or prohibit hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, impose more stringent operating standards and/or require the disclosure of the composition of hydraulic fracturing fluids. If new or more stringent state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
 16


There has been increasing public controversy regarding hydraulic fracturing with regard to the use of fracturing fluids, induced seismic activity, impacts on drinking water supplies, use of water and the potential for impacts to surface water, groundwater and the environment generally. A number of lawsuits and enforcement actions have been initiated across the country implicating hydraulic fracturing practices. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations as well as make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. In addition, if hydraulic fracturing is further regulated at the federal, state or local level, our fracturing activities could become subject to additional permitting and financial assurance requirements, more stringent construction specifications, increased monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping obligations, plugging and abandonment requirements and also to attendant permitting delays and potential increases in costs. Such legislative changes could cause us to incur substantial compliance costs, and compliance or the consequences of any failure to comply by us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the impact on our business of newly enacted or potential federal, state or local laws governing hydraulic fracturing.
 Air Emissions
 The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict emissions of various air pollutants through permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed and continues to develop stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources, including oil and natural gas production. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Our operations, or the operations of service companies engaged by us, may in certain circumstances and locations be subject to permits and restrictions under these statutes for emissions of air pollutants.
 In 2012 and 2016, the EPA issued New Source Performance Standards to regulate emissions of sources of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”), sulfur dioxide, air toxics and methane from various oil and natural gas exploration, production, processing and transportation facilities. In particular, on May 12, 2016, the EPA amended its regulations to impose new standards for methane and volatile organic compounds emissions for certain new, modified, and reconstructed equipment, processes, and activities across the oil and natural gas sector.  However, in a March 28, 2017 executive order, President Trump directed the EPA to review the 2016 regulations and, if appropriate, to initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise them consistent with the stated policy of promoting clean and safe development of the nation’s energy resources, while at the same time avoiding regulatory burdens that unnecessarily encumber energy production. On June 16, 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay for two years certain requirements of the 2016 regulations, including fugitive emission requirements. These standards, as well as any future laws and their implementing regulations, may require us to obtain pre-approval for the expansion or modification of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities expected to produce air emissions, impose stringent air permit requirements, or mandate the use of specific equipment or technologies to control emissions. We cannot predict the final regulatory requirements or the cost to comply with such requirements with any certainty.
 In October 2015, the EPA announced that it was lowering the primary national ambient air quality standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. The EPA did not meet an October 2017 deadline for designating non-attainment areas but has indicated that it continues to work with states to make the required designations. If implemented in the future, the changes will take place over several years; however, the new standard could result in a significant expansion of ozone non-attainment areas across the United States, including areas in which we operate. Oil and natural gas operations in ozone non-attainment areas would likely be subject to increased regulatory burdens in the form of more stringent emission controls, emission offset requirements, and increased permitting delays and costs.
 Climate Change
 In December 2009, the EPA issued an Endangerment Finding that determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”), present an endangerment to public health and the environment because, according to the EPA, emissions of such gases contribute to warming of the earth’s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In May 2010, the EPA adopted regulations establishing new GHG emissions thresholds that determine when stationary sources must obtain permits under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration, or PSD, and Title V programs of the Clean Air Act. On June 23, 2014, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, the Supreme Court held that stationary sources could not become subject to PSD or Title V permitting solely by reason of their GHG emissions. The Court ruled, however, that the EPA may require installation of best available control technology for GHG emissions at sources otherwise subject to the PSD and Title V programs. On August 26, 2016, the EPA proposed changes needed to bring EPA’s air permitting regulations in line with the Supreme Court’s decision on GHG permitting. The proposed rule was published in the Federal Register on October 3, 2016 and the public comment period closed on December 2, 2016.
 In addition, the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases primarily through the planned development of greenhouse gas emission inventories and/or regional greenhouse gas cap and trade programs. Although the U.S. Congress has not adopted such legislation at this time, it may do so in the future and many states continue to pursue regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

In December 2015, the United States participated in the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France. The resulting Paris Agreement calls for the parties to undertake “ambitious efforts” to limit the average global temperature, and to conserve and enhance sinks and reservoirs of GHGs. The Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. The Agreement establishes a framework for the parties to cooperate and report actions to reduce GHG emissions. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, and begin negotiations to either re-enter or negotiate an entirely new agreement with more favorable terms for the United States. The Paris Agreement sets forth a specific exit process, whereby a party may not provide notice of its withdrawal until three years from the effective date, with such withdrawal taking effect one year from such notice. It is not clear what steps the Trump Administration plans to take to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, whether a new agreement can be negotiated, or what terms would be included in such an agreement. Furthermore, in response to the announcement, many state and local leaders have stated their intent to intensify efforts to uphold the commitments set forth in the international accord.
 Restrictions on emissions of methane or carbon dioxide that may be imposed could adversely impact the demand for, price of and value of our products and reserves. As our operations also emit greenhouse gases directly, current and future laws or regulations limiting such emissions could increase our own costs. Currently, our operations are not adversely impacted by existing federal, state and local climate change initiatives and, at this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how potential future laws or regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business.
 National Environmental Policy Act 
 Oil and natural gas exploration, development and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of the Interior, to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment. The process involves the preparation of either an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement depending on whether the specific circumstances surrounding the proposed federal action will have a significant impact on the human environment. The NEPA process involves public input through comments which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects, increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities and could result in certain instances in the cancellation of existing leases.
 Threatened and endangered species, migratory birds and natural resources
 Various federal and state statutes prohibit certain actions that adversely affect endangered or threatened species and their habitat, migratory birds, wetlands, and natural resources. These statutes include the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the Clean Water Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service may designate critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species. On February 11, 2016, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a final policy which alters how it identifies critical habitat for endangered and threatened species. A critical habitat designation could result in further material restrictions on federal land use or on private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or development. Where takings of or harm to species or damages to wetlands, habitat, or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or at times private parties may act to prevent or restrict oil and natural gas exploration activities or seek damages for any injury, whether resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and in some cases, criminal penalties may result. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species or that may attract migratory birds we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and we are not aware of any proposed ESA listings that will materially affect our operations. The federal government in the past has issued indictments under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act to several oil and natural gas companies after dead migratory birds were found near reserve pits associated with drilling activities. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our development activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce our oil and natural gas reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases. 
 Hazard communications and community right to know
 We are subject to federal and state hazard communication and community right to know statutes and regulations. These regulations, including, but not limited to, the federal Emergency Planning & Community Right-to-Know Act, govern record keeping and reporting of the use and release of hazardous substances and may require that information be provided to state and local government authorities, as well as the public.
 18


Occupational Safety and Health Act
 We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, OSHA hazard communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. 
State Regulation
 Texas regulates the drilling for, and the production, gathering and sale of, oil and natural gas, including imposing severance taxes and requirements for obtaining drilling permits. Texas currently imposes a 4.6% severance tax on oil production and a 7.5% severance tax on natural gas production. States also regulate the method of developing new fields, the spacing and operation of wells and the prevention of waste of oil and natural gas resources. States may regulate rates of production and may establish maximum daily production allowables from oil and natural gas wells based on market demand or resource conservation, or both. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct economic regulation, but we cannot assure our stockholders that they will not do so in the future. The effect of these regulations may be to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells and to limit the number of wells or locations we can drill.
 The petroleum industry is also subject to compliance with various other federal, state and local regulations and laws. Some of those laws relate to resource conservation and equal employment opportunity. We do not believe that compliance with these laws will have a material adverse effect on us.
 Related Insurance
 We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration, development and production activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site, and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
 Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2017, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2018.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 58 full-time employees, of which nine are management, 19 are technical personnel, 16 are administrative personnel and 14 are field operations employees. Our employees are not covered under a collective bargaining agreement nor are any employees represented by a union. We consider all relations with our employees to be satisfactory.
