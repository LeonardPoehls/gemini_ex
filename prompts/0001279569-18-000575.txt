Item 1. Business
Overview
 
The Company has a 50% interest in a gold and silver mine and was incorporated in 1985 under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada. The Soledad Mountain Mine (the “Mine”) is located south of Mojave in Kern County in southern California.
 
The Company acquired its initial interest in the Mine in 1985 and has since added to its landholdings and interests in the area. Exploration and evaluation work on the Mine was done by Golden Queen Mining Company, LLC (“GQM LLC”), formerly Golden Queen Mining Co., Inc. (“GQM Inc.”) a California corporation that was wholly-owned by the Company until September 2014.
 
Golden Queen accounts for GQM LLC on its books as a variable interest entity (“VIE”), with Golden Queen considered to be the primary beneficiary.  A VIE is an entity in which the investor, Golden Queen, holds a controlling interest, or in this case, is a primary beneficiary, that is not based on the majority of the voting rights. As a result, Golden Queen continues to reflect 100% of the financial results of GQM LLC in its consolidated financial statements, along with a non-controlling interest representing the 50% interest in GQM LLC held by Gauss LLC.
 
The registered office of the Company is located at 1200 - 750 West Pender Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada V6C 2T8 and its executive offices are located at 2300 – 1066 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, BC, Canada, V6E 3X2. The California office of GQM LLC is located at 2818 Silver Queen Road, Mojave, California, 93501.

On February 20, 2018, the Company closed a rights offering for gross proceeds of approximately $25,000, of which, $10,000 was contributed into GQM LLC. In addition, Gauss LLC, the Company’s joint venture partner, also contributed $10,000 into GQM LLC. The funding contributed into GQM LLC will be available to settle accounts payable, equipment finance obligations and the credit facility relating to the Soledad Mountain mine in the normal course of business. The rights offering was backstopped by the Clay Group, which provided certainty of the amount raised, and allowed for shareholder participation. On February 22, 2018, we closed the rights offering which expired on February 20, 2018. The Company issued the full allotment of 188,952,761 common shares pursuant to the rights offering for gross proceeds of approximately US$25 million.
 
Additionally, the Company initiated negotiations with the Clay Group to restructure the loan repayment schedule and the interest rate on the November 2017 Clay loan.

Competitive Conditions
 
The Company and GQM LLC compete with other mining companies in the recruitment and retention of qualified managerial and technical employees, for supplies and equipment, as well as for capital. As a result of this competition in the mining industry, some of which is with large established mining companies holding substantial capabilities and with greater financial and technical resources than ours, we may be unable to effectively develop and operate the Mine or obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable.
Government and Environmental Regulation
 
Our current and planned operations are subject to state and federal environmental laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations provide strict standards for compliance, and potentially significant fines and penalties for non-compliance. These laws address emissions, waste discharge requirements, management of hazardous substances, protection of endangered species and reclamation of lands disturbed by mining. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires significant time and expense, and future changes to these laws and regulations may cause material changes or delays in the development of our Mine or our future activities on site.
 
See Environmental Issues, Permits & Approvals below for a detailed description of the effects of federal, state and local environmental regulations and permitting on the Company, GQM LLC and the Mine, as well as Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the related risks.
 
Gold and Silver Price History
 
The price of gold and silver are volatile and are affected by numerous factors, all of which are beyond our control, such as the sale or purchase of gold and silver by various central banks and financial institutions, inflation, recession, fluctuation in the relative values of the US dollar and foreign currencies, changes in global gold and silver demand and political and economic conditions.
