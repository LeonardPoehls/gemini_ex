Our Company 
 We help make complex business payments simple, smart and secure. Corporations and banks rely on us for state of the art domestic and international payments, efficient cash management, payment processing, bill review, and fraud detection, behavioral analytics and regulatory compliance solutions. The majority of our revenues are derived from offerings sold as SaaS-based solutions and paid for on a subscription and transaction basis. 
 We operate cloud-based settlement networks that facilitate electronic payments and transaction settlement between businesses, their vendors and banks. We offer cloud and on-premise solutions that banks use to provide payment, cash management and treasury capabilities to their business customers, as well as solutions that financial institutions use to facilitate customer acquisition. Our cloud-based legal spend management solutions help manage and determine the right amount to pay for legal services and claims vendor expenditures for insurance companies and other large consumers of outside legal services. Corporate customers rely on our solutions to automate payment and accounts payable processes and to streamline and manage the production and retention of electronic documents. Our healthcare customers use our solutions to streamline financial processes, particularly the patient enrollment process. We also offer cyber fraud and risk management solutions that are designed to non-invasively monitor and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag behavioral and data anomalies and other suspicious activity. 
 Our solutions are designed to complement, leverage and extend our customers existing information systems, accounting applications and banking relationships so that they can be deployed quickly and efficiently. To help our customers realize the maximum value from our products and meet their specific business requirements, we also provide professional services for installation, training, consulting and product enhancement.

 Our cyber fraud and risk management solutions (CFRM) non-invasively monitor, replay and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag and even stop suspicious activity in real time. These solutions are highly configurable and create accountability by recording and analyzing each application interaction and screen view, reducing the risk of theft, information leakage, internal fraud and payments fraud, as well as decreasing the cost of regulatory compliance.

 Our Competition 
 The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We believe our ability to compete depends on factors within and beyond our control, including: 
 

 | our ability to develop new, innovative and feature-rich technology solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and the shifting dynamics of the markets we participate in;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite domain knowledge and technical skill set necessary to develop and support our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the performance, reliability, features, ease-of-use and price of our offerings as compared to competitor alternatives;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | our industry knowledge and expertise;
--+--------------------------------------


 | the execution of our sales and services organizations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | the timing and market acceptance of new products as well as enhancements to existing products, by us and by our current and future competitors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 For our settlement network solutions, our principal competitors include AvidXchange, US Bank Payments Plus, CSI Enterprises, C2FO, Bill.com, MineralTree, Inc. and combined card and ACH Solutions from JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, Finastra, Eastnets and SWIFT. 
 For our banking solutions and cash management solutions, we primarily compete with companies such as ACI Worldwide, Fiserv, FIS, Q2, Jack Henry, Backbase, NCR, MeridianLink and Polaris, which offer a wide range of financial services, including electronic banking applications. We also encounter competition in our banking solution customer acquisition offerings from MeridianLink and Finastra.

 For our legal spend management solutions, we compete with a number of companies, including Wolters Kluwer ELM Solutions, LexisNexis, Mitratech, Quovant and DXC Legal Solutions. 
 For our cyber fraud and risk management products, we primarily compete with NICE Actimize, Norkom, SAS, Guardian Analytics and FairWarning. 
 For our healthcare solutions, our primary competitors are Access, FairWarning, FormFast, Iatric Systems, Protenus and Taylor Communications. 
 Our payment and document automation products compete primarily with companies that provide solutions to create, publish, manage and archive electronic documents and companies that offer payments software and services. We also compete with providers of enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions and providers of traditional payment products. 
 Although we believe that we compete favorably in each of the markets in which we participate, the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and a number of factors could adversely affect our ability to compete in the future, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors. 
 Our Segments 
 Operating segments are the components of our business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. Our operating segments are generally organized by the type of product or service offered and by geography. 
 Similar operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable segments as follows: 
 Cloud Solutions. Our Cloud Solutions segment provides customers predominately with SaaS technology offerings that facilitate electronic payment, electronic invoicing, and spend management. Our legal spend management solutions, which enable customers to create more efficient processes for managing invoices generated by outside law firms while offering insight into important legal spend factors such as expense monitoring and outside counsel performance, are included within this segment. This segment also incorporates our settlement network solutions (financial messaging and Paymode-X). Our settlement network solutions are highly scalable, secure and cost effective and facilitate cash payment and transaction settlement between businesses, their vendors and banks. Revenue within this segment is generally recognized on a subscription or transaction basis or ratably over the estimated life of the customer relationship. 
 Banking Solutions. Our Banking Solutions segment provides solutions that are specifically designed for banking and financial institution customers. Our Banking Solutions products are now sold predominantly on a subscription basis, which has the effect of contributing to recurring subscription and transaction revenue and the revenue predictability of future periods, but which also delays revenue recognition over a longer period. 
 Payments and Transactional Documents. Our Payments and Transactional Documents segment supplies financial business process management software solutions, including making and collecting payments, sending and receiving invoices, and generating and storing business documents. This segment also provides a range of standard professional services and equipment and supplies that complement and enhance our core software products. Revenue associated with these products and services is typically recorded upon delivery. However, if we license products on a subscription basis, revenue is typically recorded ratably over the subscription period or the expected life of the customer relationship. 
 Other. Our Other segment consists of our healthcare and cyber fraud and risk management operating segments. In our cyber fraud and risk management operating segment, our privacy and data security solution non-invasively monitors, replays and analyzes user behavior to flag and even stop suspicious activity in real time. Our healthcare solutions for patient registration, electronic signature, mobile document and payments allow healthcare organizations to improve business efficiencies, reduce costs and improve care quality. When licensed on a perpetual license basis, software revenue for our cyber fraud and risk management and healthcare 
 
7 


  products is typically recorded upon delivery, with software maintenance revenue recorded ratably over a twelve-month period. When licensed on a subscription basis, revenue is normally recorded ratably over the subscription period. 
 Please refer to
 Note 15. Operations by Segments and Geographic Areas to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report in Form 10-K for further details regarding our operating segment results. 
 Financial Information About Geographic Areas 
 A significant percentage of our revenues are generated by our international operations and our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on continued growth and success in international markets. As is the case with most international operations, the success and profitability of these operations is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including exchange rate fluctuations. We do not currently hedge against exchange rate fluctuations. A number of other factors could also have a negative effect on our business and results from operations outside the U.S., including different regulatory and industry standards and certification requirements, reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries, import or export licensing requirements, the complexities of foreign tax jurisdictions and difficulties and costs of staffing and managing our foreign operations. 
 Please refer to
 Note 15. Operations by Segments and Geographic Areas to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report in Form 10-K for further details regarding our financial information about geographic areas. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 As of June 30, 2018, we employed 342 sales and marketing employees worldwide, of whom 196 were focused on North American markets, 115 were focused on the United Kingdom and continental Europe markets and 31 were focused on Asia-Pacific and Middle East markets. We market and sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through a variety of channel partners and reseller relationships. We market and sell our products domestically and internationally, with an international focus on the United Kingdom and continental Europe. We also maintain an inside sales group which provides a cost effective channel into maintaining existing customers and expanding our customer base. 
Product Development and Engineering 
 Our product development and engineering organization includes employees as well as strategic development partners who provide a flexible supplement to our internal resources. We have three primary development groups: product design and user experience, software engineering and quality assurance. We expensed $57.3 million, $53.0 million and $47.4 million in product development and engineering costs in fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In fiscal year 2019 we expect product development and engineering costs to increase as we continue to enhance our products and develop new, innovative, feature-rich solutions. 
 Our product design and user experience team is extensively involved in the design of all of our products, driving the user-centered design process to ensure elegant, engaging and easy-to-use products. Part of this process is user experience testing that is conducted to provide additional productivity gains for the end user. 
 Our software engineers have substantial experience in advanced software development techniques as well as extensive knowledge of the complex processes involved in business document workflow, cash management, payment and invoicing applications. They maintain extensive knowledge of software development trends and best practices. Our technology focuses on providing business solutions utilizing industry standards, providing a path for extendibility and scalability of our products. Security, control and fraud prevention, as well as performance, data management and resource efficiencies are priorities in the technology we develop and deploy. 
 Our quality assurance engineers have extensive knowledge of our products and expertise in software quality assurance techniques. The quality assurance team participates in all phases of our product development 
 
8 


  processes. Members of the quality assurance group make use of both manual and automated software testing techniques to ensure high-quality software is being delivered to our customers. The quality assurance group members participate in alpha and beta releases, testing of new product releases and performance and security testing for our products. 
 Proprietary Rights 
 We use a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to help establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products. During fiscal year 2018, we added 2 patents to our portfolio. In total, we currently hold 33 U.S. patents as well as 9 foreign equivalent patents in Europe, Israel and India. We expect to receive other patents, as we have 8 applications pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The earliest year of expiration of any of our remaining patents is 2019. 
 We intend to continue to file patent applications as we identify patentable technology. There can be no assurance, however, that our existing patent applications, or any others that we may file in the future, will issue or will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection of our technology or any commercial advantage to us, or that the issued patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to help protect our proprietary rights. Given the rapidly changing nature of the industrys technology, the creative abilities of our development, marketing and service personnel may be as or more important to our competitive position as are the legal protections and rights afforded by patents. We also enter into agreements with our employees and clients that seek to limit and protect our intellectual property and the distribution of proprietary information. However, there can be no assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information, and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our proprietary rights. 
Government Regulation 
 Our U.S. chartered financial institution customers are federally regulated by either the Federal Reserve (FED), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Our non U.S. based financial institution customers are normally subject to a similar regulatory oversight within their respective country of domicile. We are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) interagency in our capacity as a technical financial service provider, during which our operating practices are risk-assessed and compared against applicable laws and regulations. If we, as part of such an examination, were to receive a material unfavorable regulatory rating, our customers may be advised by their direct federal regulators to reassess their commercial relationships with us, including the continued use of our products. 
 Each of our operating segments provides services and/or products that may be subject to various federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, particularly in the area of data security and privacy. These laws and regulations govern the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information as well as notification requirements in the event of security breaches. The legal and regulatory framework in these areas is complex and continually evolving, particularly with respect to data security, payment technology and payment methodologies. We may become subject to new or increased regulation in the future, and the cost of complying with current or future regulatory requirements could exceed our estimates. Our products and services must be designed to work effectively within this legal framework. 
 Employees 
 As of June 30, 2018, we had approximately 1,700 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe that employee relationships are good. Our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-qualified technical and managerial personnel in a highly competitive market.
