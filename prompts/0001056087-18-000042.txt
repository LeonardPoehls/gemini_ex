 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 The McClatchy Company (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) operates 30 media companies in 14 states, providing each of its communities with high-quality news and advertising services in a wide array of digital and print formats. We are a publisher of well-respected brands such as the Miami Herald, The Kansas City Star, The Sacramento Bee, The Charlotte Observer, The (Raleigh) News & Observer, and the (Fort Worth) Star-Telegram. Incorporated in Delaware, we are headquartered in Sacramento, California, and our Class A Common Stock is listed on the NYSE American under the symbol MNI.
 Our businesses are comprised of websites and mobile applications, mobile news and advertising, video products, a digital marketing agency, daily newspapers, niche publications, other print and digital direct marketing services and community newspapers. Our media companies range from large daily newspapers and news websites serving metropolitan areas to non‑daily newspapers with news websites and online platforms serving small communities. We had 71.2 million average monthly unique visitors to our online platforms and 3.9 billion page views of our digital products for the full year ended December 31, 2017. Our local websites, e-editions of the printed newspaper and mobile applications in each of our markets now provide us fully developed but rapidly evolving channels to extend our journalism and advertising products to our audience in each market. In 2017, we continued to expand our full-service digital agency, excelerateTM, which provides digital marketing tools designed to customize digital marketing plans for our customers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had an average aggregate paid daily print circulation of 1.3 million and Sunday print circulation of 1.9 million.
 Our business is roughly divided between those media companies operated west of the Mississippi River and those that are east of it, but includes four operating regions: the West, Midwest, Carolinas and East regions. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no single media company represented more than 12.0% of our total revenues.
 On July 31, 2017, we sold a majority of our interest in CareerBuilder LLC (“CareerBuilder”), which reduced our ownership interest in CareerBuilder from 15.0% to approximately 3.0%. 
 Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December. Fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, consisted of a 53-week period. Fiscal years ended December 25, 2016, and December 26, 2015, consisted of 52‑week periods.
 Strategy
 Our mission is to deliver high-quality journalism and information. To accomplish this goal, we are committed to a three‑pronged strategy to grow our businesses and total revenues as a leading local media company:
· | First, to maintain our position as the leading local media company in each of our markets by providing high-quality journalism and advertising information essential to our communities throughout the day on digital platforms and in our printed newspapers; and to grow these audiences for the benefit of our

advertisers;
------------


· | Second, to grow digital revenues as we transition to a digitally focused, digitally driven media company. This strategy includes being a leader of local digital businesses in each of our markets, including websites, e-editions of the printed newspaper, mobile applications, e‑mail products, mobile services, video products and other electronic media; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Third, to extend these franchises by supplementing the reach of the printed newspaper and digital businesses with direct marketing, niche publications and events and direct mail products so advertisers can capture both mass and targeted audiences with one‑stop shopping.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  To assist us with these strategies, we continually improve existing digital products and develop new ones, reengineer our operations to reduce legacy costs and strengthen areas driving performance in news, audience, advertising and digital growth. As a result of our efforts, we saw growth in total digital-only revenues in 2017, and we continued our focus on driving results in direct marketing and audience revenues, while continuing to drive operating expenses down.
 Business Initiatives
 Our local media companies continue to undergo tremendous structural and cyclical change. In order to strengthen our position as a leading local media company and implement our strategies, we are focused on the following five major business initiatives: Increasing and Broadening Total Revenues
 Revenue initiatives in 2017 included aligning us for digital growth by revamping and centralizing certain departments and focusing on digital marketing; digital subscription growth through new audiences and subscribers; organizing our technology groups to help us better serve our customers; growing our video market share and developing innovation teams that help us implement additional customer-focused approaches to running our businesses. In 2017, we expanded our full-service digital agency, excelerateTM, which provides customized digital marketing plans for our customers. We also continued to expand our video efforts to improve storytelling and generate additional advertising revenues.
 Revenues exclusive of print newspaper advertising continue to grow as a percentage of total revenues and represented 75.2%, 70.6% and 66.7% of total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our strategy has been to focus on growing revenue sources that include digital and direct marketing advertising, audience and other non-traditional revenues. Management expects newspaper print advertising to continue to be a smaller share of total revenues in the future, due in part to expected strong growth in digital-only advertising revenues and certain areas of direct marketing advertising, and more stable performance in audience revenues. However, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our advertiser base, including advertisers outside of our markets using our excelerateTM agency services.
 Currently, advertising revenues comprise a majority of our total revenues, making the quality of our sales force and sales tools critically important to this revenue source. Advertising revenues were approximately 55.2% of total revenues in 2017, 58.2% in 2016 and 60.3% in 2015. In 2017, we had a local sales force in each of our markets, which we believe was the largest local sales force as compared to other local media companies and websites in those markets. Our sales force is responsible for delivering to advertisers a broad array of advertising products, including print, direct marketing and digital marketing solutions. Our advertisers range from large national retail chains to regional automobile dealerships and grocers to small local businesses and even individuals.
 Increasingly, our emphasis has been on growing the breadth of products offered to advertisers, particularly our digital and direct marketing products, while expanding our relationships with current advertisers and growing new accounts. For 2017, total digital and direct marketing advertising revenues combined represented 55.1% of total advertising revenues compared to 49.5% and 44.9% in 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our digital products are discussed in more detail below.
 In 2017, we continued to sponsor special events in our markets, designed for advertisers to connect with their customers, and we expect this type of advertising to grow in 2018. 
 Audience revenues were approximately 40.2%, 37.3% and 34.8% of consolidated total revenues in 2017, 2016 and 2015,

respectively. Our subscription packages have helped diversify our revenues while continuing to drive growth in digital audience revenues. 
 Expanding Our Digital Business
 We continue to be a leader in digital advertising revenues generated in part on our media companies’ websites and mobile platforms as a percent of total advertising. In 2017, 34.7% of advertising revenues came from digital products compared to 30.6% in 2016. In 2017, 77.2% of our digital advertising revenues came from digital-only advertisements where the online buy was not bundled with a print buy, compared to 69.9% in 2016. Digital-only advertising revenues grew 9.8%, to $133.7 million in 2017 from $121.7 million in 2016. We believe this independent advertising revenue stream positions us well for the future of our digital business. During 2017, total digital advertising revenues decreased 0.6% compared to an increase of 4.3% in 2016, reflecting the negative impact of lower print advertising revenues on bundled sales.  
 Our media companies’ websites and mobile applications, e‑mail products, video and mobile services and other electronic media enable us to engage our readers with real‑time news and information that matters to them. As discussed below in Maintaining Our Commitment to Public Service Journalism, our storytelling capability is not only contributing to our growth in digital subscribers, but also to our digital advertising revenue growth. During 2017, our websites attracted an average of approximately 71.2 million unique visitors per month, up 18.3%, compared to 2016. Increasing our number of unique visitors brings additional digital advertising revenue opportunities to our sales teams. We had 3.9 billion page views of our digital products for the full year of 2017, up 9.0% from 2016. In addition, our average mobile traffic was up 45.3% as compared to 2016, and accounted for 61.3% of all digital traffic we received on a monthly basis.
 In 2016, we, along with Gannett Co., Inc., Hearst, and tronc, Inc., launched Nucleus Marketing Solutions, LLC (“Nucleus”). This marketing solutions provider connects national advertisers with the top 30 U.S. local publishers’ highly engaged audiences across existing and emerging digital platforms. We expect Nucleus to improve our reach with national advertisers in 2018 and beyond.
 We continue to pursue additional new digital products and offerings. In 2017, we continued to expand our concept of comprehensive digital marketing solutions for local businesses via our digital marketing agency called excelerateTM. We also expanded the footprint of excelerateTM to markets beyond those served by our media companies. By offering advertisers integrated packages including website customization, search engine marketing and optimization, social media presence and marketing services, and other multi‑platform advertising opportunities, excelerateTM helps businesses improve the effectiveness of their marketing efforts.
 In 2017, we continued to expand our advertising efforts on advertising exchanges. Our real-time, programmatic buying and selling of digital advertising inventory – often targeting very specific audiences at very specific times – grew 32.3% in 2017 compared to 2016. Our growth continues to be strengthened by our participation in the Local Media Consortium (“LMC”) and its more than 75 member companies representing more than 1,700 daily newspapers and broadcast members. The LMC created a private advertising exchange that includes high-quality, brand friendly advertising inventory from member publishers. The LMC’s goal is to provide advertisers with efficient access to high-quality advertising impressions. In total, LMC members serve more than 13 billion impressions monthly. 
 Video revenue increased 57.0% in 2017 compared to 2016, due to our focus on the use of video in our digital products to both enhance the content that we bring to readers and viewers and also to compete for a growing advertising stream. During 2017, more than 366 million video views were recorded across all of our digital platforms, including those on social media platforms and distribution partners, up from 225 million video views in 2016.
 All of our markets offer audience subscription packages for digital content. The packages include a combined digital and print subscription and a digital‑only subscription. Digital‑only subscriptions grew to approximately 102,900, an increase of 23.8% in 2017 compared to 83,100 subscriptions in 2016.
 Maintaining Our Commitment to Public Service Journalism    We believe that independent journalism in the public interest is critical to our democracy. It is also the underpinning of our success as a business.

 We are committed to producing best‑in‑class journalism and local content in every community we serve. Each of our newsrooms is expected to improve annually, whether measured by growth in readership, loyalty of readers, our own assessments of journalistic strengths or recognition by peers and others. And each of our newsrooms is expected to serve our core public service mission – holding leaders and institutions accountable and making our communities better places in which to live.
 During the digital transition that has reshaped the industry over the past decade, we have moved quickly to expand our digital reach and deliver news to readers when they want it and where they want it. Through an initiative called “Newsroom Reinvention,” we have placed an intense focus on what our readers want and need from us in a fast-changing news landscape. We continue to produce ground-breaking accountability journalism – from The Kansas City Star’s expose on secrecy in state government to the Miami Herald’s in-depth report on abuses in the juvenile justice system in Florida to numerous reports that have held politicians accountable for misbehavior in office. Meanwhile, we have intensified our efforts on breaking news and real-time news, and we have restructured our Washington, D.C., bureau to work more closely with our local newsrooms while also becoming a significant force on the national stage.  
 Our heritage of public service journalism is the cornerstone of our business, and the work of our journalists received significant recognition in 2017. Journalists from our Washington bureau and the Miami Herald teamed up with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists to win the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for explanatory reporting. A journalist at the Miami Herald won the 2017 Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning. With these honors we extend our Pulitzer Prize wins to 54 and our impressive streak of being a Pulitzer winner or finalist every year for more than a decade.
     Our video journalists continued to produce ambitious stories around breaking news, projects and series that have gained industry recognition. Titletown, TX, the collaborative effort between our Video Lab and the Star-Telegram on a high school football powerhouse in Texas, won three Emmys and is the only show produced by a local media company that is part of Facebook's new 'Watch' platform. The Video Lab also contributed to our Pulitzer Prize in explanatory reporting through an animation that illustrated the complex world of offshore corporations.
     These are just a few of the hundreds of examples of our powerful journalism published across the company. We intend to build on our legacy in the years ahead, propelled by the success of our ongoing digital transformation. For instance, our replica edition of each of our daily newspapers, found on our websites and mobile applications, includes stories from our 30 newsrooms and other journalistic organizations that on many days more than doubles the news that could be found in the daily newspaper delivered to subscribers’ doorsteps. This additional content, known as “Extra Extra” and “SportsXtra,” has been well received by readers of our digital products.
     Broadening Our Audience in Our Local Markets
 Each of our media companies has the largest print circulation of any news media source serving its respective community, and coupled with its local website and other digital platforms in each community, reaches a broad audience in each market. We believe that our broad reach in each market is of primary importance in attracting advertising, which is currently our largest source of revenues. 
 Our digital audience continues to grow, which is partially driven by traffic on our websites and other digital platforms. During 2017, average monthly unique visitors to our digital sites grew 18.3% as a result of continued focus and initiatives to improve our total revenues. As discussed above, we realigned and improved delivery of our content on all platforms, from websites to mobile applications in nearly every market. Due to our investment in technology and behind the scenes improvements, our websites, including the news content and advertising, are responsive or formatted to fit the screen of whatever device the content is viewed on for a seamless reading or viewing experience. 
 As noted earlier, in 2017 our monthly mobile traffic was up 45.3% as compared to 2016 and accounted for 61.3% of all monthly digital traffic we received. We work hard to appeal to our mobile audience. We have invested in new digital publishing systems to better serve these mobile readers, and we have rebuilt all of our news websites to be responsive – that is, to automatically resize to best fit a user’s screen, be it a smartphone or a tablet or desktop computer, and provide the optimal viewing experience. 
 Our news and information follows readers throughout their day. To start their day, we reach our readers who can check out our latest headlines and stories on their mobile phones or with the morning newspaper. Our news websites, updated frequently throughout the day, are available to readers via their desktop computers and optimized for all of their different 

 
  5

 
mobile devices.
 Daily newspapers paid circulation volumes for 2017 were down 12.4% compared to 2016. The declines in daily circulation reflect the fragmentation of audiences faced by all media, including our own digital‑only subscriptions, as available media outlets proliferate and readership trends change. Our Sunday circulation volumes were down 12.1% in 2017 compared to 2016.
 We also reach audiences through our direct marketing products. In 2017, we distributed approximately 641,000 Sunday Select packages per week, which are packages of preprinted advertisements generally delivered on Sunday to non‑newspaper subscribers who have interest in circulars. We also distribute thousands of e-mail messages each day, including editorial and advertising content, as well as other alerts to subscribers and non‑subscribers in our markets which supplement the reach of our print and digital subscriptions. 
 To remain the leading local media company for the communities we serve and a must‑buy for advertisers, we are focused on maintaining a broad reach of print and digital audiences in each of our markets. We will continue to refine and strengthen our print platform, but our growth increasingly comes from our digital products and the beneficial impact those products have on the total audience we deliver for our advertisers.
 Focusing on Cost Efficiencies While Investing for the Future
 While continuing to maintain our core business in news, advertising sales and digital media, we are also focused on cost efficiencies. Our cost initiatives in 2017 were focused on continuing to reduce legacy costs from our traditional print business, and we have realized significant savings from these efforts, primarily in production and distribution, including substantial savings in newsprint costs. In addition, in 2017, we made additional reductions in costs to help protect our profitability in a period of declining print advertising. Total expenses, excluding depreciation, amortization and non-cash impairment charges, declined $82.9 million in 2017 compared to 2016. This decline was net of investments made in 2017 intended to generate future savings or that were necessary to invest in revenue generating strategies. The ongoing structural and cyclical changes in our markets demand that we respond by reengineering our operations, as needed, to achieve an efficient and sustainable cost structure. Over the past several years, we have substantially lowered our cost structure through reducing our workforce, optimizing technology and maximizing printing, distribution and content efficiencies, all while maintaining operating profitability at each of our media companies.
 In 2017, in order to ensure a more collaborative enterprise, we began the process of regionalizing certain areas of our operations, including publisher and editorial leadership, and we completed reorganizing our technology, marketing, innovation and other certain finance functions. We will continue to outsource, regionalize and consolidate operations to achieve a more streamlined and efficient cost structure. These changes will result in cost savings in future years, while giving our operating executives, regionally and in each market, the ability to focus more of their time on our growing digital and direct marketing media businesses.
 As of the end of 2017, we have outsourced printing operations at 20 of our 30 media companies, which are printed through arrangements with nearby newspapers owned by us or third-party companies. In markets where we own printing presses we in‑source the printing of nearby newspapers for other companies. This allows us to maximize the use of our existing press capacity and generate additional revenues. Five markets (Charlotte, Columbia, Kansas City, Miami and Sacramento) have become hubs for in-sourcing printing in their areas.
 Other Operational Information
 Historically, each of our media companies was largely autonomous in their local advertising and editorial operations in order to meet the needs of the particular community it served. However, as discussed above, we continue to regionalize or centralize certain operations across our local markets to strengthen the local media company's ability to increase its performance in news, audience, advertising and digital growth.
 We have two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. Each operating segment consists primarily of a group of local media companies with similar economic characteristics, products, customers and distribution methods. Both operating segments report to one segment manager. One of our operating segments (“Western Segment”) consists of our media operations in the West and Midwest, while the other operating segment (“Eastern Segment”) consists primarily of media operations in the Carolinas and East. Regional or local publishers of the media companies make day‑to‑day decisions and report to the segment manager, who is responsible for implementing the operating and financial plans at each operation within the respective operating segment. The corporate managers, including executive officers, set the basic business, accounting, financial and reporting policies.

 As noted previously, our media companies also work together to consolidate functions and share resources regionally and across operating segments that lend themselves to such efficiencies, such as certain regional or national sales efforts, certain editorial functions, accounting functions, digital publishing systems and products, information technology functions and others. These efforts are often coordinated through the vice president of operations and corporate personnel.
 Our business is somewhat seasonal, with peak revenues and profits generally occurring in the fourth quarter of each year, reflecting the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. The other quarters, when holidays are not as prevalent, are historically the slower quarters for revenues and operating profits.

      Other Operations
 On July 31, 2017, we sold a majority of our interest in CareerBuilder LLC (“CareerBuilder”), which reduced our ownership interest from 15.0% to approximately 3.0%. Our ownership interests and investments in unconsolidated companies and joint ventures including but not limited to CareerBuilder, provided us with $73.9 million of cash distributions in 2017, which includes $7.3 million in normal distributions and $66.6 million of gross proceeds from the sales of assets.

 We own 49.5% of the voting stock and 70.6% of the nonvoting stock of The Seattle Times Company. The Seattle Times Company owns The Seattle Times newspaper, weekly newspapers in the Puget Sound area and daily newspapers located in Walla Walla and Yakima, Washington, and all of their related websites and mobile applications.
 In addition, three of our wholly-owned subsidiaries own a combined 27.0% interest in Ponderay Newsprint Company (“Ponderay”), a general partnership that owns and operates a newsprint mill in the state of Washington. 
 We also own a 25.0% interest in Nucleus Marketing Solutions, LLC (“Nucleus”) a marketing solutions provider as described above.
 Raw Materials 
 During 2017, we consumed approximately 67,000 metric tons of newsprint for all of our operations compared to 84,000 metric tons in 2016. The decrease in tons consumed was primarily due to changes in our print products at numerous media companies, as well as lower print advertising sales and print circulation volumes. We estimate that we will use approximately 54,000 metric tons of newsprint in 2018, depending on the level of print advertising, circulation volumes and other business considerations. 
 During 2017, our consumed newsprint was purchased through a third-party intermediary, of which approximately 17,000 metric tons of those purchases were newsprint from Ponderay.
 Our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, newsprint expense accounted for 4.4%, 4.9% and 5.7%, respectively, of total operating expenses, excluding impairments and other asset write-downs. 
 Competition
 Our newspapers, direct marketing programs, websites and mobile content compete for advertising revenues and readers’ time with television, radio, other media websites, social network sites and mobile applications, direct mail companies, free shoppers, suburban neighborhood and national newspapers and other publications, and billboard companies, among others. In some of our markets, our newspapers also compete with other newspapers published in nearby cities and towns. Competition for advertising is generally based upon digital and print readership levels and demographics, advertising rates, internet usage and advertiser results, while competition for circulation and readership (digital and print) is generally based upon the content, journalistic quality, service, competing news sources and the price of the newspaper or digital service.
 Our media companies’ internet sites are generally a leading local website in each of our major daily markets. We have continued to shift advertising to digital advertising to stay current with reader trends. Our media companies are also the largest print circulation of any news media source in each of their respective markets. However, our media companies have experienced difficulty maintaining print circulation levels because of a number of factors. These include increased competition from other publications and other forms of media technologies, including the internet and other new media formats that are often free for users; and a proliferation of news outlets that fragments audiences. We face greater competition, particularly in the areas of employment, automotive and real estate advertising, from online competitors. 
 To address the structural shift to digital media, we reengineered our operations to strengthen areas driving performance in news, audience, advertising and digital growth. Our newsrooms also provide editorial content on a wide variety of platforms and formats from our daily newspaper to leading local websites; on social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter; on smartphones and on e‑readers; on websites and blogs; in niche online publications and in e‑mail newsletters; and mobile applications. Upgrades are continually made to our mobile applications and websites.
 Employees — Labor 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 4,200 full and part‑time employees (equating to approximately 3,900 full‑time equivalent employees), of whom approximately 5.7% were represented by unions. Most of our union‑represented employees are currently working under labor agreements with expiration dates through 2020. We have unions at 5 of our 30 media companies.
 While our media companies have not had a strike for decades, and we do not currently anticipate a strike occurring, we cannot preclude the possibility that a strike may occur at one or more of our media companies when future negotiations take place. We believe that in the event of a strike we would be able to continue to publish and deliver to subscribers, a 

 
  8

 
capability that is critical to retaining revenues from advertising and audience, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to publish in the event of a strike.
 Compliance with Environmental Laws
 We use appropriate waste disposal techniques for hazardous materials. As of December 31, 2017, we have $1.0 million in a letter of credit shared among various state environmental agencies and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide collateral related to existing or previously removed storage tanks. However, we do not believe that we currently have any significant environmental issues and in 2017, 2016 and 2015 had no significant expenses or capital expenditures related to environmental control facilities.
