Recent Developments
 
On March 12, 2018, we implemented a 1-for-15 reverse stock split of our common stock (the “Reverse Stock Split”). The Reverse Stock Split became effective in the stock market upon commencement of trading on March 13, 2018. As a result of the Reverse Stock Split, every fifteen shares of our Pre-Reverse Stock Split common stock were combined and reclassified into one share of our common stock. No fractional shares were issued in connection with the Reverse Stock Split, and any fractional shares were rounded up to the nearest whole share. The number of shares of common stock subject to outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities were also reduced by a factor of fifteen as of March 13, 2018. All historical share and per share amounts reflected throughout this report have been adjusted to reflect the Reverse Stock Split. The authorized number of shares and the par value per share of our common stock were not affected by the Reverse Stock Split.
History and Background
 
On February 9 2012, we completed a reverse-triangular merger with GrowOp Technology whereby we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of GrowOp Technology. As a result of the merger, GrowOp Technology became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Following the merger, we ceased our prior operations and are now solely a holding company with ten wholly-owned subsidiaries. We also own interests in four other subsidiaries.
Our Business
 
We are a vertically integrated retail, production and cultivation company, with an emphasis on providing the highest quality of medical and adult use cannabis products. We also hold an exclusive patent on an organic antioxidant rich Superleaf lettuce and living herbs that are grown using classic Dutch hydroponic farming methods.
 
We have a presence in three states (California, Nevada and New Jersey) and currently have a concentrated cannabis interest in California and Nevada. All of our cannabis dispensaries operate under the name Blüm. Our cannabis dispensaries in California operate as MediFarm SoCal in Santa Ana and Black Oak Gallery in Oakland and offer a broad selection of medical cannabis products including flowers, concentrates and edibles. 
 
We are currently in various stages of construction in both states as we are rapidly expanding our commercial footprint focusing on building additional retail, cultivation and production locations for medical and adult use cannabis. The Hegenberger cultivation facility in Oakland under Black Oak is expected to be complete by the third quarter of 2018, with additional medical and adult use locations under Dyer and Carnegie in which we own the real property. We have received provisional permits to operate a dispensary and production facility in the city of San Leandro, California under Blüm San Leandro; and upon project completion and inspection, to receive final operating permits.

In Nevada, we have four dispensaries, three under MediFarm in Las Vegas and one under MediFarm I in Reno, which sell quality medical and adult use cannabis products. We own real property in Reno under MediFarm I RE, on which MediFarm I operates its dispensary. Under MediFarm II, we are constructing a state of the art cultivation and production facility, which will produce our IVXX proprietary brand of cannabis flowers and cannabis extracted products available throughout Nevada. 
 
We have access to wide consumer markets for cannabis in both Nevada and California for which our focus is on building a brand portfolio of a line of quality IVXX cannabis products. Within our highly advanced and custom designed extraction labs, we produce the purest concentrates and cannabis extracted products including cartridges and vape pens. Our IVXX cannabis flowers are grown under meticulous standards ensuring exceptional quality and consistency.

Marijuana Industry Overview
 
Marijuana cultivation refers to the planting, tending, improving and harvesting of the flowering plant Cannabis, primarily for the production and consumption of cannabis flowers, often referred to as “buds.” The cultivation techniques for marijuana cultivation differ for other purposes such as hemp production and generally references to marijuana cultivation and production do not include hemp.
 
Cannabis belongs to the genus Cannabis in the family Cannabaceae and for the purposes of production and consumption, includes three species, C. sativa (“Sativa”), C. indica (“Indica”), and C. ruderalis (“Ruderalis”). Sativa and Indica generally grow tall with some varieties reaching approximately four meters. The females produce flowers rich in tetrahydrocannabinol (“THC”). Ruderalis is a short plant and produces trace amounts of THC, but is very rich in cannabidiol (“CBD”) and which is an antagonist (inhibits the physiological action) to THC.
 
As of December 2017, there are a total of 29 states, plus the District of Columbia, with legislation passed as it relates to medicinal cannabis. Of these states, 8 have decriminalized adult use cannabis legislation. These state laws are in direct conflict with the United States Federal Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. § 811) (“CSA”), which places controlled substances, including cannabis, in a schedule. Cannabis is classified as a Schedule I drug, which is viewed as having a high potential for abuse, has no currently-accepted use for medical treatment in the U.S., and lacks acceptable safety for use under medical supervision.
 
These 29 states, and the District of Columbia, have adopted laws that exempt patients who use medicinal cannabis under a physician’s supervision from state criminal penalties. These are collectively referred to as the states that have de-criminalized medicinal cannabis, although there is a subtle difference between de-criminalization and legalization, and each state’s laws are different.

The states that have legalized medicinal cannabis are as follows (in alphabetical order):
 


1 | . | Alaska | 11 | . | Maine | 21 | . | New York 
---+---+-------------+----+---+---------------+----+---+--------------
2 | . | Arizona | 12 | . | Maryland | 22 | . | North Dakota 
3 | . | Arkansas | 13 | . | Massachusetts | 23 | . | Ohio 
4 | . | California | 14 | . | Michigan | 24 | . | Oregon 
5 | . | Colorado | 15 | . | Minnesota | 25 | . | Pennsylvania 
6 | . | Connecticut | 16 | . | Montana | 26 | . | Rhode Island 
7 | . | Delaware | 17 | . | Nevada | 27 | . | Vermont 
8 | . | Florida | 18 | . | New Hampshire | 28 | . | Washington

Medical cannabis decriminalization is generally referred to as the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession and use of cannabis by adults, including cultivation for personal use and casual, nonprofit transfers of small amounts. Legalization is generally referred to as the development of a legally controlled market for cannabis, where consumers purchase from a safe, legal, and regulated source.
 
The dichotomy between federal and state laws has also limited the access to banking and other financial services by marijuana businesses. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of Treasury have issued guidance for banks considering conducting business with marijuana dispensaries in states where those businesses are legal, pursuant to which banks must now file a Marijuana Limited Suspicious Activity Report that states the marijuana business is following the government’s guidelines with regard to revenue that is generated exclusively from legal sales. However, since the same guidance noted that banks could still face prosecution if they provide financial services to marijuana businesses, it has led to the widespread refusal of the banking industry to offer banking services to marijuana businesses operating within state and local laws.
 
In November 2016, California and Nevada voters both approved marijuana use for adults over the age of 21 without a physician’s prescription or recommendation, so called recreational marijuana, and permitted the cultivation and sale of marijuana, in each case subject to certain limitations. We have obtained the necessary permits and licenses to expand our existing business to cultivate and distribute marijuana in compliance with the laws in the State of Nevada and California. We have received provisional permits to operate a dispensary and production facility in the city of San Leandro, California, and upon project completion and inspection, to receive final operating permits. Although, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in doing so. Despite the changes in state laws, marijuana remains illegal under federal law.
 
In November 2016, California voters approved Proposition 64, which is also known as the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (“the AUMA”), in a ballot initiative. Among other things, the AUMA makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to 28.5 grams of marijuana flowers and 8 grams of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, the AUMA establishes a licensing system for businesses to, among other things, cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On January 1, 2018, the California Bureau of Marijuana Control enacted regulations to implement the AUMA.
 
Nevada voters approved Question 2 in a ballot initiative in November 2016. Among other things, Question 2 makes it legal for adults over the age of 21 to use marijuana and to possess up to one ounce of marijuana flowers and one-eighth of an ounce of marijuana concentrates. Individuals are also permitted to grow up to six marijuana plants for personal use. In addition, Question 2 authorizes businesses to cultivate, process and distribute marijuana products under certain conditions. On June 30, 2017, the State of Nevada Department of Taxation approved our Dual Use Marijuana business licenses. This approval allowed all four of our Blüm cannabis dispensaries in Nevada to commence sales of cannabis for adult-use beginning on July 1, 2017.
 
In an effort to provide guidance to federal law enforcement, the Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) has issued Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement to all United States Attorneys in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General David Ogden on October 19, 2009, in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on June 29, 2011 and in a memorandum from Deputy Attorney General James Cole on August 29, 2013. Each memorandum provides that the DOJ is committed to the enforcement of the CSA, but the DOJ is also committed to using its limited investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions revoked the Ogden Memo and the Cole Memos.

The DOJ has not historically devoted resources to prosecuting individuals whose conduct is limited to possession of small amounts of marijuana for use on private property but has relied on state and local law enforcement to address marijuana activity. In the event the DOJ reverses its stated policy and begins strict enforcement of the CSA in states that have laws legalizing medical marijuana and recreational marijuana in small amounts, there may be a direct and adverse impact to our business and our revenue and profits.
 
Furthermore, H.R. 83, enacted by Congress on December 16, 2014, provides that none of the funds made available to the DOJ pursuant to the 2015 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act may be used to prevent certain states, including Nevada and California, from implementing their own laws that authorized the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical marijuana. This prohibition is currently in place until March 23, 2018.
 
We are monitoring the Trump administration’s, the DOJ’s and Congress’ positions on federal marijuana law and policy. Based on public statements and reports, we understand that certain aspects of those laws and policies are currently under review, but no official changes have been announced. It is possible that certain changes to existing laws or policies could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.
 
We currently operate medical and adult use marijuana businesses in California and Nevada. Although the possession, cultivation and distribution of marijuana for medical and adult use is permitted in California and Nevada, provided compliance with applicable state and local laws, rules, and regulations, marijuana is illegal under federal law. We believe we operate our business in compliance with applicable Nevada and California laws and regulations. Any changes in federal, state or local law enforcement regarding marijuana may affect our ability to operate our business. Strict enforcement of federal law regarding marijuana would likely result in the inability to proceed with our business plans, could expose us to potential criminal liability and could subject our properties to civil forfeiture. Any changes in banking, insurance or other business services may also affect our ability to operate our business.
 
Our Medical Marijuana Dispensaries, Cultivation and Manufacturing 
 
Black Oak Gallery
 
On April 1, 2016, we acquired Black Oak, which operates a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary in Oakland, California under the name Blüm. Black Oak opened its retail storefront in Oakland, California in November 2012.
 
Black Oak sells a combination of our own cultivated products as well as high quality name-brand products from outside suppliers. In addition to multiple grades of medical and adult use marijuana, Black Oak sells “edibles”, which include cannabis-infused baked goods, chocolates, and candies; cannabis-infused topical products, such as lotions, massage oils and balms; clones of marijuana plants; and numerous kinds of cannabis concentrates, such as hash, shatter and wax.
 
Black Oak’s target markets are those individuals located in the areas surrounding its dispensary. Black Oak services approximately 1,000 consumers per day and has over 42,000 registered consumers that qualify as “patients’ under state and local rules and regulations. Collectively known as the Blüm Campus, Black Oak’s location consists of a retail dispensary storefront, indoor cultivation area, laboratory and a 20-car capacity parking lot.
 
During January 2017, we executed a lease for 13,000 square feet of industrial space on over 30,000 square feet of land in Oakland’s industrial corridor. The Hegenberger facility is currently under construction, we expect to complete construction by the third quarter of 2018.
 
On May 11, 2017, we terminated the Operations and Asset Management Agreement (the “Agreement”) by and among the Company, Black Oak and Platinum Standard, LLC (“Platinum”), dated March 31, 2016. There is no relationship between the Company or its affiliates and Platinum, other than pursuant to the Agreement. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company hired and appointed Platinum as the operator and asset manager of the Company’s licensed medical cannabis dispensary business located at 578 West Grand Avenue, in the City of Oakland, State of California, commonly known as Blüm Oakland, in exchange for certain payments to be made by the Company to Platinum, all as more fully set forth in the Agreement. We terminated the Agreement as a result of the default by Platinum in the performance of certain of its material obligations under the Agreement. We did not incur any early termination penalty in connection with terminating the Agreement. A copy of the Agreement was filed as Exhibit 10.29 to the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2016. See “Note 12 – Contingent Consideration” for further information.

Blüm San Leandro
 
We incorporated Blüm San Leandro on October 14, 2016. Blüm San Leandro has received the necessary governmental approvals and permitting to operate a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary and production facility in San Leandro, California. We have executed a lease for 13,300 square feet of industrial space in San Leandro’s industrial corridor and are in the final planning and design stages of the retail dispensary and production facility. We also plan on incorporating a community meeting space at this facility. We expect to complete construction of the dispensary, production facility, and community meeting space by early second quarter of 2018.
 
MediFarm SoCal
 
We incorporated MediFarm SoCal on August 17, 2017 to acquire all the assets of Tech Center Drive Management LLC. As a result of the acquisition, MediFarm SoCal now operates a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary under the name Blüm. MediFarm SoCal has the necessary governmental approvals and permitting to operate a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary in Santa Ana, California. 
 
MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II 
 
We formed three subsidiaries for the purposes of cultivation or production of medical and adult use marijuana and/or operation of dispensary facilities in various locations in Nevada. MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II have received four final dispensary licenses, two provisional cultivation licenses and two provisional production licenses from the State of Nevada, and we have received approval from local authorities with respect to all eight of such licenses. The receipt of both the provisional licenses from the State of Nevada and approval from local authorities were necessary to commence the final permitting process for the cultivation and production licenses. The receipt of final permits and licenses was necessary to commence the cultivation and production businesses of MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II. Effectuation of the businesses of each of (i) MediFarm, (ii) MediFarm I, and (iii) MediFarm II is also dependent upon the continued legislative authorization of medical and adult use marijuana at the state level.
 
Each subsidiary was formed with different investors, thus necessitating the need for multiple entities with different strategic partners and advisory board members. In addition, we anticipate each subsidiary will service a different geographical market in Nevada. We expect to allocate future business opportunities among MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II based on the locations of such opportunities.
 
We formed MediFarm on March 19, 2014. Prior to August 2017, we owned 60% of the membership interests in MediFarm. The remaining membership interests were owned by Camden Goorjian (20%) and by Richard Vonfeldt (20%), two otherwise unaffiliated individuals. In August 2017, we acquired an additional 38% ownership in MediFarm for no additional consideration due to changes in the planned level of involvement of the two individuals in the operations of MediFarm. We now own 98% of MediFarm. MediFarm has received the necessary governmental approvals and permitting to operate medical marijuana and adult use cultivation, production, and/or dispensary facilities in Clark County, Nevada and a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary facility in the City of Las Vegas. As of December 31, 2017, MediFarm has three fully operational retail medical and adult use marijuana dispensaries in the greater Las Vegas region.
 
We formed MediFarm I on July 18, 2014. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I. The remaining membership interests are owned by Forever Green NV, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity that also owns certain membership interests in MediFarm II. MediFarm I has the necessary governmental approvals and permitting to operate a medical and adult use marijuana dispensary in Reno, Nevada. As of December 31, 2017, MediFarm I has one fully operational retail medical and adult use marijuana dispensary in Reno, Nevada.
 
We formed MediFarm II on July 30, 2014. We own 55% of the membership interests in MediFarm II. The remaining membership interests are owned by Nevada MF, LLC (30%) and by Forever Green NV, LLC (15%), two otherwise unaffiliated entities. Forever Green NV, LLC also owns certain membership interests in MediFarm I. MediFarm II has received provisional licenses from the State of Nevada to operate a medical marijuana and adult use cultivation and production facility in Spanish Springs, Nevada.

MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II may face substantial competition in the operation of cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in Nevada. Numerous other companies were also granted licenses, and, therefore, we anticipate that we will face competition with these other companies if such companies operate cultivation, production, and dispensary facilities in and around the locations at which we operate our facilities. Our management has extensive experience in successfully developing, implementing, and operating all facets of equivalent businesses in other markets. We believe this experience will provide MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II with a competitive advantage over these other companies.
 
MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II rely on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions, and other contractual provisions to protect their proprietary rights. MediFarm, MediFarm I, and MediFarm II do not own any patents.
 
IVXX and IVXX Branded Products
 
On September 16, 2014, Terra Tech formed IVXX for the purposes of producing a line of IVXX branded cannabis flowers as well as a complete line of IVXX branded pure cannabis concentrates including: oils, waxes, shatters, and clears.
 
The science of cannabis concentrate extraction functions on the solubility of the cannabinoids and other active ingredients in the cannabis plant. Cannabinoids are not water soluble, so to extract them properly, the cannabinoids must be dissolved in a solvent. IVXX utilizes multiple proprietary extraction methods to produce its concentrates. The Company’s extractors process raw cannabis plants and separate the chemical cannabinoids from the cannabis plant material, producing a concentrate. IVXX also sells clothing, apparel, and other various branded products.
 
IVXX sells its branded products at wholesale to multiple cannabis dispensaries throughout California. None of IVXX’s products cross state lines. IVXX’s target markets are those individuals located in the areas surrounding the dispensaries that sell IVXX’s branded products and that are qualified to purchase its products under state rules and regulations. IVXX continues to actively seek opportunities to sell its products to other retailers located throughout the State of California. IVXX anticipates expanding its business into other states in which the sale of marijuana is legally permitted. In order for such expansion to occur, IVXX must secure the necessary licenses and permits required to operate in any given state, the timing and occurrence of which there can be no assurance. Initially, IVXX anticipates selling its products in Nevada in the four dispensaries operated by MediFarm and MediFarm I. They will be produced at our extraction lab operated by MediFarm II once they are issued final permits and commence operations, as to the occurrence of which there can be no assurance.
 
IVXX produces, markets and sells their line of IVXX branded cannabis products both to adult use and recreational cannabis markets in California and Nevada pursuant to Proposition 64 and Question 2, respectively, which made marijuana consumption legal (January 1, 2018 for California and July 1, 2017 for Nevada), with certain restrictions and rules, for adults over the age of 21. IVXX is consistently engaged in research and development with respect to increasing the efficiency of the processes used to produce its products, as well as improving the quality of its products for the benefit of its consumers.
 
On May 24, 2017, we announced the launch of a new “Craft Cultivation” model to expand our cultivation capabilities and the signing of our first “Craft Cultivator” in Northern California under the name Panther Gap Farms. This farm, which is approved for up to one full acre (approximately 44,000 square feet) of cannabis cultivation and uses 22,000 square feet of engineered greenhouse space, is estimated to yield approximately one metric ton of our proprietary high grade “IVXX” cannabis on an annual basis. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased 2,000 pounds from this cultivator.
 
On September 19, 2017, we announced that we signed a second craft cultivator to grow our proprietary high grade "IVXX" cannabis flowers and oils. The craft cultivator, Cultivar Inc., is located in Salinas, California and is approved for up to six acres (approximately 244,000 square feet) of cannabis cultivation, to be grown in high tech, climate-controlled greenhouses. To date we have not received or sold product from Cultivar Inc.
 
On October 26, 2017, the Company entered into agreements with NuLeaf Sparks Cultivation, LLC and NuLeaf Reno Productions, LLC (“NuLeaf”) to build and operate cultivation and production facilities for our IVXX brand of cannabis products in Nevada, subject to regulatory approval by the State of Nevada. As part of the agreements the Company made convertible loans on the date of agreement of $4.5 million in the aggregate to the NuLeaf entities bearing an interest rate of 6% per annum, payable quarterly. The Company funded an additional $0.5 million through December 31, 2017. The convertible loans will automatically convert into a 50% ownership in each NuLeaf entity upon approval by the State of Nevada. 
 
MediFarm I RE
 
On October 14, 2015, we formed MediFarm I RE. We own 50% of the membership interests in MediFarm I RE. The remaining membership interests are owned by Forever Young Investments, LLC (50%), an otherwise unaffiliated entity. MediFarm I RE is a real estate holding company that owns the real property and a building that is situated on such real property, at which in January 1, 2017 our medical marijuana dispensary facility is located and operates. 

9

Carnegie 
 
On October 31, 2017, we formed Carnegie, a wholly owned subsidiary. Carnegie is a real estate holding company that owns the real property and a building located in Santa Ana, California, of which the Company plans to open a second cannabis operation in Santa Ana, California. 
Dyer 
 
On October 31, 2017, we formed Dyer, a wholly owned subsidiary. Dyer is a real estate holding company for the purpose of acquiring real property and a building located in Santa Ana, California, where the Company plans to open a third cannabis operation in Santa Ana, California. 
Herbs and Produce Products
 
Edible Garden
 
Edible Garden was incorporated on April 9, 2013. Edible Garden is a retail seller of locally grown hydroponic produce and herb products that are distributed throughout the Northeast, Midwest and Western United States. Currently, Edible Garden’s products are sold at approximately 1,800 retailers throughout these markets. Most of the produce and herbs grown by Edible Garden are certified organic. Our target customers are those individuals seeking organic and fresh produce locally grown using environmentally sustainable methods.
 
Pursuant to letter agreements with Gro-Rite Inc., a New Jersey corporation, and related party, Naturally Beautiful Plant Products LLC ("NB Plants"), a New Jersey limited liability company and related party, and Heartland Growers Inc. (collectively the “Farmers”), have agreed to cultivate the various parts of the line of Edible Garden produce to be sold into the retail grocery channel. Pursuant to the terms of the agreements, Edible Garden will manage the marketing and sales, while the farmers will be responsible for the cultivation, packaging, and shipping of the product for retail sale under the Edible Garden brand. The terms of the agreements are now month-to-month. The agreement with NB Plants was terminated as of December 31, 2016.
 
There are numerous growers that are available to us, and therefore, we are not limited in the number of growers available nor are we dependent on any one grower. We completed construction of a greenhouse structure in 2014, which can be used to grow plants to satisfy selling demands; however, we may incur additional freight costs to distribute these plants until growers are replaced.
 
Edible Garden’s main competitors are Shenandoah Growers and Sun Aqua Farms. To a lesser extent, Edible Garden competes with Green Giant, Del Monte, Rock Hedge Herbs, and Infinite Herbs. Edible Garden is an up and coming brand that has increased its retailers to approximately 1,800 retail sellers since we acquired Edible Garden in April 2013. Edible Garden believes the following three factors set it apart from its competitors: (1) its branding and marketing displays, which are predominately placed in high traffic areas on its proprietary racks; (2) it uses proprietary strands and seeds for its produce and its methodology for growing such produce; and (3) all of its produce is hydroponically grown and sold “alive” (i.e., the produce is sold “rooted”).
 
Edible Garden relies on a combination of trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality provisions, and other contractual provisions to protect its proprietary rights, which are primarily its brand names, marks, and proprietary pods and seeds. Edible Garden owns trademarks but does not own any patents. Edible Garden signed an exclusive license agreement with Nutrasorb LLC, a spin-off from Rutgers University, to grow and commercialize nutritionally-enhanced lettuce varieties. Under the terms of the agreement, Edible Garden has the right to grow and sell Green and Red Superleaf Lettuce across the North American and European continents as well as Australia. With five times more antioxidants than ordinary lettuce, the produce is high in vitamins A and C, magnesium, iron and potassium contents. It also has high levels of fiber and chlorogenic acid for superior digestion. These nutritionally-enhanced, proprietary Green and Red Superleaf Lettuces were developed by scientists at Rutgers University following years of intensive research. Edible Garden pays a license fee to Nutrasorb, LLC for each unit sold.
 
Edible Garden’s produce is Global Food Safety Initiative certified. Edible Garden also obtained certain organic certifications for its products. No other governmental regulations or approvals are needed or affect its business.
 
Edible Garden’s research and development activities have primarily focused on developing and testing new pods and seeds, as well as different fertilizers, nutrient blends, and lighting.
 
On August 22, 2017, Edible Garden continued to expand its product range with the launch of a new line of fresh-cut herbs, under the name ‘Snip Its™’, for individuals seeking out healthier salad alternatives that are free of genetically modified organisms.
