BUSINESS
Overview
Mirati Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage oncology company developing targeted therapeutics to address the genetic, epigenetic and immunological promoters of cancer. Our precision oncology clinical programs utilize next-generation genomic testing to identify and select cancer patients who are most likely to benefit from targeted treatment. In immuno-oncology, we are advancing clinical programs where the ability of our product candidates to improve the immune environment of tumor cells may enhance and expand the efficacy of existing cancer immunotherapy medicines when given in combination. Our preclinical programs include product candidates specifically designed to address genetic mutations in cancer patients where few treatment options exist. We approach each of our discovery and development programs with a singular focus: to translate our deep understanding of the molecular drivers of cancer into better therapies and better outcomes for patients.
Our clinical and preclinical programs are summarized in the chart below:

Sitravatinib 
Sitravatinib in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors 
Background
Sitravatinib is an oral, spectrum-selective kinase inhibitor that potently inhibits specific receptor tyrosine kinases (“RTKs”). RTKs are families of kinases involved in the transmission of signals that regulate cell growth, survival, and migration and include TAM family receptors (TYRO3, Axl, Mer), split family receptors (VEGFR2, KIT) and RET. Sitravatinib addresses cancer via two distinct mechanisms: directly, by targeting RTKs that drive tumor growth through mutation, and indirectly, by 
3

modulating immune regulatory cells to stimulate the body’s immune response to tumors. Sitravatinib’s potent inhibition of TAM and split family receptors may help overcome resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors and stimulate the body’s immune response to help detect and destroy tumor cells. Blocking the signaling of these RTKs enhances the ability of T-cells (a type of white blood cell that is of key importance to the immune system) to recognize and eliminate tumor cells and modifies the tumor immune environment to enable a more productive immune response. The ability of sitravatinib to enhance the activity of immune checkpoint inhibitors was demonstrated in nonclinical cancer models. 
Program Update
 We are evaluating the potential of sitravatinib to enhance and expand the clinical efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors in a Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with nivolumab (Opdivo®), Bristol Myers Squibb’s anti-PD-1 inhibitor, in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). This clinical trial is designed to assess the potential of sitravatinib to inhibit several important immunosuppressive pathways that may be important in overcoming resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This clinical trial is enrolling patients who have relapsed after treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor, as well as checkpoint inhibitor-naïve patients. As previously reported at the IASLC 18th World Conference on Lung Cancer, as of August 10, 2017, three of 11 evaluable patients who had relapsed after previous checkpoint inhibitor treatment experienced a confirmed partial response and seven of the 11 evaluable patients were continuing to receive treatment in the clinical trial, with treatment duration ranging from four months to 10.5 months. Early safety data indicated an acceptable profile and manageable adverse events. Based on the data presented, the pre-defined criteria for expansion were met and the next stage will enroll a cumulative total of 34 patients. We expect to report further data on checkpoint inhibitor refractory patients from this clinical trial in mid-2018. Based on sitravatinib’s mechanism of action, we believe that there are multiple additional tumor types that would be attractive targets for further clinical development in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, including renal cell, liver and bladder cancers.
Sitravatinib as a Targeted Agent
Background
 Dysregulation of RTKs through genetic alteration or uncontrolled expression is associated with multiple processes relating to human cancer, including tumor growth and metastatic progression, as well as tumor angiogenesis. Sitravatinib potently inhibits a subset of these RTKs, including the TAM and split family receptors and RET, which are key regulators of signaling pathways that direct cell growth and survival. Through the genetic selection of patients with tumors that are driven by one or more of these dysregulated RTKs, there are multiple opportunities to develop sitravatinib as a targeted agent. 
 Program update
We are evaluating sitravatinib as a single agent in a Phase 1b expansion clinical trial (the “CITRINE Trial”), which is testing sitravatinib for the treatment of patients whose tumors harbor CBL, amplification of a genomic region located on chromosome 4q12 ("CHR4q12") and RET genetic alterations in NSCLC and other tumor types. Patients who have mutations in CBL, CHR4q12, or rearrangement of the RET gene are most likely to respond to sitravatinib because each of these mutations dysregulate different sitravatinib RTK targets. These mutations are estimated to be present in a total of 5.5% of all NSCLC patients. We reported early data from this clinical trial in January 2017 showing that as of December 9, 2016, of the four evaluable patients with RET genetic alterations at the time, there was one patient with stable disease, one unconfirmed partial response and one confirmed partial response. In September 2017, we presented a case study at the IASLC 2017 Chicago Multidisciplinary Symposium in Thoracic Oncology of an NSCLC patient with a CBL inactivating mutation. The case was the first evaluable NSCLC patient harboring a CBL mutation treated in the ongoing Phase 1b study of sitravatinib as a single agent. The confirmed partial response is the first example of clinical activity for sitravatinib in a patient with a CBL mutation. Inactivating mutations in CBL occur in approximately 1.5% of NSCLC patients and currently represent an unmet medical need. To date, sitravatinib safety data indicate an acceptable profile and manageable adverse events. We expect to provide an update on this clinical trial in mid-2018.
Collaboration with BeiGene, Ltd. to Develop and Commercialize Sitravatinib in Certain Asian Territories
In January 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement (the “BeiGene Agreement”) with BeiGene, Ltd. (“BeiGene”), pursuant to which Mirati and BeiGene agreed to collaboratively develop sitravatinib in Asia (excluding Japan and certain other countries), Australia and New Zealand (the “Licensed Territory”). Under the BeiGene Agreement, Mirati granted BeiGene an exclusive license to develop, manufacture and commercialize sitravatinib in the Licensed Territory, with Mirati retaining exclusive rights for the development, manufacturing and commercialization of sitravatinib outside the Licensed Territory.
Under the BeiGene Agreement, BeiGene agreed to pay to Mirati an upfront fee of $10.0 million. BeiGene is also required to make milestone payments to Mirati of up to an aggregate of $123.0 million upon the first achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and sales milestones. Additionally, BeiGene is obligated to pay to Mirati royalties at tiered percentage rates ranging from mid-single digits to twenty percent on annual net sales of licensed products in the Licensed Territory, subject to reduction under specified circumstances.

Mocetinostat
Background
Mocetinostat is an oral, Class 1 selective histone deacetylase (“HDAC”) inhibitor. Mocetinostat acts through epigenetic mechanisms and has demonstrated in preclinical studies the ability to block the effects of immune suppressive cells that counter the immune system’s ability to fight tumors and reduce the effectiveness of treatment with checkpoint inhibitors. Epigenetics is the regulation of gene expression and resulting cellular phenotypes through mechanisms other than primary DNA sequence alterations. The epigenetic regulation of gene expression involves the regulation of DNA methylation and modification of certain histones via modulation of acetylation or methylation of specific amino acid residues. Epigenetic pathways can become dysregulated during cancer progression through a variety of mechanisms, including the genetic alteration of molecules that participate in DNA methylation and histone modification. The epigenetic mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors like mocetinostat have demonstrated efficacy in hematologic malignancies and have been approved as single agents and may be complementary with other epigenetic mechanisms.
Program update
We are evaluating mocetinostat in a Phase 2 clinical trial in combination with durvalumab (IMFINZI™), MedImmune Limited’s anti-PD-L1 inhibitor, for the treatment of patients with NSCLC. The clinical trial is enrolling patients who have relapsed after treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor, as well as checkpoint inhibitor-naïve patients. Patients who have relapsed after previous treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor are stratified into two cohorts based upon their best response to prior checkpoint therapy. Stage 1 of the trial is currently enrolling nine patients in each cohort; one cohort has already met the prespecified criteria for expansion into stage 2 with at least one confirmed partial response. We expect to provide an update on stage 1 of this trial in mid-2018.
In October 2017, we announced that mocetinostat has been included in the SU2C Catalyst® program, a cutting-edge research initiative led by Stand up to Cancer (“SU2C”) designed to bring innovative cancer treatments to patients quickly through novel collaborations between industry and academia. The Phase 1/1b clinical trial, sponsored by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, is designed to evaluate the potential of epigenetic agents to improve patient responses to immunotherapy in NSCLC which will combine mocetinostat, guadecitabine, a DNA methyltransferase inhibitor from Astex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and pembrolizumab, a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor from Merck & Co., Inc. (known as MSD outside the United States and Canada). The clinical trial enrolled its first patient in August 2017.
KRAS G12C Inhibitor Program
Background
The RAS family of genes is the most commonly mutated oncogene and mutations in this gene family comprise up to 25% of all human cancers. Among the RAS family members, mutations most frequently occur in KRAS (85% of all RAS family mutations). Tumors characterized by KRAS mutations are commonly associated with poor prognosis and resistance to therapy. Nonclinical studies have demonstrated that cancer cells exhibiting KRAS mutations are highly dependent on KRAS function for cell growth and survival. Historically, KRAS has been extremely difficult to directly inhibit due to the absence of a tractable small molecule drug binding site. Recent findings have indicated that the KRAS G12C mutant variant may be targeted by irreversible small molecules that bind to a novel drug pocket and inhibit the function of KRAS. KRAS G12C driver mutations occur in approximately 14% of NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients, 5% of colorectal cancer patients and smaller percentages in other tumor types. Collectively, these patients have few treatment options. We have selected a KRAS G12C mutant-selective clinical lead compound for advancement to an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application. The clinical lead compound is an orally-available small molecule inhibitor of KRAS G12C with potency of approximately 10 nM (cellular IC50) and selectivity of greater than 1,000-fold for target inhibition in tumor cells harboring KRAS G12C mutations compared with cells exhibiting non-mutated forms of KRAS. In addition, the clinical lead compound demonstrated complete regression of KRAS G12C-positive tumors implanted in mice at well-tolerated dose levels.
Program Update
In November 2017, we announced that IND-enabling preclinical studies were underway, and an IND submission for the KRAS G12C program is expected by the fourth quarter of 2018, with early clinical proof-of-concept data anticipated in 2019. The KRAS program emerged from a joint discovery collaboration with Array BioPharma, Inc., and Mirati has an exclusive license to further develop and commercialize products emerging from the collaboration.
Glesatinib
In November 2017, we announced that, in light of superior investment opportunities in our pipeline, we suspended further investment in glesatinib and will pursue opportunities to partner the program.

Market and Competition
Market
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The National Cancer Institute estimates that in 2017, approximately 223,000 patients in the United States ("U.S.") were diagnosed with lung cancer and 156,000 died due to the disease. Lung cancer represents over 13% of all new cancer cases in the U.S., and 26% of all cancer deaths. Approximately 85% of lung cancers are NSCLC. The five-year survival rate for lung cancer patients is 18%, indicating a significant need for novel therapies to extend overall survival in this patient population. 
Immuno-oncology Combinations
The prognosis for advanced NSCLC is poor, and the primary objective of treating late-stage disease is to prolong overall survival, delay disease progression and control symptoms. The treatment algorithm for advanced NSCLC has changed significantly following recent approvals and label expansions of immuno-oncology agents, specifically immune checkpoint inhibitors. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approved Opdivo®, an anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and the first immuno-oncology agent approved for the treatment of squamous NSCLC. The approval of Opdivo® in NSCLC was subsequently followed by FDA approval of two additional immuno-oncology agents in NSCLC, Keytruda® and Tecentriq®. These three agents, approved for indications including NSCLC, accounted for over $6 billion in global sales in 2016. The immune checkpoint inhibitor market is projected to grow to $46 billion by 2023(1).
Despite the advances in patient outcomes demonstrated by approved immuno-oncology therapies in NSCLC, a significant patient need remains. The percentage of patients who respond to approved immuno-oncology treatments is quite low, and of the patients that respond, the majority will still experience disease progression. We believe that combinations of checkpoint inhibitors with other agents like sitravatinib and mocetinostat have the potential to improve efficacy outcomes and overcome resistance to checkpoint inhibitor therapy through complementary mechanisms. 
Targeted Agents
NSCLC represents a heterogeneous patient population with diverse tumor histology and underlying genomic aberrations. Genetic alterations consisting of CBL mutations, CHR4q12 amplifications and RET gene rearrangements account for up to 5.5% of NSCLC patient cases annually in the U.S. KRAS G12C driver mutations occur in approximately 14% of NSCLC adenocarcinoma patients and 5% of colorectal cancer patients.
The clinical and commercial success of leading targeted agents across multiple indications, including NSCLC, demonstrates the potential of new targeted treatments for cancer. The following table lists global sales figures for selected small molecule kinase inhibitors in NSCLC and other indications.
2016 Worldwide Retail Sales Figures of Selected Small Molecule Kinase Inhibitors

Competition
Sitravatinib in Combination with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors
There are several immune checkpoint inhibitors currently approved for use as single agents to treat multiple tumor types, including NSCLC. To augment the efficacy of these agents, combination studies are being conducted with a variety of potentially synergistic mechanisms, including inhibitors of CTLA-4, IDO1, LAG3, and CSF-1R. Most of these combination studies are being conducted in patients who are naïve to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. A competitor whose agent is being evaluated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients that are naïve to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy is Nektar Therapeutics (CD-122 agonist). Competitors whose agents are being evaluated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in NSCLC patients who failed previous immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy include Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Adenosine A2Ar inhibitor), Bristol-Myers Squibb (GITR inhibitor and LAG3 inhibitor) and Syndax, Inc. (HDAC inhibitor). Direct mechanistic competitors to sitravatinib in immunotherapy include Cabometryx (Exelixis, Inc.), an anti-VEGF agent that also inhibits MET and other RTKs. We expect that additional agents and mechanisms will be evaluated in immunotherapy combinations, and we will continue to monitor these competitors in relation to our own immunotherapy combination programs.
Sitravatinib as a Targeted Agent
A large number of multi-targeted kinase inhibitors are currently commercially available or in clinical trials, with many more in the early research stage. Biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are also developing monoclonal antibodies to inhibit kinase targets and their ligands.
Companies with RET inhibitors believed to be in late preclinical or clinical development include, but are not limited to, Blueprint Medicines, Inc., Ignyta, Inc., and Loxo Oncology, Inc. For CBL and CHRq12 alterations, we are not aware of any other companies with programs that specifically target these patient populations.
Mocetinostat
We believe that a key differentiating feature of mocetinostat is its spectrum of activity covering only isoforms 1, 2, 3 and 11, which are the most relevant HDAC isoforms in human cancers. Other companies that are developing spectrum-selective HDAC inhibitors include, but are not limited to, Acetylon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Chroma Therapeutics Ltd., Huya Bioscience International, Shenzen Chipscreen Biosciences Ltd. and Syndax Pharmaceuticals Inc.
Companies with Pan-HDAC inhibitors, which are HDAC inhibitors that have an effect across a broader range of HDAC isoforms and are therefore not as selective as molecules like mocetinostat, include but are not limited to: Celgene Corporation, Curis Inc., MEI Pharma Inc., Merck & Co Inc., Novartis, Pharmacyclics Inc. and others. We expect that these and other companies may continue to pursue research and development in relation to HDAC inhibitors. We continue to monitor these and other companies in order to be aware of any third-party products and/or intellectual property rights relevant to our products.
KRAS G12C
We are aware of one company with a competing direct KRAS G12C inhibitor program: Araxes Pharma, which partnered its KRAS G12C program with Janssen Biotech in 2013. It is likely that other companies are also researching KRAS G12C inhibitors. In November 2017, our first patent application covering our KRAS G12C inhibitor program was published. Based upon this and other publicly available information, we believe that our program is the most advanced. We will continue to monitor scientific and patent publications for the emergence of other potential competitors.
Oncology
In addition to companies that have kinase inhibitors or HDAC inhibitors addressing our targets of interest, our competition also includes hundreds of private and publicly traded companies that operate in the area of oncology but have therapeutics with different mechanisms of action. The oncology market in general is highly competitive, with over 1,000 molecules currently in clinical development. Other important competitors, in addition to those mentioned above, are small and large biotechnology companies, including, but not limited to, Amgen, Inc. and Gilead Sciences Inc., and specialty and regional pharmaceutical companies and multinational pharmaceutical companies, including but not limited to Astellas Pharma Inc., Bayer-Schering Pharmaceutical, Boehringer Ingelheim AG, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eisai Co. Ltd., Eli Lilly and Company, F. Hoffmann- LaRoche Ltd., GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck KGaA, Novartis AG, Taiho and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
Many companies have filed, and continue to file, patent applications which may or could affect our program if and when they issue, either because they protect a product that may compete with our product candidates, or because they protect intellectual property rights that are necessary for us to develop and commercialize our product candidates. These companies include, but are not limited to: Bristol-Myers Squibb, Exelixis, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis and Pfizer. Since this area is competitive and of strong interest to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, we expect that these and other companies will continue to publish and file patent applications in this space in the future, as well as pursuing research and development programs in this area. We continue 
7

to monitor these and other companies in order to be aware of any third-party products and/or intellectual property rights relevant to our product candidates.
Intellectual Property
Our goal is to obtain, maintain and enforce patent protection wherever appropriate for our product candidates, formulations, processes, methods and any other proprietary technologies both in the United States and in other countries. We typically file for patents in the United States with counterparts in certain countries in Europe and certain key market countries in the rest of the world, thereby covering the major pharmaceutical markets. As of December 31, 2017, we own or co-own U.S. patents and patent applications and their foreign counterparts, including 28 issued U.S. patents as reflected in the following table:

Description | Granted | Pending | Expiration
Sitravatinib and other kinase inhibitor compounds | 11 | 0 | 2026-2029 
Mocetinostat and other HDAC inhibitors | 17 | 0 | 2022-2035 
KRAS inhibitors | 0 | 3 | 2036-2037 
Total | 28 | 3 | 

Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our product candidates, nor do we plan to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials and finished products for our preclinical and clinical trials.
Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA's Current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved new drug applications ("NDA"), including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented.
Government Regulation
The Regulatory Process for Drug Development
The production and manufacture of our product candidates and our research and development activities are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities around the world. In the United States, drug products are subject to regulation by the FDA. There are other comparable agencies in Europe and other parts of the world. Regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products. Applicable legislation requires licensing of manufacturing and contract research facilities, carefully controlled research and testing of products, governmental review and/or approval of results prior to marketing therapeutic products. Additionally, adherence to good laboratory practices (“GLP”) and good clinical practices (“GCP”) during nonclinical and clinical testing and cGMP during production is required.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Product Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally includes the following:
8


• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with GCP standards and regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

The FDA monitors the progress of trials conducted in the U.S. under an IND and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s risk/benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The FDA may also place a hold on one or more clinical trials conducted under an IND for a drug if it deems warranted. Furthermore, even after regulatory approval of an NDA is obtained, under certain circumstances, such as later discovery of previously unknown problems, the FDA can withdraw approval or subject the drug to additional restrictions.
Preclinical Studies:   Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to evaluate efficacy and activity, toxic effects, pharmacokinetics and metabolism of the pharmaceutical product candidate and to provide evidence of the safety, bioavailability and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate in animals. Most of these studies must be performed according to GLP.
Clinical Trials:    Clinical trials involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by the sponsor. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA's GCP requirements. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), or ethics committee at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB or ethics committee is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB or ethics committee also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Clinical trials in the U.S. typically are conducted in sequential phases: Phases 1, 2, 3 and post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials. The phases may overlap. The FDA may require that we suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds.
Phase 1 Clinical Trials:    Phase 1 clinical trials are generally conducted on a small number of healthy human subjects to evaluate the drug's activity, schedule and dose, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and other drug effects. However, in the case of life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, the initial Phase 1 testing may be done in patients with the disease. These trials typically take longer to complete and may provide insights into drug activity. Follow-on Phase 1b clinical trials may also evaluate efficacy with respect to trial participants.
Phase 2 Clinical Trials:    Phase 2 clinical trials are carried out on a relatively small number of patients (generally up to several hundred) in a specific indication. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated to preliminarily assess efficacy, to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and to determine optimal dose, regimens, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and dose response relationships. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning Phase 3 clinical trials.
Phase 3 Clinical Trials:    Phase 3 clinical trials involve tests on a much larger population of patients (several hundred to several thousand patients) suffering from the targeted condition or disease. These trials are undertaken to confirm proof of concept and further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety and are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA or foreign authorities for approval of marketing applications.
Post-Approval Clinical Trials:    Phase 4 clinical trials or other post-approval commitments may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval. 
9

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trial must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or for any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or, if used, its data safety and monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or ethics committee can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB's or ethics committee's requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Pharmaceutical Review and Approval Process
Upon completion of pivotal Phase 3 clinical studies, the sponsor assembles all the product development, preclinical and clinical data along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information, and submits it to the FDA as part of an NDA. If accepted by the FDA as substantially complete to permit substantive review, the submission or application is then reviewed for approval to market the product. This process takes eight months to one year to complete, but in some cases may take longer. At the end of the review period the FDA may issue a Complete Response Letter, refusing to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or requiring additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling.
Accelerated Approval
Accelerated Approval is a program that is intended to make promising products for life threatening diseases available on the basis of evidence of effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase 4 clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product's approved labeling (known as "off-label use"), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk evaluation and mitigation strategies and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product.

FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
As part of our clinical development plans, we are exploring the use of companion diagnostics to identify patients most likely to respond to our product candidates. Companion diagnostics are classified as medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act in the United States. In the United States, the FDA regulates the medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, reporting, recordkeeping, advertising and promotion, export and import, sales and distribution, and post-market surveillance of medical devices. Unless an exemption applies, companion diagnostics require marketing clearance or approval from the FDA prior to commercial distribution. The two primary types of FDA marketing authorization applicable to a medical device are premarket notification, also called 510(k) clearance, and premarket approval ("PMA").
The FDA previously has required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to the cancer treatment to obtain a PMA simultaneously with approval of the drug. Based on the draft guidance, and the FDA's past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will require a PMA for one or more companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our product candidates. The review of these companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our product candidates involves coordination of review by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors, including government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide reimbursement for products and services based on the level at which the government (through the Medicare or Medicaid programs) provides reimbursement for such products and services. There is no uniform coverage and reimbursement policy among third-party payors in the United States; however, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services in addition to their safety and efficacy and, accordingly, significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of newly approved therapeutics. In particular, in the United States, the European Union and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of medical products and services, particularly for new and innovative products and therapies, which often has resulted in average selling prices that are lower than they would otherwise be. Recently, Congress and the Trump Administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and utilization, which may adversely affect our future product sales and results of operations. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and governmental laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical reimbursement policies and pricing in general. As a result, coverage and adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available for our product candidates to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in research and product development.
The market for our product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval will depend significantly on access to third-party payors' drug formularies, or lists of medications for which third-party payors provide coverage and reimbursement. The industry competition to be included in such formularies often leads to downward pricing pressures on pharmaceutical companies. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug in their formularies or may otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. In addition, because each third-party payor individually approves coverage and reimbursement levels, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement is a time-consuming and costly process. We would be required to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of any product to each third-party payor separately with no assurance that approval would be obtained, and we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. This process could delay the market acceptance of any of our product candidates for which we may receive approval and could have a negative effect on our future revenue and operating results. We cannot be certain that our product candidates will be considered cost-effective. If we are unable to obtain coverage and adequate payment levels for our product candidates from third-party payors, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer them and patients may decline to purchase them. This in turn could affect our ability to successfully commercialize our products and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.
Foreign Regulation
In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product,

we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Several other types of state and federal laws restrict certain marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry. These laws, which generally will not be applicable to us or our product candidates unless and until we obtain FDA marketing approval for any of our product candidates, include state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, physician payment, sunshine, patient protection and affordable care, privacy and security laws and regulations regarding providing drug samples. . In addition, there have been a number of substantial legislative and regulatory changes to the way healthcare is financed and paid for by both governmental and private insurers, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”). There has been, and continues to be, significant developments in, and continued legislative activity around the ACA and related laws, which could result in the repeal or repeal and replacement of all or certain elements of the ACA.
We may in the future be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 (“FCPA”). The FCPA and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits and other legal or equitable sanctions.
Other Laws
In addition to the above, we are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of The NASDAQ Stock Exchange, on which our shares are traded. We are also subject to various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals.
