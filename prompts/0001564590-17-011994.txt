ITEM 1. BUSINESS
GENERAL
 Toyota Motor Credit Corporation was incorporated in California in 1982 and commenced operations in 1983.  References herein to “TMCC” denote Toyota Motor Credit Corporation, and references herein to “we”, “our”, and “us” denote Toyota Motor Credit Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.  We are wholly-owned by Toyota Financial Services International Corporation (“TFSIC”), a California corporation, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toyota Financial Services Corporation (“TFSC”), a Japanese corporation.  Prior to July 1, 2016, TFSIC was known as Toyota Financial Services Americas Corporation.  TFSC, in turn, is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation (“TMC”), a Japanese corporation.  TFSC manages TMC’s worldwide financial services operations.  TMCC is marketed under the brands of Toyota Financial Services and Lexus Financial Services.
 We provide a variety of finance and insurance products to authorized Toyota and Lexus dealers or dealer groups and, to a lesser extent, other domestic and import franchise dealers (collectively referred to as “dealers”) and their customers in the United States of America (excluding Hawaii) (the “U.S.”) and Puerto Rico.  Our products fall primarily into the following categories:
  
• | Finance - We acquire retail installment sales contracts from dealers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico (“retail contracts”) and leasing contracts accounted for as operating leases (“lease contracts”) from dealers in the U.S. We collectively refer to our retail and lease contracts as the “consumer portfolio”. We also provide dealer financing, including wholesale financing, working capital loans, revolving lines of credit and real estate financing to dealers in the U.S. and Puerto Rico. We collectively refer to our dealer financing portfolio as the “dealer portfolio”.

• | Insurance - Through Toyota Motor Insurance Services, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, and its insurance company subsidiaries (collectively referred to as “TMIS”), we provide marketing, underwriting, and claims administration for products that cover certain risks of dealers and their customers in the U.S. We also provide coverage and related administrative services to certain of our affiliates in the U.S. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We support growth in earning assets through funding obtained primarily in the global capital markets as well as funds provided by investing and operating activities.  Refer to Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a discussion of our funding activities.
 We primarily acquire retail contracts, lease contracts, and insurance service contracts from dealers through 29 dealer sales and services offices (“DSSOs”) which are supported by three regional management offices and service the contracts through three regional customer service centers (“CSCs”) located throughout the U.S.  The DSSOs primarily support the dealers by providing services such as acquiring retail and lease contracts, financing inventories, and financing other dealer activities and requirements such as business acquisitions, facilities refurbishment, real estate purchases, and working capital requirements. The DSSOs also provide support for our insurance products sold in the U.S. The CSCs support customer account servicing functions such as collections, lease terminations, and administration of both retail and lease contract customer accounts. The Central region CSC also supports insurance operations by providing agreement and claims administrative services.
 On October 1, 2015, we sold certain assets and liabilities related to our industrial equipment retail, lease and dealer portfolios (hereinafter the “commercial finance business”).  Refer to Note 1 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.  In addition, vehicles previously manufactured under the Scion brand were transitioned to the Toyota brand in August 2016.

Therefore, we encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our company to review the information we post on the investor relations section of our website and the Toyota Motor Credit Corporation Twitter feed (http://www.twitter.com/toyotafinancial).  Any changes to the social media channels we use for this purpose will be posted on the investor relations section of our corporate website. We are not incorporating any of the information set forth on our website or on social media channels into this filing on Form 10-K.
Seasonality
 Revenues generated by our retail and lease contracts are generally not subject to seasonal variations.  Financing volume is subject to a certain degree of seasonality.  This seasonality does not have a significant impact on revenues as collections, generally in the form of fixed payments, occur over the course of several years.  We are subject to seasonal variations in credit losses, which are historically higher in the first and fourth calendar quarters of the year.
Geographic Distribution of Operations
 As of March 31, 2017, approximately 22 percent of retail and lease contracts were concentrated in California, 11 percent in Texas, 8 percent in New York and 5 percent in New Jersey.  As of March 31, 2017, approximately 26 percent of insurance policies and contracts were concentrated in California, 7 percent in New York and 5 percent in New Jersey.  Any material adverse changes to the economies or applicable laws in these states could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Retail and Lease Financing
 Pricing
 We utilize a tiered pricing program for retail and lease contracts.  The program matches contract interest rates with customer risk as defined by credit bureau scores and other factors for a range of price and risk combinations. Each application is assigned a credit tier. Rates vary based on credit tier, term, loan-to-value and collateral, including whether a new or used vehicle is financed. In addition, special rates may apply as a result of promotional activities.  We review and adjust interest rates based on competitive and economic factors and distribute the rates, by tier, to our dealers.
Underwriting
 We acquire new and used retail and lease contracts primarily from Toyota and Lexus dealers.  Dealers transmit customer credit applications electronically through our online system for contract acquisition.  The customer may submit a credit application directly to our website, in which case, the credit application is sent to the dealer of the customer’s choice or to a dealer that is near the customer’s residence.  In addition, through our website, customers are able to request a pre-qualification letter for presentation to the dealer specifying the maximum amount that may be financed.  Upon receipt of the credit application, our loan origination system automatically requests a credit bureau report from one of the major credit bureaus.  We use a proprietary credit scoring system to evaluate an applicant’s risk profile.  Factors used by the credit scoring system (based on the applicant’s credit history) include the terms of the contract, ability to pay, debt ratios, amount financed relative to the value of the vehicle, and credit bureau attributes such as number of trade lines, utilization ratio and number of credit inquiries.
 Credit applications are subject to systematic evaluation.  Our loan origination system evaluates each application to determine if it qualifies for automatic approval or decline without manual intervention (“auto-decisioning”) using specific requirements.  Based on the internal credit score and other application characteristics, a decision is made whether to automatically approve or decline the application.  Typically, the highest quality credit applications are approved automatically and the lowest quality credit applications are automatically declined.
 Credit analysts (located at the DSSOs) approve or decline all credit applications that are not auto-decisioned, and may also approve an application that has been the subject of an automated decline.  Failure to be automatically approved through auto-decisioning does not mean that an application does not meet our underwriting guidelines.  A credit analyst decisions applications based on an evaluation that considers an applicant’s creditworthiness and projected ability to meet the monthly payment obligation, which is derived, among other things, from the amount financed and the term.  A credit analyst will verify information contained in the credit application if the application presents an elevated level of credit risk.  At any time during the credit decisioning process, the credit analyst may elect to counter, or condition, the offer to extend credit.  Our proprietary scoring system assists the credit analyst in the credit review process.
 Completion of the financing process is dependent upon whether the transaction is a retail or lease contract.  For a retail contract, we acquire the retail contract from the dealer and obtain a security interest in the vehicle.  For a lease contract, except as described below under “Servicing”, we acquire the lease contract and concurrently assume ownership of the leased vehicle.

We regularly review and analyze our consumer portfolio to evaluate the effectiveness of our underwriting guidelines and purchasing criteria.  If external economic factors, credit losses or delinquency experience, market conditions or other factors change, we may adjust our underwriting guidelines and purchasing criteria in order to change the asset quality of our portfolio.
 Subvention and Incentive Programs
 In partnership with Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. (“TMS”) and other third party distributors, we may offer special promotional rates, which we refer to as subvention programs.  TMS is the primary distributor of Toyota and Lexus vehicles in the United States.  TMS pays us the majority of the difference between our standard rate and the promotional rate.  Amounts received in connection with these programs allow us to maintain yields at levels consistent with standard program levels.  The level of subvention program activity varies based on the marketing strategies of TMS, economic conditions, and volume of new and used vehicle sales.  The amount of subvention received varies based on the mix of Toyota and Lexus vehicles included in the promotional rate programs and the timing of the programs.  The majority of our retail and lease contracts is subvened.  We may also offer other cash incentive programs in partnership with TMS.  Subvention and other cash incentive program payments are settled at the beginning of the retail or lease contract.  We defer the payments and recognize them over the life of the contract as a yield adjustment for retail contracts and as rental income for lease contracts.  
Servicing
 Our CSCs are responsible for servicing retail and lease contracts.  A centralized department manages third party vendor relationships responsible for the bankruptcy administration and post charge-off recovery and liquidation activities. 
 We use a behavioral-based collection strategy to minimize risk of loss and employ various collection methods.  When contracts are acquired, we perfect our security interests in the financed retail vehicles through the applicable state’s department of motor vehicles (or equivalent) with certificate of title filings or with a Uniform Commercial Code (“UCC”) filing, as appropriate.  We have the right to pursue collection actions against a delinquent customer, as well as repossess a vehicle if a customer fails to meet contractual obligations.
 We use an online collection and auto dialer system that prioritizes collection efforts and signals our collections personnel to make telephone contact with delinquent customers.  Collection efforts are based on behavioral scoring models (which analyze borrowers’ past payment performance, vehicle valuation and credit bureau scores to predict future payment behavior).  We generally determine whether to commence repossession efforts after an account is 80 days past due.  Repossessed vehicles are held for sale to comply with statutory requirements and then sold at private auctions, unless public auctions are required by law. Any unpaid amounts remaining after vehicle sale or after full account charge-off are pursued by us to the extent practical and legally permissible.  Any surplus amounts remaining after recovery fees, sale fees, and other expenses have been paid, and after any reserve charge-backs, dealer guarantees and optional product refunds have been credited to the customer’s account, are refunded to the customers.  Collections of post-sale deficiencies and full-skip charge-offs are handled by third party vendors. We charge-off accounts when they are uncollectable or when the account balance becomes 120 days contractually delinquent, whichever occurs first.
 We may, in accordance with our customary servicing procedures, offer rebates or waive any prepayment charge, late payment charge, or any other fees that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing retail and lease contracts.  In addition, we may defer a customer’s obligation to make a payment by extending the contract term.
 Substantially all of our retail and lease contracts are purchased as non-recourse from the dealers.  This relieves the dealers of financial responsibility in the event of a customer default.
 We may experience a higher risk of loss if customers fail to maintain required insurance coverage.  The terms of our retail contracts require customers to maintain physical damage insurance covering loss or damage to the financed vehicle in an amount not less than the full value of the vehicle.  The terms of each contract allow but do not require us to obtain any such insurance coverage on behalf of the customer.  In accordance with our customary servicing procedures, we do not exercise our right to obtain insurance coverage on behalf of the customer.  Our lease contracts require lessees to maintain minimum liability insurance and physical damage insurance covering loss or damage to the leased vehicle in an amount not less than the full value of the vehicle.  We currently do not monitor ongoing customer insurance coverage as part of our customary servicing procedures for retail or lease accounts.

Toyota Lease Trust, a Delaware business trust (the “Titling Trust”), acts as lessor and holds title to certain leased vehicles in specified states.  This arrangement was established to facilitate lease securitizations.  We service lease contracts acquired by the Titling Trust from Toyota and Lexus dealers in the same manner as lease contracts owned directly by us.  We hold an undivided trust interest in lease contracts owned by the Titling Trust, and these lease contracts are included in our lease assets.
 Remarketing
 At the end of the lease term, the lessee may purchase the leased asset at the contractual residual value or return the leased asset to the dealer.  If the leased asset is returned to the dealer, the dealer may purchase the leased asset or return it to us.  We are responsible for disposing of the leased asset if the lessee or dealer does not purchase the asset at lease maturity.
 In order to minimize losses at lease maturity, we have developed remarketing strategies to maximize proceeds and minimize disposition costs on used vehicles sold at lease termination.  We use various channels to sell vehicles returned at lease-end and repossessed vehicles, including a dealer direct program (“Dealer Direct”) and physical auctions.
 The goal of Dealer Direct is to increase dealer purchases of off-lease vehicles thereby reducing the disposition costs of such vehicles.  Through Dealer Direct, the dealer accepting return of the leased vehicle (the “grounding dealer”) has the option to purchase the vehicle at the contractual residual value, purchase the vehicle at an assessed market value, or return the vehicle to us.  Vehicles not purchased by the grounding dealer are made available to all Toyota and Lexus dealers through the Dealer Direct online auction.  Vehicles not purchased through Dealer Direct are sold at physical vehicle auction sites throughout the country.  Where deemed necessary, we recondition used vehicles prior to sale in order to enhance the vehicle values at auction.  Additionally, we redistribute vehicles geographically to minimize oversupply in any location.

Dealer Financing
 Dealer financing is comprised of wholesale financing and other financing options designed to meet dealer business needs.
 Wholesale Financing
 We provide wholesale financing to dealers for inventories of new and used Toyota, Lexus and other domestic and import vehicles.  We acquire a security interest in the vehicle inventory, and/or other dealership assets, as appropriate, which we perfect through UCC filings. Wholesale financing may also be backed by corporate or individual guarantees from, or on behalf of, affiliated dealers, dealer groups, or dealer principals.  In the event of a dealer default under a wholesale loan agreement, we have the right to liquidate assets in which we have a perfected security interest and to seek legal remedies pursuant to the wholesale loan agreement and any applicable guarantees.
 TMCC and TMS are parties to an agreement pursuant to which TMS will arrange for the repurchase of new Toyota and Lexus vehicles at the aggregate cost financed by TMCC in the event of a dealer default under wholesale financing.  In addition, we provide other types of financing to certain Toyota and Lexus dealers and other third parties, at the request of TMS or private Toyota distributors, and TMS or the applicable private distributor guarantees the payments by such borrowers.
 Other Dealer Financing
 We provide fixed and variable rate working capital loans, revolving lines of credit, and real estate financing to dealers and various multi-franchise organizations referred to as dealer groups for facilities construction and refurbishment, working capital requirements, real estate purchases, business acquisitions and other general business purposes.  These loans are typically secured with liens on real estate, vehicle inventory, and/or other dealership assets, as appropriate, and may be guaranteed by individual or corporate guarantees of affiliated dealers, dealer groups, or dealer principals.  Although the loans are typically collateralized or guaranteed, the value of the underlying collateral or guarantees may not be sufficient to cover our exposure under such agreements.  Our pricing reflects market conditions, the competitive environment, the level of support dealers provide our retail, lease and insurance business and the creditworthiness of each dealer.  
 Before establishing a wholesale loan or other dealer financing agreement, we perform a credit analysis of the dealer. During this analysis, we:
  
• | Review financial statements and we may obtain credit reports and bank references;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Evaluate the dealer’s financial condition and history of servicing debt; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assess the dealer’s operations and management.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 On the basis of this analysis, we may approve the issuance of a loan or financing agreement and determine the appropriate amount to lend.
 As part of our monitoring processes, we require all dealers to submit monthly financial statements.  We also perform periodic physical audits of vehicle inventory as well as monitor the timeliness of dealer inventory financing payoffs in accordance with the agreed-upon terms to identify possible risks.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS
 TMCC markets its insurance products through TMIS. The principal activities of TMIS include marketing, underwriting, and claims administration for products that cover certain risks of Toyota, Lexus and other domestic and import franchise dealers and their customers in the U.S.  TMIS also provides other coverage and related administrative services to certain of our affiliates in the U.S.
 Gross revenues from insurance operations on a consolidated basis comprised 8 percent of total gross revenues for fiscal 2017, 7 percent for fiscal 2016 and 8 percent for fiscal 2015.
 Products and Services
 TMIS offers various products and services on Toyota, Lexus and other domestic and import vehicles, such as vehicle service agreements, guaranteed auto protection agreements, prepaid maintenance contracts, excess wear and use agreements, and tire and wheel protection agreements.  Vehicle service agreements offer vehicle owners and lessees mechanical breakdown protection for new and used vehicles secondary to the manufacturer’s new vehicle warranty.  Guaranteed auto protection insurance and debt cancellation agreements provide coverage for a lease or retail contract deficiency balance in the event of a total loss or theft of the covered vehicle.  Prepaid maintenance contracts provide maintenance services at manufacturer recommended intervals.  Excess wear and use agreements are available on leases of Toyota and Lexus vehicles and protect against excess wear and use charges that may be assessed at lease termination. Tire and wheel protection agreements provide coverage in the event that a covered vehicle’s tires or wheels become damaged as a result of a road hazard or structural failure due to a defect in material or workmanship, to the extent not covered by the manufacturer or the tire distributor warranties.
 Toyota, Lexus and other domestic and import dealers who elect to participate in the inventory insurance program obtain coverage for eligible vehicle inventory through a third party who cedes 100 percent of the business to TMIS.  TMIS continues to purchase third party reinsurance covering the excess of certain dollar maximums per occurrence and in the aggregate.  Through reinsurance, TMIS limits its exposure to losses by obtaining the right to reimbursement from the assuming company for the reinsured portion of losses. 
 TMIS provides TMS contractual indemnity coverage for limited warranties on certified Toyota and Lexus pre-owned vehicles.  TMIS also provides umbrella liability insurance to TMS and other affiliates covering certain dollar value layers of risk above various primary or self-insured retentions.  On all layers in which TMIS provides coverage, 99 percent of the risk is ceded to various reinsurers.  In addition, until April 30, 2016, TMIS provided property deductible reimbursement insurance to TMS and other affiliates covering losses incurred under their primary policy.

RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFFILIATES
 Our business is substantially dependent upon the sale of Toyota and Lexus vehicles and our ability to offer competitive financing and insurance products in the U.S.  TMS is the primary distributor of Toyota and Lexus vehicles in the U.S. and a subsidiary of Toyota Motor North America, Inc. (“TMNA”).  Automobiles and light-duty trucks sold by TMS totaled 2.4 million units for fiscal 2017 compared to 2.5 million units for fiscal 2016 and 2.4 million units for fiscal 2015.  Toyota and Lexus vehicles accounted for approximately 14 percent of all automobile and light-duty truck unit sales volume in the U.S. during both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, compared to 15 percent during fiscal 2015.
 TMS sponsors subvention and other cash incentive programs on certain new and used Toyota and Lexus vehicles.  The level of subvention and incentive program activity varies based on TMS marketing strategies, economic conditions, and volume of vehicle sales.
TMCC and TMS are parties to an agreement pursuant to which TMS will arrange for the repurchase of new Toyota and Lexus vehicles at the aggregate cost financed by TMCC in the event of a dealer default under wholesale financing.  In addition, we provide other types of financing to certain Toyota and Lexus dealers and other third parties, at the request of TMS or private Toyota distributors, and TMS or the applicable private distributor guarantees the payments by such borrowers.
 In connection with TMC’s planned consolidation of its three North American headquarters for manufacturing, sales and marketing, and finance operations to a single new headquarters facility in Plano, Texas, certain shared services as well as the sponsorship of the Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., Inc. Pension Plan (the “Pension Plan”) were transferred from TMS to TMNA in fiscal 2017.
 TMS and TMNA provide shared services to TMCC, including certain technological and administrative services, such as information systems support, facilities, insurance coverage, and corporate services.  
 Prior to January 1, 2015, our employees were generally eligible to participate in the Pension Plan.  Effective January 1, 2015, the Pension Plan was closed to employees first employed or reemployed on or after such date.  In addition, employees meeting certain eligibility requirements may participate in the Toyota Motor North America, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan (the “Savings Plan”).  Certain employees hired on or after January 1, 2015, may be eligible to receive an additional Company contribution to the Savings Plan calculated based on their age and compensation. Various health, life and other post-retirement benefits are offered and sponsored by TMNA, as discussed further in Note 12 – Pension and Other Benefit Plans of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
 TMCC and Toyota Financial Savings Bank (“TFSB”), a Nevada thrift company owned by TFSIC, are parties to a master shared services agreement under which TMCC and TFSB provide certain services to each other.  TMCC and TFSB are also parties to an expense reimbursement agreement, which provides that TMCC will reimburse certain expenses incurred by TFSB in connection with providing certain financial products and services to TMCC’s customers and dealers in support of TMCC’s customer loyalty strategy and programs.
 TMCC and TFSIC are parties to an expense reimbursement agreement.  Under the terms of the agreement, TMCC reimbursed certain expenses incurred by TFSIC, the parent of TMCC and TFSB, with respect to costs related to TFSB’s credit card rewards program.  TFSB sold its credit card portfolio in October 2015 and no credit card rewards program costs have been incurred after such date.
 Credit support agreements exist between TMCC and TFSC and between TFSC and TMC.  These agreements are further discussed in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, “Liquidity and Capital Resources”.
 TMIS provides administrative services and various types of coverage to TMS and other affiliates, including contractual indemnity coverage for limited warranties on TMS’ certified pre-owned vehicle program and umbrella liability insurance.  Until April 30, 2016, TMIS also provided property deductible reimbursement insurance to TMS and other affiliates.
 Refer to Note 15 – Related Party Transactions of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

COMPETITION
 We operate in a highly competitive environment and compete with other financial institutions including national and regional commercial banks, credit unions, savings and loan associations, and finance companies.  To a lesser extent, we compete with other automobile manufacturers’ affiliated finance companies that actively seek to purchase retail contracts through Toyota and Lexus dealers. We also compete with national and regional commercial banks and other automobile manufacturers’ affiliated finance companies for dealer financing.  No single competitor is dominant in the industry.  We compete primarily through service quality, our relationship with TMS, and financing rates.  We seek to provide exceptional customer service and competitive financing programs to our dealers and to their customers.  Our affiliation with TMS offers an advantage in providing financing or leasing of Toyota and Lexus vehicles.
 Competition for the principal products and services provided through our insurance operations is primarily from national and regional independent service contract providers.  We compete primarily through service quality, our relationship with TMS and product benefits.  Our affiliation with TMS provides an advantage in selling our insurance products and services.
 REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT
 Our finance and insurance operations are regulated under both federal and state law. 
 Federal Consumer Finance Regulation
 Our finance operations are governed by, among other federal laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth in Lending Act, the Truth in Leasing Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act and the consumer data privacy and security provisions of the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act.  The Equal Credit Opportunity Act is designed to prevent credit discrimination on the basis of certain protected classes, requires the distribution of specified credit decision notices and limits the information that may be requested and considered in a credit transaction.  The Truth in Lending Act and the Truth in Leasing Act place disclosure and substantive transaction restrictions on consumer credit and leasing transactions.  The Fair Credit Reporting Act imposes restrictions and requirements regarding our use and sharing of credit reports, the reporting of data to credit reporting agencies, credit decision notices, the accuracy and integrity of information reported to the credit reporting agencies, consumer dispute handling procedures and identity theft prevention requirements.  The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act requires us, in most circumstances, to reduce the interest rate charged to customers who have subsequently joined, enlisted, been inducted or called to active military duty, and also requires us to allow eligible servicemembers to early terminate their lease agreements with us without penalty.  Federal privacy and data security laws place restrictions on our use and sharing of consumer data, impose privacy notice requirements, give consumers the right to opt out of certain uses and sharing of their data and impose safeguarding rules regarding the maintenance, storage, transmission and destruction of consumer data.  In addition, the dealers who originate our retail and lease contracts also must comply with federal credit and trade practice statutes and regulations.  Failure of the dealers to comply with these statutes and regulations could result in remedies that could have an adverse effect on us. 
 The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) and its implementing regulations have broad implications for the consumer financial services industry. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), which was created by the Dodd-Frank Act, has broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority over entities offering consumer financial services or products, including non-bank companies, such as TMCC (“Covered Entities”). 
 In this capacity, the CFPB can examine Covered Entities for compliance with consumer financial protection laws and has authority to order remediation of violations in a number of ways, including imposing civil monetary penalties and requiring Covered Entities to provide customer restitution and to improve their compliance management systems. We are subject to the CFPB’s supervisory authority, which allows the CFPB to conduct comprehensive and rigorous examinations to assess compliance with consumer financial protection laws.  These examinations could result in enforcement actions, regulatory fines and mandated changes to our business products, policies and procedures.
 In February 2016, the CFPB published a list of nine policy priorities it intends to focus its resources on over the next two years.  These priorities include, among others, initiation of the rulemaking process regarding debt collection practices that would apply to third-party collectors and first-party collectors, such as ourselves, and continued examination and investigation of, and potential rulemaking regarding, consumer credit reporting practices.  The timing and impact of these anticipated rules on our business remain uncertain.
 
11


In addition, the CFPB has increased scrutiny of the sale of certain ancillary or add-on products, including products similar to those we finance or sell through TMIS.  The CFPB has questioned such products’ value and how such products are marketed and sold.
 The CFPB also has enforcement authority under which it is authorized to conduct investigations (which may include a joint investigation with other agencies and regulators) and initiate enforcement actions for violations of federal consumer financial protection laws. The CFPB has the authority to obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution or rescission of contracts, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief), or other forms of remediation, and/or impose monetary penalties.  The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) have become more active in investigating the products, services and operations of credit providers, including banks and other finance companies engaged in auto finance activities.  Both the CFPB and FTC announced various enforcement actions against lenders in the past few years involving significant penalties, consent orders, cease and desist orders and similar remedies that, if applicable to us and the products, services and operations we offer, may require us to cease or alter certain business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.  We expect the CFPB’s investigation of, and initiation of enforcement actions against, credit providers, whether on its own initiative or jointly with other agencies and regulators, may continue for the foreseeable future.  
 CFPB supervision and enforcement actions, if any, may result in monetary penalties, increase our compliance costs, require changes in our business practices, affect our competitiveness, impair our profitability, harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business.
 The CFPB has focused on the area of auto finance, particularly with respect to indirect financing arrangements, dealer compensation and fair lending compliance.  In March 2013, the CFPB issued a bulletin stating that indirect auto lenders may be liable for violations under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act based on dealer-specific and portfolio-wide disparities on a prohibited basis.  According to the bulletin, these disparities result from allowing dealers to mark up the interest rate offered by the indirect auto lenders to the contract rate offered to consumers by the dealers.  In addition, the bulletin outlined steps that indirect auto lenders should take in order to comply with fair lending laws regarding dealer markup and compensation policies.
 As previously disclosed, on February 2, 2016, we reached a settlement with the CFPB and the United States Department of Justice (collectively, the “Agencies”) related to the Agencies’ previously disclosed investigation of, and allegations regarding, our discretionary dealer compensation practices. We entered into a consent order with each of the Agencies to reflect this settlement. Pursuant to the consent orders, we implemented a new dealer compensation policy on August 1, 2016, which includes, among other things, decreased limits on dealer participation caps of 125 basis points (1.25 percent) for contracts with terms of 60 months or less and 100 basis points (1.00 percent) for contracts with longer terms. In connection with the implementation of such policy, we agreed to maintain general compliance management systems reasonably designed to assure compliance with all relevant federal consumer financial laws.  Additionally, we agreed to pay an amount in consumer restitution that is not material to our financial condition or results of operations and within the amount we had previously recorded as a loss contingency.  Although there has been no material impact to date, compliance costs and the changes to our business practices required by the consent orders may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition, including our financing volume, market share, financing margins, and net earning assets.  
 State Consumer Finance Regulation
 A majority of states (and Puerto Rico) have enacted legislation establishing licensing requirements to conduct financing activities. We must renew these licenses periodically.  Most states also impose limits on the maximum rate of finance charges.  In certain states, the margin between the present statutory maximum interest rates and borrowing costs is sufficiently narrow that, in periods of rapidly increasing or high interest rates, there could be an adverse effect on our operations in these states if we were unable to pass on increased interest costs to our customers.  Some state laws impose rate and other restrictions on credit transactions with customers in active military status in addition to those imposed by the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act.
 State laws also impose requirements and restrictions on us with respect to, among other matters, required credit application and finance and lease disclosures, late fees and other charges, the right to repossess a vehicle for failure to pay or other defaults under the retail or lease contract, other rights and remedies we may exercise in the event of a default under the retail or lease contract, privacy matters, and other consumer protection matters.

Our insurance operations are subject to state insurance regulations and licensing requirements.  State laws vary with respect to which products are regulated and what types of corporate licenses and filings are required to offer certain products and services.  Certain products offered by TMIS are covered by state privacy laws.  Insurance company subsidiaries must be appropriately licensed in certain states in which they conduct business, must maintain minimum capital requirements and file annual financial information as determined by their state of domicile and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.  Failure to comply with these requirements could have an adverse effect on insurance operations in a particular state.  We actively monitor applicable laws and regulations in each state in order to maintain compliance.
 Recently, state regulators are taking a more stringent approach to supervising and regulating providers of financial products and services subject to their jurisdiction.  We expect to continue to face greater supervisory scrutiny and enhanced supervisory requirements in the foreseeable future.  We have received a request for documents and information from the New York State Department of Financial Services relating to our lending practices (including fair lending), and a request for documents and information pursuant to a civil investigative demand from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General relating to our financing of guaranteed auto protection (“GAP”) insurance products on retail contracts.  We are cooperating with these requests, but are unable to predict their outcome given their preliminary status.
 Other Federal and International Regulation
 The Dodd-Frank Act also established the Financial Stability Oversight Council (the “FSOC”), which may designate non-bank financial companies that pose systemic risk to the United States financial system (“SIFIs”) to be supervised by the Federal Reserve.  The Federal Reserve is required to establish and apply enhanced prudential standards to SIFIs, including capital, liquidity, counterparty exposure, resolution plan and overall risk management standards.  The FSOC uses a multi-stage review process to evaluate non-bank financial companies for potential designation and supervision by the Federal Reserve.  If we were designated for supervision after this multi-stage review process and any available appeal processes, we could experience increased compliance costs, the need to change our business practices, impairments to our profitability and competitiveness and other adverse effects on our business.
 In addition to the FSOC process, certain parallel regulatory efforts are underway on an international level.  The Financial Stability Board (“FSB”) – an international standard-setting authority – has proposed a methodology for assessing and designating non-bank non-insurer global-SIFIs (“G-SIFIs”).  It is not yet clear when this framework will be finalized, what form a final framework may take, what policy measures will be recommended to apply to G-SIFIs, and whether TMCC or any of its affiliates would be designated and subject to additional regulatory requirements due to any potential G-SIFI designation.
 In addition, certain financial companies with $50 billion or more in assets, which could include us, and FSOC-designated SIFIs are potentially subject to assessments under the new Orderly Liquidation Authority (“OLA”), which provides the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) with authority to resolve large, complex financial companies outside of the normal bankruptcy process.  Should a resolution under OLA occur and the proceeds from liquidation are not able to fully cover the costs of resolution, the FDIC is required to impose assessments in accordance with factors specified in the Dodd-Frank Act.  Therefore, the amount of any assessment that might result cannot currently be determined.  
 Under the Volcker Rule companies affiliated with United States insured depository institutions are generally prohibited from engaging in “proprietary trading” and certain transactions with certain privately offered funds.  The activities prohibited by the Volcker Rule are not core activities for us. Accordingly, we do not believe the Volcker Rule and its implementing regulations are likely to have a material effect on our business or operations.  In the future, however, the federal financial regulatory agencies charged with implementing the Volcker Rule could change their approach to administering, enforcing or interpreting the rule, which could negatively affect us and potentially require us to limit or change our activities or operations.
 The Dodd-Frank Act also established a new framework for the regulation of certain over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives referred to as swaps.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) is required to adopt certain rules and regulations governing swaps.  The CFTC has completed the majority of its regulations in this area, most of which are in effect.

The OTC derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act impose clearing, trading and margin requirements on certain contracts.  At present, we qualify for exceptions from these requirements for the swaps that we enter into to hedge our commercial risks.  However, if we were to fail to qualify for such exceptions, we could become subject to some or all of these requirements, which would increase our cost of entering into and maintaining such hedging positions.  Moreover, the application of the clearing, trading and margin requirements, and other related regulations, to our dealer counterparties may change the cost and availability of the OTC derivatives that we use for hedging.  Certain other requirements, such as reporting and recordkeeping, also apply to such instruments, but are not expected to have a material impact on us.
 The full impact of the OTC derivatives provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and related regulatory requirements upon our business will not be known until the regulations are fully implemented and the market for derivatives contracts has adjusted. The Dodd-Frank Act and regulations could significantly increase the cost of OTC derivative contracts, materially alter the terms of OTC derivative contracts, reduce the availability of OTC derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, or reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing OTC derivative contracts. If we reduce our use of OTC derivatives as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and resulting regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable, which could adversely affect our ability to plan for and fund capital expenditures.
 We continually review our operations for compliance with applicable laws.  Future administrative rulings, judicial decisions, legislation, regulations and regulatory guidance, and supervision and enforcement actions may result in monetary penalties, increase our compliance costs, require changes in our business practices, affect our competitiveness, impair our profitability, harm our reputation or otherwise adversely affect our business. 
 Refer to “Part 1, Item 1A. Risk Factors – The regulatory environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”
