ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General
Core Laboratories N.V. is a Netherlands limited liability company. We were established in 1936 and are one of the world's leading providers of proprietary and patented reservoir description, production enhancement and reservoir management services to the oil and gas industry. These services and products are directed toward enabling our clients to improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery from their producing fields. We have over 70 offices in more than 50 countries and have approximately 4,400 employees.
References to "Core Lab", the "Company", "we", "our", and similar phrases are used throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this "Form 10-K") and relate collectively to Core Laboratories N.V. and its consolidated affiliates.
Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to provide advanced technologies that improve reservoir performance by (i) continuing the development of proprietary technologies through client-driven research and development, (ii) expanding the services and products offered throughout our global network of offices and (iii) acquiring complementary technologies that add key technologies or market presence and enhance existing services and products.
Development of New Technologies, Services and Products
We conduct research and development to meet the needs of our clients who are continually seeking new services and technologies to lower their costs of finding, developing and producing oil and gas. While the aggregate number of wells being drilled per year has fluctuated relative to market conditions, oil and gas producers have, on a proportional basis, increased expenditures on technology services to improve their understanding of the reservoir and increase production of oil and gas from their producing fields. We intend to continue concentrating our efforts on services and technologies that improve reservoir performance and increase oil and gas recovery.
International Expansion of Services and Products
Another component of our business strategy is to broaden the spectrum of services and products offered to our clients on a global basis. We intend to continue using our worldwide network of offices to offer many of our services and products that have been developed internally or obtained through acquisitions. This allows us to enhance our revenue through efficient utilization of our worldwide network.
Acquisitions
We continually review potential acquisitions to add key services and technologies, enhance market presence or complement existing businesses.
More information relating to any significant acquisitions is included in Note 3 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV of this Form 10-K ("Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements").
Operations
We derive our revenue from services and product sales to clients primarily in the oil and gas industry.
We operate our business in three reportable segments. These complementary segments provide different services and products and utilize different technologies for improving reservoir performance and increasing oil and gas recovery from new and existing fields. Disclosure relating to the operations and financial information of these business segments is included in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.

We provide integrated diagnostic services to evaluate the effectiveness of well completions and to develop solutions aimed at increasing the effectiveness of enhanced oil recovery projects.


• | Reservoir Management: Combines and integrates information from reservoir description and production enhancement services to increase production and improve recovery of oil and gas from our clients' reservoirs.

We offer our services worldwide through our global network of offices. Services accounted for approximately 79%, 77% and 72% of our revenue from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
We manufacture products primarily in four facilities for distribution on a global basis. Product sales accounted for approximately 21%, 23% and 28% of our revenue from operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
Our product sales backlog at December 31, 2016 was approximately $6.8 million compared to $10.2 million at December 31, 2015. Sources of raw materials for our products are readily available and we expect that our current sales backlog at December 31, 2016 will be completed in 2017.
Reservoir Description
Commercial oil and gas fields consist of porous and permeable reservoir rocks that contain natural gas, crude oil and water. Due to the density differences of the fluids, natural gas typically caps the field and overlies an oil layer, which overlies the water. We provide services that characterize the porous reservoir rock and all three reservoir fluids. Services relating to these fluids include determining quality and measuring quantity of the fluids and their derived products. This includes determining the value of different crude oil and natural gases by analyzing the individual components of complex hydrocarbons. We measure these hydrocarbons at reservoir conditions to determine the changes in their physical properties with changing pressure and temperature.
We analyze samples of reservoir rocks for their porosity, which determines reservoir storage capacity, and for their permeability, which defines the ability of the fluids to flow through the rock. These measurements are used to determine how much oil and gas are present in a reservoir and the rates at which the oil and gas can be produced. We also use our proprietary services and technologies to correlate the reservoir description data to wireline logs and seismic data by determining the different acoustic velocities of reservoir rocks containing water, oil and natural gas. 
The combined use of both the reservoir rock and fluid data are invaluable to oil companies to determine the most efficient method by which to recover, process, and refine these hydrocarbons to produce the maximum value added to crude oil and natural gas fields. Early evaluations and key decisions about well performance and viability are important for optimizing a reservoir. This is accomplished using our Digital Rock Characteristics (DRC) services which include (1) Dual Energy CT which is a non-destructive petrophysical evaluation technique to provide early time insight of reservoir lithology and reservoir quality; and (2) Micro CT which is a high resolution pore imaging service that provides early time quantification of both routine and special core analysis properties.
We have developed unique analytical processes to understand the flow characteristics and saturation profiles of unconventional reservoir systems including (1) High Frequency Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) measurements to allow the T1/T2 mapping to gain understanding of movable vs. unmovable fluid saturation distribution of these complex system; and (2) Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) of shale reservoirs by evaluating the effectiveness of gas cycling in nano-pore structures to significantly increase long-term production rates and volumes.
The Iron CorehandTM is a unit designed to handle and move core in the field to eliminate the inherent risk of back injury and dropped core. The unit is self-contained and designed to fit in the limited spaces available on offshore rigs. The system ensures proper handling of core material in the field and protecting staff from serious injuries.
Core Lab holds various patents, trade secrets, and proprietary designs for laboratory equipment required to analyze reservoir rocks as well as the properties and phase behavior of reservoir fluids. We manufacture a wide range of ambient and reservoir condition rock and fluid analysis laboratory equipment for our own use throughout our international laboratory network. Among these devices are complex, high-pressure, high temperature, reservoir condition, multi-phase flow systems and full visualization PVT cells, along with the ancillary equipment required to support these laboratory programs. We also sell equipment of this type to universities, government institutes, and client company research labs.

Whilst recognizing the need to optimize the logistical chain of our clients, from producing well to retail sales of petroleum products, a state-of-the-art IT platform CONNECT: has been launched to efficiently acquire our field data, laboratory analysis and any other other observations relevant to our client base. The system is designed in such a way that there is only single data entry, and that data can be used for further analysis and more importantly be shared with our clients by process flow dashboards, with key performance indicators. But also by sharing real-time data on mobile devices, enabling our clients to make quick decisions.
This new methodology of sharing data has been embraced by an increasing number of clients, as it has not only saved them costs, but more importantly, the data can be used for trend analysis in many ways such as the ability to forecast bottlenecks, thus eliminating waste and increasing efficiency.
Two experience centers have been set up, both in the U.S. and Europe, where our clients can get acquainted with optimizing the flow of business as well as our advanced systems for data analysis. All initiatives are meant to increase efficiency and add value to our client base.
Production Enhancement
We provide diagnostic services and products to help optimize completion and reservoir operations and field development strategies in order to increase recoverable reserves in the most efficient way. Two production enhancement methods commonly used are (i) hydraulic fracturing of the reservoir rock to improve flow and (ii) flooding a reservoir with water, carbon dioxide, nitrogen or hydrocarbon gases to force more oil and gas to the wellbore. Many oilfields today are hydraulically fractured and/or flooded to maximize oil and gas recovery. Although Core Laboratories is not a hydraulic fracturing company, we do provide services that are used by others to develop and optimize hydraulic fracturing and field flood projects and to evaluate the success of those projects. Our services and technologies play a key role in the success of both methods.
The hydraulic fracturing of a producing formation is achieved by pumping a fluid slurry containing a proppant material into the reservoir zone at extremely high pressures. This fractures the rock and the proppant material "props" or holds the fractures open after the pressure pumping is complete so that reservoir fluids can flow to the production wellbore. Our data on rock type and strength are critical for determining the proper design of the hydraulic fracturing job. In addition, our testing indicates whether the fluid slurry is compatible with the reservoir rock so that damage does not occur that would restrict production. We also provide testing of various propping agents and software to help pick the best proppant based on net present value calculations of client investments. Our proprietary and patented ZERO WASH® tracer technology is used to determine that the proppant material was properly placed in the fracture to ensure effective flow and increased recovery.
SPECTRACHEM® is another proprietary and patented technology developed for optimizing hydraulic fracture performance. SPECTRACHEM® is used to aid operators in determining the efficiency of the fracture fluids used. SPECTRACHEM® tracers allow operators to evaluate the quantity of fracture fluid that returns to the wellbore during the clean-up period after a hydraulic fracturing event. This technology also allows our clients to evaluate load recovery, gas breakthrough, fluid leak-off and breaker efficiency, all of which are important factors for optimizing oil and/or natural gas production after the formation is hydraulically fractured. 
Core's patented and proprietary SPECTRACHEM® fracture diagnostic service continued to evolve with the introduction of the SPECTRACHEM®Plus service in early 2009. The SPECTRACHEM®Plus service is effective in determining the effectiveness and efficiency of the hydraulic fracture stimulation of long multi-stage horizontal wells in oil- and gas-shale plays throughout North America and with growing demand internationally as unconventional resource plays are developed globally. SPECTRACHEM®Plus data sets are used to determine how each frac stage is flowing. Frac stages with ineffective flows may warrant further stimulation, remedial actions and guide improvements on future frac designs.
Our unique completion monitoring system, COMPLETION PROFILER™, helps to determine flow rates from reservoir zones after they have been hydraulically fractured. This provides our clients with a baseline of early production information and can be compared to subsequent production logs later in the life of the well to see if and where hydrocarbon production varies.
Our FLOWPROFILERTM service, a proprietary hydrocarbon-based tracer technology, which is a further development of our patented SPECTRACHEM® technology and has been in use for more than five years, quantifies the hydrocarbon production from discrete segments in multi-stage horizontal well completions and stimulations in unconventional tight-oil or gas plays. We have tracers used for oil reservoirs which are different from our tracers used for gas reservoirs. FLOWPROFILERTM technology and the analytical methodology for identifying the hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are the protected intellectual property of Core Lab.

FLOWPROFILERTM technology employs a unique hydrocarbon-soluble tracer and water-soluble tracer introduced into specific and isolated stages via the stimulating proppant stream. The hydrocarbon-soluble tracers are absorbed by the crude oil or gas associated with each stage while the water-soluble tracer remains in the stimulation fluid. When the well is flowed, crude oil or gas and water samples are collected and analyzed in the laboratory to identify and quantify oil or gas flows from each stage and the cleanup of the stimulation fluid. Stages not at optimum flow rates can be identified, precipitating remedial efforts to increase flow and recovery rates, and to provide valuable insight for future wells. This service, which we first used more than five years ago, is being used to monitor offset well interference by sampling offset well oil or gas and water production. The amount of tracer detected in offset wells is being used to help our clients optimize both lateral and vertical well spacing and the amount of fracturing fluids for each stage.
We conduct dynamic flow tests of the reservoir fluids through the reservoir rock, at actual reservoir pressure and temperature, to realistically simulate the actual flooding of a producing zone. We use patented technologies, such as our Saturation Monitoring by the Attenuation of X-rays (SMAX™), to help design the enhanced recovery project. After a field flood is initiated, we are often involved in monitoring the progress of the flood to ensure the maximum amount of incremental production is being achieved through the use of our SPECTRAFLOODTM technology, which we developed to optimize sweep efficiency during field floods.
Our PACKSCAN® patented technology is used as a tool to evaluate gravel pack effectiveness in an unconsolidated reservoir. PACKSCAN® measures the density changes in the area around the tool and is designed to observe the changes within the gravel pack annulus to verify the completeness of the gravel pack protection of the wellbore without any additional rig time.
In addition to Core's many patented reservoir analysis technologies, Production Enhancement has established itself as a global leader in the manufacture and distribution of high-performance perforating products. Core's unique understanding of complex reservoirs supports our ability to supply perforating systems engineered to maximize well productivity by reducing, eliminating and overcoming formation damage caused during the drilling and completion of oil and gas wells. This "systems" approach to the perforating of an oil or gas well has resulted in numerous patented products. 
HERO® (High Efficiency Reservoir Optimization), SUPERHERO® and SUPERHERO®Plus are examples of the patented perforating systems which quickly gained market acceptance and became industry leaders in enhancing reservoir performance. The SUPERHERO® and SUPERHERO®Plus charges evolved from HERO® charge technology and use a proprietary and patented design of powdered metal liners and explosives technology resulting in a deeper and cleaner perforating tunnel into the oil and gas reservoir. This allows greater flow of hydrocarbons to the wellbore and helps to maximize hydrocarbon recovery from the reservoir. The more recent charge development of the HERO® Hard Rock or HERO®-HR charges, resulted in Core Lab also having the deepest penetrating perforating charges on the market as certified by API testing. 
HERO®PerFRAC is the newest next generation of charges using HERO® technology. in addition to the benefits of HERO® technology, HERO®PerFRAC charges are designed specifically for optimizing fracture stimulation well completions by providing a uniform hole size which minimizes tortuosity effects in the rock during well stimulation resulting in less surface horsepower and less time which both translate into lower costs needed to initiate the fracturing operation. In addition to optimizing stimulation operations with faster, lower cost programs, the production is also enhanced by not only the better well stimulations but the improved near debris free perforation tunnels as the well fluids come back into the casing from the rock. Core's manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada continue to meet the global demand for our perforating systems through facility expansion in addition to gains in efficiency and productivity.
The HERO® line of perforating charges, HERO®PerFRAC, SUPERHERO® and SUPERHERO®Plus charges can eliminate the ineffective perforations that would otherwise limit daily oil and natural gas production and hinder the optimal fracture stimulation programs needed for prolific production from the Bakken, Eagle Ford, Marcellus, Niobrara and similar oil- and gas-shale formations.
Core's Production Enhancement team has experienced technical services personnel to support clients through our global network of offices for the everyday use of our perforating systems and the rapid introduction of new products. Our personnel are capable of providing client training and on-site services in the completion of oil and gas wells. The patented X-SPAN® and GTX-SPAN® casing patches are supported by our technical services personnel. Recent market applications in Canada's steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) environment have resulted in an upgrade in temperature ratings to as much as 600°F. These systems are capable of performing in high temperature as well as high pressure oil and gas environments and are used to seal non-productive reservoir zones from the producing wellbore.

Reservoir Management
Reservoir description and production enhancement information, when applied across an entire oilfield or formation, is used to maximize daily production and the ultimate total recovery from the reservoir. We are involved in numerous large-scale reservoir management projects, applying proprietary and state-of-the-art techniques from the earliest phases of a field development program until the last economic barrel of oil is recovered. These projects are of increasing importance to oil companies as the incremental barrel is often the lowest cost and most profitable barrel in the reservoir. Producing incremental barrels increases our clients' cash flows which we believe will result in additional capital expenditures by our clients, and ultimately further opportunities for us. 
Some of these are industry consortium projects that provide critical reservoir information to a broad spectrum of clients in a cost effective manner. Many of them examine unconventional reservoirs, particularly in the US and Canada. For example, our Permian Basin study evaluates the petrophysical, geochemical, completion and production characteristics of this very active play in West Texas. Our clients use this information, not only to improve their drilling and production activities, but also to evaluate potential acquisition and divestiture opportunities. Outside of North America we have an ongoing global shale study that examines the unconventional reservoir potential in Central and Southern Europe, North Africa, India, China and Australia, among other regions. We also have studies focused on tight sandstone reservoirs around the world and unconventional plays in the Middle East.
Apart from unconventional settings, several conventional reservoir studies are currently being conducted for the deep water Gulf of Mexico and several different plays around the offshore Atlantic margins of West Africa, South America and Canada. Onshore, we have also conducted dozens of conventional reservoir studies on every continent except Antarctica.
Another aspect of reservoir management is real-time reservoir monitoring. We engineer and manufacture permanent monitoring equipment that is installed in the reservoir for our oil and gas company clients. Our non-electronic ERDTM Pressure and Temperature sensors are characterized in the industry as having some of the highest reliability (95% in 20 years) and temperature (600° Fahrenheit) ratings. The real-time data obtained from these sensors are used by drilling engineers to make real-time decisions, production engineers to optimize production, and reservoir engineers to prove up models and obtain a clear picture of the reservoir over time. 
Marketing and Sales
We market and sell our services and products through a combination of sales representatives, technical seminars, trade shows and print advertising. Direct sales and marketing are carried out by our sales force, technical experts and operating managers, as well as by sales representatives and distributors in various markets where we do not have offices. Our Business Development group manages a Large Account Management Program to better serve our largest and most active clients by meeting with key personnel within their organizations to ensure the quality of our services and products are meeting their expectations and we are addressing any issues or needs in a timely manner.
Research and Development
The market for our services and products is characterized by changing technology and frequent product introduction. As a result, our success is dependent upon our ability to develop or acquire new services and products on a cost-effective basis and to introduce them into the marketplace in a timely manner. Many of our acquisitions have allowed us to obtain the benefits of the acquired company's research and development projects without the significant costs that would have been incurred if we had attempted to develop the services and products ourselves. We incur costs as part of internal research and development and these costs are charged to expense as incurred. We intend to continue committing financial resources and effort to the development and acquisition of new services and products. Over the years, we have made a number of technological advances, including the development of key technologies utilized in our operations. Substantially all of the new technologies have resulted from requests and guidance from our clients, particularly major oil companies.
Patents and Trademarks
We believe our patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other intellectual property rights are an important factor in maintaining our technological advantage, although no single one of these is considered essential to our success. Typically, we will seek to protect our intellectual property in all jurisdictions where we believe the cost of such protection is warranted. While we have patented some of our key technologies, we do not patent all of our proprietary technology even where regarded as patentable. We protect our intellectual property, including through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements, legal enforcement proceedings and by other means.

International Operations
We operate facilities in more than 50 countries. Our non-U.S. operations accounted for approximately 62%, 58% and 52% of our revenue from operations during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We attribute service revenue to the country in which the service was performed while we attribute product sales revenue to the country where the product was shipped as we feel this gives a clearer view of our operations. We do, however, have significant levels of revenue recorded in the U.S., where the services were performed, that are sourced from projects on non-U.S. oilfields. 
The following graphs and table summarize our reported revenue by geographic region for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

 | United States | | Europe/Africa/Middle East | Asia Pacific | | Canada | Former Soviet Union | | Latin/ South America | Consolidated
2016 | $ | 224,863 | | $ | 222,916 | | $ | 65,115 | | $ | 22,547 | $ | 35,935 | $ | 23,365 | $ | 594,741 
2015 | $ | 338,907 | | $ | 249,679 | | $ | 86,001 | | $ | 43,808 | $ | 41,450 | $ | 37,675 | $ | 797,520 
2014 | $ | 515,643 | | $ | 273,452 | | $ | 94,328 | | $ | 105,244 | $ | 49,778 | $ | 46,777 | $ | 1,085,222

While we are subject to fluctuations and changes in currency exchange rates relating to our international operations, we attempt to limit our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by limiting the amount in which our foreign contracts are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. However, the ultimate decision as to the proportion of the foreign currency component within a contract usually resides with our clients. Consequently, we are not always able to eliminate our foreign currency exposure. We have not historically engaged in and are not currently engaged in any significant currency hedging or trading transactions designed to compensate for adverse currency fluctuations. 
Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulations
We are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, both in the United States and other countries, pertaining to protection of the environment and the manner in which chemicals and gases used in our analytical and manufacturing processes are handled and generated wastes are disposed. Consistent with our quality assurance and control principles, we have established proactive environmental policies for the management of these chemicals and gases as well as the handling, recycling or disposal of wastes resulting from our operations. Compliance with these laws and regulations, whether at the federal, provincial, regional, state, local or foreign levels, may require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities, capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions and discharges, and stringent practices to handle, recycle and dispose of certain wastes. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective obligations, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of injunctive relief. 
Moreover, new, modified or stricter enforcement of environmental laws or regulations could be adopted or implemented that significantly increase our or our client's compliance costs, pollution mitigation costs, or the cost of any remediation of environmental contamination that may become necessary, and these costs could be material. For example, from time to time, legal requirements have been agreed to or proposed and adopted, in the United States that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows related to the following:
 6

*Ground-Level Ozone Standards. In October 2015, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a rule under the federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”), lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground-level ozone from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion under both the primary and secondary standards. The EPA is expected to make final geographical attainment designations and issue final non-attainment area requirements pursuant to this NAAQS rule by late 2017 and states are also expected to implement their own rules, which could be more stringent than federal requirements.
*Reduction of Methane Emissions by the Oil and Gas Industry. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds from certain new, modified, and reconstructed oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. These standards will require the use of certain equipment specific emissions control practices with respect to, among other things, hydraulically-fractured oil and natural gas well completions and fugitive emissions from well sites. Moreover, in November 2016, the EPA began seeking additional information about methane emissions from existing equipment an d process in the oil and gas sector that may be used in developing a standard addressing those sources.
*Reduction of Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) Emissions. The U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources. In the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislations, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA, and require monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain onshore and offshore production facilities and certain onshore processing, transmission and storage facilities. In December 2015, the United States joined other countries of the United Nations in preparing an agreement requiring member countries to each develop reductions in GHG emissions. This agreement, referred to as the “Paris agreement,” was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions.
*Hydraulic Fracturing. While the U.S. Congress has not adopted legislation regulating hydraulic fracturing, several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority or pursued investigations over certain aspects of the hydraulic fracturing process. For example, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and, also in June 2016, the EPA published a final rule establishing first-time standards to address emissions of methane from hydraulically-fractured oil and natural gas well completions. Additionally, the federal Bureau of Land Management published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands, which rule was struck down by a federal judge in June 2016 but that decision is currently being appealed by the federal government. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. Moreover, some states and certain local governments have adopted, or are considering adopting, legal requirements that have imposed or in the future could impose, new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities.
*Offshore Compliance. In recent years, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”), agencies under the U.S. Department of the Interior have imposed more stringent permitting procedures and regulatory safety and performance requirements for new wells to be drilled in federal waters. These agencies have pursued, implemented or enforce new rules, Notices to Lessees and Operators (“NTLs”) and even temporary drilling moratoria that imposed safety and operational performance measures on exploration, development and production operators in the Gulf of Mexico or otherwise resulted in a temporary cessation of drilling activities. For example, in April 2016, the BSEE published a final rule on well control that, among other things, imposes rigorous standards relating to the design, operation and maintenance of blow-out preventers, real-time monitoring of deep water and high temperature, high pressure drilling activities, and enhanced reporting requirements. Also in April 2016, the federal BOEM published a proposed rule that would bolster existing air-emissions requirements relating to offshore oil and natural-gas activity on federal Outer Continental Shelf waters including in the Central Gulf of Mexico by, among other things, requiring the reporting and tracking of the emissions of all pollutants defined by the EPA to affect human health and public welfare. In addition, in September 2016, the BOEM issued a Notice to Lessees and Operators that bolsters the supplemental bonding procedures followed by oil 
 7

and natural gas exploration and production operators on the federal Outer Continental Shelf waters for the decommissioning of offshore wells, platforms, pipelines, and other facilities.
Our compliance with such new or amended legal requirements that are applicable to us could result in our incurring significant additional expense and operating restrictions with respect to our operations, which may not be fully recoverable from our clients and, thus, could reduce net income. Our clients, to whom we provide our services, may similarly incur increased costs or restrictions that may limit or decrease those clients’ operations and have an indirect material adverse effect on our business.
Our analytical and manufacturing processes involve the handling and use of numerous chemicals and gases as well as the generation of wastes. Spills or releases of these chemicals, gases, and wastes at our facilities, whether by us or prior owners or operators, or at offsite locations where we transport them for recycling or disposal could subject us to environmental liability, either from the applicable government agency or private landowners or other third parties. Such liabilities could be strict, joint and several, as is applicable in the United States under such laws as the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. This could also include costs of cleaning up chemicals and wastes released into the environment and for damages to persons, properties or natural resources. As a result of such actions, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), remediate environmental contamination (including contaminated groundwater), and undertake measures to prevent future contamination. We may not be able to recover some or any of these remedial or corrective costs from insurance. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
Our operations are also subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended ("OSHA"), and comparable state laws in the United States, whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In the United States, the OSHA hazard communication standard and applicable community right-to-know regulations require that information is maintained concerning hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information is provided to employees, state and local government authorities, and citizens. Historically, our worker health and safety compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that such costs will not be material in the future or that such future compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations.
Competition
The businesses in which we engage are competitive. Some of our competitors are divisions or subsidiaries of companies that are larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have. While no one company competes with us in all of our product and service lines, we face competition in these lines, primarily from independent regional companies and internal divisions of major integrated oil and gas companies. We compete in different product and service lines to various degrees on the basis of price, technical performance, availability, quality and technical support. Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including successful and timely development of new services and products, performance and quality, client service, pricing, industry trends and general economic trends.
Reliance on the Oil and Gas Industry
Our business and operations are substantially dependent upon the condition of the global oil and gas industry. Future downturns in the oil and gas industry, or in the oilfield services business, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.
The oil and gas industry is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant economic downturns at various times as a result of numerous factors affecting the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, including the level of capital expenditures of the oil and gas industry, the level of drilling activity, the level of production activity, market prices of oil and gas, economic conditions existing in the world, interest rates and the cost of capital, environmental regulations, tax policies, political requirements of national governments, coordination by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC"), cost of producing oil and natural gas, and technological advances.
