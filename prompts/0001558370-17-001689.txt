     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     OVERVIEW
     We are Gener8 Maritime, Inc., a leading U.S.‑based provider of international seaborne crude oil transportation services, resulting from a transformative merger between General Maritime Corporation, a well‑known tanker owner, and Navig8 Crude Tankers Inc., a company sponsored by the Navig8 Group, an independent vessel pool manager. General Maritime Corporation was founded in 1997 by our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Peter Georgiopoulos, and we have been an active owner, operator and consolidator in the crude tanker sector. As of March 10, 2017, we owned a fleet of 40 tankers on the water, consisting of 24 Very Large Crude Carriers (“VLCCs”), ten Suezmax vessels, four Aframax vessels and two Panamax vessels, with an aggregate carrying capacity of 9.4 million deadweight tons, or “DWT” and one “eco” VLCC newbuilding that is being constructed at a highly reputable shipyard and is expected to be delivered during the second half of 2017. See “Our Fleet” below for a list of all our ships on the water.
     We believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from the recent expansion of our fleet through the acquisition of 21 VLCC vessels in 2014 and 2015, all of which have been delivered as of the date of this report, except for the Gener8 Nestor which is expected to be delivered during the second half of 2017. We believe that the timing of this expansion coincides with a strong outlook on the long-term rate environment. All of our recently delivered VLCC vessels are considered “eco,” incorporating many of the latest technological improvements designed to optimize speed and reduce fuel consumption and emissions. 
     Our fleet is employed worldwide. As of March 10, 2017, approximately 77% of our total fleet carrying capacity based on DWT, including newbuildings, is focused on VLCC vessels. We have seen an increase in trip length and ton‑miles in the tanker market due to shifting trade patterns and believe that VLCC vessels are uniquely positioned to benefit from such increase and provide operational benefits due to economies of scale.
     We seek to maximize long‑term cash flow, taking into account current freight rates in the market and our own views on the direction of those rates in the future. Historically our spot and charter exposures have varied as we continually evaluate our charter employment strategy and the trade‑off between shorter spot voyages and longer‑term charters. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we had approximately 91.2% of our vessel operating days exposed to the short‑term charter market, mostly via employment in pools.
     Pools generally consist of a number of vessels that may be owned by a number of different ship owners which operate as a single marketing entity in an effort to produce freight efficiencies. Pools typically employ experienced commercial charterers and operators who have close working relationships with customers and brokers, while technical management is typically the responsibility of each ship owner. We believe that pool participation optimizes various operational efficiencies including improving the potential to monetize freight spikes, greater flexibility of voyage planning and fleet positioning, and reduction of waiting times. In addition to these competitive advantages, pool participation provides us with greater access to key market dynamics and information. As of December 31, 2016, all of our VLCC, Suezmax and Aframax vessels were employed in Navig8 Group commercial crude tanker pools, which we refer to as the “Navig8 pools.”
     We maintain strong relationships with high quality customers, including Saudi Aramco, BP, Shell, S‑Oil, Exxon, Chevron, Repsol, Valero, Reliance, Petrobras and Clearlake, either directly or through pooling arrangements. We believe the substantial scale of the global tanker pools in which we participate will provide with freight optimization and cost benefits through economies of scale, as well as greater access to key market dynamics and information. Additionally, we expect the new “eco” vessels deployed in the Navig8 pools will be able to earn higher returns relative to older, non‑eco vessels that may be contributed, as fuel consumption is a significant determinant of pool earnings distributed to shipowners.
     Our New York City‑based executive management team includes executives with extensive experience in the shipping industry who have a long track record of managing the commercial, technical and financial aspects of our business.

     BUSINESS STRATEGY
     Our strategy is to leverage our competitive strengths to enhance our position within the industry and maximize long term shareholder returns. Our strategic initiatives include:
    
· | Optimize our vessel deployment to maximize shareholder returns. We seek to employ our vessels in a manner that maximizes fleet utilization and earnings upside through our chartering strategy in line with our goal of maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate. We believe our participation in the Navig8 pools provides us with unique benefits, including access to both scale and superior utilization, versus the broader market. We believe these pools allow us to capture additional opportunities as they become available. Our management actively monitors market conditions and changes in charter rates to seek to achieve optimal vessel deployment for our fleet, which may include entering our vessels into time charters when appropriate.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maintain cost efficient operations. We outsource the technical management of our fleet to experienced third party managers who have specific teams dedicated to our vessels. We believe the technical management cost at third party managers is lower than what we could achieve by performing the function in house. We seek to aggressively manage our operating and maintenance costs and quality by actively overseeing the activities of the third party technical managers and by monitoring and controlling vessel operating expenses they incur on our behalf.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Operate a young, high quality fleet and continue to safely and effectively serve our customers. We intend to maintain a high quality fleet that meets or exceeds stringent industry standards and complies with charterer
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

requirements through our technical managers’ rigorous and comprehensive maintenance programs under our active oversight. Our fleet has a strong safety and environmental record that we maintain through regular maintenance and inspection. We believe that the “eco” design of our 20 recently delivered VLCCs on the water, and our one VLCC newbuilding, as well as the extensive experience from our technical managers and our in house oversight team, will enhance our position as a preferred provider to oil major customers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Opportunistically engage in acquisitions or disposals to maximize shareholder value. Our practice is to acquire or dispose of secondhand vessels, newbuilding contracts, or shipping companies while focusing on maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate. Our executive management team has a demonstrated track record in sourcing and executing acquisitions and disposals at attractive points in the cycle and financings. We are continuously and actively monitoring the market in an effort to take advantage of growth opportunities. We believe that the demand created by changing oil trade pattern distances has been most significant in the VLCC sector as those ships have been directed largely to long haul trade routes to China. Consistent with our strategy, we purchased 21 “eco” VLCC newbuildings in 2014 and 2015, of which 18 were delivered as of December 31, 2016. Two additional VLCC newbuildings were delivered in the first quarter of 2017, and the final vessel is expected to be delivered in the second half of 2017. In 2016, we completed the sale of two VLCC vessels (the Genmar Victory and Genmar Vision), one Suezmax vessel (the Gener8 Spyridon) and one Handymax vessel (the Gener8 Consul). In the first quarter of 2017, we completed the sale of one VLCC vessel (the Gener8 Ulysses).

· | Actively manage capital structure and return capital to shareholders when appropriate. We believe that we have access to multiple financing sources, including banks and the capital markets. We leveraged our strong relationships with our lenders under the Korean Export Credit Facility and the Amended Sinosure Credit Facility to fund the construction and delivery of our VLCC newbuildings. We intend to manage our capital structure by actively monitoring our leverage level with changing market conditions and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate. For more information regarding our senior secured credit facilities, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Debt Financings.”

      VESSEL ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS
     Our practice is to acquire or dispose of secondhand vessels, newbuilding contracts, or shipping companies while focusing on maximizing shareholder value and returning capital to shareholders when appropriate. Our executive management team has a demonstrated track record in sourcing and executing acquisitions and disposals at attractive points in the cycle and financings. We are continuously and actively monitoring the market in an effort to take advantage of growth opportunities. We also evaluate opportunities to monetize our investments in vessels by selling them when conditions allow us to generate attractive returns, to adjust the profile of our fleet to fit customer demands such as preferences for modern vessels, and to generate capital for potential investments in the future.
     From 2001 to 2008, we grew from 20 vessels to 31 vessels upon the completion of our stock‑for‑stock acquisition of Arlington Tankers Ltd. in December 2008, our first acquisition of VLCCs.
     In 2010, we entered into agreements to purchase seven tankers for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $620 million, consisting of five VLCCs built between 2002 and 2010 and two Suezmax newbuildings, from subsidiaries of Metrostar Management Corporation. We completed taking delivery of these vessels in April 2011.
     In 2011, we sold three product tankers for aggregate net proceeds of $62 million and subsequently leased back each of these vessels to one of our subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Chapter 11 plan, we rejected the bareboat charters and charter guarantees related to these leasebacks effective June 2012 and July 2012. In February 2011, we also sold one Aframax vessel and one Suezmax vessel. We sold one Aframax vessel in each of March 2011, April 2011, October 2011, May 2012 and October 2012.
     In 2014, we sold one Suezmax vessel, and we sold one Aframax vessel in each of February 2014 and October 2013.

 In 2016, we sold one Suezmax vessel (the Gener8 Spyridon), two VLCC vessels (the Genmar Victory and Genmar Vision) and one Handymax (Gener8 Consul) vessel. For more information regarding our sale of the vessels, see Note 8, Delivery and Disposal of VESSELS and Note 22, SubseqUent events, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
     Our recent fleet expansion strategy has involved two acquisitions of VLCC fleets in 2014 and 2015, described in more detail below. The VLCC fleet purchased in 2014 consists of seven “eco” newbuild VLCCs originally ordered by Scorpio Tankers, Inc. or “Scorpio.” These seven newbuildings were originally ordered by Scorpio and have an aggregate contract price of $662.2 million, and we acquired them for $735.0 million (with the difference from the contract price representing an additional embedded premium paid to Scorpio). We refer to the seven newbuildings acquired from Scorpio as the “2014 acquired VLCC newbuildings.” As of March 10, 2017, all of these VLCC vessels have been delivered to us and deployed in the VL8 Pool. As of March 10, 2017, we have borrowed approximately $419.1 million under our senior secured credit facilities to fund the installment payments paid under the shipbuilding contracts for these vessels.
     Additionally, in 2015, we acquired 14 “eco” VLCCs newbuilding contracts through a merger with Navig8 Crude Tankers, Inc., which we refer to as “Navig8 Crude.” See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Related Party Transactions—2015 Merger Related Transactions” for more information regarding the merger with Navig8 Crude, which we refer to as the “2015 merger.” 
     The 14 “eco” newbuild VLCCs we acquired in the 2015 merger had been originally ordered by Navig8 Crude prior to the 2015 merger with an aggregate contract price (including installment payments already made) of $1.3 billion. We assumed the remaining installment payments from Navig Crude. One remaining newbuilding has yet to be delivered, which has remaining installment payments of $48.2 million as of March 10, 2017. We have an agreement in place with Navig8 Shipmanagement Pte Ltd., an affiliate of the Navig8 Group, to supervise and inspect the construction of the one remaining newbuilding, which we expect to be delivered during the second half of 2017. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Related Party Transactions – Related Party Transactions of Navig8 Crude Tankers, Inc.” for more information regarding our relationship with the Navig8 Group.
     We refer to the 14 newbuildings acquired in the 2015 merger as the “2015 acquired VLCC newbuildings.” As of March 10, 2017, all but one of these VLCC vessels have been delivered to us and deployed in the VL8 Pool. As of March 10, 2017, we have borrowed approximately $1.1 billion under our senior secured credit facilities to fund the installment payments paid under the shipbuilding contracts for the 2015 acquired VLCC newbuildings.
    
These 21 VLCC vessels are based on advanced “eco” design, which incorporate many technological improvements such as more fuel‑efficient engines, hull forms, and propellers and decreased water resistance, designed to optimize speed and fuel consumption and reduce emissions. However, there is no guarantee of the extent to which these fuel efficiencies will be realized. See “Risk Factors–There is no assurance that our recently delivered VLCC vessels (as well as the Gener8 Nestor which is scheduled to be delivered in the second half of 2017) will provide the fuel consumption savings that we expect, or that we will fully realize any fuel efficiency benefits of our recently delivered VLCC vessels.”
     Certain events may arise which could result in us not taking delivery of our final 2015 acquired VLCC newbuilding on such schedule or at all. See “Risk Factors—Delay in delivery of our one remaining VLCC newbuilding or any other new vessel that we may order, or delivery of any vessel with significant defects, could harm our operating results and lead to the termination of any related charters that may be entered into prior to their delivery.”
     OUR FLEET
     As of March 10, 2017 our fleet was comprised of 41 wholly-owned tankers, which includes 40 vessels on the water, consisting of 24 VLCC vessels, ten Suezmax vessels, four Aframax vessels and two Panamax vessels, with an aggregate carrying capacity of 9.4 million DWT and one “eco” VLCC newbuilding with an expected delivery in the second half of 2017. As of March 10, 2017, all of our VLCC vessels were deployed in Navig8 Group’s VL8 Pool, all of

      FLEET DEPLOYMENT
     We strive to optimize the financial performance of our fleet by opportunistically evaluating the deployment of our vessels in the spot market, which are contracts pertaining to specified cargo, and on time charters, which are contracts defined by their duration rather than their cargoes, including through commercial pool arrangements. Vessels operating in the spot market typically are chartered for a single voyage that may last up to three months whereas vessels operating on time charters may be chartered for several months or years. Vessels operating in the spot market may generate increased profit margins during periods of improving tanker rates, while vessels operating on time charters generally provide more predictable cash flows. Due to the historically low charter rates in recent years, we have primarily deployed our vessels on spot market voyage charters (either directly or through pools which operate primarily in the spot market) as opposed to time charters. However, we actively monitor market conditions and changes in charter rates in managing the deployment of our vessels between spot market voyage charters, pool agreements and time charters. Historically, during certain periods of higher charter rates, we entered into time charters to benefit from a measure of stability through cycles. We may utilize a similar strategy to the extent that tanker rates rise and market conditions become favorable. We may also utilize time charters to lock in contracted rates when we believe the rate environment could weaken or decline in the future. We may also consider deploying our vessels on time charter for customers to use as floating storage. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Pool, Spot and Time Charter Deployment” for more information regarding our fleet deployment strategy.      Our Charters
     The following table details the percentage of our fleet operating on time charters, in the spot market and in the Navig8 pools during the prior three years.

Percentage in spot charter days | 7.0 | 51.2 | 93.7 
Total vessel operating days | 100.0 | 100.0 | 100.0 

      (1) Consists of vessels chartered into the VL8 Pool, the Suez8 Pool and the V8 Pool.
     As of December 31, 2016, our fleet consisted of 39 vessels on the water, which were all employed in the spot market (either directly or through spot market focused pools). Additionally, all of our vessels that were delivered in the first quarter of 2017 were employed in the spot market (either directly or through spot market focused pools). 
     VL8, Suez8 and V8 Pools
     We employ all of our VLCC, Suezmax and Aframax vessels, in Navig8 Group commercial crude tanker pools, including the VL8 Pool, the Suez8 Pool and the V8 Pool, respectively. The pools leverage the Navig8 Group’s industry leading platform with a spot market focus, in which shipowners with vessels of similar size and quality participate along with us in the pools. As of December 31, 2016, based on information provided to us by the Navig8 Group, the VL8 Pool was comprised of 45 vessels, the Suez8 Pool was comprised of 24 vessels and the V8 Pool was comprised of 19 vessels. 
     We believe this scale among global tanker pools will provide both us and these pools with freight optimization and cost benefits through economies of scale, as well as greater access to key market dynamics and information. Furthermore, we believe that vessel pools can provide cost‑effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels and potentially result in lower waiting times. Pooling our vessels with those of other operators also helps us derive various operational benefits through voyage flexibility, including having more vessels available to

deploy as opportunities arise. For example, pool participation means we could obtain backhaul or other voyages that could result in higher time charter equivalent earnings than we might have otherwise earned.
     For further detail on our pooling arrangements with the Navig8 Group, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Related Party Transactions—Related Party Transactions of Navig8 Crude Tankers Inc.”
     For more information on other pools we have participated in, see Note 16, Vessel pool arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. 
     OPERATIONS AND SHIP MANAGEMENT
     Commercial Management
     Our management team and other employees, including the management and employees of our wholly‑owned subsidiary, Gener8 Maritime Management LLC, are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet. Commercial management involves negotiating charters for vessels, managing the mix of various types of charters, such as time charters, voyage charters and spot market‑related time charters, and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters. Strategic management involves locating, purchasing, financing and selling vessels. The commercial management of our vessels deployed in the VL8, Suez8 and V8 Pools is handled by affiliates of the Navig8 Group. Our in‑house commercial management team oversees our pool arrangements and manages any vessels not chartered into pools.     Technical Management
     We utilize the services of independent technical managers for the technical management of our fleet (including the vessels we have deployed in pools). We currently contract with Anglo Eastern Ship Management, Northern Marine Management, Wallem Ship Management and Selandia Ship Management, independent technical managers, for our technical management. Technical management involves the day‑to‑day management of vessels, including performing routine maintenance, attending to vessel operations, arranging for crews and supplies and providing safety, quality and environmental management, operational support, crewing shipyard supervision, insurance and financial management services. Members of our New York City‑based corporate technical department oversee the activities of our independent technical managers. The head of our technical management team has over 38 years of experience in the shipping industry.
     Under our technical management agreements, our technical managers are obligated to:
    
· | provide qualified personnel to ensure safe vessel operation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


· | arrange and supervise the maintenance of our vessels to our standards to assure that our vessels comply with applicable national and international regulations and the requirements of our vessels’ classification societies including arranging and conducting vessel dry dockings;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | select and train the crews for our vessels, including assuring that the crews have the correct certificates for the types of vessels on which they serve;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | warrant the compliance of the crews’ licenses with the regulations of the vessels’ flag states and the International Maritime Organization, or “IMO”;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | arrange the supply of spares and stores and lubricating oil for our vessels;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | report expense transactions to us, and make its procurement and accounting systems available to us in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | ensure that our vessels are acceptable to customers for the safe carriage of cargo.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     Our crews inspect our vessels and perform ordinary course maintenance, both at sea and in port. Our vessels are regularly inspected by technical management staff and specific notations and recommendations are made for improvements to the overall condition of the vessel, maintenance of the vessel and safety and welfare of the crew.
     EMPLOYEES
     As of December 31, 2016, we employed 38 office personnel. Fourteen of these employees (of which thirteen are located in New York City and one is located in Houston, Texas) manage the commercial operations of our business and oversee the technical management of our fleet. As part of our strategy to outsource the technical management of our fleet, we completed the closure of our Portugal office (which had four employees) in August 2015 and our Russia office (which had three employees) in March 2016. 
     Since November 15, 2014, we no longer provided any seaborne personnel to crew our vessels. Crews for our vessels are provided by third‑party managers. Our technical managers are responsible for locating and retaining qualified officers for our vessels subject to third‑party management arrangements. The crewing agencies handle each seaman’s training, travel and payroll, and ensure that all the seamen on our vessels have the qualifications and licenses required to comply with international regulations and shipping conventions. We typically man our vessels with more crew members than are required by the country of the vessel’s flag in order to allow for the performance of routine maintenance duties.
     We place great emphasis on attracting qualified crew members for employment on our vessels. Recruiting qualified senior officers has become an increasingly difficult task for vessel operators. We believe that our third‑party technical managers pay competitive salaries and provide competitive benefits to our personnel. We believe that the well‑maintained quarters and equipment on our vessels help to attract and retain motivated and qualified seamen and officers. Our crew management services contractors have collective bargaining agreements that cover all the junior officers and seamen whom they provide to us.
     CUSTOMERS
     We have strong relationships with our customers, which include major international oil companies and commodities trading firms such as Saudi Aramco, BP, Shell, S‑Oil, Exxon, Chevron, Repsol, Valero, Reliance, Petrobras and Clearlake, either directly or through pooling arrangements.
     Our vessels are primarily available for employment in commercial pools, or for charter on a spot voyage or time charter basis. 
     During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Navig8 pools accounted for 91.2% and 34.8%, respectively of our net voyage revenues. The Navig8 pools, which manage vessels owned by third-party operators, distribute revenues on net basis, and our net voyage revenues are not directly attributable to the charterers of our vessels. We receive such revenues indirectly through distributions made to us by the Navig8 pools in which our vessels participate. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, one of our customers, Unipec, accounted for 9.9% and 15.2% of our voyage revenues (including revenue from the Unique Tankers pool), respectively. On May 7, 2015, we delivered to Unipec a notice of termination under certain of our pool related agreements between Unipec and Unique Tankers, and we subsequently transitioned all of our vessels to the Navig8 commercial crude tanker pools, with the exception of two vessels deployed in the spot market, to the Navig8 commercial crude tanker pools. See “Risk Factors—We receive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers and pools, and the loss of any customer or the termination of our relationships with these pools could result in a significant loss of revenues and cash flow” for certain risks related to our reliance on key customers. See Note 16, Vessel pool arrangements, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 for more information on the Unique Tankers pool and the Navig8 pools.
     COMPETITION
     International seaborne transportation of crude oil and other petroleum products is provided by two main types of operators: fleets owned by independent companies and fleets operated by oil companies (both private and 

 
  11

 
state‑owned). Many oil companies and other oil trading companies, the primary charterers of the vessels we own, also operate their own vessels and transport oil for themselves and third‑party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators. Competition for charters is intense and is based upon price, vessel location, the size, age, condition and acceptability of the vessel, and the quality and reputation of the vessel’s operator.
     Other significant operators of vessels carrying crude oil and other petroleum products include Frontline, Ltd., Overseas Shipholding Group, Inc., Teekay Shipping Corporation, Tsakos Energy Navigation, Euronav NV, DHT Holdings, Inc., and Tankers International LLC. There are also numerous, smaller vessel operators.
     See “Risk Factors” for a discussion of certain negative factors pertaining to our competitive position.
     INSURANCE
     General Operational Risks 
     The operation of any ocean‑going vessel carries an inherent risk of catastrophic marine disasters and property losses caused by adverse weather conditions, mechanical failures, human error, war, terrorism and other circumstances or events. In addition, the transportation of crude oil is subject to the risk of spills, and business interruptions due to political circumstances in foreign countries, hostilities, labor strikes and boycotts. The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or “OPA,” has made liability insurance more expensive for ship owners and operators imposing potentially unlimited liability upon owners, operators and bareboat charterers for oil pollution incidents in the territorial waters of the United States. We believe that our current insurance coverage is adequate to protect us against the principal accident‑related risks that we face in the conduct of our business.
     Liability Risks: Protection and Indemnity Insurance        Our protection and indemnity insurance, or “P&I insurance,” covers, subject to customary deductibles, policy limits and extensions, third‑party liabilities and other related expenses from, among other things, injury or death of crew, passengers and other third parties, claims arising from collisions, damage to cargo and other third‑party property and pollution arising from oil or other substances. Our current P&I insurance coverage for pollution is the maximum commercially available amount of $1.0 billion per tanker per incident and is provided by mutual protection and indemnity associations. Our current P&I Insurance coverage for non‑pollution losses is $3.0 billion per tanker per incident. Each of the vessels currently in our fleet is entered in a protection and indemnity association which is a member of the International Group of Protection and Indemnity Mutual Assurance Associations, or the “International Group.” The 13 protection and indemnity associations that comprise the International Group insure approximately 90% of the world’s commercial tonnage and have entered into a pooling agreement to reinsure each association’s liabilities. Each protection and indemnity association has capped its exposure to this pooling agreement at $4.3 billion. As a member of protection and indemnity associations, which are, in turn, members of the International Group, we are subject to calls payable to the associations based on the International Group’s claim records as well as the claim records of all other members of the individual associations and members of the pool of protection and indemnity associations comprising the International Group.
     Marine Risks: Hull and Machinery and War Risks        Our hull and machinery insurance covers actual or constructive total loss from covered risks of collision, fire, heavy weather, grounding and engine failure or damages from same. Our war risk insurance covers risks of confiscation, seizure, capture, vandalism, sabotage and other war‑related risks. Such coverage is subject to policy deductibles. Our loss‑of‑hire insurance covers loss of revenue for up to 90 days resulting from vessel off hire for each of our vessels, with a 14‑day deductible.

 ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION AND OTHER REGULATIONS
     Government regulations and laws significantly affect the ownership and operation of our vessels. We are subject to international conventions, national, state and local laws and regulations in force in the countries in which our vessels may operate or are registered and compliance with such laws, regulations and other requirements may entail significant expense.
     Our vessels are subject to both scheduled and unscheduled inspections by a variety of government, quasi-governmental and private organizations, including local port authorities, national authorities, harbor masters or equivalent, classification societies, flag state administrations (countries of registry) and charterers. Our failure to maintain permits, licenses, certificates or other approvals required by some of these entities could require us to incur substantial costs or temporarily suspend operation of one or more of our vessels.
     We believe that the heightened levels of environmental and quality concerns among insurance underwriters, regulators and charterers have led to greater inspection and safety requirements on all vessels and may accelerate the scrapping of older vessels throughout the industry. Increasing environmental concerns have created a demand for vessels that conform to stricter environmental standards. We believe that the operation of our vessels is in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that our vessels have all material permits, licenses, certificates or other authorizations necessary for the conduct of our operations; however, because such laws and regulations are frequently changed and may impose increasingly stricter requirements, we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these requirements, or the impact of these requirements on the resale value or useful lives of our vessels. In addition additional legislation or regulation applicable to the operation of our vessels that may be implemented in the future could negatively affect our profitability.
     International Maritime Organization (IMO)
     The United Nations’ International Maritime Organization, or the “IMO,” has adopted the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 and updated through various amendments relating thereto (collectively referred to as MARPOL 73/78 and herein as “MARPOL”). MARPOL entered into force on October 2, 1983. It has been adopted by over 150 nations, including many of the jurisdictions in which our vessels operate. MARPOL sets forth pollution‑prevention requirements applicable to tankers, among other vessels, and is broken into six Annexes, each of which regulates a different source of pollution. Annex I relates to oil leakage or spilling; Annexes II and III relate to harmful substances carried, in bulk, in liquid or packaged form, respectively; Annexes IV and V relate to sewage and garbage management, respectively; and Annex VI, lastly, relates to air emissions. Annex VI was separately adopted by the IMO in September of 1997.
     In 2012, the IMO’s Marine Environmental Protection Committee, or the “MEPC,” adopted a resolution
 amending the International Code for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicals in Bulk, or the “IBC Code.” The provisions of the IBC Code are mandatory under MARPOL and the IMO International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea of 1974, or “SOLAS.” These amendments, which entered into force in June 2014, pertain to revised international certificates of fitness for the carriage of dangerous chemicals in bulk and identifying new products that fall under the IBC Code. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments.
     In 2013, the MEPC adopted a resolution amending MARPOL Annex I Condition Assessment Scheme, or “CAS.” These amendments became effective on October 1, 2014, and require compliance with the 2011 International Code on the Enhanced Programme of Inspections during Surveys of Bulk Carriers and Oil Tankers, or “ESP Code,” which provides for enhanced inspection programs. We may need to make certain financial expenditures to comply with these amendments.
     Air Emissions. In September of 1997, the IMO adopted Annex VI to MARPOL to address air pollution. Effective May 2005, Annex VI sets limits on nitrogen oxide emissions from ships whose diesel engines were constructed (or underwent major conversions) on or after January 1, 2000. It also prohibits “deliberate emissions” of “ozone depleting substances,” defined to include certain halons and chlorofluorocarbons. “Deliberate emissions” are not limited 

 
  13

 
to times when the ship is at sea; they can for example include discharges occurring in the course of the ship’s repair and maintenance. Emissions of “volatile organic compounds” from certain tankers, and the shipboard incineration (from incinerators installed after January 1, 2000) of certain substances (such as polychlorinated biphenyls “PCBs”) are also prohibited. Annex VI also includes a global cap on the sulfur content of fuel oil and allows for special areas to be established with more stringent controls on sulfur emissions known as “Emission Control Areas,” or “ECAs” (see below).
     The MEPC adopted amendments to Annex VI on October 10, 2008, which amendments were entered into force on July 1, 2010. The amended Annex VI seeks to further reduce air pollution by, among other things, implementing a progressive reduction of the amount of sulfur contained in any fuel oil used on board ships. On October 27, 2016, at its 70th session, or “MEPC 70,” MEPC announced its decision concerning the implementation of regulations mandating a reduction in sulfur emissions from 3.5% currently to 0.5% as of the beginning of 2020 rather than pushing the deadline back to 2025. By 2020 ships will now have to either remove sulfur from emissions through the use of emission scrubbers or buy fuel with low sulfur content. 
     Sulfur content standards are even stricter within certain ECAs. As of January 1, 2015, ships operating within an ECA may not use fuel with sulfur content in excess of 0.10%. Amended Annex VI establishes procedures for designating new ECAs. Currently, the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and certain coastal areas of North America and the Caribbean Sea have been so designated. Ocean-going vessels in these areas are subject to stringent emissions controls, which may cause us to incur additional costs. If other ECAs are approved by the IMO or other new or more stringent requirements relating to emissions from marine diesel engines or port operations by vessels are adopted by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, or “EPA,” or the states where we operate, compliance with these regulations could entail significant capital expenditures, operational changes, or otherwise increase the costs of our operations. For example, the amended Annex VI also establishes new tiers of stringent nitrogen oxide emission standards for new marine engines developed after the date of installation. The EPA promulgated equivalent (and in some senses stricter) emissions standards in late 2009. At MEPC 70, MEPC approved the North Sea and Baltic Sea as ECAs for nitrogen oxides, effective January 1, 2021. It is expected that these areas will be formally designated after the draft amendments are presented at MEPC’s next session.
         As of January 1, 2013, Amended Annex VI of MARPOL made mandatory certain measures relating to energy efficiency for ships in part to address greenhouse gas emissions. This included the requirement that all new ships utilize the Energy Efficiency Design Index, or “EEDI,” and that all ships use the Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plan, or “SEEMP.”
     We believe that all our vessels will be compliant in all material respects with these regulations. Additional or new conventions, laws and regulations may be adopted that could require the installation of expensive emission control systems and could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.
     Pollution Control and Liability Requirements 
     The IMO adopted the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships’ Ballast Water and Sediments, or the BWM Convention, in February 2004. The BWM Convention’s implementing regulations call for a phased introduction of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements, to be replaced in time with mandatory concentration limits of ballast discharge. All ships will also have to carry a ballast water record book and an International Ballast Water Management Certificate. The BWM Convention enters into force 12 months after it has been adopted by 30 states, the combined merchant fleets of which represent not less than 35% of the gross tonnage of the world’s merchant shipping tonnage. On September 8, 2016, this threshold was met (with 52 contracting parties making up 35.14%). Thus, the BWM Convention will enter into force on September 8, 2017.
     Many of the implementation dates originally written into the BWM Convention have already passed, so that once the BWM Convention enters into force, the period for installation of mandatory ballast water exchange requirements would be extremely short, with several thousand ships a year needing to install ballast water management systems, or “BWMS”. For this reason, on December 4, 2013, the IMO Assembly passed a resolution revising the application dates of the BWM Convention so that they are triggered by the entry into force date and not the dates 

 
  14

 
originally in the BWM Convention. This in effect makes all vessels constructed before the entry into force date ‘existing’ vessels, and allows for the installation of BWMS on such vessels at the first renewal survey following entry into force of the Convention. At MEPC 70, MEPC adopted updated “guidelines for approval of ballast water management systems (G8).” G8 updates previous guidelines concerning procedures to approve BWMS. The cost of compliance could increase for ocean carriers and the costs of ballast water treatments may be material. 
     The IMO adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Bunker Oil Pollution Damage, or the “Bunker Convention,” to impose strict liability on ship owners for pollution damage in jurisdictional waters of ratifying states caused by discharges of bunker fuel. The Bunker Convention requires registered owners of ships over 1,000 gross tons to maintain insurance for pollution damage in an amount equal to the limits of liability under the applicable national or international limitation regime (but not exceeding the amount calculated in accordance with the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims of 1976, as amended). With respect to non‑ratifying states, liability for spills or releases of oil carried as fuel in ship’s bunkers typically is determined by the relevant national or other domestic laws in the jurisdiction where the events or damages occur.
     The IMO has also adopted the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage of 1969, as amended by different Protocol in 1976, 1984, and 1992, and amended in 2000, or the “CLC.” Under the CLC and depending on whether the country in which the damage results is a party to the 1992 Protocol to the CLC, a vessel’s registered owner is strictly liable for pollution damage caused in the territorial waters of a contracting state by discharge of persistent oil, subject to certain exceptions. The 1992 Protocol changed certain limits on liability. The right to limit liability is forfeited under the CLC where the spill is caused by the shipowner’s personal fault and under the 1992 Protocol where the spill is caused by the shipowner’s personal act or omission or by intentional or reckless conduct where the shipowner knew pollution damage would probably result. The CLC requires ships covered by it to maintain insurance covering the liability of the owner in a sum equivalent to an owner’s liability for a single incident.
     Noncompliance with the IMO’s International Management Code for the Safe Operation of Ships and for Pollution Prevention, or “ISM Code,” or other IMO regulations may subject the vessel owner or bareboat charterer to increased liability, lead to decreases in available insurance coverage for affected vessels or result in the denial of access to, or detention in, some ports. As of the date of this Annual Report, each of our operating vessels is ISM Code certified. 
     Anti‑Fouling Requirements. In 2001, the IMO adopted the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti‑fouling Systems on Ships, or the “Anti‑fouling Convention.” The Anti‑fouling Convention, which entered into force on September 17, 2008, prohibits the use of organotin compound coatings to prevent the attachment of mollusks and other sea life to the hulls of vessels after September 2003. Vessels of over 400 gross tons engaged in international voyages will be required to undergo an initial survey before the vessel is put into service or before an International Anti‑fouling System Certificate is issued for the first time; and subsequent surveys when the anti‑fouling systems are altered or replaced. We have obtained Anti‑fouling System Certificates for all of our vessels that are subject to the Anti‑fouling Convention.
     The IMO continues to review and introduce new regulations. It is impossible to predict what additional regulations, if any, may be passed by the IMO and what effect, if any, such regulations might have on our operations.
     The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.
     The U.S. Oil Pollution Act of 1990, or “OPA,” established an extensive regulatory and liability regime for the protection and cleanup of the environment from oil spills. OPA affects all “owners and operators” whose vessels trade with the United States, its territories and possessions or whose vessels operate in United States waters, which includes the United States’ territorial sea and its 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the United States. The United States has also enacted the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, or “CERCLA,” which applies to the discharge of hazardous substances (other than petroleum, except in certain limited circumstances), whether on land or at sea. OPA and CERCLA both define “owner and operator” “in the case of a vessel as any person owning, operating or chartering by demise, the vessel.” Both OPA and CERCLA impact our operations.
    
 
  15

 

 Under OPA, vessel owners and operators are “responsible parties” and are jointly, severally and strictly liable (unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war) for all containment and clean‑up costs and other damages arising from discharges or threatened discharges of oil from their vessels. OPA defines these other damages broadly to include:
    
· | injury to, destruction or loss of, or loss of use of, natural resources and related assessment costs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | injury to, or economic losses resulting from, the destruction of real and personal property;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | net loss of taxes, royalties, rents, fees or net profit revenues resulting from injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property, or natural resources;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | loss of subsistence use of natural resources that are injured, destroyed or lost;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to injury, destruction or loss of real or personal property or natural resources; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | net cost of increased or additional public services necessitated by removal activities following a discharge of oil, such as protection from fire, safety or health hazards.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      OPA contains statutory caps on liability and damages; such caps do not apply to direct cleanup costs. Effective December 21, 2015, the U.S. Coast Guard, or “USCG,” adjusted the limits of OPA liability to the greater of $2,200 per gross ton or $18,796,800 per tank vessel, other than a single-hull tank vessel, that is greater than 3,000 gross tons (subject to periodic adjustments for inflation). These limits of liability do not apply if an incident was proximately caused by the violation of an applicable U.S. federal safety, construction or operating regulation by a responsible party (or its agent, employee or a person acting pursuant to a contractual relationship), or a responsible party’s gross negligence or willful misconduct. The limitation on liability similarly does not apply if the responsible party fails or refuses to (i) report the incident where the responsible party knows or has reason to know of the incident; (ii) reasonably cooperate and assist as requested in connection with oil removal activities; or (iii) without sufficient cause, comply with an order issued under certain provisions of the U.S. Clean Water Act or the Intervention on the High Seas Act.
     CERCLA contains a similar liability regime whereby owners and operators of vessels are liable for cleanup, removal and remedial costs, as well as damage for injury to, or destruction or loss of, natural resources, including the reasonable costs associated with assessing same, and health assessments or health effects studies. There is no liability if the discharge of a hazardous substance results solely from the act or omission of a third party, an act of God or an act of war. Liability under CERCLA is limited to the greater of $300 per gross ton or $5 million for vessels carrying a hazardous substance as cargo and the greater of $300 per gross ton or $500,000 for any other vessel. These limits do not apply (rendering the responsible person liable for the total cost of response and damages) if the release or threat of release of a hazardous substance resulted from willful misconduct or negligence, or the primary cause of the release was a violation of applicable safety, construction or operating standards or regulations. The limitation on liability also does not apply if the responsible person fails or refused to provide all reasonable cooperation and assistance as requested in connection with response activities where the vessel is subject to OPA.
     OPA and CERCLA each preserve the right to recover damages under existing law, including maritime tort law.
     OPA and CERCLA both require owners and operators of vessels to establish and maintain with the USCG evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet the maximum amount of liability to which the particular responsible person may be subject. Vessel owners and operators may satisfy their financial responsibility obligations by providing a proof of insurance, a surety bond, qualification as a self‑insurer or a guarantee. Under OPA regulations, an owner or operator of more than one tanker is required to demonstrate evidence of financial responsibility for the entire fleet in an amount equal only to the financial responsibility requirement of the tanker having the greatest maximum strict liability under OPA and CERCLA. We have provided such evidence and received certificates of financial responsibility from the USCG for each of our vessels required to have one. Compliance with any new requirements of OPA may substantially impact our cost of operations or require us to incur additional expenses to comply with any new regulatory 

 
  16

 
initiatives or statutes. Additional legislation or regulations applicable to the operation of our vessels that may be implemented in the future could adversely affect our business.
     We currently maintain pollution liability coverage insurance in the amount of $1 billion per incident for each of our operating vessels. If the damages from a catastrophic spill were to exceed our insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
     Other United States Environmental Regulations. The U.S. Clean Water Act, or the “CWA,” prohibits the discharge of oil, hazardous substances and ballast water in U.S. navigable waters unless authorized by a duly‑issued permit or exemption, and imposes strict liability in the form of penalties for any unauthorized discharges. The CWA also imposes substantial liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages and complements the remedies available under OPA and CERCLA. Furthermore, most U.S. States that border a navigable waterway have enacted environmental pollution laws that impose strict liability on a person for removal costs and damages resulting from a discharge of oil or a release of a hazardous substance. These laws may be more stringent than U.S. federal law.
     The EPA requires a permit regulating ballast water discharges and other discharges incidental to the normal operation of certain vessels within U.S. waters under the Vessel General Permit for Discharges Incidental to the Normal Operation of Vessels, or “VGP.” For a new vessel delivered to an owner or operator after September 19, 2009 to be covered by the VGP, the owner must submit a Notice of Intent, or “NOI,” at least 30 days before the vessel operates in U.S. waters. On March 28, 2013, the EPA re‑issued the VGP for another 5 years. This VGP took effect on December 19, 2013. The VGP focuses on authorizing discharges incidental to operations of commercial vessels and the new VGP contains numeric ballast water discharge limits for most vessels to reduce the risk of invasive species in U.S. waters, more stringent requirements for gas scrubbers and the use of environmentally acceptable lubricants.
     USCG regulations adopted, and proposed for adoption, under the U.S. National Invasive Species Act, or “NISA,” also impose mandatory ballast water management practices for all vessels equipped with ballast water tanks entering or operating in U.S. waters, which require the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other port facility disposal arrangements or procedures, and/or otherwise restrict our vessels from entering U.S. waters. The USCG must approve any technology before it is placed on a vessel, but has not yet approved the technology necessary for vessels to meet the foregoing standards. However, the USCG has developed an Alternate Management System, or “AMS,” acceptance program. This is a bridging strategy to allow foreign type approved BWMS to be installed and operated on vessels. An AMS must be installed prior to the vessel’s compliance date and may be used up to five years after the date that the vessel is required to be in compliance with the USCG ballast water discharge standards.
     Notwithstanding the foregoing, as of January 1, 2014, vessels are technically subject to the phasing‑in of these standards. As a result, the USCG has provided waivers to vessels which cannot install the as‑yet unapproved technology. The EPA, on the other hand, has taken a different approach to enforcing ballast discharge standards under the VGP. On December 27, 2013, the EPA issued an enforcement response policy in connection with the new VGP in which the EPA indicated that it would take into account the reasons why vessels do not have the requisite technology installed, but will not grant any waivers.
     In October 2015, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling that directed the EPA to redraft certain sections of the VGP that address ballast water. However, the Second Circuit stated that the 2013 VGP will remain in effect until the EPA issues a new VGP. Since the current VGP will remain in effect until the EPA issues a new VGP, it remains unclear how the ballast water requirements promulgated by the EPA, the USCG, and IMO BWM Convention, some of which are in effect and some of which are pending, will co-exist and affect us.
     Compliance with the VGP could require the installation of equipment on our vessels to treat ballast water before it is discharged or the implementation of other disposal arrangements, and/or otherwise restrict our vessels from entering United States waters. In addition, certain states have enacted more stringent discharge standards as conditions to their required certification of the VGP. We submit NOIs for our vessels where required and do not believe that the costs associated with obtaining and complying with the VGP have a material impact on our operations. We have installed ballast water treatment systems on newbuilding vessels and will retrofit these on certain other ships in the future.

 
  17

 

     The U.S. Clean Air Act of 1970 (including its amendments in 1977 and 1990), or the “CAA,” requires the EPA to promulgate standards applicable to emissions of volatile organic compounds and other air contaminants. Our vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements for certain cargoes when loading, unloading, ballasting, cleaning and conducting other operations in regulated port areas. Our vessels that operate in such port areas with restricted cargoes are equipped with vapor recovery systems that satisfy these requirements. The CAA also requires states to draft State Implementation Plans, or “SIPs,” designed to attain national health‑based air quality standards in each state. Although state‑specific SIPs may include regulations concerning emissions resulting from vessel loading and unloading operations by requiring the installation of vapor control equipment, as indicated above, our vessels operating in covered port areas are already equipped with vapor recovery systems that satisfy these existing requirements.
     European Union Regulations
     In October 2009, the European Union amended a directive to impose criminal sanctions for illicit ship‑source discharges of polluting substances, including minor discharges, if committed with intent, recklessly or with serious negligence and the discharges individually or in the aggregate result in deterioration of the quality of water. Aiding and abetting the discharge of a polluting substance may also lead to criminal penalties. Member States were required to enact laws or regulations to comply with the directive by the end of 2010. Criminal liability for pollution may result in substantial penalties or fines and increased civil liability claims.
     The European Union has adopted several regulations and directives requiring, among other things, more frequent inspections of high‑risk ships, as determined by type, age, and flag as well as the number of times the ship has been detained. The European Union also adopted and then extended a ban on substandard ships and enacted a minimum ban period and a definitive ban for repeated offenses. The regulation also provided the European Union with greater authority and control over classification societies, by imposing more requirements on classification societies and providing for fines or penalty payments for organizations that failed to comply.
     Greenhouse Gas Regulation
     Currently, the emissions of greenhouse gases from international shipping are not subject to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which entered into force in 2005 and pursuant to which adopting countries have been required to implement national programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The 2015 United Nations Convention on Climate Change Conference in Paris did not result in an agreement that directly limited greenhouse gas emissions from ships.
     However, in January 2013 the MEPC’s two new sets of mandatory requirements that address greenhouse gas emissions from ships entered into force. Currently operating ships will be required to develop Ship Energy Efficiency Management Plans, and minimum energy efficiency levels per capacity mile, outlined in the Energy Efficiency Design Index, will apply to new ships. These requirements could cause us to incur additional compliance costs. In April 2015, a regulation was adopted requiring that large ships (over 5,000 gross tons) calling at European ports from January 2018 collect and publish data on carbon dioxide omissions. Draft amendments, which included guidelines on this data collection system, were approved by the 69th session of the MEPC in April 2016, and adopted at MEPC 70.  This is expected to be an early step in the analysis of such data for international shipping by MEPC to aid in deciding future steps concerning greenhouse gas emissions and energy efficiency. A roadmap for a “comprehensive IMO strategy on a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from ships” was also approved at MEPC 70. 
 The MEPC is also considering the implementation of market-based mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from ships. For 2020, the European Union made a unilateral commitment to reduce overall greenhouse gas emissions from its member states by 20% of 1990 levels. The European Union also committed to reduce its emissions by 20% under the Kyoto Protocol’s second period, from 2013 to 2020. In December 2013, the European Union environmental ministers discussed draft rules to implement monitoring and reporting of carbon dioxide emissions from ships. In the United States, the EPA has issued a finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and safety and has adopted regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from certain mobile sources and large stationary sources.  The EPA enforces both the CAA and the international standards found in Annex VI of MARPOL concerning marine diesel engines, their emissions, and the sulfur content in marine fuel. Although the mobile source emissions regulations do not 

 
  18

 
apply to greenhouse gas emissions from vessels, such regulation of vessels is foreseeable, and the EPA has in recent years received petitions from the California Attorney General and various environmental groups seeking such regulation. Any passage of climate control legislation or other regulatory initiatives by the IMO, European Union, the U.S. or other countries where we operate, or any treaty adopted at the international level to succeed the Kyoto Protocol, that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases could require us to make significant financial expenditures, including capital expenditures to upgrade our vessels, which we cannot predict with certainty at this time.
     International Labour Organization
     The International Labour Organization, or “ILO,” is a specialized agency of the UN with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The ILO has adopted the Maritime Labour Convention 2006, or “MLC 2006.” A Maritime Labor Certificate and a Declaration of Maritime Labour Compliance will be required to ensure compliance with the MLC 2006 for all ships above 500 gross tons in international trade. On August 20, 2013, MLC 2006 entered into force. Amendments to MLC 2006 were adopted in 2014 and 2016. The MLC 2006 requires us to develop new procedures to ensure full compliance with its requirements.     Ship Safety
     Vessel Security Regulations. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 in the United States, there have been a variety of initiatives intended to enhance vessel security, such as the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, or “MTSA.” To implement certain portions of the MTSA, in July 2003 the USCG, issued regulations requiring the implementation of certain security requirements aboard vessels operating in waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The regulations also impose requirements on certain ports and facilities, some of which are regulated by the EPA.
     Similarly, in December 2002, amendments to SOLAS created a new chapter of the convention dealing specifically with maritime security. The new Chapter XI-2 became effective in July 2004 and imposes various detailed security obligations on vessels and port authorities, and mandates compliance with the International Ship and Port Facilities Security Code, or the “ISPS Code.” The ISPS Code is designed to enhance the security of ports and ships against terrorism. To trade internationally, a vessel must attain an International Ship Security Certificate, or “ISSC,” from a recognized security organization approved by the vessel’s flag state. The following are among the various requirements, some which are found in SOLAS:
    
· | on board installation of automatic identification systems to provide a means for the automatic transmission of safety related information from among similarly equipped ships and shore stations, including information on a ship’s identity, position, course, speed and navigational status;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | on board installation of ship security alert systems, which do not sound on the vessel but only alert the authorities on shore;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the development of vessel security plans;
--+------------------------------------------


· | ship identification number to be permanently marked on a vessel’s hull;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | a continuous synopsis record kept onboard showing a vessel’s history including the name of the ship, the state whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, the date on which the ship was registered with that state, the ship’s identification number, the port at which the ship is registered and the name of the registered owner(s) and their registered address; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | compliance with flag state security certification requirements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

      A ship operating without a valid certificate may be detained at port until it obtains an ISSC, or may be expelled from port or refused entry at port.

 Furthermore, additional security measures could be required in the future which could have a significant financial impact on us. The USCG regulations, intended to align with international maritime security standards, exempt non‑U.S. vessels from MTSA vessel security measures provided such vessels have on board a valid ISSC that attests to the vessel’s compliance with SOLAS security requirements and the ISPS Code. We have implemented the various security measures addressed by the MTSA, SOLAS and the ISPS Code.
     Safety Management System Requirements. In addition to SOLAS, the IMO also adopted the International Convention on Load Lines, or the “LL Convention.” SOLAS and the LL Convention impose a variety of standards that regulate the design and operational features of ships. The IMO periodically revises SOLAS and LL Convention standards. May 2012 SOLAS amendments entered into force as of January 1, 2014. The Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims, or “LLMC,” was recently amended and went into effect on June 8, 2015. The amendments alter the limits of liability for loss of life or personal injury claims and property claims against ship owners. We believe that all our vessels will be in substantial compliance with SOLAS and LL Convention standards.
     The operation of our ships is also affected by the requirements set forth in Chapter IX of SOLAS, which sets forth the ISM Code. The ISM Code requires ship owners and bareboat charterers to develop and maintain an extensive “Safety Management System” that includes, among other things, the adoption of a safety and environmental protection policy setting forth instructions and procedures for safe operation and describing procedures for dealing with emergencies. We rely upon the safety management systems that we and our technical managers have developed for compliance with the ISM Code. The failure of a ship owner or bareboat charterer to comply with the ISM Code may subject such party to increased liability, may decrease available insurance coverage for the affected vessels and may result in a denial of access to, or detention in, certain ports.
     The ISM Code requires that vessel operators obtain a safety management certificate, or “SMC,” for each vessel they operate. This certificate evidences compliance by a vessel’s operators with the ISM Code requirements for a safety management system, or “SMS.” No vessel can obtain a SMC under the ISM Code unless its manager has been awarded a document of compliance, or “DOC,” issued in most instances by the vessel’s flag state. We believe that we have all material requisite documents of compliance for our offices and safety management certificates for all of our operating vessels for which such certificates are required by the IMO. We renew these documents of compliance and safety management certificates as required.
     Inspection by Classification Societies. Every oceangoing vessel must be evaluated, surveyed and approved by a classification society. The classification society certifies that the vessel is “in class,” signifying that the vessel has been built and maintained in accordance with the rules of the classification society and complies with applicable rules and regulations of the vessel’s country of registry and the international conventions of which that country is a member. In addition, where surveys are required by international conventions and corresponding laws and ordinances of a flag state, the classification society will undertake them on application or by official order, acting on behalf of the authorities concerned.
     The classification society also undertakes on request other surveys and checks that are required by regulations and requirements of the flag state. These surveys are subject to agreements made in each individual case and/or to the regulations of the country concerned.
     For maintenance of the class certification, regular and extraordinary surveys of hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and any special equipment classes are required to be performed as follows:
    
· | Annual Surveys: For seagoing ships, annual surveys are conducted for the hull and the machinery, including the electrical plant, and where applicable for special equipment classed, within three months before or after each anniversary date of the date of commencement of the class period indicated in the certificate. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Intermediate Surveys: In addition to annual surveys, intermediate surveys typically are conducted two and one half years after commissioning and each class renewal. Intermediate surveys are to be carried out at or between the occasion of the second or third annual survey. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Class Renewal Surveys: Class renewal surveys, also known as special surveys, are carried out for the ship’s hull, machinery, including the electrical plant, and for any special equipment classed, at the intervals indicated by the character of classification for the hull. At the special survey, the vessel is thoroughly examined, including audio gauging to determine the thickness of the steel structures. Should the thickness be found to be less than class requirements, the classification society would prescribe steel renewals. The classification society may grant a one year grace period for completion of the special survey. Substantial amounts of money may have to be spent for steel renewals to pass a special survey if the vessel experiences excessive wear and tear. In lieu of the special survey every four or five years, depending on whether a grace period was granted, a vessel owner has the option of arranging with the classification society for the vessel’s hull or machinery to be on a continuous survey cycle, in which every part of the vessel would be surveyed within a five year cycle. Upon a vessel owner’s request, the surveys required for class renewal may be split according to an agreed schedule to extend over the entire period of class. This process is referred to as continuous class renewal. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      All areas subject to survey as defined by the classification society are required to be surveyed at least once per class period, unless shorter intervals between surveys are prescribed elsewhere. The period between two subsequent surveys of each area must not exceed five years.
     Most vessels under 15 years old undergo an intermediate survey every 30 to 36 months for inspection of the underwater parts and for repairs related to inspections. If any defects are found, the classification surveyor will issue a “recommendation” which must be rectified by the vessel owner within prescribed time limits. For vessels 15 years and older, a class renewal survey is performed every 30 months.
     Most insurance underwriters make it a condition for insurance coverage that a vessel be certified as “in class” by a classification society which is a member of the International Association of Classification Societies. All of our operating vessels have been certified as being “in class” by a recognized classification society. All new and secondhand vessels that we purchase must be certified prior to their delivery under our standard agreements.
     Oil Major Vetting Process
     Shipping in general and crude tankers in particular, have been, and will remain, heavily regulated. Many international and national rules, regulations and other requirements—whether imposed by the classification societies, international statutes, national and local administrations or industry—must be complied with in order to enable a shipping company to operate and a vessel to trade.
     Traditionally there have been relatively few large players in the oil trading business and the industry is continuously consolidating. The so‑called “oil majors,” such as BP, Chevron, Conoco Phillips, Exxon, Petrobras, Shell, Sinopec, Statoil and Total, together with a few smaller companies, represent a significant percentage of the production, trading and, especially, shipping logistics (terminals) of crude and refined products worldwide. Concerns for the environment, health and safety have led the oil majors to develop and implement a strict due diligence process when selecting their commercial partners. This vetting process has evolved into a sophisticated and comprehensive risk assessment of both the vessel operator and the vessel.
     While many parameters are considered and evaluated prior to a commercial decision, the oil majors, through their association, the Oil Companies International Marine Forum, or “OCIMF,” have developed and are implementing two basic tools: (a) SIRE, the Ship Inspection Report Program, and (b) the Tanker Management & Self Assessment, or “TMSA” program. The former is a physical ship inspection protocol based upon a thorough vessel inspection questionnaire, and performed by accredited OCIMF inspectors, resulting in a report being logged on SIRE, while the latter is a recent addition to the risk assessment tools used by the oil majors.
     Based upon commercial needs, there are three levels of risk assessment used by the oil majors: (a) terminal use, which will clear a vessel to call at one of the oil major’s terminals; (b) voyage charter, which will clear the vessel for a single voyage; and (c) term charter, which will clear the vessel for use for an extended period of time. The depth, complexity and difficulty of each of these levels of assessment vary. While for the terminal use and voyage charter

relationships a ship inspection and the operator’s TMSA will be sufficient, a longer term charter relationship also requires a thorough office assessment. In addition to the commercial interest on the part of the oil major, an excellent safety and environmental protection record is necessary to ensure an office assessment is undertaken.
     We believe that we benefit from our technical managers’ track record of successful audits by major international oil companies. See “—Operations and Ship Management—Technical Management” for more information about our technical managers.
     SEASONALITY
     We operate our vessels in markets that have historically exhibited seasonal variations in tanker demand and, as a result, in charter rates. Tanker markets are typically stronger in the fall and winter months (the fourth and first quarters of the calendar year) in anticipation of increased oil consumption in the Northern Hemisphere during the winter months. Unpredictable weather patterns and variations in oil reserves disrupt vessel scheduling and could adversely impact charter rates.
