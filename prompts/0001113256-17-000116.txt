Overview

 Meritor, Inc. ("we", "us" or "our"), headquartered in Troy, Michigan, is a premier global supplier of a broad range of integrated systems, modules and components to original equipment manufacturers ("OEMs") and the aftermarket for the commercial vehicle, transportation and industrial sectors. We serve commercial truck, trailer, military, bus and coach, construction, and other industrial OEMs and certain aftermarkets. Our principal products are axles, undercarriages, drivelines and brakes.

Meritor was incorporated in Indiana in 2000 in connection with the merger of Meritor Automotive, Inc. and Arvin Industries, Inc. As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms "company," "Meritor," "we," "us" and "our" include Meritor, its consolidated subsidiaries and its predecessors unless the context indicates otherwise.

Meritor serves a broad range of customers worldwide, including medium- and heavy-duty truck OEMs, specialty vehicle manufacturers, certain aftermarkets, and trailer producers. Our total sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2017 were approximately $3.3 billion. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 74 percent of fiscal year 2017 sales from continuing operations. Sales from operations outside the United States (U.S.) accounted for approximately 47 percent of total sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2017. Our continuing operations also participated in five unconsolidated joint ventures, which we accounted for under the equity method of accounting and that generated revenues of approximately $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2017.

Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest to September 30. Fiscal year 2017 ended on October 1, 2017, fiscal year 2016 ended on October 2, 2016, and fiscal year 2015 ended on September 27, 2015. All year and quarter references relate to our fiscal year and fiscal quarters unless otherwise stated. For ease of presentation, September 30 is utilized consistently throughout this report to represent the fiscal year end.

Our specific business strategies are influenced by these industry factors and global trends and are focused on leveraging our resources to continue to develop and produce competitive product offerings. We believe the following strategies will allow us to 
2

maintain a balanced portfolio of commercial truck, industrial and aftermarket businesses covering key global markets. See Item 1A. Risk Factors below for information on certain risks that could have an impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.
M2019 Growth-Focused Plan
With our M2019 plan well underway, we made significant progress in fiscal year 2017 toward our objectives. The financial targets we set for this plan are the following:
•Grow revenue at 20 percent cumulatively above market levels
•Increase Adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations by $1.25
•Reduce the ratio of Net debt to Adjusted EBITDA to less than 1.5
(see Non-GAAP Financial Measures in Item 7)
To achieve these targets, we are focused on three main priorities:
•Exceeding customer expectations
•Transforming to a growth-oriented organization
•Continuing to invest in employees
Exceed Customer Expectations
For more than 100 years, our products have evolved to meet the changing needs of our customers in major regions of the world. As technology has advanced, we have designed products that are more fuel efficient, lighter weight, safer, more durable and more reliable. The Meritor brand is well established globally and reflects a broad and growing portfolio of high-quality products for various applications.
Over the past years, we worked hard to become an innovation partner to our customers. From concept to launch, we work closely together to ensure we are designing reliable and high quality products that meet or exceed their expectations now and in the future. In addition to technology and product collaboration, we also meet regularly with our customers to review our performance in a number of other areas including quality, delivery and cost.
In our M2019 plan, we set an overall quality target of 25 parts per million ("PPM"). We believe this will further differentiate us in the commercial vehicle industry. In fiscal year 2017, a number of strategic customers, including PACCAR, Hino Motors Manufacturing U.S.A., and Daimler Trucks North America, recognized several of Meritor’s manufacturing facilities for outstanding quality. 
We want to continue the excellent delivery performance we have demonstrated at greater than 99 percent. This year, we were proud to receive the first-ever gold award from Ashok Leyland for on-time delivery performance. Meritor’s manufacturing facility in Mysore, India supplies almost 65 percent of the axles and half of the brakes for this major manufacturer of commercial vehicles. We were also honored to be in the top two percent of suppliers to Navistar in fiscal year 2017. For this performance, we were recognized with Navistar’s Diamond Supplier award for helping to improve customer uptime and for exceeding expectations in quality, delivery, technology and cost. XCMG is another important customer to Meritor, in addition to being our key joint venture partner in China. XCMG honored us this year with its Excellent Supplier Award that recognizes top suppliers in delivery, quality and product performance. These recognitions are a critical element to maintaining our customer relationships globally and will continue to be an area to which we devote significant attention. 
We will maintain our focus on driving down operating costs through material cost-reduction and labor and burden improvements with a target achievement of 1.5 percent improvement per year. We are continuing to drive material performance with three different approaches: commercial negotiations, best-cost-country sourcing and technical innovation. And, we are improving in labor and burden by addressing several areas simultaneously including better equipment utilization, reduced changeover time, elimination of waste, improved shift and asset utilization, investing in equipment to improve cycle time and flexibility and employee involvement.
3

We believe we effectively manage complexity for low volumes and support our customers’ needs during periods of peak volumes. The quality, durability and on-time delivery of our products has earned us strong positions in the markets we support. As we seek to extend and expand our business with existing customers and establish relationships with new ones, our objective is to ensure we are getting a fair value for the recognized benefits of our products and services and the strong brand equity we hold in the marketplace.
Transform to a Growth-Oriented Organization
We know that despite changes and volatility in global market conditions, we must generate top-line growth. We have designed the M2019 plan to enable us to achieve the growth we are targeting while operating in a cyclical industry that can be greatly impacted by economic and political factors. We are increasing our market share with key customers, renewing long-term contracts and winning new business in all of our regions around the globe across both of our reportable segments. 
We have rapidly increased the pace of product introduction, which is a key component to growing revenue. Prior to our M2016 plan, we launched approximately three programs annually. During the M2019 timeframe, we expect to introduce seven or more programs per year across our product portfolio and geographic regions. We are developing these jointly with our customers for their future product programs, and we have line of sight to revenue streams for each of these products. In fiscal year 2017, we launched the following eight products:

1. | 14X HE (High-Efficiency) Tandem Drive Axle - This axle demonstrates efficiency improvement up to 1.5 percent while also reducing weight by 30 pounds over the previous industry-leading 14X design for linehaul applications. The use of laser welding to manufacture components helped drive this efficiency improvement. It also comes standard with high-efficiency bearings, the Meritor Lube Management system and precision-finished gearing.


2. | 13X Medium-Duty Drive Axle - Engineered for a variety of medium-duty applications including pick-up and delivery, beverage, utility, school bus, construction and ambulance, the single, rear-drive 13X utilizes the best technologies of Meritor's proven 14X platform.


3. | PACCAR 40 Tandem Axle - An ultra-high efficiency tandem axle developed as a proprietary product solution for a major strategic customer.


4. | MFS+™ Steer Axle - The MFS+ front saves up to 85 pounds from the previous offering due to a new gooseneck beam design and an offset knuckle with integrated torque plate and tie-rod arms. This product earned Heavy Duty Trucking (HDT) magazine's 2017 Top 20 Product Award for being one of the most innovative and significant new products that address industry issues and help linehaul fleets improve their bottom line.


5. | Two Off-Highway Planetary Axles - Built to operate in extreme conditions, these two new off-highway axles are designed for higher levels of durability and reliability. Both off-highway axles launched this year can be used in a variety of applications that serve construction, mining, and oil and gas segments.


6. | MX-25-810 Front Drive Steer Axle - Reliable, cost-efficient front drive steer axle re-engineered for the construction, severe-service and utility applications. Design enhancements include a new housing and new wheel ends. This axle was originally engineered for the defense Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected ("MRAP") segment and is now available in three different housings with options for disc and drum brakes.


7. | MTec6™ - The industry’s lightest trailer axle that offers greater weight savings and lower total cost of ownership. This 6-inch, large-diameter axle is 36 pounds lighter than the industry-standard 5-inch axle. The lighter axle reduces gross trailer weight to enhance fuel economy and available payload.

Also in fiscal year 2017, we announced the following new products that will start production in fiscal year 2018. 

• | Optimized EX+ Air Disc Brake - Built to maximize productivity by reducing maintenance time and costs, the gear-synchronized, twin-piston design delivers even force across the brake pads simultaneously, resulting in better performance and uniform pad wear for tractors and trailers.


• | 79000 Axle - Designed to help municipal transit fleets meet federal and industry durability guidelines. By more than tripling the durability of previous offerings, fleets may only need to replace the axle’s carrier once instead of multiple times during the vehicle’s service life in this heavy stop-and-go segment.

4


• | ProTec Series 50 Beam Axle - Expanding on the legacy of Meritor’s ProTec lineup, the optimized axles for military-specific applications feature a new beam design and utilize theater-proven technologies to fulfill the mission at hand. By applying proven technologies, Meritor has also reduced lead times for quicker deliveries.

We expect to continue to broaden our relationships with our global strategic customers, earn the business of new customers, increase aftermarket share in our core product areas, expand our components business by utilizing our time-proven core competencies of forging, machining and gear manufacturing, and enter near adjacent markets and products that we believe will be a good match with our core competencies.
AB Volvo is Meritor’s largest global customer with the majority of that business being in Europe. We recently extended our long-term agreement with Volvo for an additional three years to 2024. Under the terms of this agreement, Meritor will design and deliver a new family of heavy, single reduction rear axles for both Volvo and Renault brands. These newly designed products will feature fuel efficiency improvement, faster ratios and a higher gross combined weight rating to enable more payload per truck. This fiscal year, Volvo launched its new UD Quon truck in Japan which incorporates Meritor’s global axle and air disc brake platforms. We also support Volvo in Thailand and India.
Also this year, we were awarded important new contracts with significant strategic customers in North America and Europe for the supply of various linehaul and heavy haul axles, as well as new business in China and India with companies including JAC Motors, Qingling and Tata Motors. 
We also continue to grow our off-highway, specialty and defense businesses with wins that included a new contract to provide our P600 tandem axle to Kenworth for a heavy haul customer in the Middle East and to Navistar Defense for the Israeli Army HET and the MaxxPro Recovery Vehicle program. In our Specialty business, we announced a new standard supplier agreement with the REV Group in North America. Under the terms of the three-year agreement, REV Group will equip its bus, fire and specialty vehicles with Meritor’s fully dressed axle assemblies.
As we strive to grow our aftermarket business, we took various actions this year to better serve our customers. We announced a new value brand, Mach™, that features all-makes products including suspension, steering, brake and drivetrain components designed and engineered to industry standards at affordable prices for second and third owners. End-users looking for lower price points from a proven Tier 1 supplier can now look to Mach-branded products.
We also took steps to reduce lead times for customers on the West Coast of the United States with the announcement of the establishment of a West Coast aftermarket distribution center in Santa Fe Springs, California. Through this center, we will fulfill aftermarket orders from warehouse distributors and dealers in 13 states in an effort to get our customers back on the road faster. The facility stocks the complete Meritor Aftermarket brand portfolio for customers in the Western U.S.
While we are planning for the majority of our growth to be organic, we anticipate allocating capital for targeted acquisitions that could be an accelerant in our growth trajectory. To that end, this year Meritor acquired the product portfolio and related technologies of Fabco Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries. With the addition of Fabco’s suite of products, Meritor now has an expanded portfolio of complementary products, including transfer cases, specialty gear boxes, auxiliary transmissions and power take off units for medium, heavy and extra heavy vehicles for on- and off-highway, construction, defense, rail and other industrial applications. These products are available to both original equipment and aftermarket customers. This transaction allows us to offer global customers a wider breadth of capabilities and an expanded portfolio of complementary products. The acquisition is expected to also help us to diversify our customer base and expand into the rail and oil & gas industries not currently served by Meritor.
As industry trends continue to drive the need for equipment that complies with environmental and safety-related regulatory provisions, OEMs select suppliers based not only on the cost and quality of their products, but also on their ability to meet stringent environmental and safety requirements and to service and support the customer after the sale. We use our technological and market expertise to develop and engineer products that address mobility, safety, regulatory and environmental concerns.
Our commitment to designing and manufacturing braking solutions for the commercial vehicle market has resulted in more commercial vehicles in North America having Meritor brakes than any other brake manufacturer. We believe Meritor’s EX+ air disc brakes are among the highest performing brakes in the marketplace. In Europe, a region where air disc brakes are much more widely adopted, we have sold more than 6 million ELSA air disc brakes - a testament to the quality, reliability and performance of this brake platform.
5

We believe the quality of our core product lines, our ability to service our products through our aftermarket capabilities, and our sales and service support teams give us a competitive advantage. An important element of being a preferred supplier is the ability to deliver service through the entire life cycle of the product. Also, as our industry becomes more international, our manufacturing footprint around the world and our ability to supply customers with regionally-tailored product solutions are competencies of increasing importance.
Invest in Employees
The safety of our employees is our top priority. Total case rate is a measure of recordable workplace injuries normalized per 100 employees per year. Our target for M2019 is to achieve a rate of less than 0.65. In fiscal year 2017, we achieved an overall case rate of 0.48 injuries per 200,000 hours, which we believe is world class for an industrial company like Meritor and is below our M2019 target. Eighteen of our 39 measured facilities had no recordable incidents in the entire fiscal year. We attribute this to the diligence of our employees and the safety programs and equipment we have instituted throughout our global operations to protect them.
We will also continue to drive the close alignment of our global Meritor team to M2019. Such alignment was a key driver of the success we experienced in our previous M2016 strategic plan. We believe that our strength to compete in the global market is dependent upon the engagement of every Meritor employee and that a high-performing team is critical to the level of performance we want to achieve. We have a strong and experienced leadership group and a committed team, both of which are focused on sustaining the strong foundation we built in M2016 and delivering on our M2019 performance objectives. We will also continue to diversify our workforce because we recognize the value of different opinions and backgrounds in a company as global as Meritor.
We have established various development and training programs to help our employees grow as we grow. This year, we executed leadership development programs for managers, directors and senior leaders around the world. For managers, we initiated E-Learning modules and two new courses that address important areas for advancement including accountability, delegation, and providing and receiving feedback. For director-level employees, we developed Leadership Edge - a 10-month program whose objective is to develop advanced leadership skills, prepare high-potential leaders for senior level positions and strengthen business acumen. And for senior-level leaders, we began the Summit, which provides executive coaching, the opportunity to attend specific executive training sessions tailored to each individual’s background and career goals, participation in a MBA-level finance course, if needed, and engagement in mentorship opportunities with a member of Meritor’s Board of Directors. To ensure we provide a rich experience for our employees, we will continue to measure employee engagement to build on the competencies that are important to our future.
Products

 Meritor designs, develops, manufactures, markets, distributes, sells, services and supports a broad range of products for use in the transportation and industrial sectors. In addition to sales of original equipment systems and components, we provide our original equipment, aftermarket and remanufactured products to vehicle OEMs, their dealers (who in turn sell to motor carriers and commercial vehicle users of all sizes), independent distributors, and other end-users in certain aftermarkets.
The following chart sets forth, for each of the fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, information about product sales comprising more than 10% of consolidated revenue in any of those years. A narrative description of our principal products follows the chart.

We believe we are one of the world's leading independent suppliers of axles for medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicles, with the leading market position in axle manufacturing in North America, South America and Europe, and are one of the major axle manufacturers in the Asia-Pacific region. Our extensive truck axle product line includes a wide range of front steer axles and rear drive axles. Our front steer and rear drive axles can be equipped with our cam, wedge or air disc brakes, automatic slack adjusters, and complete wheel-end equipment such as hubs, rotors and drums.
We supply heavy-duty axles in certain global regions for use in numerous off-highway vehicle applications, including construction, material handling, and mining. We also supply axles for use in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. These products are designed to tolerate high tonnage and operate under extreme conditions. In addition, we have other off-highway vehicle products that are currently in development for certain other regions. We also supply axles for use in buses, coaches and recreational vehicles, fire trucks and other specialty vehicles in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, and we believe we are a leading supplier of bus and coach axles in North America.

We are one of the major manufacturers of heavy-duty trailer axles in North America. Our trailer axles are available in more than 40 models in capacities from 20,000 to 30,000 pounds for virtually all heavy trailer applications and are available with our broad range of suspension modules, and brake products, including drum brakes and disc brakes.

We supply universal joints and driveline components, including our Permalube™ universal joint and RPL Permalube™ driveline, which are maintenance free, permanently lubricated designs used often in the high mileage on-highway market. We supply drivelines in North America for use in numerous on-highway vehicle applications. We supply transfer cases and drivelines for use in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. We also supply transfer cases for use in specialty vehicles in North America. In addition, we supply trailer air suspension systems and products with an increasing market presence in North America. We also supply advanced suspension modules for use in light-, medium- and heavy-duty military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America.

Brakes and Brake-Related Components

We believe we are one of the leading independent suppliers of air brakes to medium- and heavy-duty commercial vehicle manufacturers in North America and Europe. In Brazil, we believe that Master Sistemas Automotivos Limitada, our 49%-owned joint venture with Randon S. A. Implementos e Participações, is a leading supplier of brakes and brake-related products.
 Through manufacturing facilities located in North America, Asia Pacific and Europe, we manufacture a broad range of foundation air brakes, as well as automatic slack adjusters for brake systems. Our foundation air brake products include cam drum brakes, which offer improved lining life and tractor/trailer interchangeability; wedge drum brakes, which are lightweight and provide automatic internal wear adjustment; air disc brakes, which provide enhanced stopping distance and improved fade resistance for demanding applications; and wheel-end components such as hubs, drums and rotors.

Our brakes and brake system components also are used in military tactical wheeled vehicles, principally in North America. We also supply brakes for use in buses, coaches and recreational vehicles, fire trucks and other specialty vehicles in North America and Europe, and we believe we are the leading supplier of bus and coach brakes in North America. We also supply brakes for commercial vehicles, buses and coaches in Asia Pacific.
Other Products

In addition to the products discussed above, we sell other complementary products, including third-party and private label items, through our aftermarket distribution channels. These products are generally sold under master distribution or similar agreements with outside vendors and include brake shoes and friction materials; automatic slack adjusters; yokes and shafts; wheel-end hubs and drums; ABS and stability control systems; shock absorbers and air springs; air brakes.
Customers; Sales and Marketing

We have numerous customers worldwide and have developed long-standing business relationships with many of these customers. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 74 percent of our total sales in fiscal year 2017. Sales to our largest three customers, AB Volvo, Daimler AG and PACCAR, represented approximately 22 percent, 17 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of our sales in fiscal year 2017. No other customer accounted for 10 percent or more of our total sales in fiscal year 2017.

 Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs)

In North America, we design, engineer, market and sell products principally to OEMs, dealers and distributors. While our North American sales are typically direct to the OEMs, our ultimate commercial truck customers include trucking and transportation fleets. Fleet customers may specify our components and integrated systems for installation in the vehicles they purchase from OEMs. We employ what we refer to as a “push-pull” marketing strategy. We “push” for being the standard product at the OEM. At the same time, our district field managers then call on fleets and OEM dealers to “pull-through” our components on specific truck purchases. For all other markets, we specifically design, engineer, market and sell products principally to OEMs for their market-specific needs or product specifications.

For certain large OEM customers, our supply arrangements are generally negotiated on a long-term contract basis for a multi-year period that may require us to provide annual cost reductions through price reductions or other cost benefits for the OEMs. If we are unable to generate sufficient cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margins will be adversely affected. Sales to other OEMs are typically made through open order releases or purchase orders at market-based prices that do not require the purchase of a minimum number of products. The customer typically has the right to cancel or delay these orders on reasonable notice. We typically compete to either retain business or try to win new business from OEMs when long-term contracts expire. 

We have established leading positions in many of the markets we serve as a global supplier of a broad range of drivetrain systems, brakes and components. Based on available industry data and internal company estimates, our market-leading positions include independent truck drive axles (i.e., those manufactured by an independent, non-captive supplier) in North America, Europe, South America and India through a joint venture; truck drivelines in North America; truck air brakes in North America and South America (through a joint venture); and military wheeled vehicle drivetrains, suspensions and brakes in North America.

Our global customer portfolio includes companies such as AB Volvo, Daimler AG, PACCAR, Navistar International Corporation, Oshkosh, MAN, CNH Industrial, Ashok Leyland, Scania, XCMG, Wabash National and Ford.

Aftermarket

We market and sell truck, trailer, off-highway and other products principally to, and service such products principally for, OEMs, their parts marketing operations, their dealers and other independent distributors and service garages within the aftermarket industry. Our product sales are generated through long-term agreements with certain of our OEM customers and distribution agreements and sales to independent dealers and distributors. Sales to other OEMs are typically made through open order releases or purchase orders at market based prices, which do not require the purchase of a minimum number of products. The customer typically has the right to cancel or delay these orders on reasonable notice.

Our product offerings allow us to service all stages of our customers’ vehicle ownership lifecycle. In North America, we stock and distribute thousands of parts from top national brands to our customers or what we refer to as our “all makes” strategy. Our district field managers call on our OEM and independent customers to market our full product line capabilities on a regular basis to seek to ensure that we satisfy our customers’ needs. Our aftermarket business sells products under the following brand names: Meritor; Euclid; Trucktechnic; Meritor Green; Meritor AllFit and Mach.

Based on available industry data and internal company estimates, we believe our North America aftermarket business has the overall market leadership position for the portfolio of products that we offer. 
Competition

We compete worldwide with a number of North American and international providers of components and systems, some of which are owned by or associated with some of our customers. The principal competitive factors are price, quality, service, product performance, design and engineering capabilities, new product innovation and timely delivery. Certain OEMs manufacture their own components that compete with the types of products we supply.

Our major competitors for axles are Dana Incorporated and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture axles for use in their own products. Emerging competitors for axles include Daimler Truck North America’s Detroit Axle, ZF Friedrichshafen in Europe, and from China, Hande, Fuwa and Ankai. Our major competitors for brakes are Bendix/Knorr Bremse, WABCO and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture brakes for use in their own products. Our major competitors for industrial applications are MAN, AxleTech International, Oshkosh, AM General, Marmon-Herrington, Dana Incorporated, Knorr Bremse, Kessler & Co., Carraro, NAF, Sisu and, in certain markets, OEMs that manufacture industrial products for use in their own vehicles. Our major competitors for trailer applications are Hendrickson and SAF-Holland.

Raw Materials and Suppliers

Our purchases of raw materials and parts are concentrated over a limited number of suppliers. We are dependent upon our suppliers' ability to meet cost performance, quality specifications and delivery schedules. The inability of a supplier to meet these requirements, the loss of a significant supplier, or work stoppages, could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our customers' delivery requirements.
The cost of our core products is susceptible to changes in overall steel commodity prices, including ingredients used for various grades of steel. We have generally structured our major steel supplier and customer contracts to absorb and pass on normal index-related market fluctuations in steel prices. While we have had steel pricing adjustment programs in place with most major OEMs, the price adjustment programs tend to lag behind the movement in steel costs and have generally not contemplated non-steel index related increases. 
Significant future volatility in the commodity markets or a deterioration in product demand may require us to pursue customer increases through surcharges or other pricing arrangements. In addition, if suppliers are inadequate for our needs, or if prices remain at current levels or increase and we are unable to either pass these prices to our customer base or otherwise mitigate the costs, our operating results could be further adversely affected.
We continuously work to address these competitive challenges by reducing costs and, as needed, restructuring operations. We manage supplier risk by conducting periodic assessments for all major suppliers and more frequent rigorous assessments of high-risk suppliers. On an ongoing basis, we monitor third-party financial statements, conduct surveys through supplier questionnaires, and conduct site visits. We have developed a supplier improvement process where we identify and develop actions to address ongoing financial, quality and delivery issues to further mitigate potential risk. We are proactive in managing our supplier relationships to avoid supply disruption. Our process employs dual sourcing and resourcing trigger points that cause us to take aggressive actions and then monitor the progress closely. 
Acquisitions, Divestitures and Restructuring

As described above, our business strategies are focused on enhancing our market position by continuously evaluating the competitive differentiation of our product portfolio, focusing on our strengths and core competencies, and growing the businesses that offer the most attractive returns. Implementing these strategies involves various types of strategic initiatives.

As part of our M2019 plan, we are evaluating acquisition opportunities that fit strategically with our core competencies and growth initiatives and regularly review the prospects of our existing businesses to determine whether any of them should be modified, restructured, sold or otherwise discontinued. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we closed on the sale of our interest in Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems to a subsidiary of our joint venture partner, WABCO Holdings Inc. (see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below). In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we also completed the acquisition of the product portfolio and related technologies of Fabco Holdings, Inc. (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below). In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we completed the acquisition of the majority of the assets of Sypris Solutions, Inc.’s Morganton, North Carolina trailer, axle beam and carrier manufacturing facility (see Note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below).
Restructuring Actions 
Aftermarket Actions: During the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we approved various restructuring plans in the North American and European Aftermarket businesses. We recorded $5 million of restructuring costs during the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 and $4 million of restructuring costs during fiscal year 2017. Restructuring actions associated with these plans were substantially complete as of September 30, 2017. 
Fourth Quarter 2016 Market Related Actions: In response to the decline in revenue in North America and South America, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we approved various headcount reduction plans targeting different areas of the business. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we incurred a total of $5 million in restructuring costs in the Commercial Truck & Industrial segment, $1 million in Aftermarket & Trailer segment and $2 million in their corporate locations. Restructuring actions with these plans were substantially complete as of September 30, 2017. 
Other Fiscal 2016 Actions: During the first half of fiscal year 2016, we recorded restructuring costs of $3 million primarily associated with a labor reduction program in China in the Commercial Truck & Industrial segment and a labor reduction program

in the Aftermarket & Trailer segment. Restructuring actions with these plans were substantially complete as of September 30, 2016. 
M2016 Footprint Actions: As part of our M2016 Strategy, during fiscal year 2013 we announced a North American footprint realignment action and a European shared services reorganization. In total, we eliminated approximately 140 hourly and salaried positions and incurred approximately $7 million of associated restructuring costs, primarily in the Commercial Truck & Industrial segment in connection with the consolidation of certain gearing and machining operations in North America and the closure of a North America manufacturing facility. Restructuring actions associated with these programs were substantially complete as of September 30, 2015.
South America Labor Reduction: During fiscal years 2014 and 2015, we completed a South America headcount reduction plan intended to reduce labor costs in response to softening economic conditions in the region. In response to decreasing production volumes in South America, we eliminated approximately 420 hourly and 40 salaried positions and incurred $13 million of restructuring costs, primarily severance benefits, in the Commercial Truck & Industrial segment. This plan was substantially complete as of September 30, 2015.
Closure of a Corporate Engineering Facility: During the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, we notified approximately 30 salaried and contract employees that their positions were being eliminated due to the planned closure of a corporate engineering facility. We recorded severance expenses of $2 million associated with this plan. Restructuring actions associated with this program were substantially complete as of September 30, 2015.
European Labor Reduction: During the second quarter of fiscal year 2015, we initiated a European headcount reduction plan intended to reduce labor costs in response to continued soft markets in the region. We eliminated approximately 20 hourly and 20 salaried positions and recorded $2 million of expected severance expenses in the Commercial Truck & Industrial segment in fiscal year 2015. Restructuring actions associated with this program were substantially complete as of June 30, 2015. 
Joint Ventures

As the industries in which we operate have become more globalized, joint ventures and other cooperative arrangements have become an important element of our business strategies. These strategic alliances provide for sales, product design, development and manufacturing in certain product and geographic areas. As of September 30, 2017, our continuing operations participated in the following non-consolidated joint ventures:

 | Key Products | Country
Master Sistemas Automotivos Limitada | Braking systems | Brazil 
Sistemas Automotrices de Mexico S.A. de C.V. | Axles, drivelines and brakes | Mexico 
Ege Fren Sanayii ve Ticaret A.S. | Braking systems | Turkey 
Automotive Axles Limited | Rear drive axle assemblies and braking systems | India 

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017, we closed on the sale of our interest in Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems to a subsidiary of our joint venture partner, WABCO Holdings Inc. Aggregate sales of our non-consolidated joint ventures, including Meritor WABCO Vehicle Control Systems, were $1,156 million, $1,101 million and $1,288 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, our consolidated financial statements include the financial position and operating results of those joint ventures in which we have control. For additional information on our unconsolidated joint ventures and percentage ownership thereof see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below. 
Research and Development

We have significant research, development, engineering and product design capabilities. We spent $69 million in fiscal year 2017, $68 million in fiscal year 2016 and $69 million in fiscal year 2015 on company-sponsored research, development and engineering. We employ professional engineers and scientists globally and have additional engineering capabilities through contract arrangements in low-cost countries. We also have advanced technical centers in North America, South America, Europe and Asia Pacific (primarily in India and China).

Patents and Trademarks

We own or license many United States and foreign patents and patent applications in our engineering and manufacturing operations and other activities. While in the aggregate these patents and licenses are considered important to the operation of our businesses, management does not consider them of such importance that the loss or termination of any one of them would materially affect a business segment or Meritor as a whole.

Our registered trademarks for Meritor® and the Bull design are important to our business. Other significant trademarks owned by us include Euclid® and Trucktechnic® for aftermarket products.

Substantially all of our U.S.-held intellectual property rights are subject to a first-priority perfected security interest securing our obligations to the lenders under our credit facility. See Note 17 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below. 
Employees

At September 30, 2017, we had approximately 8,200 full-time employees (which includes consolidated joint ventures). At that date, 18 employees in the United States and Canada were covered by collective bargaining agreements. Most of our facilities outside of the United States and Canada are unionized. We strive to foster and maintain positive relationships with our hourly and salaried employees. 
Environmental Matters

Federal, state and local requirements relating to the discharge of substances into the environment, the disposal of hazardous wastes and other activities affecting the environment have, and will continue to have, an impact on our operations. We record liabilities for environmental issues in the accounting period in which they are considered to be probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. At environmental sites in which more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site, as well as an allocable share of costs related to insolvent parties or unidentified shares. At environmental sites in which we are the only potentially responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation before consideration of recovery from insurers or other third parties.

We have been designated as a potentially responsible party at nine Superfund sites, excluding sites as to which our records disclose no involvement or as to which our liability has been finally determined. In addition to Superfund sites, various other lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been asserted against us, alleging violations of federal, state and local environmental protection requirements or seeking remediation of alleged environmental impairments, principally at previously disposed-of properties. We have established reserves for these liabilities when they are considered to be probable and reasonably estimable. See Note 24 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below for information as to our estimates of the total reasonably possible costs we could incur and the amounts recorded as a liability as of September 30, 2017, and as to changes in environmental accruals during fiscal year 2017.

The process of estimating environmental liabilities is complex and dependent on physical and scientific data at the site, uncertainties as to remedies and technologies to be used, and the outcome of discussions with regulatory agencies. The actual amount of costs or damages for which we may be held responsible could materially exceed our current estimates because of uncertainties, including the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties, the success of the remediation and other factors that make it difficult to predict actual costs accurately. However, based on management's assessment, after consulting with Meritor's General Counsel and with outside advisors who specialize in environmental matters, and subject to the difficulties inherent in estimating these future costs, we believe that our expenditures for environmental capital investment and remediation necessary to comply with present regulations governing environmental protection and other expenditures for the resolution of environmental claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, in future periods, new laws and regulations, changes in remediation plans, advances in technology and additional information about the ultimate clean-up remedy could significantly change our estimates. Management cannot assess the possible effect of compliance with future requirements.

International Operations

We believe our international operations provide us with geographical diversity and help us to weather the cyclical nature of our business. Approximately 46 percent of our total assets as of September 30, 2017 and 47 percent of fiscal year 2017 sales from continuing operations were outside the U.S. See Note 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below for financial information by geographic area for the three fiscal years ended September 30, 2017.

Our international operations are subject to a number of risks inherent in operating abroad (see Item 1A. Risk Factors below). There can be no assurance that these risks will not have a material adverse impact on our ability to increase or maintain our foreign sales or on our financial condition or results of operations.

Our operations are also exposed to global market risks, including foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We have a foreign currency cash flow hedging program in place to help reduce the company’s exposure to changes in exchange rates. We use foreign currency forward contracts and options to manage the company’s exposures arising from foreign currency exchange risk. Gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency exposures are partially offset with gains and losses on the foreign currency forward contracts. It is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and, therefore, we hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk and Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data below.
Seasonality; Cyclicality

We may experience seasonal variations in the demand for our products, to the extent OEM vehicle production fluctuates. Historically, for most of our operations, demand has been somewhat lower in the quarters ended September 30 and December 31, when OEM plants may close for summer shutdowns and holiday periods or when there are fewer selling days during the quarter. Our aftermarket business and our operations in India and China generally experience seasonally higher demand in the quarters ending March 31 and June 30.

In addition, the industries in which we operate have been characterized historically by periodic fluctuations in overall demand for trucks, trailers and other specialty vehicles for which we supply products, resulting in corresponding fluctuations in demand for our products. Production and sales of the vehicles for which we supply products generally depend on economic conditions and a variety of other factors that are outside of our control, including freight tonnage, customer spending and preferences, vehicle age, labor relations and regulatory requirements. See Item 1A. Risk Factors below. Cycles in the major vehicle industry markets of North America and Europe are not necessarily concurrent or related. It is part of our strategy to continue to seek to expand our operations globally to help mitigate the effect of periodic fluctuations in demand of the vehicle industry in one or more particular countries.
See section Trends and Uncertainties in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis for estimated commercial truck production volumes for selected original equipment markets based on available sources and management's estimates.
