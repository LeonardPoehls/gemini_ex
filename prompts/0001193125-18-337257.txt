Diagnostics Segment 
 Overview of Products and Markets 
 Our largest source of revenues is clinical diagnostic products, with our Diagnostics segment providing 70% of consolidated net revenues for fiscal 2018. As of September 30, 2018, our Diagnostics segment had approximately 400 employees in seven countries. 
 Our clinical diagnostic products provide accuracy, simplicity and speed; enable early diagnosis and treatment of common, acute medical conditions; and provide for better patient outcomes at reduced costs. We target diagnostics for disease states that: (i) are conditions where rapid diagnosis impacts patient outcomes; (ii) have opportunistic demographic and disease profiles; (iii) are underserved by current diagnostic products; and/or (iv) have difficult sample handling requirements (e.g., stool). This approach has allowed us to establish significant market share in our target disease states, gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses, and tests for elevated lead levels in blood.

 Our clinical diagnostic products span a broad menu of testing platforms and technologies, and also include transport media that store and preserve specimen samples from patient collection to laboratory testing. Our testing platforms include: 
 

 | Isothermal DNA Amplification (Alethia brand, formerly illumigene)  high sensitivity, molecular platform that is suitable for virtually any moderately-complex laboratory, whether centralized or decentralized; provides flexibility to process from 1 to 10 tests per run in generally under one hour; and requires no batching of samples.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Rapid Immunoassay (ImmunoCard and ImmunoCard STAT! brands)  single-use immunoassays that have fast turnaround times (generally under 20 minutes); and can reduce expensive send-outs for hospitals and outpatient clinics.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Enzyme-linked Immunoassay (PREMIER brand)  batch immunoassay platform that can process up to 96 tests per run; is highly accurate and economical; and is adaptable to automation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Anodic Stripping Voltammetry (LeadCare brand)  electrical chemical sensor platform for quantitative determination of lead levels in blood.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our clinical diagnostic products are comprised of products used principally in the detection of infectious diseases caused by various bacteria, viruses, parasites and pathogens, along with the LeadCare brand of tests for quantitative determination of blood lead levels. These products are grouped into the following product families: 
 Gastrointestinal Assays 
 Includes tests for the following, among others: C. difficile, Enterohemorrhagic E. coli, Campylobacter jejuni (Campy), H. pylori, Cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, and calprotectin.
Respiratory Illness Assays

 Our current research and development pipeline for immunoassay products includes a new instrument that utilizes fluorescent chemistry, which improves workflow and test result readability. This new platform is being branded under the Curian name. During fiscal 2019, we expect to submit a 510(k) to the FDA for one or more rapid immunoassay tests for use with the Curian instrument. We expect to develop additional rapid immunoassay tests for use with the Curian instrument beyond 2019. Our current research and development pipeline for molecular products includes a combination test for the detection of H. pylori and the resistance of one or more antibiotics. Our congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) test is currently awaiting FDA 510(k) clearance. 
 Market Trends 
 The global market for infectious disease tests continues to expand as new disease states are identified, new therapies become available, and worldwide standards of living and access to health care improve. More importantly, within this market, there is a continuing shift from conventional testing, which requires highly trained personnel and lengthy turnaround times for test results, to more technologically advanced testing, which can be performed by less highly trained personnel and completed in minutes or hours. 
 The growing global pressures to contain total health care costs have accelerated the increased use of diagnostic testing. With rapid and accurate diagnoses of infectious diseases, physicians can pinpoint appropriate therapies quickly, leading to faster recovery, shorter hospital stays and lower overall treatment cost. Integrated Delivery Networks (IDNs) in our U.S. market have the goal of increasing the efficiency of health care delivery, reducing spending and improving clinical outcomes. We believe our product portfolio positions us competitively with IDNs and health care systems that are transitioning from fee-for-service compensation models to value-based reimbursement. Our C. difficile, Group B Streptococcus, Group A Streptococcus and H. pylori products are all examples of how a highly accurate diagnostic test on the front end can mitigate or reduce down-stream costs of antibiotic use, symptom-relieving drugs and hospital stays. 
 We also continue to see aggregation of buying power in our U.S. market via multi-hospital group purchasing organizations and IDNs, consolidation among reference laboratories, hospital laboratories being operated by large reference laboratories, and acquisition of physician practices by hospitals, health systems and for-profit specialty health care companies. 
 Cost containment pressures have also affected health care systems outside the U.S., particularly in Europe, where the health care systems are generally government-run. The level of government budget deficits can have an adverse effect on the amount of government health care spend.

 Sales, Marketing and Distribution 
 Our Diagnostics segments sales and distribution network consists of the following for each of the broad geographic regions we serve: 
 Americas
In the Americas, our sales and distribution network consists of a direct sales force complemented by independent distributors. The use of independent distributors allows our products to reach any size health care facility and also provides our customers the option to purchase our products directly from Meridian or through an authorized distributor. Two independent distributors accounted for 10% or more of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016: Cardinal Healthcare Corporation (Cardinal) and Thermo Fisher Scientific (Fisher). Our Diagnostics segment revenues from Cardinal were approximately $21,000, $22,000 and $20,000 during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Diagnostics segment revenues from Fisher were approximately $22,000, $18,000 and $20,000 during fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. 
 EMEA
In Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), our sales and distribution network consists of direct sales personnel in Belgium, France and Italy, and independent distributors in other European countries, Africa and the Middle East. We maintain a distribution center near Milan, Italy. 
 ROW
With the exception of Australia and China, where we utilize direct sales personnel, we utilize independent distributors throughout the rest of the world (ROW). 
 Competition 
 Our major competitors in molecular diagnostics are Cepheid (acquired by Danaher) and Becton Dickinson, which have systems with multiple-assay menus. We also face competition in molecular diagnostics, but to a lesser degree, from companies such as Abbott (Alere) and Quidel. 
 Our major competitors in rapid immunoassay diagnostics are primarily Abbott (Alere) and Quidel. In recent years, companies such as BioMerieux have captured market share in our gastrointestinal category via multi-plex panel tests. However, since their introduction to the market, payors have begun to raise concerns over reimbursement levels relative to clinical utility. For blood lead testing, we believe we have the only FDA-cleared, CLIA-waived point-of-care test available commercially. Other blood lead testing systems in use, marketed by our competitors, include Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy, which requires a highly-skilled technician and larger laboratory space to operate, in addition to not being portable or suitable for point-of-care use. We believe that with the breadth and depth of our product portfolio, we are well positioned for the clinical laboratory.

 Research and Development 
 Our Diagnostics segments research and development organization for infectious disease products is located at our corporate headquarters in Newtown, Ohio, a suburb of Cincinnati, and has expertise in biochemistry, immunology, mycology, bacteriology, virology, parasitology, and molecular biology. Our blood-chemistry products have a dedicated research and development team in Billerica, Massachusetts. Our research and development activities are focused on new product and new technology development, new applications for our existing technologies, and improvements to existing products. Research and development efforts may occur in-house or with collaborative partners. We believe that new product development is a key source for sustaining revenue growth. The products within our Alethia molecular platform, H. pylori product family and blood lead testing family were developed solely in-house, or substantially so. See Operating Expenses section within MD&A on page 39. 
 Manufacturing 
 Our immunoassay and molecular assay products require the production of highly specialized reagents, primers and enzymes. We produce the vast majority of our own immunoassay requirements. Primers for our Alethia molecular assay products are purchased from outside vendors. Our blood lead testing products require the production of electrical chemical sensors, which we manufacture using critical raw materials purchased from outside vendors. We believe that we have sufficient manufacturing and sourcing capacity for anticipated growth over the next several years. 
Intellectual Property, Patents and Licenses 
 We own or license U.S. and foreign patents, most of which are for select products manufactured by our Diagnostics segment. These patents are used in our manufacturing processes for select products (e.g., method patents) or may relate to the design of the test device technology format (e.g., design patents). In the absence of patent protection, we may be vulnerable to competitors who successfully replicate our production and manufacturing technologies and processes. Our employees are required to sign confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements designed to protect our proprietary products. 
 The patents for our Alethia products, which represented 16%, 17% and 20% of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, are licensed from a third party, Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., under a non-exclusive license agreement and expire between 2020 and 2022. These patents were issued in the U.S., European Community and other countries. The term of our license agreement runs until the last patent expires in 2022, at which point we will be free to practice the patents without any restriction or royalty obligation.

 The patents for our H. pylori products, owned by us and which represented approximately 16%, 15% and 16% of consolidated revenues for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, expired in May 2016 in the U.S. and in May 2017 in countries outside the U.S. We expect competition with respect to our H. pylori products to increase in the near future, and such competition may have an adverse impact on our selling prices for these products, or our ability to retain business at prices acceptable to us, and consequently, adversely affect our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. Our product development pipeline includes new product initiatives for the detection of H. pylori, and we recently entered into a strategic collaboration with DiaSorin to sell H. pylori tests. We have executed multi-year supply agreements with our two largest reference laboratory customers for H. pylori tests to secure volume, albeit at lower selling prices. We are unable to provide assurances that we will be successful with any strategy or that any strategy will prevent an adverse effect on our future results of operations and liquidity, including revenues and gross profit. 
 Government Regulation 
 Our diagnostic products are regulated by the FDA as devices pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes (i.e., Class I, II or III). Class I and II devices are not expressly approved by the FDA, but, instead, are cleared for marketing. Class III devices generally must receive pre-market approval from the FDA as to safety and effectiveness. Our diagnostics manufacturing facilities in Cincinnati and Billerica are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA. See page 32 within MD&A for discussion regarding the FDAs inspection of our Billerica facility. 
 Each of the diagnostic products currently marketed by us in the United States has been cleared by the FDA pursuant to the 510(k) clearance process or is exempt from such requirements. We believe that most, but not all, products under development will be classified as Class I or II medical devices and, in the case of most of our Class I and all Class II devices, will be eligible for 510(k) clearance; however, we can make no assurances in this regard. 
 Sales of our diagnostic products in foreign countries are subject to foreign government regulation, which is similar to that of the FDA. 
 Our Diagnostics facilities are certified to ISO 13485:2016. 
 Seasonal Factors and Sporadic Outbreaks 
 Our principal business is the sale of a broad range of clinical diagnostic test kits for common gastrointestinal and respiratory infectious diseases, and elevated blood lead levels. Certain infectious diseases may be seasonal in nature, while others may be associated with sporadic outbreaks, such as foodborne illnesses or pandemics such as an influenza outbreak. While we believe that the breadth of our diagnostic product lines reduces the risk that infections subject to seasonality and sporadic outbreaks will cause significant variability in diagnostic revenues, we can make no assurance that revenues will not be impacted period over period by such factors.

 Life Science Segment 
 Overview of Products and Markets 
 Our Life Science segment focuses on the development, manufacture, sale and distribution of bulk antigens, antibodies, PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides, competent cells, and bioresearch reagents used by researchers, agri-bio companies and other diagnostic manufacturing companies. As of September 30, 2018, our Life Science segment had approximately 185 employees in five countries. 
 Most of the revenues for our Life Science segment currently come from the manufacture, sale and distribution of bulk antigens, antibodies, PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides, competent cells, and bioresearch reagents used by other diagnostic manufacturing companies focused on the development of immunoassay and molecular assay tests. Approximately 76% of Life Science revenues are generated from the industrial market, defined as diagnostic manufacturers. This continues to be an increasing focus for our molecular reagent products, which historically have been marketed to the academic/research customers that comprise the remaining 24% of Life Science revenues. We utilize direct sales teams in key countries such as the U.S., the U.K., France, Germany, and Australia. In order to further pursue revenue opportunities in Asia, and China in particular, during fiscal 2017 we established a wholly foreign owned enterprise (WFOE) location in Beijing, China, after having operated a representative office there since fiscal 2015. The WFOE employs a business development staff and imports product for sale to customers in China. We utilize a network of distributors in other major countries. During fiscal 2018, 18% of third-party revenues for this segment were from two diagnostic manufacturing customers. 
 Products such as antibodies, antigens and reagents are marketed primarily to diagnostic manufacturing customers as a source of raw materials for their immunoassay products, or as an outsourced step in their manufacturing processes. For example, we supply a number of major diagnostic manufacturers with proteins used to detect hepatitis A virus and rubella virus. These products are typically sold in bulk quantities, and may also be custom-designed for a particular manufacturers requirements. Sales efforts are focused on multi-year supply arrangements in order to provide stability in volumes and pricing. We believe this benefits both us and our customers. 
 Molecular biology products such as PCR/qPCR reagents, nucleotides and competent cells are marketed to academic/research and industrial customers. These products are used in measuring DNA and RNA in human, animal, plant and environmental applications. These reagents improve the purity, yield and speed of PCR reactions. Products such as MyTaq and SensiFAST are examples of this type of PCR/qPCR reagent. 
 Market Trends 
 As certain global markets become increasingly accessible to us, most notably the Asia-Pacific region, geographic expansion continues to be a significant strategy for our Life Science segment, along with further penetration into industrial markets with our molecular component products.

 Competition 
 The market for bulk biomedical reagents is highly competitive. Important competitive factors include product quality, price, customer service and reputation. We face competitors, many of which have greater financial, research and development, sales and marketing, and manufacturing resources, and where sole-source supply arrangements do not exist. Customers also may choose to manufacture their biomedical reagents in-house rather than purchase from outside vendors such as Meridian. 
 The academic/research market is highly fragmented. Individual purchases are typically of small quantities. The breadth of product offerings, quality, price and service, including on-line capabilities and technical resources, are important factors to building customer loyalty and repeat purchases. 
 Research and Development 
 The focus of this research and development activity is development of new molecular and immunological reagent products. See Operating Expenses section within MD&A on page 39. 
 Manufacturing and Government Regulation 
 Our Life Science facilities are ISO 13485:2016 certified. Additionally, where appropriate, our Life Science facilities comply with Regulation EC 1069:2009. 
 Acquisitions 
 Acquisitions have played an important role in the growth of our businesses. Our acquisition objectives include, among other things: (i) enhancing product offerings; (ii) improving product distribution capabilities; (iii) providing access to new markets; and/or (iv) providing access to key biologicals or new technologies that lead to new products. Although we cannot provide assurance that we will consummate additional acquisitions in the future, nor can we provide assurance that any acquisitions will accomplish these objectives, we expect that the potential for acquisitions will continue to provide opportunities for revenue and earnings growth in the future. 
 During March 2016, we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of Magellan. Details of the Magellan acquisition are set forth in Note 3 of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 International Markets 
 International markets are an important source of revenues and future growth opportunities for both of our segments. For both segments combined, revenues from customers located outside of the Americas approximated $66,000 or 31% of consolidated fiscal 2018 revenues, $61,000 or 30% of consolidated fiscal 2017 revenues, and $53,000 or 27% of consolidated fiscal 2016 revenues. We expect to continue to look to key European markets and China as a source of revenue growth in the future.

 Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates since fiscal 2017 had an approximate $2,200 favorable impact on fiscal 2018 revenues; $1,400 within the Diagnostics segment and $800 within the Life Science segment. This compares to year-to-year currency exchange rates having an approximate $1,200 unfavorable impact on revenues in fiscal 2017; $400 within the Diagnostics segment and $800 within the Life Science segment. Due to natural hedge relationships with expenses, both cost of sales and operating expenses, the overall impact of exchange rate fluctuations on operating income was not significant during fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016. 
 Environmental 
 We are in compliance with applicable portions of the federal and state hazardous waste regulations and have never been a party to any environmental proceeding.
