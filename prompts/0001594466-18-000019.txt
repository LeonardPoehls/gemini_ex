ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Parsley Energy, Inc. (either individually or together with its subsidiaries, as the context requires, “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) was formed in December 2013 to succeed our predecessor, which began operations in August 2008 when it acquired operator rights to wells producing from the Spraberry Trend in the Midland Basin from Joe Parsley, a co-founder of Parker and Parsley Petroleum Company. 
We are an independent oil and natural gas company focused on the acquisition and development of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the Permian Basin. The Permian Basin is located in West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico and is comprised of three primary sub-areas: the Midland Basin, the Central Basin Platform and the Delaware Basin. These areas are characterized by high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple vertical and horizontal target horizons, extensive production histories, long-lived reserves and historically high drilling success rates. Our properties are located in the Midland and Delaware Basins, where, given the associated returns, we focus predominantly on horizontal development drilling.
As of December 31, 2017, we had an average working interest of 81% in 372 gross (282.6 net) horizontal wells, of which 319 gross (241.0 net) are in the Midland Basin. As of December 31, 2017, we operated 80% of the horizontal wells in which we have an interest and had the rights to develop 351,857 gross (219,747 net) acres in the Permian Basin, with approximately 301,160 gross (174,392 net) acres located in the Midland Basin and 50,697 gross (45,355 net) acres located in the Delaware Basin. 
We intend to grow our reserves and production through the drilling and development of our multi-year inventory of identified drilling locations. As of December 31, 2017, we have identified 12,303 gross (8,040 net) potential horizontal drilling locations on our existing acreage.
The following table summarizes our net leasehold acreage and technically identified horizontal drilling locations as of December 31, 2017:

Area (1) | Net Acreage | Net Identified Drilling Locations (2) | | Average Lateral Length
Midland Basin (3) | 174,392 | | 7,225 | | 6,624
Delaware Basin (4) | 45,355 | | 815 | | 8,333
Total Permian Basin | 219,747 | | 8,040 | | 7,479


(1) | Please see “Item 2. Properties.” 
(2) | We have estimated our drilling locations based on well spacing assumptions for the areas in which we operate and other criteria. The drilling locations on which we actually drill will depend on the availability of capital, regulatory approvals, commodity prices, costs, actual drilling results and other factors. Any drilling activities we are able to conduct on these identified locations may not be successful and may not result in our adding additional proved reserves to our existing proved reserves. See also ‘’Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
(3) | Our horizontal location count in the Midland Basin assumes 660’ to 990’ between well spacing, which is equivalent to five to eight wells per 640-acre section per target interval. The ultimate spacing may be less than these amounts, which would result in a higher location count, or greater than these amounts, which would result in a lower location count. 
(4) | Our target horizontal location count in the Delaware Basin assumes 660’ to 1,320’ between well spacing which is equivalent to four to eight wells per 640-acre section per target interval. The ultimate spacing may be less than these amounts, which would result in a higher location count, or greater than these amounts, which would result in a lower location count. 

At December 31, 2017, our estimated proved oil, natural gas and NGLs reserves were 416.4 MMBoe based on an internal reserve report prepared by our internal staff of petroleum engineers and audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our independent reserve engineers. Of these reserves, approximately 50% are classified as proved developed producing. Based on this report, at December 31, 2017, our proved developed reserves were approximately 57% oil, 19% natural gas and 24% NGLs. These calculated percentages include proved developed non-producing reserves.

Our 2018 budget for capital development expenditures is approximately 1,350.0 million to $1,550.0 million, 85% to 90% of which is expected to be used for drilling and completions and 10% to 15% of which is expected to be used for infrastructure and other expenditures. We expect approximately 20% of the total budget to be associated with drilling and completions for proved undeveloped reserves as of December 31, 2017. Our capital budget excludes any amounts that may be paid for acquisitions. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, our aggregate drilling and completion expenditures were $1,049.6 million and $401.6 million, respectively, and our infrastructure and other expenditures were $157.8 million and $94.4 million, respectively, for totals of $1,207.4 million and $496.0 million, respectively. Of these totals, $65.1 million and $53.2 million were associated with drilling, completions and facility buildout for proved undeveloped reserves for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The amount and timing of 2018 capital expenditures is largely discretionary and within our control. We could choose to defer a portion of these planned 2018 capital expenditures depending on a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the success of our drilling activities, prevailing and anticipated prices for oil and natural gas, the availability of necessary equipment, infrastructure and capital, the receipt and timing of required regulatory permits and approvals, seasonal conditions, drilling and acquisition costs and the level of participation by other working interest owners.
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to increase stockholder value through the following:

• | Grow reserves, production and cash flow by developing our liquids rich resource base. We intend to selectively develop our acreage base in an effort to maximize its value and resource potential. We intend to pursue drilling opportunities offering competitive returns that we believe are supported by production history and industry activity in the area and repeatable as a result of well-defined geological properties over a large area. Through the conversion of our resource base to developed reserves, we will seek to increase our reserves, production and cash flow while generating favorable returns on invested capital.


• | Improve operational and cost efficiency by maintaining control of our production. We currently operate approximately 80% of the horizontal wells in which we have an interest and intend to maintain operational control of substantially all of our producing properties. We believe that retaining control of our production will enable us to more efficiently manage the pace of drilling and completion activities, increase recovery rates, lower well costs, improve drilling performance and increase ultimate hydrocarbon recovery through optimization of our drilling and completion techniques. Our management team regularly evaluates our operating results against those of other operators in the area in an effort to improve our performance and implement best practices. Our average horizontal working interest of 81% allows us to realize the majority of the benefits of these activities and cost efficiencies.


• | Optimizing and high-grading our leasehold position. We regularly evaluate and complete acquisitions of undeveloped leasehold and producing properties that meet our strategic and financial objectives in the ordinary course of our business, while selectively adding to maintain adequate inventory life. Our acreage position extends through what we believe are multiple oil and natural gas producing stratigraphic horizons in the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin, and we believe we can economically and efficiently add and integrate additional acreage into our current operations. We have a proven history of acquiring leasehold positions in the Permian Basin that have substantial oil-weighted resource potential and believe our management team’s extensive experience operating in the Midland Basin and Delaware Basin provides us with a competitive advantage in identifying leasing opportunities and acquisition targets and evaluating resource potential during 2018.


• | Maintain financial flexibility. We intend to maintain a conservative financial position to allow us to develop our exploration, drilling and production activities and maximize the present value of our oil-weighted resource potential. We intend to fund our growth with cash flow from operations, liquidity under our Revolving Credit Agreement (defined herein) and access to capital markets over time. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $1,700.8 million of liquidity, including $703.5 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Our borrowing base under the Revolving Credit Agreement currently stands at $1.8 billion, with a commitment level of $1.0 billion. There were no borrowings outstanding and $2.7 million in letters of credit outstanding under our Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017, resulting in availability of $997.3 million. Consistent with our disciplined approach to financial management, we have an active commodity hedging program through which we seek to hedge a meaningful portion of our expected oil production, reducing our exposure to downside commodity price fluctuations and enabling us to protect cash flows and maintain liquidity to fund our capital program and investment opportunities.

Our Strengths 
We believe that the following strengths will help us achieve our business goals:

• | Extensive horizontal development potential. We believe that the majority of our acreage offers stacked pay potential to develop oil and natural gas from several prospective target zones, including, depending on the area, the Spraberry, Wolfcamp, and Bone Spring, and further, that some of these target zones may be characterized by sufficient thickness and resource potential to accommodate more than one pay interval per zone. Through December 31, 2017, we had drilled and completed 231 gross (216.2 net) horizontal wells in the Midland Basin and 37 gross (35.6 net) horizontal wells in the Delaware Basin. As of December 31, 2017, we had an inventory of 12,303 gross (8,040 net) identified horizontal drilling locations.


• | Established resource base and acreage position in the core of the Permian Basin. Our production is exclusively from the Permian Basin in West Texas, an area that has supported production since the 1940s. The Permian Basin has well established infrastructure from historical operations, and we believe it also benefits from a relatively stable regulatory environment that has been established over time. As of December 31, 2017, our estimated net proved reserves were composed of approximately 60% oil and 18% natural gas, and 22% NGLs.


• | Incentivized management team with substantial technical and operational expertise. Our management team has a proven track record of executing on multi-rig development drilling programs and has extensive experience in the Spraberry and Wolfberry Trends of the Permian Basin. Our Chief Executive Officer, Bryan Sheffield, is a third generation oil and natural gas executive, and our management team has an average of 21 years of experience. We have also assembled a robust technical team of petroleum engineers and geologists with an average of 14 years of experience, which we believe will be of strategic importance as we continue to expand our future exploration and development plans. As of December 31, 2017, our executive officers held approximately 13.0% of our outstanding equity interests. We believe the existence of this significant management ownership position provides meaningful incentive to increase the value of our business for the benefit of all stockholders.


• | Operating control over substantially all our horizontal production. As of December 31, 2017, we operated approximately 80% of the horizontal wells in which we have an interest, which translates to a vast majority of our 2017 production. We believe that maintaining control of our production enables us to dictate the pace of development and better manage the cost, type and timing of exploration and development activities.


• | Conservative balance sheet. We expect to maintain financial flexibility that will allow us to continue our development activities and selectively pursue acquisitions. As of December 31, 2017, we had $997.3 million of available borrowing capacity under our Revolving Credit Agreement, with no borrowings currently outstanding thereunder. We believe this borrowing capacity, along with cash on hand and cash flow from operations, will provide us with sufficient liquidity to execute our current capital program.

Recent Events
5.625% Senior Unsecured Notes due 2027 
On October 11, 2017, Parsley Energy, LLC (“Parsley LLC”) and Parsley Finance Corp. (“Finance Corp.”) issued $700.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (the “2027 Notes”) in an offering that was exempt from registration under the Securities Act (the “2027 Notes Offering”). The 2027 Notes Offering resulted in net proceeds to us, after deducting the initial purchasers’ discount and offering expenses, of approximately $692.1 million. These net proceeds are being used to fund a portion of our capital program and for general corporate purposes.
Fifth Amendment to Revolving Credit Facility
On October 11, 2017, the Company, Parsley LLC, as borrower, each of the guarantors thereto, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, and the other lenders party thereto entered into the Fifth Amendment (the “Fifth Amendment”) to our revolving credit agreement (as amended, the “Revolving Credit Agreement”). The Fifth Amendment, among other things, modified the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement to (i) increase the borrowing base from $1.225 billion (to which it was reduced in connection with the closing of the 2027 Notes Offering) to $1.8 billion (although the aggregate elected commitments remained at $1.0 billion), (ii) decrease the applicable margins for borrowings to a range of (A) 1.5% to 2.5% for LIBOR based borrowings and (B) 0.5% to 1.5% for alternative base rate based borrowings, with the specific 
8

applicable margins determined by reference to borrowing base utilization, (iii) provide flexibility, subject to certain conditions, to enter into “reverse 1031 exchanges” under Section 1031 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (iv) provide enhanced flexibility, subject to certain dollar limitations, to make investments in unrestricted subsidiaries and joint ventures and to make other investments, and (v) provide enhanced flexibility, subject to certain conditions, to dispose of oil and gas properties not evaluated in the reserve reports delivered to the lenders pursuant to the Revolving Credit Agreement.
CEO Succession Plan
On January 9, 2018, we announced a succession plan pursuant to which our current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Bryan Sheffield, will serve as Chief Executive Officer through the end of 2018, in the newly-created position of Executive Chairman throughout 2019, and as Chairman of the Board thereafter. Matt Gallagher, our President and Chief Operating Officer, will succeed Mr. Sheffield as Chief Executive Officer, effective January 1, 2019, and was appointed to our board of directors concurrent with the announcement.
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
On December 22, 2017, Public Law No. 115-97, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), was enacted by the U.S. government. The Tax Act significantly impacts our 2017 effective tax rate and makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. corporate income tax code. Among other changes, the Tax Act: (i) reduces the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; (ii) repeals the corporate alternative minimum tax and provides for a refund of previously accrued alternative minimum tax credits; (iii) modifies the provisions relating to the limitations on deductions for executive compensation of publicly traded corporations; (iv) enacts new limitations regarding the deductibility of interest expense and (v) imposes new limitations on the utilization of net operating losses arising in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017.
GAAP requires that the impact of tax legislation be recognized in the period in which the law was enacted. As a result of the Tax Act, we remeasured our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the federal income and state income tax rates at which they are now expected to reverse, and they now generally reflect a federal income tax rate of 21%. The enacted rate change resulted in a noncash increase of approximately $23.9 million to our income tax provision, a corresponding reduction of $23.9 million to our net noncurrent deferred tax asset balance and a reduction in valuation allowance of $24.3 million December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we have not finalized our accounting for the tax effect of the Tax Act. However, as described in Note 10—Income Taxes in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, we have made a reasonable estimate of the tax effect of the Tax Act, including the impact on existing deferred tax balances. Any adjustments recorded to these estimates through 2018 will be included in income from operations as an adjustment to tax expense. The ultimate impact of the Tax Act may differ from our estimates based on our further analysis of the new law and additional regulatory guidance that may be issued. Further, the amount of our future federal income tax will be dependent upon our future taxable income.
Organizational Structure
We are a holding company that was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on December 11, 2013 for the purpose of facilitating our initial public offering (the “IPO”) and to become the sole managing member of Parsley LLC. As of December 31, 2017, our sole material asset consists of 252,260,300 PE Units, constituting a controlling equity interest in Parsley LLC.
After the effective date of the registration statement but prior to the completion of the IPO, the limited liability company agreement of Parsley LLC was amended and restated to modify its capital structure by replacing the different classes of interests previously held by Parsley LLC owners with a single new class of units called “PE Units.” In addition, each holder of PE Units (“PE Unit Holder”) received one share of our Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class B Common Stock”). Pursuant to such amended and restated limited liability company agreement (as subsequently amended and restated by the Second Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement, the “Parsley LLC Agreement”), the PE Unit Holders generally have the right to exchange (the “Exchange Right”) their PE Units (and a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock), for shares of our Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Class A Common Stock”) at an exchange ratio of one share of Class A Common Stock for each PE Unit (and a corresponding number of shares of Class B Common Stock) exchanged (subject to conversion rate adjustments for stock splits, stock dividends and reclassifications), or, if either we or Parsley LLC so elects, cash (the “Cash Option”). In addition, in connection with the IPO, on May 29, 2014, we entered into a Tax Receivable Agreement (the “TRA”) with Parsley LLC and the initial PE Unit Holders and certain other holders of equity in us (each such person, a “TRA Holder”). This agreement generally provides for the payment by us to a TRA Holder of 85% of the net cash savings, if any, in U.S. federal, state or local income tax that we actually realize (or are deemed 
9

to realize in certain circumstances) in periods after our IPO as a result of (i) any tax basis increases resulting from the contribution in connection with our IPO by such TRA Holder of all or a portion of its PE Units to us in exchange for shares of Class A Common Stock, (ii) the tax basis increases resulting from the exchange by such TRA Holder of PE Units for shares of Class A Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Right (or resulting from an exchange of PE Units for cash pursuant to the Cash Option) and (iii) imputed interest deemed to be paid by us as a result of, and additional tax basis arising from, any payments we make under the TRA. We will retain the benefit of the remaining 15% of these cash savings. See “Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
As a result of the IPO and the related reorganization transactions, we became the sole managing member of and have a controlling equity interest in Parsley LLC. As the sole managing member of Parsley LLC, we operate and control all of the business and affairs of Parsley LLC and, through Parsley LLC and its subsidiaries, conduct our business. We consolidate the financial and operating results of Parsley LLC and its subsidiaries and record noncontrolling interests for the economic interest in Parsley LLC held by the PE Unit Holders.

(1) | Average prices shown in the table reflect prices both before and after the effects of our realized commodity hedging transactions. Our calculation of such effects includes both realized gains and losses on cash settlements for commodity derivative transactions and premiums paid or received on options that settled during the period. 
(2) | Approximately 88%, 90% and 98% of our total estimated proved reserves as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, were attributable to the Midland Basin. Our production from the Midland Basin was 21,641 MBoe (14,082 MBbls oil, 20,835 MMcf natural gas, 4,087 MBbls natural gas liquids), 13,222 MBoe (8,693 MBbls oil, 13,134 MMcf natural gas, 2,340 MBbls natural gas liquids) and 7,952 MBoe (4,740 MBbls oil, 10,309 MMcf natural gas, 1,494 MBbls natural gas liquids) for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Productive Wells
As of December 31, 2017, we owned an average 81% working interest in 372 gross (282.6 net) productive horizontal wells. As of December 31, 2017, we owned an average 61% working interest in 1,532 gross (749.0 net) productive vertical wells. Productive wells consist of producing wells and wells capable of production, including oil wells awaiting connection to production facilities. Gross wells are the total number of producing wells in which we have an interest and net wells are the sum of our fractional working interests owned in gross wells. As of December 31, 2017, we owned an immaterial number of productive wells related to the production of natural gas.
11

Well Operations
As of December 31, 2017, we operated approximately 80% of the horizontal wells in which we have an interest. As operator, we design and manage the development of a well and supervise operation and maintenance activities on a day-to-day basis. Independent contractors engaged by us provide all the equipment and personnel associated with these activities. We employ petroleum engineers, geologists and land professionals who work to improve production rates, increase reserves and lower the cost of operating our oil and natural gas properties.
Marketing and Customers
We market the majority of the production from properties we operate for both our account and the account of the other working interest owners in these properties. We sell our production to purchasers at market prices.
We normally sell production to a relatively small number of customers, as is customary in the exploration, development and production business. For the year ended December 31, 2017, two purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during the period: Shell Trading (US) Company (“Shell”) and Targa Pipeline Mid-Continent, LLC (“Targa”). For the year ended December 31, 2016, three purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during the period: Shell, BML, Inc. (“BML”) and Targa. For the year ended December 31, 2015, four purchasers each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during the period: Shell, BML, Targa and Transoil Marketing, LLC. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenue during these periods. If a major customer decided to stop purchasing oil and natural gas from us, our revenue could decline and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed. However, we believe that the loss of any one or all of our major purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers. Please see Note 2—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies—Significant Customers to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information.
Transportation
During the initial development of our fields, we consider all gathering and delivery infrastructure in the areas of our production. Our oil is transported from the wellhead to our tank batteries by our gathering systems. The purchaser then transports the oil by truck or pipeline to a tank farm, another pipeline or a refinery. Our natural gas is transported from the wellhead to the purchaser’s meter and pipeline interconnection point through our gathering systems.
In addition, we move the majority of our produced water by pipeline connected to our operated salt water disposal wells rather than by truck. However, due to the inaccessibility of certain of our wells, some produced water will likely always be required to be taken away by truck.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we entered into a contract with a private midstream company that provides for firm pipeline transportation from our acreage in Reagan, Upton and Midland Counties, Texas to Crane, Colorado City and Midland, Texas, which enables us to choose from multiple destinations for a substantial portion of our crude oil production. 
During the year ended December 31, 2017, we entered into a contract that provides firm transportation off one of the pipeline systems through which we transport or sell crude oil. Under this contract, we are committed to deliver minimum average volumes of 45,000 Bbls/day from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 and 37,500 Bbls/day from January 1, 2019 to June 30, 2020. Satisfaction of the volume requirements includes volumes produced by us and other third-party working, royalty, and overriding royalty interest owners whose volumes we market on their behalf. Our consolidated statements of operations reflect our share of firm transportation costs. This contract requires us to pay a deficiency fee if we fail to deliver the required volumes.
As of December 31, 2017, approximately 69% of our gross oil production was being transported by these pipeline systems and sold under these agreements. We do not believe, however, that the termination of either of these agreements would materially impact our operating results, as crude oil and natural gas are fungible products with well-established markets and numerous purchasers. We expect to fulfill our delivery commitments for the next one to three years with existing proved developed and proved undeveloped reserves, which we regularly monitor to ensure sufficient availability. In addition, we monitor our current production, our anticipated future production and our future development plans in order to meet our delivery commitments. If production is not sufficient to meet contractual delivery commitments, we may purchase commodities in the market to satisfy our delivery commitments.
12

Competition
The oil and natural gas industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and natural gas, but also carry on midstream and refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects or to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low oil and natural gas market prices. Our larger or more integrated competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, because we have fewer financial and human resources than many companies in our industry, we may be at a disadvantage in bidding for exploratory prospects and producing oil and natural gas properties.
There is also competition between oil and natural gas producers and other industries producing energy and fuel. Furthermore, competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and/or regulation considered from time to time by the governments of the United States and the jurisdictions in which we operate. It is not possible to predict the nature of any such legislation or regulation which may ultimately be adopted or its effects upon our future operations. Such laws and regulations may substantially increase the costs of exploring for, developing or producing oil and natural gas and may prevent or delay the commencement or continuation of a given operation. Our larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of existing, and any changes to, federal, state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can, which would adversely affect our competitive position.
Segment Information and Geographic Area
Operating segments are defined under GAAP as components of an enterprise that (i) engage in activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses (ii) for which separate operational financial information is available and is regularly evaluated by the chief operating decision maker for the purpose of allocating resources and assessing performance. 
Based on our organization and management, we have only one reportable operating segment, which is oil and natural gas exploration and production. We consider drilling rig services ancillary to our oil and natural gas exploration and producing activities and manage these services to support such activities. All of our operations are conducted in one geographic area of the United States. For additional information, see our consolidated financial statements in this Annual Report beginning on page F-1.
Seasonality of Business
Weather conditions affect the demand for and prices of, oil and natural gas. Demand for oil and natural gas is typically higher in the first and fourth quarters, resulting in higher prices. Due to these seasonal fluctuations, results of operations for individual quarterly periods may not be indicative of the results that may be realized on an annual basis. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Oil and Natural Gas Industry and Our Business—“Extreme weather conditions could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in the areas where we operate” for additional information.
Oil and Natural Gas Leases
Typically the oil and natural gas lease agreements covering our properties provide for the payment of royalties to the mineral owner for all oil and natural gas produced from any wells drilled on the leased premises. The lessor royalties and other leasehold burdens on our properties generally range from 20% to 25%, resulting in a net revenue interest to us generally ranging from 75% to 80%. In cases where we own minerals underlying properties that we operate, our net revenue interest will be higher.
Markets for Sale of Production
Our ability to market oil and natural gas found and produced, if any, will depend on numerous factors beyond our control, the effect of which cannot be accurately predicted or anticipated. Some of these factors include, without limitation, the availability of other domestic and foreign production, the marketing of competitive fuels, the proximity and capacity of pipelines, fluctuations in supply and demand, the availability of a ready market, the effect of United States federal and state regulation of production, refining, transportation and sales and general national and worldwide economic conditions. 
13

Additionally, we may experience delays in marketing natural gas production and fluctuations in natural gas prices and our marketing professionals may experience short-term delays in marketing oil due to trucking and refining constraints. There is no assurance that we will be able to market any oil or natural gas produced, or, if such oil or natural gas is marketed, that favorable prices can be obtained.  
The United States natural gas market has undergone several significant changes over the past few decades. The majority of federal price ceilings were removed in 1985 and the remainder were lifted by the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act of 1989. Thus, currently, the United States natural gas market is operating in a free market environment in which the price of gas is determined by market forces rather than by regulations. At the same time, the domestic natural gas industry has also seen a dramatic change in the manner in which gas is bought, sold and transported. In most cases, natural gas is no longer sold to a pipeline company. Instead, the pipeline company now primarily serves the role of transporter and gas producers are free to sell their product to marketers, local distribution companies, end users or a combination thereof.
In recent years, oil, natural gas and NGLs prices have been under considerable pressure due to oversupply and other market conditions. Specifically, increased foreign production and increased efficiencies in horizontal drilling, combined with exploration of newly developed shale fields in North America, have dramatically increased global oil and natural gas production, which has led to lower market prices for these commodities. Given the many uncertainties affecting the supply and demand for oil, natural gas and NGLs, we are unable to accurately predict future oil, natural gas and NGLs prices or the overall effect, if any, that the oversupply of such products and other market conditions will have on our financial condition or results of operations.
Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and natural gas industry are regularly considered by the United States Congress (“Congress”), the states, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (the “FERC”) and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than similarly situated competitors.
Regulation Affecting Production
Natural gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, sourcing and disposal of water used in the drilling and completion process and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area and the unitization or pooling of crude oil or natural gas wells, as well as regulations that generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individual wells. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas wells we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells or limit the number of locations we can drill.
The failure to comply with the rules and regulations of natural gas production and related operations can result in substantial penalties. Our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations.
Regulation Affecting Sales and Transportation of Commodities
Sales prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices. Although prices of these energy commodities are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in their regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas, or the prices charged for these commodities might be proposed, what 
14

proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of oil and natural gas may be subject to certain state and potentially federal reporting requirements.
The price and terms of service of transportation of the commodities, including access to pipeline transportation capacity, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation. Such regulation may affect the marketing of oil and natural gas produced, as well as the revenues received for sales of such production. Gathering systems may be subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes. Ratable take statutes generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, oil and natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes generally require gatherers to purchase, or accept for gathering, without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes may affect whether and to what extent gathering capacity is available for oil and natural gas production, if any, of the drilling program and the cost of such capacity. Further, state laws and regulations govern rates and terms of access to intrastate pipeline systems, which may similarly affect market access and cost.
The FERC regulates interstate natural gas pipeline transportation rates and service conditions. The FERC is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting interstate transportation. The stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry and to promote market transparency. We do not believe that our drilling program will be affected by any such FERC action in a manner materially differently than other similarly situated natural gas producers.
Gathering services, which occur upstream of FERC jurisdictional transmission services, are regulated by the states onshore and in state waters. Although the FERC has set forth a general test for determining whether facilities perform a non-jurisdictional gathering function or a jurisdictional transmission function, the FERC’s determinations as to the classification of facilities is done on a case-by-case basis. State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements. Although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies, natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future.
In addition to the regulation of natural gas pipeline transportation, the FERC has jurisdiction over the purchase or sale of gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction pursuant to the Energy Policy Act of 2005. Under this law, it is unlawful for “any entity,” including producers such as us, that are otherwise not subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the FERC, in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. The FERC’s rules implementing this provision make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud, to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading, or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 up to $1,238,271 per day per violation (adjusted annually based on inflation). The anti-manipulation rule applies to activities of otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction, which includes the annual reporting requirements under Order 704 (defined below).
In December 2007, the FERC issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements, as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing (“Order 704”). Under Order 704, any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million MMBtus of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year, must annually report such sales and purchases to the FERC on Form No. 552 on May 1 of each year. Form No. 552 contains aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize or contribute to the formation of price indices. It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704. Order 704 is intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring those markets and in detecting market manipulation.
The FERC also regulates rates and service conditions for interstate transportation of liquids, including oil and NGLs, under the Interstate Commerce Act (the “ICA”). Prices received from the sale of liquids may be affected by the cost of transporting those products to market. The ICA requires that pipelines maintain a tariff on file with the FERC. The tariff sets forth the established rates as well as the rules and regulations governing the service. The ICA requires, among other things, that rates and terms and conditions of service on interstate common carrier pipelines be “just and reasonable.” Such pipelines must 
15

also provide jurisdictional service in a manner that is not unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential. Shippers have the power to challenge new and existing rates and terms and conditions of service before the FERC.
Rates of interstate liquids pipelines are currently regulated by the FERC primarily through an annual indexing methodology, under which pipelines increase or decrease their rates in accordance with an index adjustment specified by the FERC. For the five-year period beginning on July 1, 2016, the FERC established an annual index adjustment equal to the change in the producer price index for finished goods plus 1.23%. This adjustment is subject to review every five years. Under the FERC’s regulations, a liquids pipeline can request the authority to charge market-based rates for transportation service if it satisfies certain criteria, and also can request a rate increase that exceeds the rate obtained through application of the indexing methodology by using a cost-of-service approach, but only after the pipeline establishes that a substantial divergence exists between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rates resulting from application of the indexing methodology. Increases in liquids transportation rates may result in lower revenue and cash flows.
In addition, due to common carrier regulatory obligations of liquids pipelines, capacity must be prorated among shippers in an equitable manner in the event there are nominations in excess of capacity. Therefore, requests for service by new shippers or increased volume by existing shippers may reduce the capacity available to us. Any prolonged interruption in the operation or curtailment of available capacity of the pipelines that we rely upon for liquids transportation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. However, we believe that access to liquids pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors.
Intrastate liquids pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate liquids pipeline regulation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate liquids pipeline rates, varies from state to state. We believe that the regulation of liquids pipeline transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is materially different from the effects on our similarly situated competitors.
In addition to the FERC’s regulations, we are required to observe anti-market manipulation laws with regard to our physical sales of energy commodities. In November 2009, the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) issued regulations pursuant to the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 intended to prohibit market manipulation in the petroleum industry. Violators of the regulations face civil penalties of up to $1,180,566 per violation per day (adjusted annually based on inflation). In July 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which incorporated an expansion of the authority of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) to prohibit market manipulation in the markets regulated by the CFTC. This authority, with respect to crude oil swaps and futures contracts, is similar to the anti-manipulation authority granted to the FTC with respect to crude oil purchases and sales. In July 2011, the CFTC issued final rules to implement its new anti-manipulation authority. The rules subject violators to a civil penalty of up to the greater of $1,116,156 (adjusted annually based on inflation) or triple the monetary gain to the person for each violation.
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment and occupational health and safety. These laws and regulations may, among other things: (i) require the acquisition of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and production operations; (ii) restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment or injected into formations in connection with oil and natural gas drilling and production activities; (iii) limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; (iv) require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells; and (v) impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from drilling and production operations. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of corrective or remedial obligations and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of our operations.  
These laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
The clear trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, storage, transportation, disposal, or remediation requirements could 
16

have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations. We may be unable to pass on such increased compliance costs to our purchasers. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. While compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations has not had a material adverse effect on our operations, we can provide no assurance that this will continue in the future.
The following is a summary of the more significant existing and proposed environmental, occupational health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are or may be subject and for which compliance may have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, results of operations or financial position.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Pursuant to rules issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), the individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluids, produced waters and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of crude oil or natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. However, it is possible that certain oil and natural gas drilling and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous wastes in the future. For example, in December 2016, the EPA and environmental groups entered into a consent decree to address the EPA’s alleged failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations exempting certain exploration and production related oil and natural gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. The consent decree requires the EPA to propose a rulemaking no later than March 15, 2019 for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and natural gas wastes or to sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary. Removal of RCRA’s exemption for exploration and production wastes has the potential to significantly increase our waste disposal costs to manage, which in turn will result in increased operating costs and could adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Also, in the course of our operations, we generate some amounts of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes if such wastes have hazardous characteristics.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owners and operators of the site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
We generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances. Despite the “petroleum exclusion” of CERCLA, which currently encompasses natural gas, we may nonetheless handle hazardous substances within the meaning of CERCLA, or similar state statutes, in the course of our ordinary operations and, as a result, may be jointly and severally liable under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment. In addition, we currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas exploration, production and processing for many years. Although we believe that we have utilized operating and waste disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons may have been released on, under or from the properties owned or leased by us, or on, under or from other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, some of our properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose treatment and disposal of hazardous substances, wastes, or hydrocarbons was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on, under or from them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state and local laws. Under such laws, we could be required to undertake investigatory, response, or corrective measures, which could include soil and groundwater sampling, the removal of previously disposed substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated property, or performance of remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future contamination, the costs of which could be substantial.

Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act (the “CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including wetland areas, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the “USACE”) or an analogous state agency. In September 2015, the EPA and the USACE issued a final rule redefining the scope of the EPA’s and the USACE’s jurisdiction under the CWA with respect to certain types of waterbodies and classifying these waterbodies as regulated wetlands. The 2015 rule was previously stayed nationwide to determine whether federal district or appellate courts had jurisdiction to hear cases in the matter and, in January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. The EPA and the USACE proposed a rulemaking in June 2017 to repeal the June 2015 rule and announced their intent to issue a new rule defining the CWA’s jurisdiction. Recently, in January 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision finding that jurisdiction to hear challenges to the 2015 rule resides with the federal district courts; consequently, the previously-filed district court cases will be allowed to proceed. Following the Supreme Court’s decision, the EPA and the USACE issued a final rule in January 2018 staying implementation of the 2015 rule for two years. As a result of these recent developments, future implementation of the June 2015 rule is uncertain. To the extent the rule or any replacement rule expands the scope of the CWA’s jurisdiction, we could face increased costs and delays with respect to obtaining permits for dredge and fill activities in wetland areas. In addition, federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. We do not expect the costs to comply with the requirements of the CWA to have a material adverse effect on our operations.
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amends the CWA and establishes strict liability for owners and operators of facilities that cause a release of oil into waters of the United States. In addition, this law requires owners and operators of facilities that store oil above specified threshold amounts to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasures plans.
Safe Drinking Water Act
In the course of our operations, we produce water in addition to oil and natural gas. Water that is not recycled or otherwise disposed of on the lease may be sent to saltwater disposal wells for injection into subsurface formations. Underground injection operations are regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act and permitting and enforcement authority may be delegated to the states. In Texas, the Texas Railroad Commission (“RRC”) regulates the disposal of produced water by injection well. The RRC requires operators to obtain a permit from the agency for the operation of saltwater disposal wells and establishes minimum standards for injection well operations. In response to recent seismic events near underground injection wells used for the disposal of oil and natural gas-related waste waters, federal and some state agencies have begun investigating whether such wells have caused increased seismic activity, and some states have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of such injection wells. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states are considering additional requirements related to seismic safety. For example, the RRC has adopted new rules for injection wells to address these seismic activity concerns in Texas. Among other things, the rules require companies seeking permits for disposal wells to provide seismic activity data in permit applications, provide for more frequent monitoring and reporting for certain wells and allow the RRC to modify, suspend, or terminate permits on grounds that a disposal well is likely to be, or determined to be, causing seismic activity. These new rules could impact the availability of injection wells for disposal of wastewater from our operations. Increased costs associated with the transportation and disposal of produced water, including the cost of complying with regulations concerning produced water disposal, may reduce our profitability; however, these costs are commonly incurred by all oil and natural gas producers, and we do not believe that the costs associated with the disposal of produced water will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Air Emissions
The federal Clean Air Act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, such as tank batteries and compressor stations, through air emissions standards, construction and operating permitting programs and the imposition of other compliance requirements. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. The need to obtain permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects. Over the next several years, we may be required to incur certain capital expenditures for air pollution control equipment or other air emissions related issues. For example, in October 2015, the EPA lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. In November 2017, the EPA published a list of areas that are in compliance with the new ozone standards and, separately in December 2017, issued responses to state recommendations for designating non-attainment areas. States have the opportunity to submit new air quality monitoring to the EPA prior to the EPA finalizing any non-attainment 
18

designations. State implementation of these revised air quality standards could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our ability to obtain such permits and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. More recently, in June 2016, the EPA finalized a rule regarding criteria for aggregating multiple small surface sites into a single source for air-quality permitting purposes applicable to the oil and natural gas industry. This rule could cause small facilities, on an aggregate basis, to be deemed a major source, thereby triggering more stringent air permitting requirements, which in turn could result in operational delays or require us to install costly pollution control equipment. The EPA has also adopted new rules under the Clean Air Act that require the reduction of volatile organic compound emissions from certain fractured and refractured natural gas wells for which well completion operations are conducted and further require that most wells use reduced emission completions, also known as “green completions.” These regulations also establish specific new requirements regarding emissions from production‑related wet seal and reciprocating compressors and from pneumatic controllers and storage vessels. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA issued final rules that establish new air emission controls for emissions of methane from certain equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities. The final rules include first-time standards to address emissions of methane from equipment and processes across the source category, including hydraulically fractured oil and natural gas well completions. In addition, the rule package extends existing volatile organic compound standards under the EPA’s Subpart OOOO of the New Source Performance Standards to include previously unregulated equipment within the oil and natural gas source category. However, in June 2017, the EPA published a proposed rule to stay certain portions of the June 2016 standards for two years and re-evaluate the entirety of the 2016 standards but the EPA has not yet published a final rule and, as a result, the June 2016 rule remains in effect but future implementation of the 2016 standards is uncertain at this time. To the extent fully implemented, compliance with this rule will require enhanced record-keeping practices, the purchase of new equipment such as optical gas imaging instruments to detect leaks and the increased frequency of maintenance and repair activities to address emissions leakage. The rules may also require hiring additional personnel to support these activities or the engagement of third party contractors to assist with and verify compliance. These and other air pollution control and permitting requirements have the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects and increase our costs of development and production, which costs could be significant. However, we do not believe that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations.
Regulation of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
In response to findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) present an endangerment to public health and the environment, the EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that, among other things, establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), construction and Title V operating permit reviews for certain large stationary sources. Facilities required to obtain PSD permits for their GHG emissions also will be required to meet “best available control technology” standards that will be established on a case-by-case basis. EPA rulemakings related to GHG emissions could adversely affect our operations and restrict or delay our ability to obtain air permits for new or modified sources. In addition, the EPA has adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production sources in the United States on an annual basis, which include gathering and boosting facilities as well as GHG emissions from completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells. Also, as noted above, the EPA has proposed a New Source Performance Standard related to methane emissions from the oil and natural gas source category.
While Congress has considered legislation related to the reduction of GHG emissions in the past, the possibility of federal legislation related to climate change appears unlikely at this time. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional cap and trade programs have emerged that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. At the international level, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that requires member countries to review and ‘‘represent a progression’’ in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. The Paris Agreement entered into force in November 2016. Although this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, it does include pledges from participating nations to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. In June 2017, President Trump stated that the United States would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, but may enter into a future international agreement related to GHGs. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020. The United States’ adherence to the exit process is uncertain and/or the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on, or limiting emissions of GHGs from, our equipment and operations could require us to incur costs to reduce emissions of GHGs associated with our operations. 
19

In addition, substantial limitations on GHG emissions could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce and lower the value of our reserves. Recently, activists concerned about the potential effects of climate change have directed their attention at sources of funding for fossil-fuel energy companies, which has resulted in certain financial institutions, funds and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in oil and natural gas activities. Ultimately, this could make it more difficult to secure funding for exploration and production activities. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that global energy demand will continue to rise and will not peak until after 2040 and that oil and gas will continue to represent a substantial percentage of global energy use over that time. Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, droughts and other extreme climatic events; if any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand or alternative proppant and chemicals under pressure into target geological formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. We regularly use hydraulic fracturing as part of our operations. Recently, there has been increased public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies and proposals have been made to enact separate federal, state and local legislation that would increase the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing.
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance in February 2014 addressing the performance of such activities. Also, in May 2014, the EPA issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to collect data on chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations under Section 8 of the Toxic Substances Control Act (“TSCA”). To date, no other action has been taken and the likelihood of any future rulemaking under TSCA appears remote at this time. Further, the EPA finalized regulations under the CWA in June 2016 that prohibit wastewater discharges from hydraulic fracturing and certain other natural gas operations to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants. Also, in December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources “under some circumstances,” noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits.
At the state level, several states have adopted or are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. For example in May 2013, the RRC adopted new rules governing well casing, cementing and other standards for ensuring that hydraulic fracturing operations do not contaminate nearby water resources. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular or prohibit the performance of well drilling in general or hydraulic fracturing in particular. We believe that we follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our hydraulic fracturing activities. Nonetheless, if new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where we operate, we could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development, or production activities and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.
If new federal, state or local laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such legal requirements could result in delays, eliminate certain drilling and injection activities and make it more difficult or costly to perform fracturing. Any such regulations limiting or prohibiting hydraulic fracturing could reduce oil and natural gas exploration and production activities and, therefore, adversely affect our business. Such laws or regulations could also materially increase our costs of compliance and doing business by more strictly regulating how hydraulic fracturing wastes are handled or disposed.

The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and (in some cases) comparable state laws were established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be 
20

imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. We may conduct operations on oil and natural gas leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species, such as the sage grouse, that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (the “FWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions to federal land use and may materially delay or prohibit land access for oil and natural gas development. Moreover, as a result of a 2011 settlement agreement, the FWS was required to make a determination on listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the FSA by no later than completion of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The FWS missed the deadline and continues to review new species for protected status under the ESA. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Recently, there have been renewed calls to review protections currently in place for the dunes sagebrush lizard, whose habitat includes the Permian Basin, and to reconsider listing the species under the ESA. The identification or designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where underlying property operations are conducted could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our exploration and production activities that could have an adverse impact on our ability to develop and produce reserves. If we were to have a portion of our leases designated as critical or suitable habitat, it could adversely impact the value of our leases. 
OSHA
We are subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state statutes and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. 
Related Permits and Authorizations
Many environmental laws require us to obtain permits or other authorizations from state and/or federal agencies before initiating certain drilling, construction, production, operation, or other oil and natural gas activities and to maintain these permits and compliance with their requirements for on-going operations. These permits are generally subject to protest, appeal, or litigation, which, in certain cases, can delay or halt projects and cease production or operation of wells, pipelines and other operations.
Related Insurance
We maintain insurance against some risks associated with above or underground contamination that may occur as a result of our exploration and production activities. However, this insurance is limited to activities at the well site, and there can be no assurance that this insurance will continue to be commercially available or that this insurance will be available at premium levels that justify its purchase by us. The occurrence of a significant event that is not fully insured or indemnified against could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations.
Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non-recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2017, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2018.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed 460 people. We consider our relations with employees to be satisfactory. Our future success will depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages. We regularly utilize the services of independent contractors to perform various field and other services
