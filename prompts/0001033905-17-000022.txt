ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We develop, manufacture and sell proprietary biological testing technologies and products with applications throughout the diagnostics, pharmaceutical and life sciences industries.  These industries depend on a broad range of tests, called assays, to perform diagnostic testing and conduct life science research.
We have established a position in several segments of the life sciences industry by developing and delivering products that meet a variety of customer needs in specific market segments, including multiplexing, accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, reduction of labor and ability to test for proteins and nucleic acids. These needs are addressed by our proprietary technology, which allows the end user in a laboratory to perform biological testing in a multiplexed format. Multiplexing allows for many different laboratory results to be generated from one sample with a single assay. This is important because our end user customers, which include laboratory professionals performing research and clinical laboratories performing tests on patients as ordered by physicians and other laboratories, have a fundamental need to perform high quality testing as efficiently as possible. Until the availability of multiplexing technology such as our xMAP® (Multi-Analyte-Profiling) technology, the laboratory professional had to perform one assay at a time in a sequential manner, and if additional testing was required on a sample, a second assay would be performed to generate the second result, and so on until all the necessary tests were performed. 
We have a full range of instruments using our xMAP technology: our LUMINEX® 100/200™ Systems offer 100-plex testing; our FLEXMAP 3D® System is our high-throughput, 500-plex testing system; and our MAGPIX® System provides 50-plex testing at a lower cost using imaging rather than flow cytometry. By using our xMAP technology, the end users are able to be more efficient by generating multiple simultaneous results per sample. We believe that this technology may also offer advantages in other industries, such as in food safety/animal health and bio-defense/bio-threat markets. Using the products Luminex has available today, up to 500 simultaneous analyte results can be determined from a single sample.
We primarily serve the diagnostics, pharmaceutical and life sciences industries by marketing products, including our specific testing equipment, called systems, and assays, to various types of testing laboratories. We have a large base of installed systems that has grown primarily from the following:

• | placements made by partners who either:


• | license our xMAP technology and develop products that incorporate our xMAP technology into products that they then sell to end users, or


• | purchase our proprietary xMAP laboratory instrumentation and our proprietary xMAP microspheres and sell xMAP-based assay products and/or xMAP-based testing services, which run on the xMAP instrumentation, and pay a royalty to us; and


• | our direct sales force that focuses on the sale of molecular diagnostic assays that run on our systems.

As of December 31, 2016, we had 75 strategic partners, 51 of which have released commercialized reagent-based products utilizing our technology. Luminex and these partners have sold approximately 13,782 xMAP-based instruments in laboratories worldwide as of December 31, 2016. Our remaining partners are in various stages of development and commercialization of products incorporating our technology.
Following the completion of our acquisition of Nanosphere, Inc. (Nanosphere) on June 30, 2016 our offering in the molecular diagnostic market segment expanded to include Nanosphere's proprietary diagnostic tools that enable rapid and accurate detection of respiratory, gastrointestinal and bloodstream infections. Nanosphere is a leader in the high-growth bloodstream infection testing segment with its U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared Verigene® Gram-Positive Blood Culture (BC-GP) and Gram-Negative Blood Culture (BC-GN) test panels for the early detection of pathogens associated with bloodstream infections. In addition to detecting bacteria, these panels also detect yeast and identify antibiotic resistance markers. In contrast to traditional methodologies, which can take several days, these assays enable physicians to identify the pathogen, including any associated resistance markers, and prescribe the most appropriate antibiotic regimen, all within 2.5 hours after identification of a positive blood culture. The ability for clinicians to make earlier, better informed therapeutic decisions results in improved patient outcomes and lower healthcare costs. In addition, Nanosphere has FDA-cleared products for the detection of gastrointestinal and respiratory infections. These include a targeted product for the detection of  C. difficile, as well as highly multiplexed molecular enteric, blood and respiratory pathogen panels which test for a wide spectrum of microorganisms often associated with these types of infections. With the addition of the Verigene platform, Luminex offers customers automated molecular platforms for both syndromic and targeted molecular diagnostic testing.

In addition to our menu of infectious disease tests, we are currently developing a next generation Verigene System that will deliver improved user experience. This next generation system is designed to provide a reduced time to result and an improved user interface, including a room temperature cartridge, all in a fully automated sample to result system with an optimized footprint. 
A primary focus for our growth is the development and sale of molecular diagnostic assays utilizing our proprietary MultiCode® and Verigene technologies for use on our installed base of systems. We utilize a direct sales model for sales of these products, which is intended to take advantage of our increasing installed base of instruments.  Our assays are primarily focused on multiplexed applications for the human molecular clinical diagnostics market. Our assay products are currently focused on three segments of the molecular diagnostic testing market: human genetics, personalized medicine and infectious disease. 
In addition to the sales to this installed based, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we received FDA clearance for our ARIES® System. The ARIES® System is a sample to answer clinical test system that automates and integrates extraction of nucleic acid from a clinical sample, performs real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and detects multiple signals generated by target specific probes. The ARIES® System is used with specific assays to measure multiple analytes indicative of infectious disease. The ARIES® System uses internal barcode scanning and other advanced features to minimize operator errors. Each independent module supports from one to six cassettes, allowing both STAT and Batch testing. The ARIES® System can run both In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) and MultiCode Analyte Specific Reagents (ASRs) simultaneously with a common Universal Assay Protocol. The ARIES® System was commercially launched in the fourth quarter of 2015. We also received FDA clearance for the ARIES® HSV (herpes simplex virus) 1&2 Assay in the fourth quarter of 2015; Conformité Européenne (CE)-IVD Mark in Europe for the ARIES® System and ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay in the first quarter of 2016; CE-IVD Mark in Europe for the ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay in the second quarter of 2016; FDA Clearance and CE-IVD Mark for the ARIES® M1 System, FDA clearance for the ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay in the third quarter of 2016 and FDA clearance for the ARIES® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Assay in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Luminex was incorporated under the laws of the State of Texas in May 1995 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in February 2000.  
Recent Events
Following the acquisition of Nanosphere, and to better focus on the Company's core business, the Company conducted a reorganization in December, 2016. The reorganization included a headcount reduction of approximately 40 employees, a reallocation of responsibilities within the research and development organization and a significant reduction of biodefense efforts.  As a result of the organizational change, the Company eliminated approximately 4% of its aggregate workforce. The Company recognized a charge of approximately $2.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 in conjunction with these activities.

Industry Background
The life sciences industry uses assays to detect the presence and characteristics of certain biochemicals, proteins or nucleic acids in a sample. Drug discovery, genetic analysis, pharmacogenomics, clinical diagnostics and general biomedical research all use assays. For example, assays can be used to:

• | measure the presence and quantity of substances such as infectious agents, antigens for histocompatibility, hormones, cancer markers and other proteins in a patient’s blood, other body fluid or tissue to assist physicians in diagnosing, treating or monitoring disease conditions;

2


• | detect genetic variations, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms or genetic mutations present in inherited diseases;


• | measure the response to a compound or dosage by measuring cellular activity to assist in drug discovery and development; and


• | assist physicians in prescribing or dosing the appropriate drug therapy based on the patient’s genetic makeup, a field known as pharmacogenetics.

The life sciences customer can purchase assays in the form of complete off-the-shelf kits, develop them from scratch or utilize a customized service to meet the customer's specific needs.
The table below briefly describes the key assay technologies in the life sciences industry:

Our xMAP Technology 
Our xMAP technology is an open architecture, multiplexing technology that combines existing biological testing techniques with illumination, advanced digital signal processing, detection and proprietary software. With our technology, discrete assays are performed on the surface of color-coded microspheres. These microspheres are read in a compact analyzer that utilizes lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs), detectors, charge-coupled device imaging and high-speed digital signal processing to simultaneously identify the assay and measure the individual assay results. The key features of xMAP technology include the following:
3


• | Multi-analyte/multi-format

xMAP technology has been designed to simultaneously perform up to 500 distinct assays in a single tube or well of a microtiter plate using only a small amount of sample. Moreover, unlike most existing technologies that are dedicated to only one type of assay, xMAP can perform multiple types of assays including enzymatic, genetic and immunologic tests on the same instrumentation platform.

• | Flexibility/scalability

xMAP technology allows flexibility in customizing test panels. Panels can be modified to include new assays in the same tube by adding additional microsphere sets. It is also scalable, meaning that there is no change in the manufacturing process and only minimal changes to the required labor to produce a small or large number of microsphere-based tests.

• | Both protein and nucleic acid applications on a single platform

xMAP technology has an advantage due to its ability to analyze both proteins and nucleic acids.  This allows customers to utilize a single platform to evaluate samples across more biological parameters and generate a more complete assessment of these samples.  Alternative technologies are typically restricted to either proteins or nucleic acid, requiring customers to use two or more technologies from other vendors to get the same information.

• | High throughput

Our technology can perform up to 500 tests in a single well, permitting up to 96,000 tests to be detected in approximately one hour with only a small amount of sample.  Rapid sample analysis permits efficient use for high-throughput applications. 

• | Ease of use

Most xMAP-based assays are simple to perform. A test sample is added to a solution containing microspheres that have been coated with reagents. The solution is then processed through one of our xMAP systems which incorporates proprietary software to automate data acquisition and analysis in real-time.

• | Cost effective

By performing multiple assays at one time, xMAP technology is designed to be cost effective for customers compared to competitive techniques such as ELISA or real-time PCR. By analyzing only those assays in which a customer is interested, xMAP is also more cost effective than most competing microarray technologies. In addition, microsphere-based assays are inexpensive compared to other technologies, such as chip based microarrays.
Two types of microspheres, polystyrene microspheres and polystyrene magnetic microspheres, are both fundamental components of the xMAP technology. We purchase and manufacture microspheres and, in a proprietary process, dye them with varying intensities of proprietary dyes to achieve up to 500 distinct colors. The specific dye proportions permit each color-coded microsphere to be readily identified based on its distinctive fluorescent signature. Our customers create assays by attaching different biochemical reactants to each distinctly colored microsphere set. These unique reactants bind, or capture, specific substances present in the test sample.  The microsphere sets can then be combined in test panels as required by the user, with a maximum of 500 tests per panel.  Customers can order either standard microspheres or magnetic microspheres.
To perform an assay using xMAP technology on our systems, a researcher attaches biomarker detectors such as antibodies or nucleic acid oligos to one or more sets of color-coded microspheres, which are then mixed with a test sample. This mixture is injected into the xMAP analyzer such as the Luminex 200 instrument where the microspheres pass single-file in a fluid stream through two laser beams. The first laser excites the internal dyes that are used to identify the color of the microsphere and the test being performed on the surface of the microsphere. The second laser excites a fluorescent dye captured on the surface of the microspheres that is used to detect the result of the assay taking place. Our proprietary optics, digital signal processors and software record the fluorescent signature of each microsphere and compare the results to the known identity of that color-coded microsphere set. The results are analyzed and displayed in real-time with data stored on the computer database for reference, evaluation and analysis.
Our xMAP technology is currently being used within various segments of the life sciences industry, which includes the fields of drug discovery and development, and for clinical diagnostics, bio-defense, food safety and biomedical research.

Our xTAG® and MultiCode Technologies
Our xTAG technology consists of several components including multiplexed PCR or target identification primers, DNA Tags, xMAP microspheres and data analysis software.  xTAG technology permits the development of molecular diagnostic assays for clinical use by hospital and reference laboratories.  xTAG technology has been applied, in particular, to human genetic assays, pharmacogenetic assays and infectious disease assays.
Our MultiCode technology is based upon a unique assay chemistry that is a flexible platform for both real-time PCR and multiplex PCR-based applications. MultiCode-based PCR assays are primarily used for the detection of infectious diseases and genetic-based conditions. We have multiple molecular diagnostic assays based on the MultiCode chemistry. MultiCode products are based upon the unique MultiCode bases, isoC and isoG. The synthetic isoC:isoG DNA base pair differs from the naturally occurring base pairs in its hydrogen bonding pattern. As a result, the MultiCode bases, isoC and isoG, can only pair with each other, but can co-exist with naturally occurring nucleotide pairs. This property enables site-specific incorporation of the isobases during amplification. The MultiCode base pair is recognized by naturally occurring enzymes and can be used for the specific placement of reporter molecules and to increase the molecular recognition capabilities of hybridization-based assays. The MultiCode base pair enables solutions to complex molecular challenges that were previously not possible with natural nucleic acid alone.

We have multiple assay development activities ongoing and these activities are focused in the areas of infectious disease, human genetics, and pharmacogenomics.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we received FDA clearance for our ARIES® System and ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay as well as our NxTAG® Respiratory Pathogen Panel (RPP) Assay, CE-IVD Mark in Europe for the ARIES® System and ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay in the first quarter of 2016; CE-IVD Mark in Europe for the ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay in the second quarter of 2016; FDA Clearance and CE-IVD Mark for the ARIES® M1 System, FDA clearance for the ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay in the third quarter of 2016 and FDA clearance for the ARIES® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Assay in the fourth quarter of 2016 and will submit additional assay products to the FDA for clearance to expand our ARIES® System test menu. We have plans to submit additional assay products to regulatory authorities in 2017, including the FDA and foreign equivalents, for clearance in order to comply with established guidelines across the jurisdictions in which we participate. 
Our Verigene Technology

The Verigene System is an automated multiplex-capable system that rapidly and accurately detects infectious pathogens and drug resistance markers.  The Verigene System consists of:  i) Verigene Test Cartridges which are single-use, self-contained test units and ii) Verigene instrumentation including the Verigene Processor SP, which is a modular bench-top analyzer that combines automated nucleic acid extraction, purification, amplification (if needed), and hybridization in each module, as well as the Verigene Reader which manages sample information and reads results from processed cartridges. Tests that run on the Verigene System are designed to identify infections in the bloodstream, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract.
The Verigene System utilizes advanced automation and proprietary chemistry to enable rapid sample to result detection of nucleic acid and protein targets. NanoGrid Technology, a unique gold nanoparticle probe chemistry, is the driving force behind all Verigene tests, providing a foundation for the Verigene System’s menu of clinically meaningful diagnostics. 
Business Strategy 
Our Company’s current focus is the transition from a technology-based tools company to a market-based diagnostic company and the establishment of Luminex as a market leader in the molecular diagnostic market. To achieve these objectives, we have implemented and are pursuing the following strategies:

• | Focus on key markets

We have identified the following key market segments: (i) molecular infectious disease, (ii) genetic or inherited disease, (iii) human leukocyte antigen (HLA) transplant diagnostics, (iv) immunodiagnostics and (v) life sciences research. We will continue to employ a combination of a partnership-driven business model and a product-driven business model focused on selected market segments and assay applications.
5


• | Develop and deliver market-leading molecular diagnostic platforms and assays

Our research and development and our acquisitions have expanded the breadth of technology and solutions we offer our customers to meet their needs. We acquired the MultiCode RTx real-time PCR technology for both quantitative and qualitative low-plex real-time PCR assays and the GenturaDx IDbox sample to answer platform, which is compatible with our MultiCode RTx technology, to provide our customers with a complete system for their real-time PCR assays. The GenturaDx IDbox was further developed and launched as the ARIES® System. A key focus currently is the development of additional assay products for our ARIES® System. The ARIES® System, when combined with our proprietary real-time PCR chemistry and a new menu of highly automated assays that we are developing, is designed to offer a differentiated, easy to use diagnostic solution. The ARIES® System is designed to help clinical diagnostic laboratories overcome their daily challenges: minimizing healthcare cost increases while maintaining the overall quality of healthcare, the scarcity of highly trained laboratory personnel and limited lab bench space. The ARIES® System offers barcode-based data entry, an efficient workflow, a slim design that occupies minimal bench space, universal assay protocols that enable true walkaway automation and ability to simplify laboratory developed tests (LDTs). 

We acquired the Verigene platform in the acquisition of Nanosphere. The Verigene System offers automated, cost-effective multiplex capabilities that rapidly and accurately detect infectious pathogens and drug resistance markers, without relying on time-consuming culture methods.  We currently offer assays on the Verigene platform in the categories of Bloodstream Infection Tests, Gastrointestinal Infection Tests and a Respiratory Infection Test.  The Verigene Bloodstream Infection Tests provide cost-effective bacterial identifications and antibiotic resistance determinations directly from positive blood culture bottles up to 48 hours faster than conventional methods. The BC-GP test provides 15 different targets, and the BC-GN test provides 14 different targets.  Verigene enables an earlier shift from empiric to targeted antibiotic treatment and differentiates potential blood culture contaminants. As a result, the Verigene System delivers better outcomes, improved patient care, and true antibiotic stewardship, all at a lower cost.  
Testing for gastrointestinal pathogens has traditionally been labor-intensive, unpleasant for technologists to perform, has low sensitivity, and can take as long as five to seven days to produce definitive results.  The Verigene C. difficile Test for healthcare-acquired diarrhea with 027 hypervirulent strain differentiation and Verigene Enteric Pathogens Test for community-acquired diarrhea with nine bacterial and viral targets requires less than five minutes of user hands-on time and delivers comprehensive results directly from a stool sample in less than two hours. As a result, the Verigene System provides earlier optimization for patient treatment and improved laboratory and hospital efficiency.
Influenza is highly contagious and affects up to 20% of the U.S. population each year and is responsible for more than 200,000 hospitalizations, and as many as 49,000 deaths each year, depending on the severity of the season. Influenza can lead to serious complications such as pneumonia, bronchitis, sinus infections, and a general worsening of chronic conditions.  Respiratory pathogens are responsible for more than one billion annual cases of the common cold and other related illnesses. They are recognized as a serious contributor to respiratory ailments in children, the elderly, and the immunocompromised and commonly mistreated with unnecessary antibiotics due to delays in diagnosis. The Verigene Respiratory Pathogens Flex (RP Flex) provides viral identification information clinicians need to select appropriate treatment for their patients. Verigene RP Flex can limit misuse and overuse of antibiotics, which are ineffective and not indicated for viral infections, and provide results within two hours. 


• | Develop next generation products

We have developed a full range of multiplexing instruments and consumables to cover a broad range of customer applications and budgets.  We have developed, and continue to improve, our proprietary chemistries for our multiplex assays in areas such as human genetic testing, personalized medicine testing and infectious disease testing. All of these technology solutions provide our customers with a breadth of innovative solutions to meet their many testing needs.
Following our acquisition of Nanosphere on June 30, 2016, we have continued the development of the next generation Verigene System (currently referred to as Project Atlas). We currently expect to initiate clinical studies on the system and its first assay in 2017.
6

In the fourth quarter of 2015, we launched our sample to answer platform, ARIES® System. We also received FDA clearance for the ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay in the fourth quarter of 2015; CE-IVD Mark in Europe for the ARIES® System and ARIES® HSV 1&2 Assay in the first quarter of 2016; CE-IVD Mark in Europe for the ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay in the second quarter of 2016; FDA Clearance and CE-IVD Mark for the ARIES® M1 System and FDA clearance for the ARIES® Flu A/B & RSV Assay in the third quarter of 2016; and FDA Clearance for the ARIES® Group B Streptococcus (GBS) Assay in the fourth quarter of 2016.
In addition, we are collaborating with industry participants, biomedical research institutions and government entities to develop additional products on our platform. We continuously consider other adjacent markets where our platform and assay offerings would be beneficial. 
We have improved the simplicity and ease of use of our multiplex products through the development of a new version of our multiplex PCR technology. This new NxTAG chemistry enables customers to experience streamlined workflow without sacrificing throughput. We recognize that the crucial aspect of our current technology that we want to preserve for our larger customers is the ability to process samples ranging anywhere from 1 to 96 patients in a single batch. This throughput flexibility and capacity is a crucial aspect for tests like our xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP), in which seasonality and local outbreaks can cause testing volumes to surge unpredictably. We offer the convenience of a one-step workflow with the throughput of a batch-based system. In addition, products using this new chemistry are expected to have the convenience of room temperature shipping and storage. We released our NxTAG RPP product in 2015. Additionally, we continue pursuing projects such as the development of consumables, automation, software and the expansion and enhancement of our multiplexing capabilities to advance our technologies and market acceptance. 

• | Actively pursuing acquisitions that could accelerate our business strategies

We utilize analytical tools and an evaluation template to assess potential acquisition targets to accelerate our business strategies in the key markets described above. This approach led to several successful acquisitions historically, including the acquisition of GenturaDx in 2012, which is the foundation of our ARIES® System, and the acquisition of Nanosphere in 2016, which is the foundation of the Verigene System. We actively evaluate opportunities to enhance our capabilities or our access to targeted markets or technologies, or provide us other advantages in executing our business strategies in our key markets.

• | Continue to develop the partnership channel focused in select key markets


As of December 31, 2016, 51 of our 75 strategic partners have developed and commercialized xMAP based assay products and are paying royalties to us.  We also have strategic partners who distribute Luminex products.  During 2016, the 51 strategic partners who have commercialized xMAP based assay products accounted for approximately 58% of our total revenue and all of our strategic partners represented approximately 61% of our total revenue. We intend to continue pursuing opportunities to expand market acceptance of xMAP technology through development, marketing and distribution partnerships with leading companies in the life sciences markets. By leveraging our strategic partners’ market positions and utilizing their distribution channels and marketing infrastructure, we believe we can continue to expand our installed instrument base.  Furthermore, our partners’ investments in research and development for xMAP applications provide Luminex xMAP customers with more assay product options than any one company or Luminex could develop and commercialize individually.
We will continue to focus our commercialization efforts through our strategic partners covering large sectors of the life science research market, where Luminex believes it has competitive advantages over alternative technologies and approaches. We define strategic partners as those companies in the life sciences markets that develop and distribute assays and tests on xMAP technology or may only distribute our xMAP technology based systems and consumables.  With our partners’ support and through our direct commercial efforts in the molecular diagnostics clinical laboratory segment, we have targeted major pharmaceutical companies, large clinical laboratories, research institutions and major medical institutions for our principal marketing efforts. We believe that these customers provide the greatest opportunity for maximizing the use of xMAP based products and that continued adoption by these industry leaders will promote wider market acceptance of our xMAP technology.

Cystic Fibrosis Family
These FDA-cleared and CE marked IVD kits include the first-ever IVD assays for cystic fibrosis (CF) genotyping.  Current recommendations by the American College of Medical Genetics and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists include screening for 23 mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator gene. The xTAG CF kits screen for these mutations in addition to a variety of other important CF mutations, commonly found in the ethnically diverse North American and European populations.  These kits are typically used for screening newborns and for diagnosing adult carriers of the CF gene.
Pharmacogenetics Product Family
This product family includes assays used to determine the drug metabolism status of individuals for specific medications.  All products include genotyping of genes encoding different cytochrome P450 drug metabolizing enzymes.  This type of  information is typically used to determine if a patient will need a lower or higher dose of a specific drug, or whether the patient should be switched to a different medication altogether.  Two of the products in this category are the FDA-cleared CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 assays used for identifying patients with variants that affect the metabolism and efficacy of some pharmaceutical compounds.
Specialty Product Family and Instrumentation
This family of products includes a variety of assays targeted towards specialty, niche markets.
In addition to the commercially available assays, we are an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) of custom reagents and instrumentation for certain of our customers. 
Sales and Marketing
Our diagnostic sales and marketing strategy is to expand the installed base and utilization of xMAP, xTAG, MultiCode and Verigene product lines, as well as to drive successful adoption of our newest products: NxTAG RPP and ARIES® System and assays. Our partner business is focused on generating recurring revenues from the sale of Luminex developed assays, microspheres and other consumables, as well as from royalties on kits and testing services developed or performed by partners. We have two key elements to our sales and marketing strategy: i) marketing internally developed assays directly to end users and ii) building and maintaining long-term relationships with Luminex’s strategic partners. Luminex's strategic partners include clinical diagnostic, pharmaceutical and life sciences companies that develop applications and/or perform testing using our technology platforms. Some partners also distribute xMAP systems to their customers. 
We sell the xTAG, NxTAG, MultiCode, ARIES® and Verigene product lines primarily through a direct sales channel. Building a direct relationship with customers is a critical component of Luminex's sales and marketing strategy to launch new, innovative products such as NxTAG RPP and the ARIES® System. NxTAG RPP is a next generation product to replace the successful xTAG RVP assay. NxTAG RPP offers a streamlined workflow and enhanced product performance to customers. 
The ARIES® System program began with the acquisition of GenturaDx in July 2012 to secure a real-time PCR system for the previously acquired EraGen® MultiCode product line. After the acquisition of GenturaDx, we obtained customer feedback that ultimately transformed the GenturaDx IDbox into the ARIES® System. Customer feedback was critically important and resulted in a system designed to better meet customer needs, including eliminating the external computer in lieu of an integrated touchscreen. The ARIES® System takes up less bench space than competitive systems. In addition, the unique cassette design and off instrument user defined protocol application enables customers to run LDTs and ASRs along with their IVD assays. Finally, SYNCTTM, an innovative data management software solution that compiles data from multiple ARIES® and xMAP Systems, was released at the end of 2015. Enabling user defined protocols will accelerate Luminex's menu pipeline, and SYNCT meets customer needs in the laboratory, assisting laboratories to better leverage their data to decrease laboratory costs and improve patient care.

The acquisition of Nanosphere and its Verigene System allowed us to move into syndromic testing in three clinical high-impact areas:  infections in the bloodstream, respiratory tract, and gastrointestinal tract.  In all three areas, determination of infectious agent(s) has to be accomplished with speed from a long list of potential candidates.  The Verigene System offers automated, cost-effective multiplex capabilities that rapidly and accurately detect infectious pathogens and drug resistance markers, without relying on time-consuming culture methods. Delivery of this time-critical information enables clinicians to provide targeted patient care more quickly, potentially leading to improved patient outcomes, lower costs, optimized antibiotic therapy, reduced spread of antibiotic resistance, and most importantly, saved lives. The introduction of the ARIES® and Verigene Systems allows us access to moderate-complexity laboratories, including microbiology labs, increasing our overall market opportunity as these Systems can perform both high and low multiplexed assays.

Outside of Luminex's direct molecular diagnostic business, we continue to work with strategic partners as the primary distribution channel for our xMAP systems, and we will continue to pursue new partnerships focusing on partners with market presence in the key partner segments described above.  Some of our strategic partners develop application-specific kits for use on our xMAP systems that they, in turn, sell to their customers, thereby generating royalties for Luminex. Certain strategic partners also perform testing services for third parties using our xMAP products, which also results in royalty revenue.  Luminex also contracts with distributors to purchase and resell the xMAP systems and consumables in geographic or application-specific areas not covered by strategic partners. 
We update our strategic partner listing regularly to reflect results of partner consolidations due to mergers and acquisitions, commercial sales inactivity, as well as termination or expiration of existing non-performing partner agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we had 75 strategic partners, compared to 73 strategic partners as of December 31, 2015.  During 2016, 51 strategic partners with commercialized products utilizing xMAP technology submitted royalties. As of December 31, 2016, 51 of these strategic partners with commercialized products remain, of which 22 companies principally serve the clinical diagnostics market and 29 companies principally serve the life science research market. Revenues through these commercialized, royalty-submitting, strategic partners constituted 58% of our revenues for 2016. We also believe our strategic partners provide us with complementary capabilities in product development, regulatory expertise and sales and marketing. By leveraging our strategic partners’ assay development capabilities, customer relationships and distribution channels, we believe that we can continue to achieve measurable market penetration and product adoption. Our remaining partners are in various stages of development and commercialization of products that incorporate our technology.
We also serve as an OEM provider for certain strategic partners that choose to sell components of the xMAP product line as an embedded system under their own branding and marketing efforts. 
Customers 
In each of the last three years, one or more customers or partners each accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues. LabCorp accounted for 20%, 24% and 21% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. accounted for 13%, 13% and 17% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.  No other customer or partner accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 or 2014; however, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. accounted for 7%, 8% and 7% of our total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The loss of any of these customers or partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The loss of any of these customers (including LabCorp’s decision to move to an alternative vendor for women’s health products in 2018 discussed further on Page 23) could have a material adverse effect or our business, financial condition and results of operations.
International Operations
We currently ship our products to a number of customers outside the United States, primarily including customers in Canada, Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.  For the annual periods ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, foreign shipments to customers totaled $47.9 million, $37.3 million, and $39.0 million, respectively, representing 18%, 16% and 17%, respectively, of our total revenues for such periods.  We have foreign subsidiaries in Canada, the Netherlands, the People’s Republic of China, Japan, and Hong Kong, which increase our international support, service and marketing capabilities.  Sales to territories outside of the U.S. are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars.  We believe that our activities in some countries outside the U.S. involve greater risk than our domestic business due to the foreign economic conditions, exchange rate fluctuations, local commercial and economic policies and political uncertainties.  See Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
Technical Operations
Our Technical Operations Group provides technical assistance to our customers, our distributors, our strategic partners and their customers. Most of our technical operations personnel have experience as biologists, biochemists or electrical engineers and have extensive experience in academic, industrial and commercial settings. Cross training is a major focus, as is empowering group members to solve problems outside of their primary assignment.
11

Remote Support
Our technical support department assists users primarily through a toll-free hotline, internet interface and e-mail communications.  We deliver “24/7” remote technical support with our staff based at our Austin, Northbrook and Toronto locations and from our European, Chinese and Japanese subsidiaries to better serve our customer base.  Personnel assist our distributors, strategic partners and customers in inquiry and complaint management related to Luminex products, system implementation and development of their assays. A comprehensive software and database system is utilized to track customer interactions, follow trends and measure utilization. The information is categorized and presented to management for regular review. 
Training
Luminex offers comprehensive programs in basic system training, advanced assay development, instrument field service and technical support functions. A portion of our training material is web-based and available online. Customers have the option to receive training on-site at their location or locally, with our staff based at our Austin, Northbrook, European, Chinese or Japanese offices. 
Field Support
We currently have field service and field application personnel based across North America, Europe, China and Japan in areas of our more significant system concentration.  In addition, several of our distributors and strategic partners provide their own field service and field application support. As we continue to expand our installed base, we believe a strong, reliable, efficient field support organization is crucial to maintaining a high level of customer satisfaction. 
Research and Development 
Our research and development groups work to develop next generation systems, chemistries, assays and software to provide new, innovative products to our customers. Our research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, was $48.7 million, $42.7 million and $43.1 million, respectively, including customer-sponsored research funding of $0.0 million, $0.4 million and $0.7 million, respectively.
Our current research and development projects include:

• | New platform and technology development

Our research and development group has been working on the development of the next generation, sample-to-answer, molecular diagnostic, automated Verigene System (Project Atlas). This involves the final design and development of the instrument, consumables and software as well as the development of a menu of assay products for that system. We currently expect to initiate clinical studies on the system and its first assay in 2017.

• | New sample to answer menu development

Our research and development group has been working on a pipeline of new targeted and syndromic assays for use on the ARIES®, Verigene and next generation Verigene (Project Atlas) systems. These automated assays are primarily in the area of infectious disease testing.

• | Partnership projects

Luminex has invested in a small early stage company, which, if successful, could provide an updated xMAP platform. Luminex on occasion collaborates on other partnered research programs. 
Manufacturing 
Luminex has approximately 60,700 square feet of manufacturing space located at our principal executive offices in Austin, Texas.  In addition, we have approximately 10,000 square feet of manufacturing space located in Madison, Wisconsin, approximately 6,000 square feet of manufacturing space located in Toronto, Canada, and approximately 13,797 square feet of manufacturing space located in Northbrook, Illinois.

We initially certified our Quality Management System (QMS) to the ISO 9001:2000 standard and in 2010 updated our certification to ISO 9001:2008.  ISO is an internationally recognized standard for quality management systems.  Subsequent audits by the registrar have been and will continue to be carried out at regular intervals to ensure we are maintaining our system in compliance with ISO standards.  Recertification is required every three years and we have been successfully recertified since obtaining our original ISO certification.  Also, we have our QMS certified to the ISO 13485:2012 Quality Management Standard and the Canadian Medical Devices Regulation (CMDR).  These standards include a special set of requirements specifically related to the supply of medical devices and related services.  Additionally, we manufacture to current FDA "Good Manufacturing Practice" requirements and our QMS is implemented in accordance with FDA Quality System Regulations (21 CFR 820).
Supply Chain
We have historically purchased many of the components and raw materials used in our products from numerous suppliers worldwide. For reasons of quality assurance, sole source availability or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are available only from one supplier. We have worked closely with our suppliers to develop contingency plans to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability, and in some cases, we have established long-term supply contracts with our suppliers.  Due to the high standards and FDA requirements applicable to the manufacturing of our products, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for certain components or materials. In the event that we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials or components on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, our ability to manufacture our products on a timely and cost-competitive basis may be compromised, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Instruments
Component suppliers and contract manufacturers provide certain components and component assemblies of our xMAP and ARIES® Systems. The remaining assembly and manufacturing of our systems are performed at our facilities in Austin, Texas and Northbrook, Illinois. The quality control and quality assurance protocols are all performed at our facilities.  Parts and component assemblies that comprise our technology systems are obtained from a number of sources.  We have identified alternate sources of supply for several of our strategic parts and component assemblies.  Additionally, we have entered into supply agreements with most of our suppliers of strategic parts and component subassemblies to help ensure component availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such components.  As of December 31, 2016, a total of 13,782 Luminex multiplexing analyzers had been shipped since inception. 
Microspheres
We procure our undyed, standard Microplex microspheres and manufacture our magnetic Magplex carboxylated polystyrene microspheres.  We synthesize our dyes and manufacture our dyed microspheres using a proprietary method in our Austin, Texas manufacturing facility in large lots.  We dye the microspheres with varying intensities of red and near infrared dyes to produce our distinctly colored microsphere sets. We currently purchase the standard polystyrene microspheres from one supplier, in accordance with a supply agreement. We believe this agreement will help ensure microsphere availability and flexible purchasing terms with respect to the purchase of such microspheres. While we believe the microspheres will continue to be available from our supplier in quantities sufficient to meet our production needs, we believe our in-house manufacturing capabilities along with other potential suppliers would provide sufficient microspheres for us if given adequate lead-time to manufacture the microspheres to our specifications.
Assays and Reagents
Component suppliers and contract manufacturers produce certain components of our developed reagents. The remaining assembly and manufacturing of our on-market kits are performed at one of our facilities in Austin, Texas; Toronto, Canada, Madison, Wisconsin, or Northbrook, Illinois. The quality control and quality assurance protocols are all performed at our facilities.  Reagents, consumables and other raw material that comprise our kits are obtained from a number of sources. 
In addition to developed assay kits, increasing regulatory requirements coupled with rising demand for new clinical applications are driving demand for laboratory developed tests. Our proprietary technologies and platforms offer a unique combination of flexibility and throughput, as our systems' open architecture, software and standard protocols allow our customers the ability to use our proprietary reagents to validate and verify a new test, while being able to utilize the same system to handle increasing volumes once the assay is commercialized. 
13

Competition
We design our xMAP systems and consumables for use by customers across the various segments of the life sciences, pharmaceutical and clinical diagnostic industries. Our xTAG, NxTAG, MultiCode, ARIES® and Verigene products are developed specifically for the molecular diagnostic segment. Our competition includes companies marketing conventional testing products based on established technologies such as ELISA, real-time PCR, mass spectrometry, gene sequencing, biochips, arrays and flow-based technologies as well as companies developing their own advanced testing technologies. 
The pharmaceutical industry is a large market for the genomic, protein and high-throughput screening applications supported by xMAP technology. In each application area, Luminex faces a different set of competitors. Genomic and protein testing can be performed by products available from Affymetrix, Inc. (a Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. brand), Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. brand), Becton, Dickinson and Company, Illumina, Inc., Qiagen N.V., Meso Scale Discovery (a division of Meso Scale Diagnostics LLC), Quanterix Corporation and PerkinElmer, Inc., Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc. and others.
Our diagnostic market competitors include, among others, Abbott Laboratories, Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. brand), BioFire Diagnostics, Inc. (a bioMérieux company), Cepheid (a Danaher Corporation company), GenMark Dx, Roche Diagnostics, Siemens Medical, Hologic, Inc., Alere, Inc., Quidel Corporation, Focus Diagnostics (DiaSorin S.p.A), T2 Biosystems, Inc., Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Meridian Bioscience, Inc., Great Basin Scientific, Inc. and Illumina, Inc. Some of these companies have technologies that can perform a variety of established assays. In addition, certain of these companies offer integrated systems and laboratory automation that are designed to meet the need for improved work efficiencies in the clinical laboratory.
Competition within the academic biomedical research market is highly fragmented. There are hundreds of suppliers to this market including, among others, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, a part of GE Healthcare, Life Technologies Corporation (a Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc. brand) and Becton, Dickinson and Company. 
Intellectual Property

To establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products, we rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality agreements.  We have filed for registration or obtained registration for trademarks used with our products and key technologies. 
We have implemented a strategy designed to optimize our intellectual property rights. For core intellectual property, we are pursuing patent coverage in the United States and those foreign countries that correspond to the majority of our current and anticipated customer base. We currently own 563 issued patents worldwide, including 192 issued patents in the United States. Other countries in which we have issued patents directed to various aspects and applications of our products and technology include France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Australia, Japan, Netherlands, Canada, Hong Kong and China, amongst others. In addition, our patent portfolio includes 166 pending patent applications in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions.  We believe our patents and pending claims provide, or will provide, protection for systems and technologies that allow real-time multiplexed analytical techniques for the detection and quantification of many analytes from a single sample. We also hold patents covering the precision-dyeing process used in the manufacture of our fluorescent microspheres and patents covering digital over-sampling to measure the area of a fluorescence pulse instead of “peak detection,” giving increased sensitivity with no lost events. In addition, multiple granted patents and pending applications describe aspects of Multicode technology, xTAG technology, nanoparticle technology, the ARIES® and Verigene Systems and NxTAG technology.

The source code for our proprietary software is protected as a trade secret and/or as a copyrighted work. Aspects of this software also are covered by an issued patent. 
We also rely on trade secret protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with strategic partners, third parties, employees and consultants. Our employees and third-party consultants also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in inventions and original works of expression and any corresponding patents and copyrights arising from their work for us. See Item 1A, "Risk Factors - The property rights we rely upon to protect the technologies underlying our products may not be adequate to maintain market exclusivity. Inadequate intellectual property protection could enable third parties to exploit our technologies or use very similar technologies and could reduce our ability to distinguish our products in the market."
14

Government Regulation
Our products are generally considered medical devices and are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and similar agencies outside the United States. To varying degrees, each of these agencies require us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, and distribution of our medical devices. Our business is also affected by the United States and foreign patient privacy laws, cost containment initiatives and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. The primary laws and regulations that are unique to our business are described below. 
Food and Drug Administration 
The development, testing, manufacturing, marketing, post-market surveillance, distribution, advertising and labeling of our products is subject to regulation in the United States by the FDA. FDA regulations require that certain products have pre-marketing clearance or approval by the FDA and require certain products to be manufactured in accordance with the FDA’s “Good Manufacturing Practice” requirements. This requires that some products be extensively tested, and all to be properly labeled to disclose test results, performance claims and limitations. Unless an exemption applies, before we can introduce a new product into the U.S. market, we must obtain FDA clearance by premarket notification 510(k) or similar pathway, or obtain premarket approval (PMA). 
If we can establish that our product is “substantially equivalent” to a pre-amendment or previously cleared device for which the FDA has not called for premarket approvals, we may seek clearance from the FDA to market the product by submitting a 510(k). The 510(k) requires the support of appropriate data, including, in some cases, clinical data establishing the claim of substantial equivalence to the satisfaction of the FDA. A number of 510(k) clearances for our products have been obtained.
Where a product is not deemed as substantially equivalent to a pre-amendment or previously cleared device, a more rigorous PMA process is required. This PMA process requires us to independently demonstrate that the new medical device product is safe and effective by collecting data regarding design, materials and human clinical data. Only if the FDA determines there is reasonable assurance that the medical device is safe and effective, will the FDA authorize the device’s commercial release. The PMA process is much more detailed, time-consuming and expensive than the 510(k) process.
Numerous post-marketing regulatory requirements apply for our products, including, certain recordkeeping and reporting requirements, such as FDA’s medical device and corrections/removal reporting regulations. The FDA enforces its requirements by inspection and market surveillance. FDA has authority to take various administrative and legal actions against us if we or our products fail to comply with relevant legal or regulatory requirements. Such could include warning letters, product seizures, product recalls or withdrawals and/or other civil or criminal sanctions.
We manufacture versions of the Luminex instruments for use with diagnostic assay kits that are available through our strategic partners. For FDA purposes, the Luminex systems are IVD cleared and are considered components of our partners’ kit products. Kits manufactured by our strategic partners used in conjunction with our technology, may be subject to clearance or approval before they can be marketed and sold and are generally subject to FDA requirements such as Good Manufacturing Practices and others. Our partners are also subject to a number of other requirements in the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its regulations, such as Good Clinical Practice requirements, Device Registration and Listing, and compliance with the FDA's current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations. These regulations, also known as the Quality System Regulations, govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, servicing, installation and distribution of all finished medical devices intended for human use. Our strategic partners are also subject to other pre-market and post-market controls such as labeling, complaint handling, medical device reporting, corrections and removals reporting and record keeping requirements. Upon evidence of non-compliance with applicable regulations, FDA can detain or seize products, request or, in certain circumstances, require a recall, impose operating restrictions, enjoin future violations, recommend criminal prosecution to the Department of Justice and/or assess civil and criminal penalties against our strategic partner, us, or our officers and our employees. Other regulatory agencies may have similar powers. In addition, various federal and state statutes and regulations govern or influence the manufacturing, safety, storage of our products and components as well as our record-keeping. There can be no assurance that such requirements will always be met without interruption, or that the FDA will file, clear or approve our strategic partners’ submissions. 
15

We also manufacture kit products intended for Research Use Only applications (not for diagnostic use), kits that are IVD cleared for diagnostic use (currently regulatory classification of Class I and II), and Investigational Use Only or clinical applications. Although certain products intended for research use only are not currently subject to clearance or approval by the FDA, research use only products fall under the FDA’s jurisdiction if they are used for clinical rather than research purposes. Further, even where a product is not otherwise subject to clearance or approval by the FDA, the FDA, in order to limit sales to those who use the products for research only, can determine the manner in which we can market and sell our products and/or the types of customers to which we can market and sell our products.
Consideration of Research Use Only products including genetic analysis tools, and the process and extent of regulating Laboratory Developed tests in which our technology may be used, is presently underway at the Agency. The nature and extent of rule changes and policy initiatives, and its effects on present and future products, and impact on our business in this area cannot be predicted.

Laboratories that purchase certain of our products are subject to extensive regulation under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), requiring laboratories to meet specified standards in areas such as personnel qualifications, administration, participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Adverse interpretations of current CLIA regulations or future changes in CLIA regulations could have an adverse effect on sales of any affected products.
Certain of our instruments use lasers to detect assay results. Therefore, we are required to ensure that these products comply with FDA regulations pertaining to the performance of laser products. The Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act, administered by the FDA, imposes performance standards and record keeping, reporting, product testing and product labeling requirements for devices that emit radiation. These regulations are intended to ensure the safety of laser products by establishing standards to prevent exposure to excessive levels of laser radiation. There can be no assurance that the FDA will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations.
Foreign Jurisdictions
Medical device laws and regulations are also in effect in many countries outside of the United States ranging from comprehensive pre-approval requirements for medical products, to simpler requests for product data or certification. The number and scope of these requirements is increasing. There can be no assurance that we, and our strategic partners, will be able to obtain any approvals that may be required to market xMAP technology products outside the United States. In addition, we may incur significant initial and/or ongoing costs in obtaining or maintaining our foreign regulatory approvals. Further, the export by us of products that have not yet been cleared for domestic commercial distribution is subject to FDA or other export requirements and/or restrictions.
We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, or administrative or other penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future government contracts and programs.
We produce CE marked products, which are subject to a number of different European Union (EU) Directives, including, but not limited to, the In Vitro Diagnostic Devices Directive (98/79/EC) (IVDD). CE marking of our products is currently by self-declaration, not issued by a third party, based on the intended uses of our products. A product that is not CE marked is automatically considered to be non-compliant. The law is enforced through market surveillance by appointed national enforcement agencies. Imported products are checked for compliance at customs offices.
No in vitro device or accessory may be placed on the market or put into service unless it satisfies the essential requirements set forth in the IVDD. Devices considered to meet the essential requirements must bear the CE marking of conformity, placed by the manufacturer, when introduced on the market. A manufacturer placing devices on the market in its name must notify its national competent authorities. 
There can be no assurance that the EU member states will agree with our interpretation and implementation of these regulations as it pertains to classification of our products. The failure by us or our strategic partners to comply with the IVDD could have a material adverse effect on our business.
16

The State Food and Drug Administration, P.R. China (SFDA), is the government regulation authority in charge of safety management of drug, food, health food and cosmetics for the People’s Republic of China. The SFDA issues certificates that are required for registration and approval to import our products into China. Certificates are also subject to periodic recertification requirements.  We have received certificates for the “Luminex System,” which combines the Luminex 100 and Luminex 200 into one product, and for our MAGPIX System.
Failure by us, or our strategic partners, to comply with applicable current federal, state and foreign medical product laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business. Federal, state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices and components of such devices are continually subject to future changes. We cannot predict what impact, if any, such changes might have on our business, but any such change could have a material impact.
WEEE
The European Community Council Directive 2002/96/EC on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) outlines the responsibility for the disposal of waste electrical and electronic equipment. Compliance with WEEE is placed with the manufacturers of such equipment.  Those manufacturers are required to establish an infrastructure for collecting WEEE, in such a way that users of electrical and electronic equipment from private households should have the ability of returning WEEE at least free of charge.  All Luminex-manufactured equipment is in compliance with this directive. We have been in compliance with the requirements since August 13, 2005, regarding the labeling and disposal of our products containing electronic devices in each of the EU member states where our regulated products are distributed. 
RoHS
RoHS stands for “The Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment” and implements EU Directive 2002/95, which bans the placing on the EU market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyl and polybrominated diphenyl ether flame retardants. 

The Directive directly affects producers who manufacture or assemble electrical or electronic equipment in the EU, importers of electrical or electronic equipment from outside the EU and companies that re-brand electric producers as their own. The Directive applies to electrical and electronic equipment falling under the categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 10 set out in Annex IA of the WEEE Directive (2002/96/EC).  Equipment categories 8 and 9 defined in the WEEE Directive are currently outside the scope of the RoHS Directive.  Luminex IVD equipment is classified as category 8 (Medical Devices) in Annex IA of the WEEE Directive, which is not covered within the scope of the RoHS Directive.  Luminex research equipment is classified as category 9 (Monitoring and Control Instruments) in Annex IA of the WEEE Directive, which is not covered within the scope of the RoHS Directive.
17

Environmental 
We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment. In the course of our business, we are involved in the handling, storage and disposal of certain chemicals and biohazards. The laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment. Some of these environmental laws and regulations impose “strict liability,” rendering a party liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such party. Such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for environmental contamination, including remediation costs, natural resource damages and other damages as a result of the conduct of, or conditions caused by, us or others or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. Although it is our policy to use generally accepted operating and disposal practices in accordance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, hazardous substances or wastes may have been disposed or released on, under or from properties owned, leased or operated by us or on, under or from other locations where such substances or wastes have been taken for disposal. These properties may be subject to investigation, remediation and monitoring requirements under federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. However, failure to comply with these environmental laws and regulations may result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal penalties or other liabilities. We do not believe that we have been required to expend material amounts in connection with our efforts to comply with environmental requirements or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations may frequently change and new environmental laws and regulations may be adopted, we are unable to predict the cost of compliance with such requirements in the future, or the effect of such laws on our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. Moreover, the modification or interpretation of existing environmental laws or regulations, the more vigorous enforcement of existing environmental laws or regulations or the adoption of new environmental laws or regulations may also negatively impact our strategic partners, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on us and other similarly situated component companies.
Other Government Regulations
Our operations in the United States are subject to various federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and state and federal marketing compliance laws. These laws may impact our operations directly or indirectly through our customers and may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. We are also subject to statutes in foreign jurisdictions that prohibit commercial bribery and certain activities with customers or potential customers. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include the following foreign laws, federal laws and their counterparts at the state level in addition to various implementing regulations: 
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and state anti-kickback prohibitions; 
•the federal physician self-referral prohibition, commonly known as the Stark Law, and state equivalents; 

• | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended and implementing privacy, security and breach notification regulations;

•the Civil Monetary Penalties Law and related exclusion provisions; 
•the federal False Claims Act and state equivalents; 
•the U. K. Bribery Act of 2010;
•the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which applies to our international activities; and 
•the Physician Payment Sunshine Act. 
Other
Based on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (the Health Reform Law), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) implemented a medical device excise tax of 2.3% of the sale price on non-exempt medical devices. This tax on manufacturers, producers and importers has not had, nor do we expect it to have, a material impact on our operations. A two-year moratorium on this tax took effect on January 1, 2016 under the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015.

The Health Reform Law resulted in extensive changes across the healthcare system, affecting coverage, delivery and reimbursement of services. However, there is substantial uncertainty regarding the future of the Health Reform Law because of the results of the 2016 federal elections, which will likely result in the repeal of the Health Reform Law or significant changes to the Health Reform Law, its implementation and its interpretation. It is possible that the reforms imposed by the Health Reform Law or uncertainty regarding its repeal or significant changes to the law will adversely affect our customers and strategic partners, which could cause them to reduce or delay the purchase of our systems or to demand reduced fees. 
Employees
As of February 23, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, we had a total of 914 and 936 employees and contract employees, as compared with 806 as of December 31, 2015.  The year over year increase is primarily the result of the acquisition of Nanosphere, which was completed on June 30, 2016, partially offset by the headcount reduction related to our December 2016 reorganization of approximately 50 employees.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have not experienced any work stoppage. We believe that relations with our employees are good.
Seasonality

Worldwide sales, including U.S. sales, do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, sales of our Respiratory Viral products have demonstrated seasonal fluctuations consistent with the onset and decline of influenza-like illnesses.
Financial information relating to our business for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 can be found in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
