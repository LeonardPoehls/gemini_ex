Item 1. BUSINESS
General
 
Dominion Minerals Corp. (the “Company,” “we” or “us”) was previously engaged in the acquisition, exploration, development and operation of mineral and natural resource properties and prospects. The Company’s only current activity is pursuing a claim against the Republic of Panama, as described below, and seeking new mining projects. The following subsections set out information on our history and present and proposed operations and certain of the risk factors associated with us and our securities.
 
History of the Company
 
The Company was formed as a Delaware corporation on January 4, 1996 under the name ObjectSoft Corporation. On May 9, 2005, The Company changed its name to Nanergy, Inc. On June 5, 2006, its name was changed to Xacord Corp. On January 3, 2007, the Company changed its name to Empire Minerals Corp. and on November 26, 2007, it was changed to Dominion Minerals Corp.
 
We were originally formed in January of 1996 to acquire the business of a predecessor company, ObjectSoft Corporation, a New Jersey Corporation. This acquisition was completed in the form of a corporate business combination effective January 31, 1996. The acquired business involved the provision of retail Kiosks, which were internet-connected, advertising-interactive Kiosks. The Kiosks were public access terminals that offered entertainment information and the ability to execute financial transactions via a touch screen. This business was unsuccessful and in July of 2001, we filed a Bankruptcy Petition in the Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. None of our present officers, directors or significant employees were associated with us at the time of or involved in any way in our bankruptcy proceeding. In November of 2004, we exited the Bankruptcy case with no assets, one liability in the form of a convertible promissory note with a principal balance of $100,000 and 195 shares of common stock outstanding. We then operated as a shell corporation seeking a new business opportunity either through a corporate business combination or an acquisition of assets.
 
In September of 2005, we were a party to a business combination in which we acquired the ownership of a New Jersey corporation holding licenses, patents and developments to certain photovoltaic processes. In this transaction, the Company issued 99,455 shares of our common stock. The Company also agreed to issue additional shares of common stock and stock options, if certain economic milestones were met by December 31, 2006. These economic milestones were not met. In 2006, we abandoned our efforts to develop the processes.
 
During the period from June 17, 2005 to the date of this filing, the Company effected three reverse stock splits of its outstanding common stock by amending its Certificate of Incorporation. On June 17, 2005, each outstanding 100 shares were reversed into one share. On August 11, 2006, each 20 outstanding shares were reversed into one share. On January 22, 2007, each 20 outstanding shares were reversed into one share. In all three reverse splits, all fractional shares due to be issued were rounded up to the next full share. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to a number of shares of the Company's common stock have been adjusted to give effect to the applicable stock splits.

On February 20, 2007 we completed a business combination in which we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Empire Minerals Corp. (the “Nevada Subsidiary”) in exchange for shares of our common stock. The combination was structured as a three-party merger in which the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of the Nevada Subsidiary by merger with a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company formed for the purpose of the acquisition. A total of 26,504,000 shares of the Company's stock were issued in the acquisition And the Company assumed four warrants issued by the Nevada Subsidiary to purchase up to a total of 4,050,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock at $0.10 per share during a three-year term. A warrant to purchase 50,000 shares was exercised on March 2, 2007. The remaining three warrants for 4,000,000 shares were canceled by mutual agreement of the parties on June 1, 2007. The Company acquired the rights of the Nevada Subsidiary under a Letter of Intent to enter into the agreements relating to the acquisition of a majority interest in the Panamanian corporation holding a concession to a copper prospect described below. 
 
On March 6, 2007, the Company entered into an Exploration and Development Agreement with Bellhaven Copper & Gold, Inc. (“Bellhaven”), a corporation organized in British Columbia, Canada and Bellhaven’s then wholly-owned subsidiary, Cuprum Resources Corp. (“Cuprum”), a corporation organized in Panama.  Cuprum was the holder of a Mineral Concession from Panama on a copper prospect located in the Guariviara area of Panama.  That agreement granted the Company an option to acquire up to 75% of the authorized and outstanding stock of Cuprum.  On April 14, 2009, the Company and Bellhaven completed a transaction pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement under which the Company acquired 100% of Cuprum’s outstanding stock and the Exploration and Development Agreement entered into on March 6, 2007 was terminated.
 
Present and Proposed Operations
 
The Company’s present operations consist solely of pursuing its claims against the Republic of Panama relating to its Mineral Concession from the Republic of Panama on a copper prospect (“Cerro Chorcha”) located in the Guariviara area of Panama and seeking new mining projects.
Panamanian Mineral Concession
 
Significant Events and Developments of the Panamanian Mineral Concession
 
On March 6, 2007, the Company entered into an Exploration and Development Agreement with Bellhaven and Cuprum relating to Cerro Chorcha. This agreement granted the Company an option to acquire up to 75% of the authorized and outstanding stock of Cuprum in exchange for (i) the payment of $2,000,000 to Bellhaven by the Company; (ii) the issuance of 4,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock to Bellhaven; (iii) the expenditure of no less than $15,000,000 for the exploration and development work on the property covered by the Panamanian Mineral Concession held by Cuprum, of which approximately $5,244,051 had been spent as of April 14, 2009; and (iv) other specific terms and conditions. 
 
On April 14, 2009, the Company and Bellhaven completed a transaction under a Stock Purchase Agreement between them pursuant to which (i) the Company acquired a 100% interest in all the outstanding stock of Cuprum; (ii) the Company paid Bellhaven $1,500,000 in cash and issued Bellhaven 2,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock; (iii) the officers and directors of Cuprum were replaced by the officers and directors of the Company; and (iv) the March 6, 2007 Exploration and Development Agreement between the Company, Bellhaven and Cuprum was terminated and the Company and Bellhaven mutually released each other from all obligations and/or liabilities arising thereunder.

On December 24, 2009, the Supreme Court of Panama issued an Order of Provisional Suspension in response to a lawsuit filed by Cesar Salazar against the Republic of Panama Ministry of Commerce and Industry (“MICI”). The lawsuit alleges among other things that MICI granted the Concession Agreement to Cuprum unlawfully. The Company considers the claims frivolous and although the suit did not name the Company or Cuprum as a defendant, in February 2010 the Company exercised its right under Panama Law, as an interested third party, by filing a petition in the Supreme Court of Panama, defending the allegations. Pursuant to the Order of Provisional Suspension, any administrative or operational activities to be performed pursuant to the Concession Agreement by the Company or any Ministry or Office of the Republic of Panama, are indefinitely suspended. To date, the Company has not received a response to its petition. In addition, no final ruling has been issued by the Supreme Court of Panama.
 
In March 2010, the Company filed an application of extension to its Concession Agreement with MICI. In accordance with the Concession Agreement, the 2-year extension to continue exploration activities shall be granted by MICI with another 2-year extension to be granted after that. Requirements of such extension consist of (i) full compliance of the terms of the Concession Agreement during the initial 4-year period; (ii) proof of ability to perform financially by the Company; and (iii) proof of ability to perform technically by the Company. The Company in its application complied with each requirement. According to MICI, due to the Order of Provisional Suspension issued by the Supreme Court of Panama, MICI was not able to process or respond to the application of extension to the Concession Agreement.
 
In April 2010, to the contrary of the Order of Provisional Suspension issued by the Supreme Court of Panama, MICI issued and posted a resolution on the Gazeta Oficial of Panama declaring the site of the concession a “Mining Reserve.” Pursuant to the resolution, no further exploration and/or mining activities are to be performed on the site of the concession.
 
As of December 2013, MICI has provided no response to the lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court in December 2009. The Company has not received a resolution or response to the petition filed by the Company, from the Supreme Court of Panama. Although, the Company never received a “resolution of cancelation” from MICI, the application of extension submitted by the Company to MICI was neither, approved nor rejected. As explained by MICI that the concession remained in a “frozen” status pursuant to the Order of Provisional Suspension issued by the Supreme Court of Panama and the application of extension could not be processed. The Company considers the Concession Agreement active and plans to continue its operations upon resolution of the lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of Panama and Order of Provisional Suspension being lifted.

On December 5, 2013, the Company notified the Panamanian government of the Company’s intent to initiate arbitration proceedings under the U.S.-Panama Bilateral Investment Treaty (“U.S.-Panama BIT”) and the U.S.-Panama Trade Promotion Agreement (“U.S.-Panama TPA”).  As the Panamanian government has not responded to the Company’s requests to discuss a negotiated settlement, The Company filed a formal request for arbitration at the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) on March 29, 2016.  The Company has determined the amount of relief that it will seek in the arbitration shall be $268,300,000. There can be no assurance that it will be successful or recover any amount. 
 
The dispute involves the Panamanian government’s interference with the Company’s investment in the mining concession.  Cuprum owns the exploration rights to the Cerro Chorcha concession.  As discussed above, the Panamanian Ministry of Commerce and Industry (“MICI”) was named as a defendant in a lawsuit brought by Cesar Salazar in December 2009, which led to the “provisional suspension” on all actions involving the Cerro Chorcha.  Awaiting resolution of the lawsuit, the Company filed an application for an extension of its exploration rights in March 2010, one month before the initial exploration concession was to expire.  However, despite the provisional suspension placed on the Cerro Chorcha, the Panamanian government designated the Cerro Chorcha as a “mining reserve” in April 2010 without considering the Company’s extension request, with the purpose and intent of reverting ownership of the concession to the Panamanian government.  Furthermore, the Panamanian government subsequently passed legislation that annulled existing mining concessions in the area encompassing Cerro Chorcha in March 2013.  The Company believes that these actions of the Panamanian government are unlawful and contravene Panama’s international obligations under the U.S.-Panama BIT and the U.S.-Panama TPA.
 
On March 29, 2016, the Company filed a Request for Arbitration against the Republic of Panama (Panama). This request was filed with the Secretary-General of the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) under the terms of the U.S.-Panama Bilateral Investment Treaty (the U.S.-Panama BIT). The Request for Arbitration is the result of the above mentioned longstanding dispute arising from Panama’s expropriation of Dominion’s substantial investment in the Cerro Chorcha mining concession.
 
The Request for Arbitration sets forth Dominion’s claims as follows:
 

· | Panama’s actions amounted to an expropriation of Dominion’s investment within the meaning of Article IV of the U.S.-Panama BIT, as they had the effect of depriving Dominion of all or substantially all of its investment in Cerro Chorcha; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Panama’s actions breached its obligations under Article II of the U.S.-Panama BIT to accord fair and equitable treatment to Dominion with respect to its investment in Cerro Chorcha.

Description of the Panamanian Mineral Concession
 
The Cerro Chorcha concession consists of 24,241.91 hectares (“ha”) in five rectangular blocks and is located in Chiriqui and Bocas Del Toro Provinces of Panama straddling the continental divide about 290 km west of Panama City as shown in the following map.

The closest city to Cerro Chorcha is David, Panama's third largest city, which is about 40 km to the southwest of the concession site. Travel from Panama City to David requires approximately six hours by car along a paved two-lane highway. There are a number of daily commercial flights between these two cities.
 
To both the north and south of the concession site there are a number of small towns and villages all connected by a system of roads and trails. A north-south paved road passes within the northwest portion of the Cerro Chorcha concession; however, this highway occurs on the opposite side of the Continental divide to the main camp which is accessible only by helicopter or on foot.
 
Currently helicopter flights to the main Cerro Chorcha camp and work area are out of Rambala a small town 31 kilometers north of the camp. There is a dirt road from Rambala to the village of Soloy. A foot trail leads from Soloy to the Cerro Chorcha camp. This route requires one day and a half to traverse by auto and foot.
 
Elevations on the property range from about 600 m to 2213 m at the top of Cerro Chorcha and slopes are steep. The higher elevations near the Continental Divide are often cloud covered generated by warm, moist Caribbean air that is lifted daily to cooler heights by air currents. Due to the weather effects, access to the concession site by helicopter is best achieved in the early morning and in the late afternoon.
 
The mountain terrain is covered in high altitude rain forest with annual rainfall reported to be up to about six meters. Temperatures in this locality average 20(degree) C to 25(degree) C but during some month’s temperatures can dip down to 5(degree)C at night. Work on the concession site can be undertaken at any time of the year.
 
The main Chorcha exploration camp consists of four large all-weather buildings powered by a diesel generator. Within the region, personnel, supplies, fuel, water and sufficient space for a mining operation are readily available.
 
The Cerro Chorcha Mineral Exploration Concession (Contract # 006,2005) at Cerro Chorcha was granted to Cuprum on April 4, 2006. In March 2010, the Company made its application for the extension of the Concession. As of the date of this Registration Statement, the Company has not received notice of the cancellation of the Concession Contract or any approval or denial of the application for extension.
 
The area falls under the local jurisdictions of the District of San Lorenzo in Chiriqui Province and the District of Chiriqui Grande in the Province of Betas Del Toro.

Mineral title to Cerro Chorcha was previously held under Exploration Concession 93-71 (Geo-Minas, S.A.). These concessions expired in 1999 and were officially cancelled by publication in the Official Gazette (No. 25,029) on April 15, 2004. An application for a new concession (CRC-EXPL 2004-05) was accepted on May 17, 2004 in the name of Cuprum.

The owners of the former concession lodged legal complaints objecting to the cancellation of their concession and the re-application by Cuprum. All legal complaints opposing the cancellation of the concession have been rejected by the Supreme Court of Panama. The new metallic mineral concession at Cerro Chorcha was granted to Cuprum and published in the Official Gazette (No. 25,517) on April 4, 2006. A metallic mineral exploration concession is valid for four years, with extensions available for another four. There are various reporting requirements and a tax on the exploration concessions which begins at US$0.50 per ha the first year and increases to US$1.50 per ha in year five.
 
The owner of the exploration mineral concession has an exclusive right to the application of an exploitation concession. The terms under which major projects proceed are negotiated with the government.
 
A portion of the Chorcha concession occurs on an autonomous aboriginal land reserve (Comarca) of the Ngobe-Bugle (see figure 2). There are no permanent habitations in the area of concession.
 
Cuprum signed an exclusive mineral exploration agreement (the "Agreement") with the Comarca on July 28, 2004. The Agreement granted Cuprum the exclusive rights to explore for minerals and to negotiate a new agreement with the Comarca for the "next phase of activity" upon completion of the exploration phase. The Agreement is valid until the expiration of the Exploration Concession and strictly follows the Panama Mining Code whereby an exploitation concession is granted once the presence of commercial ore is demonstrated.
 
The Agreement (resolution #1 Feb 12, 2006) was signed by the President of the Regional Congress of the NoKribo Region (Mr. Enrique Pineda), the Chief of the NoKribo Region (Mr. Johnny Bonilla), and the president of the Local Congress of the Kanicintti District of the NoKribo Region (Mr. Julian Palacio) and, for Cuprum, the General Manager and Secretary of the Board of Directors (Mr. Alfredo Burgos).

Among the issues covered by the Agreement are: work progress, budgets and reporting; employment and training; land rentals and leasing; development programs; environment, education and culture; force majeure; settlement of conflicts; notification, continuity and applicable laws.
 
A joint committee was created by Cuprum and the peoples of the Comarca. Monthly meetings of the committee are held to review development and to ensure continued mutual support. All work planned by the Company and Cuprum to date have been formally reviewed by and approved by the operating committee.
 
The north western portion of the Concession is in the watershed of the Fortuna Hydroelectric Project. Significant development in the hydra-electric reserve area would require approval from Fortuna S.A. (a corporation composed equally of Americas Generation Corp. and the State of Panama) which purchased the publicly owned Institute deRecursos Hidro-electricos y Electrificacion (IE) in 1998.
 
The mineralized area, as presently known, is far outside of the reserve, in fact it is on the other side of the Continental Divide from the Fortuna Project and therefore does not affect the catchment area.
 
Exploration work can be performed within the boundaries of the hydro-electric reserve, as long as we present the plan and procedures that adhere to the respective regulations they will not affect the watershed. A portion of the Palo Seco Reserve Forestal (Forestry Reserve) enters the concession from the north and extends to within about one kilometer north of the main mineralized zone, although legal survey of this has not yet been done.
 
ANAM (Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente), Panama's environmental agency, is responsible for the administration of the forest reserve.
 
The Palo Seco Reserve, Forestal is divided into various sub-zones, each of which has a different level of protection. The current management plan does not specifically address mineral exploration and development, however the portion of the Palo Seco Forest Reserve nearest the Chorcha Project is assigned to a highly protected status with entry permitted only for scientific research. In the past exploration has been permitted within the limits of forest reserves, however damages must be mitigated.
 
Prior exploration work on Cerro Chorcha has not resulted in anything that could be considered to be an environmental liability.
 
Most of Panama consists of island arc assemblages of Cretaceous to Recent age which have resulted from the subduction of the Cocos tectonic plate underneath the Caribbean plate.
 
In western Panama, where Cerro Chorcha is located, Miocene andesitic to basaltic flows and volcanoclastic rocks of the Caflazas Group have been intruded by Pliocene to Miocene granodiorite and monzonitic rocks of the Tabasara.
 
The Porphyry copper deposits in Panama are associated with calc-alkaline intrusives. Panama hosts two 'world class' mineralized systems at Cerro Colorado and at Petal Pine, each containing in excess of one billion tons of mineralized rock.
 
At Cerro Chorcha the main area of interest occurs within a composite intrusion, consisting of diorite, quartz diorite, and lesser amounts of monzodiorite. Small bodies and dykes of quartz feldspar porphyry and mafic dykes cut the various intrusive phases and are considered to be post-mineral.
 
The Cerro Chorcha project contains porphyry copper mineralization with related gold and some reported molybdenum. Oxide and hypogene copper zones are present.
 
Distal propylitic (chlorite, epidote, and actinolite) alteration surrounds proximal phyllic (sericitie and silicic) zones. Much of the chalcopyrite and bornite mineralization occurs in a quartz-magnetite stock work and vein facies within the intrusive.

There is a strong structural component to the more or less east-west trending mineralized body which is cut by conjugate NE-SW and NW-SE trending faults.
 
By analogy with the Cerro Colorado porphyry copper deposit only 35 km to the ESE it is thought that the porphyry copper mineralization at Cerro Chorcha is between three and five million years old.
 
There are scattered mineralized showings over the entire 242 square kilometer Cerro Chorcha concession.
 
Porphyry copper (Cu) mineralization with associated gold, silver and molybdenum occur at the main Cerro Chorcha zone (the Guariviara Zone) over an area measuring 1.1 kilometers by 500 meters.
 
Much of the mineralization is structurally controlled and is related to quartz-magnetite sulphide veining and stockwork zones within the intrusive rocks. Laterally outward from the quartz-magnetite zones, sericite-altered intrusive rock contain fracture/veinlet controlled sulphides. The alteration outward from the phyllic, sericitic and siliceous material is predominantly propylitic.
 
Minerals encountered in the hypogene zone consist of magnetite, chalcopyrite, pyrite, bornite and minor sphalerite and molybdenite. Only minor supergene mineralization has been observed.
 
Exploration by previous operators has included regional stream sediment geochemistry, prospecting, trenching, soil and rock chip sampling, aerial and ground geophysics, and the drilling of 35 drill holes aggregating 7036 in.
 
ASARCO Exploration Company of Canada Ltd. discovered the Guariviviara Zone during a regional stream sediment program initiated in 1969. In 1976, exploration efforts included sampling, mapping and trenching resulted in defining porphyry copper mineralization grading greater than 0.2% Cu over an area of 600 meters by 300 meters.
 
ASARCO mobilized a drill onto the property. Negotiations with the Government to improve the terms of the concession agreement failed and the company abandoned the project without drilling. A total of over 400 samples were taken and assayed during the ASARCO tenure.
 
In the period 1990 to 1992 Consultores Geologicos S.A. obtained a concession and confirmed the importance of the zone discovered by ASARCO.
 
In 1993 the original concession was grouped together in a land package measuring 24,350 ha in an agreement between Consultores Geologicos and GeoRecursos International S.A. and the concession was transferred to Geo-Minas, S.A.
 
During 1993 a north-south grid was cut with 200m line spacing. A total of sixty-seven soil, 30 rock and 64 chip samples were taken as part of a regional prospecting program.
 
In the period 1994 and 1995 GeoRecursos International S.A. and Arlo Resources (Arlo) expanded the grid, performed geochemical, geological, and magnetic surveys and regional prospecting work.
 
GeoRecursos and Arlo completed 27 helicopter-supported diamond drill holes on the Guariviara Zone for a total of 5,765 meters.
 
During 1997 and 1998 Cyprus Minera de Panama (Cyprus) obtained an option on the property. Cyprus expanded the grids, refined the geology of the deposit, mapped and sampled outlying zones, conducted airborne radiometric and magnetic surveys and drilled nine diamond drill holes for a total of 1271 meters. Cyprus left Panama and the concession remained dormant, finally being officially cancelled April 15, 2004.

Following approval of the new Chorcha mineral concession Cuprum and Belhaven undertook the construction of the Chorcha exploration camp and conducted a short program of geologic mapping and one-meter channel samples were collected from several zones of structurally-controlled quartz-magnetite stock work that appears to host the high-grade copper-gold-silver mineralization. Reported grades within the stock work zone, returned a total of 61 meters at an average grade of 1.89% Cu, 1.44 g/t Au, and 23.28 g/t Ag.
 
Based upon exploration work on the Cerro Chorcha, Bellhaven and the Company have procured a technical report on the property which was prepared in compliance with the National Instrument (NI) 43-101, "Standards of Disclosure For Mineral Projects" adopted by Canadian securities regulatory authorities. However, a company reporting under the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may not report resources designated under NI 43-101 based upon a pre-feasibility study. In addition, to designate reserves under the Industry Guide 7 of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission a final or bankable feasibility study is required. Accordingly, while Bellhaven, Cuprum and the Company have used the NI 43-101 report in their evaluation of the property, they are not claiming or asserting any reserves for the Cerro Chorcha and it must be considered as an exploration property without any known resources. The proposed program for the Cerro Chorcha is exploratory in nature.
 
The final two phases of a three phase program of geologic investigation was planned to be conducted with Cuprum serving as the operator. Apart from direct geologic work, each phase of the program included the funding of some social program with the local indigenous groups.
 
Phase One included surface prospecting, surface geologic mapping, trenching and sampling as well as an 11-hole diamond drill program of 3,615.8 meters. The phase one program was conducted from March 2007 to November 2007, had a budget of $2.1 million dollars and actual costs of $2,100,492.
 
A contract with Cabo Drilling Corp. (Cabo), of Vancouver, B.C. Canada was signed to perform the drill program on March 14, 2007. In preparation for the drill program, the Company built drill pads and fuel storage facilities. The 3,600-meter drill program was commenced in June 2007 and concluded in November 2007 with eleven drill holes and 3,615.8 meters have been drilled with encouraging results.
 
The drill program of 3,615.8 meters, confirmed the Company’s geologic model which outlined a structurally controlled mineralized zone with a NE-SW direction. Holes CH-07-01 to CH-07-11 drilled across the higher grade stock work structures, identifying a zone of nearly 900 meters in strike length, which will be further defined by the next drilling campaign. Additionally, the drill program confirmed an envelope of medium grades (ranging from 0.4 to 0.8% Cu) which surround the higher grade stock work zones.
 
All holes drilled appeared to indicate potential for the extension of the higher grade zone at depth as evidenced by dipping mineralized structures observed in drill core and as shown on cross sections. This possibility was planned to be explored to greater extent by a10,000 meter drill program.
 
The previous drill program gives better context to the probable continuity of higher grade stock work and porphyry-style mineralization within areas of previously unexplained rock and soil geochemical anomalies surrounding the known Chorcha deposit. These anomalies are located within 0.5 to 1 kilometer to the north, south and east of the drill indicated resource, and are now being investigated by field crews to develop drill targets for the next tentative drill program. The updated NI-43-101 report, which was published in August 2008, was to serve as the basis for the next 10,000 meter drill program planned for 2016 or later, depending on the Company’s success in negotiations with the Panamanian government or the outcome of legal action mentioned throughout this report. The purpose of the next drill program will be to provide greater continuity to the geological model and to further define the mineralization at Cerro Chorcha which remains open in almost every direction, and to extend porphyry-style copper and gold mineralization to areas adjacent to and surrounding the known deposit.

Copper values were obtained by ICP-MS from Acme Labs, Vancouver for Holes CH-07-01 to CH-07-06, and atomic absorption spectroscopy results were obtained by SGS Labs, Peru for Holes CH-07-07 to CH-07-11. Gold values were performed by fire assay prep and AAS finish. Silver values were obtained by utilizing ICP-MS analysis.
 
Phase Two was planned to include the creation of access road into the Chorcha main zone. Phase two will also include surface prospecting, surface geologic mapping, trenching and sampling as well as a 26-hole, 10,000-meter diamond drill program of systematic drilling utilizing several diamond drill rigs. Phase two will have a budget of approximately $6,900,000. 
 
Phase Three was planned to concentrate on the completion of a bankable feasibility study by conducting the appropriate meters of drilling necessary to complete this task. Further details or the costs affiliated with Phase Three cannot be determined unless a Phase 2 has been completed or until significant results of the Phase two have been assessed.
 
Throughout the exploration all samples will be prepared and analyzed by an independent 1S0 certified laboratory.
 
The exploration work on the Cerro Chorcha project was supervised by Michael D. Druecker, Ph.D., P.Geo a Qualified Person as defined in NI 43-101. Mr. Druecker has verified that trench and drill results have been accurately summarized from the official assay certificates provided to the Company.
 
The Company's drilling sampling procedures followed the Exploration Best Practices Guidelines outlined by the Mining Standards Task Force and adopted by the Toronto Stock Exchange. Samples have been analyzed by ICP (inductively coupled plasma/mass spectrometry), and gold analysis has been by fire assay with gravimetric finish on a 30gram split.
 
Quality control measures, including check duplicates and sample standard-assaying were implemented. A chain of custody review was been completed to ensure the integrity of all sample data. Samples were assayed by Acme Analytical Laboratories, independent of the Company.

The outstanding legal status of the project and the Company's financial condition delayed the Company’s ability to fund the commencement of Phase 2 and the Company’s operations. The Company planned to fund operations including Phase 2 by the sales of shares of the Company’s Common Stock and or Convertible Promissory Notes. However, in order to do so, the legal status of the Company’s Panamanian project must be resolved.
 
Panamanian Regulations
 
The operations conducted on the Cerro Chorcha project by Cuprum are subject to the supervisory and administrative laws of Panama which govern mining activities. In addition, these activities are governed by the terms and conditions of the exclusive mineral exploration agreement between Cuprum and the Regional Congress of the NoKaibo Region, the Chief of the NoKaibo Region and the Local Congress of the Kanicintti District of the NoKaibo Region as set out above. The major Panamanian statutes applicable to these operations are the "Code of Mineral Resources," the "General Corporation Law" and the "General Environmental Law."
Environmental Issues
 
Although our mineral activities are outside the United States of America and not subject to Federal, state or local provisions regarding discharge of material into the environment, they are subject to all the environmental regulations of their respective locales. However, since our proposed activities for the next several years are exploratory in nature, the effect of the regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment will not have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position of the Company.
Plan of Operations
 
During the 12-month period commencing August 1, 2017, the Company will concentrate its efforts on the resolution of legal issues of the Panamanian copper prospect. We believe that it is doubtful that the Company will regain the concession and then any resolution is likely to involve a monetary payment to the Company. If the Company regains the concession, it would seek to resume operations and concentrate on the further exploration of the project. The Company will also continue to evaluate additional mineral acquisitions. The Company has hired outside counsel and on June 18, 2015, entered into a Litigation Funding Agreement (“LFA”) with Therium Capital Management Limited, to fund its litigation against the Republic of Panama. The terms of the LFA allow for funding of up to $8,000,000 of the Company’s litigation costs and require repayment of 2.5 times of the amount funded to the Company for such legal costs. In addition, the Company will be required to share a percentage of any amount awarded to the Company with Therium.
 
In the event the Company is able to regain the concession in Panama as a form of settlement of the litigation, it would resume exploration work which would require approximately 10,000 meters of drilling at an estimated cost of $6,900,000. The Company would need to raise approximately $8,000,000 for the exploration work and the cost of operations for the 12-month period commencing August 1, 2017. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available to the Company.
 
If the Company is not able to regain the concession, the Company’s activities will consist of evaluation of other mineral projects and concessions that will require additional capital of approximately $500,000 to finance all of its operations for the 12-month period commencing August 1, 2017. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available to the Company.
 
Competition
 
In the event we regain the Panama concession, we would face competition from other copper mining and producing companies around the world from companies that are more established and better capitalized. 
 
With respect to seeking new mining projects, we also face competition from larger, more established and better capitalized companies seeking profitable projects around the world.
