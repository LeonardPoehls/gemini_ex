Item 1. Business
Overview

Ixia (the "Company," "we," "us," or "our") was incorporated in 1997 as a California corporation. We help customers validate the performance and security resilience of their applications and networks. Our test, visibility, and security products help organizations make their physical and virtual networks stronger. Enterprises, service providers, network equipment manufacturers, and governments worldwide rely on our solutions to validate new products before shipping and ensure ongoing operation of their networks with better visibility and security. Our product solutions consist of our high performance hardware platforms, software applications, and services, including warranty and maintenance offerings.

We expect that our customers, when asked, would agree that two things are true: applications need to perform even as their network edge has blurred, and security is critical in an environment of exponentially growing IT threats. We are committed to helping our customers' networks perform at their highest level so that our customers' end users get the best performing and most secure application experience available. Better performing applications means an improved end-user customer experience. Security resilience means ensuring network durability against ever-growing IT security threats. 
We help applications perform better through an extensive array of test, security, and visibility solutions that validate, secure, and optimize networks and applications from engineering concept to live deployment. Our products uncover performance and security blind spots within networks and expose vulnerabilities.

We are headquartered in Calabasas, California with operations across the U.S. and in other parts of the world.  Our revenues are principally derived from shipments within the U.S. and to the Europe, Middle East and Africa ("EMEA"), and Asia Pacific regions. See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Form 10-K”) for entity-wide disclosures about products and services, geographic areas, and major customers.

Our powerful and versatile solutions, expert global support, and professional services equip organizations to exceed their customer expectations and achieve better business outcomes. Our solutions provide organizations with a complete understanding of its user behavior, security vulnerabilities, network capacity, application performance, and information technology (“IT”) resiliency. From the research labs to the network cloud, Ixia solutions ensure application performance and security resilience across network and data center infrastructure. No matter what profession or position in the world, connecting to networked applications quickly and securely – from any location – is paramount to success. The convergence of new technologies is complicating the IT landscape – smartphone ubiquity, cloud proliferation, challenges of big data, demands of the social consumer, pervasive cyber threats – intensifying the challenge of constantly, securely, and quickly connecting users to their applications. The delivery of communications and entertainment applications and services is moving to an always-connected, always-on paradigm. Ixia solutions battle-test wired networks, wireless networks, and data center infrastructures, provide seamless access to network & application performance, and enable IT leaders to run highly resilient, high performing networks.

Our solutions are scalable, easy-to-use, and adaptable, automatically providing companies with comprehensive coverage of the latest applications and security attacks in order to optimize performance and protect against threats. Our goal is to enhance application performance and security resilience by providing comprehensive, easy-to-use, and automated solutions that empower our customers to drive their business forward by taking the guesswork out of network reliability and the application services.

Real-world test solutions must recreate the true behavior of network users, at massive scale, with increasing fidelity. Network testing solutions must be highly scalable and capable of generating large amounts of data at high speeds over increasingly complex configurations, and be up to date with the very latest applications and security attacks. Comprehensive, integrated testing must occur throughout network design, development, production, deployment, and operation stages. Because this testing and verification must take place across multiple layers of the network infrastructure and for all network protocols, network testing solutions are also required to be highly flexible, extensible, and modular. This rapid evolution of complex network technologies and protocols - which includes leading-edge technologies such as higher speed Ethernet, wireless, virtualization, software defined networks, and the latest Wi-Fi standards - has resulted in the need for an integrated platform solution that is easy to use, with minimal training and set-up.
Our network visibility solutions intelligently connect data centers and network infrastructures with monitoring solutions that ensure application performance and security resilience. Powered by an easy to use, drag-and-drop interface, our advanced packet processing technologies, including filtering, load balancing, packet shaping, session correlation, application intelligence, and de-duplication, improve the way our customers manage their data centers, prevent network application and service downtime, and maximize return on IT investment. Network visibility is the first step towards a successful security deployment. It is imperative that visibility solutions deliver 100% of the traffic at high speed with advanced processing to ensure effective application security and performance monitoring. 
Integrating our technologies across our platforms to bring valuable solutions to market is a key element of our growth strategy. ThreatARMOR is an example of how our security expertise and IP from our test solutions drives value across our business. ThreatARMOR decreases the attack surface networks and reduces the load on security devices and resources. It further expands the security capabilities of our visibility architecture by leveraging our proprietary Application and Threat Intelligence ("ATI") technology to identify and block known bad traffic at line rate speeds before it can access the network. In addition, ThreatARMOR can identify and stop infected internal devices from communicating with known botnets. 
By leveraging our security technologies across our portfolio, we deliver visibility solutions that enable a secure infrastructure and make security solutions more efficient and resilient. We believe that an effective visibility architecture should do more than just see the traffic--it also needs to help identify where you are vulnerable, reduce your attack surface, and provide intelligence.

Our systems provide our customers with the following key benefits:


• | Versatile High Performance. Our network test solutions generate and receive data traffic at full line rate – the maximum rate that data traffic can be transmitted over a network medium. Our systems provide accurate analysis across multiple layers of the overall network and of individual network components in real time. Our systems can be configured to either generate programmed packets of data or conduct complete sessions.

Our test systems can analyze each discrete packet of information, thereby allowing our customers to precisely measure the performance of their networks and individual network components. This precision allows customers to accurately measure critical quality of service parameters such as throughput, latency, loss, and jitter. It also verifies data integrity, packet sequencing throughout the network, and quality of service ("QoS").
4

When used for realistic application sessions or conversations between network endpoints, our test systems emulate highly complex and specialized applications such as transferring electronic mail, browsing the Internet, conveying voice and video information, managing databases, and establishing wireless calls. This emulation allows our customers to accurately measure critical characteristics of their networks such as session setup rate, session tear down rate, and session capacity. By analyzing the content of these sessions, our customers can also accurately measure QoS and media quality.
Our network visibility solutions allow customers to dynamically aggregate, regenerate, distribute, filter, and condition packets from all parts of the network at full line rate. These high performance systems enable broader network visibility and enhance the performance of customers’ monitoring solutions while reducing costs.

• | Highly Scalable. Each of our network test interface cards provides one or more ports through which our systems generate and receive data traffic. Each physical port contains its own dedicated logic circuits, with substantial memory and compute resources. Our customers can easily scale the size of their test bed or the amount of data traffic generated by inserting additional interface cards. By connecting multiple chassis and synchronizing hundreds of ports to operate simultaneously, our customers can simulate extremely large networks. Our GPS-based components even allow our chassis to be distributed throughout the world, while maintaining the close time synchronization necessary for precision tests. We believe that our systems can offer our customers one of the highest port density and scalable space efficient systems available. In addition, our client-server architecture allows multiple users in the same or different geographic locations to simultaneously access and operate different ports contained in the same chassis to run independent tests. Customers using our high-density network visibility platform can easily scale their visibility needs through flexible port licensing and modular extensions that can grow with their expanding network monitoring needs.


• | Highly Modular Hardware Platform. We offer network test hardware platforms with interchangeable interfaces, using a common set of applications and Application Programing Interfaces ("APIs"). Our architectures enable the emulation of millions of network users on scalable platforms, with a mixture of both network and application layer traffic. These architectures offer our customers an integrated test environment that might otherwise require multiple products to cover the same test scenarios. We believe that our network test hardware platform solutions decrease the overall cost while increasing productivity and scalability, and reducing training requirements for our customers. Our network test hardware products consist of stackable and portable chassis which, depending on the chassis model, can be configured with a mix of interface cards. This modular design allows our customers to quickly and easily create realistic, customized test configurations. Our open architecture accelerates the integration of additional network technologies into existing systems through the addition of new interface cards and distributed software. Our modular approach to network visibility allows customers to increase port density, add higher speed links, and/or add advanced features – helping customers to future proof their network monitoring and visibility investments.


• | Flexible. Our customers can easily expand our systems to address changing technologies, protocols, and applications without changing system hardware or replacing interface cards. This protects and optimizes customers’ investments by eliminating the need for “forklift upgrades” or the purchase of additional niche products. Additionally, customers under our ATI subscription service receive automatic bi-weekly updates of the latest applications and attacks for use in their real-world testing scenarios.


• | Automation. Our systems make it easy to create automated tests and network monitoring rules that can run unattended. We offer our customers a growing library of automated tests and monitoring automation scripts that simplify and streamline the test and monitoring processes. The automated tests are repeatable and the results are presented in a structured format for easy analysis. Ixia offers “Click-Thru Automation” that records and repeats interactive operation, providing automation without programming. In addition, Ixia's Tool Command Language ("Tcl") API is a comprehensive programming interface to our hardware, as well as to our software applications. The Tcl API enables libraries of automated scripts to be quickly built with specificity to a customer's environment. We also offer a utility that exports configurations created in our graphical user interface ("GUI") as Tcl scripts. Our visibility solutions can be automated and integrated with monitoring tools using our RESTful API.

5


• | Ease of Use. We have designed our systems so that users can install and operate them with minimal training and setup. Our network test systems are easy to use and offer our customers a wide range of readily accessible pre-designed test configurations. These tests include industry standard and use case-specific tests. Users can easily configure and operate our systems to generate and analyze data traffic over any combination of interface cards or ports through our graphical user interface. Once tests are designed in our GUIs, they can be saved for reuse or in Tcl script form for customization and even greater levels of automation. Our network visibility systems also offer customers best in class ease-of-use, with a point-and-click GUI that enables customers to quickly develop complex filtering and packet distribution algorithms with simple, but powerful, drop-down menus. These configurations can be saved for reuse and automated using our RESTful API.


• | Intelligent. Our products and solutions are designed with high processing capability and intelligence leveraging the deep technical prowess and engineering capabilities at Ixia. These intelligence capabilities manifest themselves in our products in the form of protocol awareness, application context and knowledge of security threat vectors. Ixia continues to be a leader in the market through innovation by making our products more application and security aware and intelligent through analytics so that our customers are presented with relevant and actionable information whether it be test results in a lab environment or resiliency reports for some network equipment or real-time application flow data being sent to a monitoring & security analysis tool.

Customers

Today’s networks and data centers are continuously improving their performance and scale in order to accommodate the plethora of applications and services we now rely upon to do business, communicate, capture memories, plan, travel, and more. Applications drive network capacity, influence quality of experience, introduce potential vulnerabilities, and lead to more innovations. Every organization from device manufacturers, to service providers, to enterprise and government organizations, seeks to optimize networks and data centers in order to accelerate, secure, and scale the delivery of these applications.

Our solutions provide the insight needed for organizations to make real-time decisions that optimize performance, harden security and increase the scalability of networks facing constantly changing requirements. Our line of hardware, software, and other services cater to the needs of network equipment manufacturers ("NEMs"), service providers, and enterprise and government organizations. Our solutions provide an end-to-end approach for our customers to test devices and systems prior to deployment, validate the performance and security of networks and data centers after every change, and help them continuously monitor network application and security behavior to manage performance. 

We provide solutions and services to each of our customer segments, including those set forth below:


• | NEMs. NEMs provide voice, video, and data and service infrastructure equipment to customer network operators, service providers, and network users. Such users require high standards of functionality, performance, security, and reliability. To meet these higher standards, NEMs must ensure the quality of their products during development and manufacturing (prior to deployment). Failure to ensure the consistent functionality and performance of their products may result in the loss of customers, increased research and development costs, increased support costs, and losses resulting from the return of products. NEMs, for example, use our network test systems to run large-scale subscriber and service emulations, generating extreme traffic loads to verify the performance and capacity of their wired and wireless devices prior to deployment in production networks. Our systems are also used by NEMs in the sales and acceptance process to demonstrate to their customers (e.g., service providers and enterprises) how the NEMs’ products will operate under real-world conditions. In addition, our conformance test suites are used by NEMs to ensure that their devices conform to published standards – ensuring that they will be interoperable with other equipment. These equipment manufacturers are also, in many cases, large enterprises and therefore have the same challenges that can be met using our assessment and monitoring solutions within their own internal network.

7


• | Service Providers. Service providers seek to deliver a growing variety of high quality, advanced network services ranging from traditional telecommunications and Internet services, to social networking, cloud storage, and entertainment streaming. Failure to provide a quality experience to the end user can be costly through high subscriber churn rates and reduced revenues. To ensure quality of experience and service assurance, service provider R&D and network engineering groups must verify the performance and functionality of staged networks during equipment selection and network design, prior to deployment and after any change to the production network. Service providers also use our network test systems to emulate millions of mobile subscribers to realistically predict end-user quality of experience delivered by providers’ infrastructure and services. Service providers must also ensure security for customers and their own networks, as the keepers of vast amounts of business and personal data. And finally, service providers depend on our monitoring solutions to filter application traffic in order to prioritize, de-duplicate, and optimize wired and wireless data streams.


• | Enterprises and Government. Enterprise and government organizations depend on their networks and data centers to get business done, and they devote enormous resources to ensure applications and services run optimally and securely. These customers rely on our solutions to help evaluate equipment during selection, optimize and harden their network designs in labs prior to roll-out, and once rolled out, continuously monitor the production network to ensure optimal performance and security of the contents flowing through it. Notably, organizations must always be vigilant against the impact of security threats to its business critical network. Using our solutions, they consistently ensure their network and data center are optimized and resilient. Our security solutions are also used by major organizations to train their staff on the new generation of “cyber warfare and mitigation techniques” to recognize and defend against massive cyber-attacks.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, we received orders from approximately 2,600 new and existing end customers. Based on product shipments for the year ended December 31, 2016, our significant customers by category included:


• | Leading NEMs such as Cisco Systems, Juniper Networks, and Alcatel-Lucent;


• | Voice, broadband and/or wireless service providers such as Verizon, AT&T, and NTT;


• | Enterprises such as Oracle, Kaiser Permanente, and Wells Fargo; and


• | Government contractors, departments and agencies such as Raytheon, Defense Information Systems Agency, and the U.S. Army.

We do not have long-term or volume purchase contracts that commit our customers to future product purchases, and as a result our customers may reduce or discontinue purchasing from us at any time.

Backlog

Backlog consists of purchase orders that we have received and accepted for products and services. Our backlog includes orders for products scheduled to be shipped and for services scheduled to be delivered to our resellers and customers within 90 days. Purchase orders for products are generally shipped within 90 days after acceptance, unless a later shipment date is requested by the reseller or customer. Services are performed in accordance with our contractual commitments to our customers. Our backlog at December 31, 2016 was approximately $15.1 million, compared with a backlog of approximately $16.9 million at December 31, 2015.

We typically ship our products within the quarter in which the related product orders are received. A substantial portion of our orders is received during the last month of the quarter, and a significant percentage of those orders is received during the last week of that month.

Because our product shipments in any quarter may be affected by our customers’ rescheduling of product delivery dates and changes in and cancellations of orders by our customers (which changes and cancellations can usually be effected prior to shipment without significant penalty), and because a significant portion of our revenue in a quarter is attributable to product orders shipped in the same quarter during which they are received, we do not believe that the amount of our backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily a meaningful indicator of our future business prospects or financial performance.

8

Although it is generally our practice to ship and bill for products shortly following our acceptance of an order, we from time to time exercise discretion over the timing of certain product shipments, which can increase or decrease the amount of our backlog and affect the timing of revenue recognition for such shipments. In such cases, we may consider a number of factors, including the degree to which we have achieved our business objectives for the quarter, especially with respect to product orders received late in a quarter. We may also consider our manufacturing and operational capacity to fulfill product orders, delivery dates requested by our resellers and customers, our contractual obligations to our resellers and customers, and the creditworthiness of our resellers and customers. Our ability to ship products shortly following our acceptance of an order may also be adversely impacted by the time required to comply with applicable export laws and regulations.

Timing of revenue recognition for services may vary depending on the contractual service period or when the services are rendered. 
Product Technology

The design of our products requires a combination of sophisticated technical competencies, including designs utilizing field programmable gate arrays ("FPGAs"), network processors ("NPs"), packet switching ASICS, embedded systems, high speed electrical and optical serial interfaces, high speed and low latency memory technology, large scale system software, and high speed packet and data processing software. FPGAs are integrated circuits that can be repeatedly reprogrammed to perform different sets of functions as required. NPs are special programmable integrated circuits optimized for networking applications. Many of our systems also require high-speed digital hardware design, software engineering and optical and mechanical engineering. We have built an organization of professional staff with skills in all of these areas. The integration of these technical competencies enables us to design and manufacture test systems which are highly scalable to meet the needs of our customers.

Complex Logic Design. Our systems use FPGAs that are programmed by the host computer and therefore can be reconfigured for different applications. Our newest products have high clock frequencies, which are the timing signals that synchronize all components within our system, and logic densities, which are the number of individual switching components, or gates, of more than four million gates per chip. Our customers may obtain updates and enhancements from our website, thereby allowing rapid updates of the system. Almost all of our logic chips are designed in the hardware description language including VHSIC Hardware Description Language and System Verilog, which are unique programming languages tailored to the development of logic chips. These languages enables the easy migration of the hardware design to application specific integrated circuits as volumes warrant. We develop code in a modular fashion for reuse in logic design, which comprises a critical portion of our intellectual property. This reusable technology allows us to reduce the time-to-market for our new and enhanced products.

Network Processor Technology. Our patented NP technology enables our products to emulate complex networks and data centers at a very high scale and analyze traffic on live networks in real time in order to take action against security threats or provide the user relevant analytics for network operations departments. The programmability of the NPs allows our customers to remain current with new networking technologies, security threats, and new application types by allowing customers to obtain frequent updates and enhancements from our website.
Application and Threat Intelligence ("ATI") Technology. We invest in security research to characterize the ever changing landscape of valid applications and harmful threats that exist on the Internet. This research enables us to produce a database of threat signatures, harmful IP addresses, and valid application signatures that is used across the product portfolio for network test, network security, and network visibility. This database is used by our test products to emulate threats and valid applications, used by our security products to block known threats, and used by our visibility products for application level visibility to network operations. Our NP technology embeds ATI technology. The security research team is continuously updating the database, and our customers are able to receive these updates via our available ATI subscription service as new threats emerge.

Software Technology. We devote substantial engineering resources to the development of software technology for use in our product lines on both physical appliances and as Virtual Editions to run on Virtual Machines using off-the-shelf compute platforms. We have developed software to control our systems, analyze data collected by our systems, process network traffic, and monitor, maintain, and self-test our hardware and field programmable gate array subsystems. A majority of our software technology and expertise is focused on the use of object-oriented development techniques to design software subsystems that can be reused across multiple product lines. These objects are client and server independent allowing for distributed network applications. This software architecture allows all of the software tools developed for our existing products to be utilized in all of our new products with very little modification. Another important component of our software technology is our graphical user interface design. Customer experience with our test and visibility products has enabled us to design a simple yet effective method to display complex configurations in clear and concise graphical user interfaces for intuitive use by engineers.

Products and Services

Our product solutions consist of our hardware platforms, such as our chassis, interface cards and appliances, software application tools, and services, including our warranty and maintenance offerings and professional services. Our highly scalable and flexible products enable our customers to configure solutions based on their specific networks and use cases. For example, if our customer wants to analyze the performance of an Ethernet router, the customer could purchase our network test hardware platform, including a chassis and one or more Ethernet interface cards, and our IxNetwork software application.
Products

Sales of our network test hardware products typically include a chassis and one or more Ethernet interface cards. Our software applications and APIs allow our customers to create and manage integrated, easy-to-use automated test environments. Our hardware platform consists largely of interchangeable interface cards which fit into multi-slot chassis. Our chassis are metal cases that incorporate a computer, a power supply, and a backplane which connects the interface cards to the chassis. The interface cards generate, receive, and analyze a wide variety of traffic types at multiple network layers.

Our primary 12-slot network test chassis (e.g., XGS12) provides a high-density, highly-flexible test platform. Operating in conjunction with our software applications, our chassis provide the foundation for a complete, high-performance test environment. A wide array of interface cards is available for our primary chassis. The 12-slot Ixia chassis supports up to 192 1 Gigabit Ethernet (GE) ports, 192-10GE ports, 384-25GE ports, 120-40GE ports, 40-50GE ports, and 96-100GE ports. These interface cards provide the network interfaces and distributed processing resources needed for executing a broad range of data, signaling, voice, video, and application testing for layers 1-7 of the network stack. Each chassis supports an integrated test controller that manages all system and testing resources. Resource ownership down to a per-port level, coupled with hot-swappable interface modules, ensures a highly-flexible, multi-user testing environment. Backward compatibility is maintained with key existing Ixia interface cards and test applications to provide seamless migration from and integration with existing Ixia test installations.
We offer a number of interface cards that operate at speeds of up to 400 gigabit per second. Each one of our interface cards contains multiple independent traffic generation and analysis ports that operate at line rate. Each port on most interface cards has a unique transmit stream engine that is used to generate packets of information and a real-time receive analysis engine capable of analyzing the packets as they are received. The transmit stream engine generates millions of data packets or continuous test sequences at line rate that are transmitted through the network and received by the analysis engine. When data packets have been generated, the analysis engine then measures throughput, latency, loss, and jitter, and checks data integrity and packet sequence on a packet-by-packet basis. In addition, our systems measure the effectiveness of networks in prioritizing different types of traffic. Most of our current generation interface cards also include a microprocessor per port to generate and analyze sophisticated routing protocols, such as BGP and MPLS, as well as application traffic such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and SSL. Certain of our application and security load modules can recreate more than 35,000 attacks, including exploits, malware, denial of service (DoS), and mobile malware. These load modules provide application and threat assessment solutions at Internet-scale, and create massive-scale, high fidelity simulation and testing conditions for battle-testing infrastructures, devices, applications, and people.

We offer a comprehensive suite of software applications in conjunction with our network test hardware platforms to address specific technologies. These applications measure and analyze the performance, functionality, interoperability, service quality, and conformance of networks, network equipment and applications that run on these networks. These applications enable network equipment manufacturers, service providers, enterprises and governments to evaluate the performance of their equipment and networks during the design, manufacture and pre-deployment stages, as well as after the equipment is deployed in a network. Our technology-specific application test suites are targeted at a wide range of popular application and security performance and conformance requirements across various protocols, interfaces and types of devices. These include automated and targeted delivery, functionality and performance test for technologies and devices including storage, video, voice, intelligent networks, specific applications, routing, switching, Wi-Fi, broadband, wireless, software defined networks, and virtual networks and functions. All of these technologies are used in variety of situations including (but not limited to) R&D test environment, change management, and scenario planning for production networks.

We also develop virtual versions of our core network test products designed to test virtual assets and environments using trusted technologies that have been used for testing hardware-based network equipment for a decade. These products help accelerate the development of our customer’s virtual products and allow enterprises, service providers, and governments to quantify its benefits by using our trusted technologies.

Our network visibility products improve the way our enterprise, service provider, and government customers manage their data centers, save valuable IT time, and maximize return on IT investments. Ixia network visibility solutions revolutionize the way customers monitor their network - enabling complete network visibility into physical and virtual networks, and optimizes monitoring tool performance whether out-of-band or in-line. Our network visibility platform ranges from network access test access point ("TAPs"), to solution-specific appliances for smaller implementations to a 100GE, high-density NEBS3 compliant chassis designed for large and complex data centers. These products help our customers monitor their rapidly growing number of 1GE, 10GE, 40GE, and 100GE ports with existing monitoring tools. Sales of our network visibility products typically consist of an integrated, purpose-built hardware appliance with proprietary software which includes patented filtering and content handling technology that ensures each monitoring tool gets exactly the right data needed for analysis, all powered by the easy to use, drag-and-drop management system.  We also offer advanced processing modules that easily slide into certain of our appliances for additional advanced intelligence and functionality including de-duplication, packet slicing, and time-stamping. Our latest advanced feature module is the Application and Threat Intelligence Processor ("ATIP") that delivers real-time application data to monitoring tools to allow customers to make better decisions with respect to identifying unknown network applications, and threats to network infrastructure from suspicious applications and locations.

In addition to our core network visibility functionality, we also have a number of available features that give customers greater flexibility and intelligence for their network visibility implementations. For example, we believe that an effective visibility architecture should do more than just see the traffic--it also needs to help identify where you are vulnerable, reduce your attack surface, and provide intelligence. Our Hawkeye solution quickly and effectively validates network performance, isolates problems, and proactively detects issues by running scheduled verification tests on any site using wireline or wireless connections. Using a combination of hardware and software agents called Performance Endpoints, Hawkeye simulates application traffic and sends key performance metrics to a central console for fast action. Our ThreatARMOR product expands the security capabilities of our visibility architecture by decreasing the attack surface of the network and reducing the load on security devices and resources. Customers can deploy our network visibility solutions not only out-of-band in physical networks, but in-line for security applications and in virtual environments with our in-line technologies and Phantom virtual TAP software application, respectively. Another example is the GTP Session Controller that intelligently manages high-scale, session-aware, mobility load balancing deployments. In addition, our ControlTower solution allows customers to deploy, manage, and maintain distributed implementations with ease.

Products in Development

We continue to develop our IP testing capabilities, and we intend to remain focused on improving our position in performance, security, monitoring, functional, interoperability, service quality, and conformance in several technology areas. Our product development teams have deep networking, applications, and security expertise and understand the incredibly diverse set of problems our customers need to solve today as well as new challenges customers will face as network technologies evolve. Our teams constantly work to improve current solutions as well as push forward into new areas relevant to the markets in which we compete. These technologies include a host of networking, application, and security technologies and protocols ranging from faster speeds like 400 GE and beyond to software defined networking and network functions virtualization, to old and new protocols that allow the data to traverse those environments.

We may delay or cancel the introduction of new products to the market as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. For more information regarding these factors, see “Business – Research and Development” and “Risk Factors – If we are unable to successfully develop or introduce new products to keep pace with the rapid technological changes that characterize our market, our results of operations will be significantly harmed.”

Competition

The market for providing network test and monitoring systems is highly competitive, and we expect this competition to continue in the future. We currently compete with network test and monitoring solution vendors such as Spirent Communications, Gigamon, and NetScout. We also compete either directly or indirectly with large Ethernet switch vendors and network management, analysis, compliance, and test tool vendors that offer point solutions that address a subset of the issues that we solve. Additionally, some of our significant customers have developed, or may develop, in-house products for their own use or for sale to others.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:

• | Breadth of product offerings and features on a single test or monitoring platform;


• | Timeliness of new product introductions;


• | Product quality, reliability and performance;


• | Price and overall cost of product ownership;


• | Ease of installation, integration and use;


• | Customer service and technical support; and


• | Company reputation and size.

We believe that we compete favorably in the key competitive factors that impact our markets. We intend to remain competitive through ongoing research and development efforts that enhance existing systems and result in the development of new products and features. We will also seek to expand our market presence through marketing and sales efforts.

We expect to continue to experience significant competition from our existing competitors, and from companies that may enter our existing or future markets. And, as we move into new market segments within the broader network test and monitoring arena, we will be challenged by new competitors. These companies may develop similar or substitute solutions that may be more cost-effective or provide better performance or functionality than our systems. Also, as we broaden our product offerings, we may move into new markets in which we will have to compete against companies already established in those markets. Some of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, substantially greater financial, product development, marketing, service, support, technical and other resources, significantly greater name recognition, and a larger installed base of customers than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers and have extensive knowledge of our industry. It is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors will emerge and rapidly acquire market share. Moreover, our competitors may consolidate with each other, or with other companies, giving them even greater capabilities with which to compete against us.

To be successful, we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to the challenges of changing customer requirements, technological advances and competitors’ innovations. Accordingly, we cannot predict what our relative competitive position will be as the market evolves for network test and monitoring solutions.

Sales, Marketing and Technical Support

Sales. We use our global direct sales force to market and sell our products and solutions. In addition, we use distributors, value added resellers, system integrators, and other partners to complement our direct sales and marketing efforts for certain vertical and geographical markets. We depend on many of our distributors, resellers, and other partners to generate sales opportunities and manage the sales process. Our direct sales force maintains close contact with our customers and supports our distributors, resellers, and other partners. Another key component of our go-to-market strategy for certain products is strategic relationships with technical partners. These technical partners consist of network monitoring and management companies, including Computer Associates, Riverbed, Dynatrace, FireEye, Cisco, Imperva, Anritsu, and others, to complement their monitoring or security solutions. We work with technical partners in two main ways: (i) through customer referrals and recommendations and (ii) through automation integration/interoperability that provides a differentiated solution for our customers.
12

Marketing. We have a number of ongoing programs to support the sale and distribution of our products and solutions and to inform existing and potential customers, partners and distributors about the capabilities and benefits of our systems. Our marketing efforts also include promoting our business by:

• | Sponsoring technical seminars and webinars that highlight our solutions;


• | Participating in industry trade shows and technical conferences;


• | Advertising in digital media publications and physical locations;


• | Writing and distribution of various forms of collateral, including brochures, white papers, solution briefs, and application notes;


• | Demonstrating the performance and scalability of our products at our executive briefing center proof-of-concept labs;


• | Communicating through our corporate website and various social media outlets, such as LinkedIn, Twitter, and our corporate blog; and

We have invested in developing our case management system, support phone system, and other tools to increase our global support capability thereby allowing us to respond quickly, route customers to the best support engineer, and effectively manage their requests to resolution.

Manufacturing and Supply Operations

Our manufacturing and supply operations consist primarily of new product introduction, test and manufacturing, test engineering, supply chain management, procurement, quality assurance, order management, final assembly, configuration testing, fulfillment, and logistics. We outsource the manufacture, assembly, and testing of printed circuit board assemblies, certain interface cards, and certain chassis to third party contract manufacturers and assembly companies, the most significant of which are located in Malaysia and Mexico. This manufacturing process enables us to operate without dedicating substantial space and personnel solely to manufacturing operations. As a result, we can leverage a significant portion of the working capital and capital expenditures that may be required for other operating needs.

We are dependent upon sole or limited source suppliers for some key components and parts used in our systems, including among others, field programmable gate arrays, memory devices, processors, oscillators, and optical modules. We and our contract manufacturers forecast consumption and purchase components through purchase orders. We have no guaranteed or long-term supply arrangements with our respective suppliers. In addition, the availability of many components is dependent in part on our ability and the ability of our contract manufacturers and assembly companies to provide suppliers with accurate forecasts of future requirements, as well as the global commodity market. Any extended interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from a sole or limited source, or delay in transitioning to a replacement supplier’s product or replacement component into our systems, could disrupt our operations and significantly harm our business in any given period.
13

Lead times for materials and components ordered by us and by our contract manufacturers vary and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, purchase terms, global allocations, and demand for a component at a given time. We and our contract manufacturers acquire materials, complete standard subassemblies, and assemble fully-configured systems based on sales forecasts and historical purchasing patterns. If orders do not match forecasts or substantially deviate from historical patterns, we and our contract manufacturers and assembly companies may have excess or inadequate supply of materials and components.

Research and Development

We believe that research and development is critical to our business. Our development efforts include anticipating and addressing the network performance, security, and monitoring needs of network equipment manufacturer, service provider, enterprise and government customers, and focusing on emerging high growth network technologies.

Our future success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop new products that address the needs of our customers. We closely monitor changing customer needs by communicating and working directly with our customers, partners, and distributors. We also receive input from our active participation in industry groups responsible for establishing technical standards.

Development schedules for technology products are inherently difficult to predict, and there can be no assurance that we will introduce any proposed new products in a timely fashion. Also, we cannot be certain that our product development efforts will result in commercially successful products or that our products will not contain software errors or other performance problems or be rendered obsolete by changing technology or new product announcements by other companies.

We plan to continue making significant investments in research and development, including investments in certain product initiatives. Our research and development expenses were $102.5 million in 2016, $113.4 million in 2015, and $115.2 million in 2014. These expenses included stock-based compensation of $6.5 million in 2016, $6.6 million in 2015, and $6.8 million in 2014.
Intellectual Property and Proprietary Rights

Our success and ability to compete are dependent in part upon our ability to establish, protect, and maintain our proprietary rights to our intellectual property. We currently rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret, and copyright laws, and restrictions on disclosure and use, to establish, protect, and maintain our intellectual property rights. We have patent applications and existing patents in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions. We cannot be certain that these applications will result in the issuance of any patents, or that any such patents, if they are issued, or our existing patents, will be upheld. We also cannot be certain that such patents, if issued, or our existing patents, will be effective in protecting our proprietary technology. We have registered the Ixia name, the Ixia logo and certain other trademarks in the United States, the European Union, and other jurisdictions, and have filed for registration of additional trademarks.

We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our officers, employees, consultants, and vendors, and in many instances, our customers. We also generally limit access to and distribution of our source code and further limit the disclosure and use of other proprietary information. However, these measures provide only limited protection of our intellectual property rights. In addition, we may not have signed agreements containing adequate protective provisions in every case, and the contractual provisions that are in place may not provide us with adequate protection in all circumstances.

Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use technology or information such as trade secrets that we regard as confidential and proprietary. We cannot be certain that the steps taken by us to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technology. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Any infringement or misappropriation of our intellectual property rights could result in significant litigation costs, and any failure to adequately protect our intellectual property rights could result in our competitors’ offering similar products, potentially resulting in loss of competitive advantage, loss of market share, and decreased revenues. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could significantly harm our business.

14

The telecommunication and data communications industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement. From time to time, third parties may assert patent, copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property rights to technologies or related standards that are important to our business. We generally have not conducted searches to determine whether the technologies that we use infringe upon or misappropriate intellectual property rights held by third parties. Any claims asserting that any of our products or services infringe or misappropriate proprietary rights of third parties, if determined adversely to us, could significantly harm our business. See Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding the risks associated with patents and other intellectual property.

Employees

As of December 31, 2016, we had 1,817 full time employees, 881 of whom were located in the U.S. We also from time to time hire temporary and part-time employees and independent contractors. Our future performance depends, to a significant degree, on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified technical, sales and marketing, and senior management personnel. Our employees are not represented by any labor unions, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
