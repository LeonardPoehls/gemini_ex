Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a leading provider of business spend management, or BSM, solutions. We offer a comprehensive, cloud-based BSM platform that has connected hundreds of organizations with more than three million suppliers globally. Our platform provides greater visibility into and control over how companies spend money. Using our platform, businesses are able to achieve real, measurable value and savings that drive their profitability. 
 Our cloud-based BSM platform has been designed for the modern global workforce that is mobile and expects real-time results, flexibility and agility from software solutions. We empower employees to acquire the goods and services they need to do their jobs by applying a distinctive user-centric approach that provides a consumer Internet-like experience, drives widespread adoption of our platform and, therefore, significantly increases an organization’s spend under management. We refer to the process companies use to purchase goods and services as business spend management and to the money that they manage with this process as spend under management. Increased user adoption and spend under management drive better visibility and control of a company’s spend, resulting in greater savings and increased compliance.
 Economic conditions, intense competition and the global regulatory environment are forcing businesses to find new ways to drive operational efficiencies, track processes, reduce costs, fund business growth and enhance profitability and cash flow. Therefore, managing business spend has increasingly become a major strategic imperative to help businesses achieve cost savings. Indirect spend, which refers to goods and services that support a company’s operations as opposed to direct spend that flows into the products a company manufactures, is particularly difficult to manage due to inefficient employee spending behavior and disparate systems that obstruct spend visibility.
 We offer a comprehensive, cloud-based BSM platform that is tightly integrated and delivers a broad range of capabilities that would otherwise require the purchase and use of multiple disparate point applications. The core of our platform consists of procurement, invoicing and expense management modules that form our transactional engine and capture a company’s business spend. In addition, our platform offers supporting modules to help companies further manage their spend, including strategic sourcing, spend analysis, contract management, supplier management and inventory management. We also offer a purchasing program, Coupa Advantage, that leverages the collective buying power of Coupa customers, and provide benchmarking and insights to customers on our BSM platform through a solution we refer to as Community Intelligence. Moreover, through our Coupa Open Business Network, suppliers of all sizes can easily interact with buyers electronically, thus significantly reducing paper, improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs. 
 
We have a strong results-driven and customer success-focused culture. Our focus is on delivering quantifiable business value to our customers by helping them maximize their spend under management to achieve real, measurable value and savings. With a rapid time to deployment, typically ranging from a few weeks to several months, and an easy to use interface that shields users from unnecessary complexity, our customers can achieve widespread user adoption quickly and generate savings within a short timeframe, thus benefitting from a rapid return on investment.
 We benefit from powerful network effects. As more businesses subscribe to our BSM platform, the collective spend under management on our platform grows. Greater aggregate spend under management on our platform attracts more suppliers, which in turn attracts more businesses that want to take advantage of the goods and services available through our platform, thereby creating powerful network effects. In addition, as more businesses and employees use our platform, the amount of spend under management continues to increase. This leads to more value and savings for customers and improves our ability to attract more businesses. The resulting increase in sales enables us to further invest in our platform and to improve our functionality and user interface to continue to attract more businesses and suppliers to our platform, which enhances the network effects that benefit all parties.

We have developed a rich partner ecosystem of systems integrators, implementation partners, resellers and technology partners. We work closely with several global systems integrators, including KPMG, Deloitte, Accenture, PwC and Wipro, that help us scale our business, extend our global reach and drive increased market penetration. We expect the number of our partner-led implementations to continue to increase over time, as well as sales referrals from our partners.
 We have achieved rapid growth in customer adoption, cumulative spend under management and transactions conducted through our platform which is currently subscribed to by more than 700 customers. Our cumulative spend under management is highlighted below: 


As of January 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our cumulative spend under management was $680 billion, $365 billion and $190 billion, respectively. Cumulative spend under management does not directly correlate to our revenue or results of operations because we do not charge our customers based on actual usage of our BSM platform.  However, we believe that cumulative spend under management illustrates the adoption, scale and value of our platform, which we believe enhances our ability to maintain existing customers and attract new customers.
 
For our fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, our revenues were $186.8 million, $133.8 million and $83.7 million, respectively, and our net losses were $43.8 million, $37.6 million and $46.2 million, respectively, as we focused on growing our business.
 The Coupa BSM Platform 
 We offer a comprehensive, cloud-based BSM platform that can significantly improve savings for businesses. The core of our platform consists of procurement, invoicing and expense management modules that form our transactional engine and capture a company’s spend. In addition, our platform offers supporting modules to help companies further manage their spend, including strategic sourcing, spend analysis, contract management, supplier management and inventory management. We also offer a purchasing program, Coupa Advantage, that leverages the collective buying power of Coupa customers, and provide benchmarking and insights to customers on our BSM platform through a solution we refer to as Community Intelligence. Moreover, through our Coupa Open Business Network, suppliers of all sizes can easily interact with buyers electronically, thus significantly reducing paper, improving operating efficiencies and reducing costs.

Our BSM platform provides businesses with real-time visibility into spending that is occurring company-wide and enables businesses to drive adoption of the platform and capture, analyze and control this spend, achieve real measurable value and savings and directly improve their profitability: 
  
• | Drive Adoption. Our platform applies a distinctive user-centric approach that shields users from complexity and provides a mobile-enabled consumer Internet-like experience, thus enabling widespread adoption of our platform by users across the entire organization as well as suppliers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capture. At the core of our platform is our transactional engine that is comprised of our procurement, invoicing and expense management modules, which collectively capture spend within an organization. Given purchase orders, invoices and expense reports flow through our platform and the data is stored centrally in a clean and organized fashion, businesses are able to observe the company-wide spending activities in real time. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analyze. Our spending analytics capabilities provide intuitive spend analysis dashboards and reports that deliver real-time analytical insights that help businesses identify problems and make better spending decisions. Real-time analytical insight is critical to helping identify savings opportunities and risks, as well as isolating problem areas in the spending process to target improvement efforts. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Control. We help our customers control and streamline their spending activity, as well as realize efficiencies that result in real savings. Our platform has extensive functionality that enables managers to prevent excessive spend and reduce spend through realizing efficiencies and cost savings associated with strategic sourcing and contract compliance. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Save. Within a short timeframe, we help our customers realize measurable value and savings by taking advantage of pre-negotiated supplier discounts, achieving contract compliance, improving process efficiencies and reducing redundant and wasteful spending, as well as enable strategic sourcing via reverse auctions in which suppliers bid down prices at which they are willing to sell their goods and services to businesses.

Coupa’s Transactional Engine 
 The core of our platform is our transactional engine, which is comprised of the following modules:
  
• | Procurement. Our procurement module enables customers to strategically establish spend policies and approval rules to govern company spending. The application provides a consumerized e-commerce shopping experience so that employees can easily and quickly find the goods and services they need to do their jobs. Our procurement module streamlines purchasing requisition and purchase order processes, allowing businesses to track and manage purchases in real time, thus reducing time and cost. Upon approval of an employee request, purchase orders are automatically sent to suppliers for fulfillment and invoicing. Benchmark data allows customers to spot process inefficiencies, while configuration ease enables businesses to effortlessly adjust business processes to meet continually changing business requirements. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Invoicing. Our invoicing module enables customers to improve cash management through the effective management of supplier invoices via embedded dashboards and work queues that prioritize invoices with early payment discount opportunities. Customers may quickly configure invoice approval and matching rules so invoices can be routed without accounts payable team member effort and cost. Easy, no-cost means for suppliers to create electronic invoices that comply with government regulations allow businesses to eliminate paper and further reduce their invoice processing costs, all while reducing invoice payment fraud risk. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expense Management. Our expense management module enables customers to gain control of the expenses incurred by employees. Innovative mobile capabilities such as GPS and geo-location make it easy for travelers to create expense reports on-the-go so businesses gain real-time expense visibility. Frugal meter capabilities automatically assess the appropriateness of employee charges based on the customer’s configured business processes. Seamless connectivity to credit card providers feed charges into our expense management module for added visibility and reporting ease. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Supporting Modules 
 Our platform offers the following supporting modules that help companies further manage their spend:
 Strategic Sourcing.  Our strategic sourcing module enables customers to find the best suppliers for the goods or services they need to run their businesses. It also offers advanced capabilities for the sourcing of complex sourcing categories such as direct raw materials and logistics. Customers easily create sourcing events containing the specifics of their business needs and invite suppliers to participate. Suppliers are able to review and bid effortlessly and without any fees to participate. Collaboration capabilities enable employees to review bids and provide feedback that is automatically compiled and scored. For the sourcing of complex categories, Coupa applies advanced mathematical optimization techniques, allowing customers to analyze price and non-price elements to find the combination of suppliers and goods and services that meet the constraints they specify.
 Inventory.  Our inventory module enables customers to manage spending by effectively managing physical goods and virtual licenses. Employees searching for goods see inventory on hand balances in the search results, which eliminates redundant spending. Embedded dashboards facilitate the move of inventory from warehouse to warehouse and predict item shortages so inventory managers can easily manage goods and licenses. The application automates fulfillment and keeps inventory in sync through regular cycle counts, discrepancy reports, and asset tags.
 Contracts.  Our contracts module enables customers to operationalize contracts and make them easily available for purchasing by employees across the organization. Contract compliance increases savings as employees make purchases using negotiated rates. Real-time contract enforcement and spend visibility is provided through embedded dashboards at both the contract and summary level. Full text search capabilities and automatic alerts remind employees to review contracts prior to expiration or auto-renewal dates.
 Supplier Management.  Our supplier management module enables customers to collect supplier information required to manage and pay their suppliers and also provides data about potential risks associated with certain suppliers. Customers can quickly create data collection web forms using a drag and drop interface. Web forms may

be tailored for country specific rules or supplier types. To make data collection easy, web forms are embedded as part of the natural business processes for procurement and invoicing. Real-time dashboards and reports show supplier data freshness and upcoming expirations. This module also enables information regarding supplier risk by leveraging the collective data of Coupa customers, credit ratings and other searches of publicly available databases. 
 Spend Analysis.  Our spend analysis module provides managers a large set of built-in reports and dashboards that allow users to see spending activity, find bottlenecks in workflows, analyze granular data by commodity, supplier, location and cost center, and drill-down into the spend transactions. Customers can also leverage our artificial intelligence capabilities to automate complex business spend data classification. We have created more than one hundred out-of-the-box reports covering some of the most important business metrics, such as unified spend for purchase orders, invoices or expense reports, spend trends over time, spend by commodity, supplier and contract; however, users can also create new metrics, reports and dashboards with our intuitive user interface, as well as include external data like corporate and travel expenses or integrate with third-party systems, to get a holistic view of their spend patterns.
Coupa Open Business Network
 Our Coupa Open Business Network instantly connects businesses and suppliers providing businesses with a platform that is accessible to suppliers of all sizes—even those typically ignored by fee-based closed networks—to drive success. Suppliers have a variety of options to connect with businesses including:

• | Coupa Supplier Portal. This portal is a tool for suppliers to easily do business with our customers. The Supplier Portal lets suppliers manage content and settings on a customer-by-customer basis, including managing company information, setting up purchase order transmission preferences, creating and managing online catalogs, managing procurement orders and invoices across multiple customers and gaining visibility to the status of invoices. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Coupa Supplier Actionable Notifications. These notifications enable suppliers to receive HTML purchaser orders and convert these purchase orders into invoices right from the procurement order e-mail, which represents the easiest way to submit electronic invoices through our platform. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct Connection via cXML and EDI. Our platform supports various communication formats such as cXML or EDI for suppliers that want to automate their invoicing through a tighter integration with our platform. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Direct E-mail. Suppliers can choose to send PDF invoices simply through e-mail. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By using our Coupa Open Business Network, companies can become compliant with government mandates, increase profitability and reduce costs by driving electronic transactions from purchase order through e-invoice and payment visibility. Our Coupa Open Business Network user interface is easy to navigate and requires little to no training for suppliers to instantly manage transactions. Businesses are able to interact with thousands of suppliers already using our Supplier Portal, onboard new suppliers in minutes, integrate directly or simply use our smart e-mail tools. Businesses can also use the Coupa Open Business Network to layer on top of their existing technology, including third-party systems such as Oracle iProcurement, SAP SRM and others. Suppliers of all sizes benefit, as they are able to join the networked economy without changing their technology or spending money on transaction fees.
 Coupa Advantage
 Our Coupa Advantage program offers customers the opportunity to leverage pre-negotiated discounts from select suppliers in several business categories such as office supplies, branded promotional products, background checks, employee perquisites and more. The program leverages the collective buying power of Coupa customers to offer potential savings opportunities.

Coupa Community Intelligence
 Our Community Intelligence capability, which extends across our BSM platform, provides information to Coupa customers by applying intelligent frameworks to the structured, normalized data collected from the business spend transactions that have occurred on the Coupa platform. Participating customers are able to contribute to and benefit from Community Intelligence, with use cases extending from supplier insights which helps companies evaluate the risk levels of suppliers, to operational insights which helps businesses measure their own performance on key operational metrics against other Coupa customers.

Partnerships and Strategic Relationships 
 As a core part of our strategy, we have developed an ecosystem of partners to extend our sales capabilities and coverage, to broaden and complement our application offerings and to provide a broad array of services that lie outside of our primary areas of focus. 
 Our partnerships increase our ability to grow and scale quickly and efficiently and allow us to maintain greater focus on executing against our strategy. 
  
• | Advisory and Referral Partners. Our Advisory and Referral partners provide global, national and regional expertise in business spend management, procurement and expense management. They help organizations through operational transformation by leveraging process, best practices and new technology. These partners may refer customer prospects to us and assist us in selling to them.

We work closely with global leaders such as KPMG, Deloitte, Accenture, PwC and Wipro, as well as with boutique service providers that focus primarily on delivering implementation services for our applications, like The Hackett Group, Armanino, CrossCountry Consulting, Xoomworks and The Shelby Group. Our strategy is to enable the majority of our projects to be led by implementation partners with additional specialized support from us. Our implementation partners are highly skilled and trained by our team. When working with implementation partners, we are typically in a “co-sell” arrangement where we will sell our subscription directly to the customer and our partner will sell its implementation services directly to the customer.

Research and Development 
 Our ability to compete depends in large part on our continuous commitment to research and development and our ability to rapidly introduce new applications, technologies, features and functionality. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, testing and certification of our applications. We focus our efforts on developing new applications and core technologies and further enhancing the usability, functionality, reliability, performance and flexibility of existing applications.
 Research and development expenses were $44.5 million, $30.3 million and $22.8 million for the fiscal years ended January 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Competition 
 We believe the overall market for BSM software is highly competitive, marked by rapid consolidation, fragmented and rapidly evolving due to technological innovations. We have been recognized, however, as a technology and market leader. 
 Our competitors fall into the following categories: 
  
• | Large enterprise software vendors such as Oracle Corporation and SAP AG that predominantly focus on database and ERP software solutions. SAP acquired both Ariba, Inc. and Concur Technologies, Inc. in 2012 and 2014, respectively, to form the core of their cloud offerings that compete with us.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Niche software vendors that either address only a portion of the capabilities we provide or predominantly focus on narrow industry verticals.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market include the following: 
  
• | focus on customer success;
--+---------------------------


• | ability to deliver measurable value and savings;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | ability to offer a comprehensive BSM platform;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | ease of use;
--+-------------


• | widespread adoption by users;
--+------------------------------


• | time to deployment;
--+--------------------


• | cloud-based architecture;
--+--------------------------


• | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


• | configurability and agility;
--+-----------------------------


• | rich reporting capabilities;
--+-----------------------------


• | product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | independence; and
--+------------------


• | adoption by suppliers.
--+-----------------------

 We believe that we compare favorably on the basis of these factors. However, many of our competitors have greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition and larger sales and marketing budgets; therefore, we may not compare favorably with respect to some or all of the factors above.

Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademarks, as well as contractual protections, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. While we have obtained or applied for patent protection for some of our intellectual property, we do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one or more of our patents. We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and control access to software, documentation and other proprietary information. 
 We pursue the registration of domain names, trademarks and service marks in the United States and in various jurisdictions outside the United States. We also actively seek patent protection covering inventions originating from our company. 
 We control access to and use of our proprietary technology and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, customers, and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international intellectual property laws. Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of our software, documentation and other proprietary information. 
 Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or obtain and use our technology to develop applications with the same functionality as our applications. Policing unauthorized use of our technology and intellectual property rights is difficult. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective protection of our technology and intellectual property rights may not be available to us in every country in which our software or services are available. 
 We and others in our industry have been, and we expect that we will continue to be, subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of applications in different industry segments overlaps. Moreover, many of our competitors and other industry participants have been issued patents and/or have filed patent applications, and have asserted claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. From time to time, third parties, including certain of these companies, have asserted patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret and other intellectual property rights within the industry. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us at any time.
