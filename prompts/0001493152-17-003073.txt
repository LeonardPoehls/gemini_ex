ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS. 
 
This Report contains summaries of the material terms of various agreements executed in connection with the transactions described herein. The summaries of these agreements are subject to, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to, these agreements, all of which are incorporated herein by reference.
 
History and Organization
 
Solis Tek Inc. (the “Company”) was originally incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on March 2, 2007 as Cinjet, Inc. (“Cinjet”). Effective September 1, 2015, Cinjet changed its corporate name to Solis Tek Inc. On June 23, 2015, the Company entered into an Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization (the “Agreement”) with Solis Tek Inc., a California corporation (“STI”), and CJA Acquisition Corp., a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), providing for the merger of Merger Sub with and into STI (the “Merger”), with STI surviving the Merger as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The Merger Agreement was approved by the Company’s Board of Directors and the sole Director of the Company, effective June 23, 2015. The Merger closed on June 23, 2015.
 
At the effective time of the Merger, each share of STI common stock issued and outstanding was converted automatically into the right to receive .166 shares of the common stock of the Company, with an aggregate of 26,187,000 shares of the Company’s common stock issued to the former shareholders of STI.
 
Upon the closing of the Merger, STI paid a total of $22,500 to four shareholders of the Company for the cancellation of a total of 61,297,002 shares of the Company’s common stock. Also at the closing of the Merger, STI paid $198,100 to the Company to settle and pay liabilities of $405,932, which represented all of the then current liabilities of the Company. After the closing, a total of 29,551,998 shares of the Company were outstanding.
 
Upon completion of the Merger, the former stockholders of STI owned approximately 89% of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock and the holders of the outstanding shares of the Company’s common stock prior to the Merger owned the balance. As the former owners and management of STI have voting and operating control of the Company after the Merger, the transaction has been accounted for as a recapitalization with the STI deemed the acquiring companies for accounting purposes, and the Company deemed the legal acquirer. Due to the change in control, the consolidated financial statements reflect the historical results of STI prior to the Merger, and that of the combined company following the Merger. Common stock and the corresponding capital amounts of the Company pre-Merger have been retroactively restated as capital stock shares reflecting the exchange ratio in the Merger. No step-up in basis or intangible assets or goodwill will be recorded in this transaction and the cash paid by the Company of $248,980 (including $28,380 of transaction costs) has been reflected as a cost of the transaction.
 
Overview of Business
 
Solis Tek Inc. is focused on the research, design, development and manufacturing of advanced, energy efficient indoor horticulture lighting and ancillary equipment. Our vision is to apply the latest advances in high efficiency lighting and controls technology as well as effective manufacturing techniques to deliver highly differentiated products with clear benefits at competitive prices to the greenhouse and indoor horticulture markets.
 
Our subsidiary, Solis Tek Inc., a California corporation, was formed in June of 2010. Its operations consists of designing, developing and sourcing of a line of Solis Tek Digital Ballasts intended for use in high intensity lighting systems used for horticulture. An electrical ballast is a device intended to limit the amount of current in an electric circuit. A familiar and widely used example is the inductive ballast used in fluorescent lamps, to limit the current through the tube, which would otherwise rise to destructive levels due to the tube’s negative resistance characteristic. Since the commencement of operations, our product line has evolved from digital ballasts to a line of lighting products including a line of specialty ballasts ranging from 400 watts to 1,000 watts with various features, a line of specialty metal halide digital lamps (our “Lamp Products”), a line of reflectors, high intensity lighting accessories and a new line of light emitting diode (“LED”) lighting technologies.

We sell our products primarily to retailers in the United States and international markets who specialize in hydroponic horticulture. Currently we have approximately 500 retailers that sell our products. We have five full time sales employees and four wholesale distributors who cover US, Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom.
 
The Company believes that almost all of the end users that use this type of products have used the equipment for the growing of cannabis. Currently, there are 28 states and the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. In addition, the States of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Massachusetts, Nevada and the District of Columbia have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis. Many other States are considering legislation to similar effect. As of July 30, 2015, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of State law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of our end user customers to continue to grow cannabis. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus directly and adversely affect revenues and profits.
 
However, the Company’s products can be, and are used for, the hydroponic and indoor growing of other horticultural products, such as hothouse vegetables, decorative plant nurseries, indoor aquariums, and industrial painting facilities. The Company intends to continue to expand and improve its products for use in as many applications as possible and to market its products to the entire indoor horticultural industry as well as other industrial applications that require artificial lighting.
 
In 2014, Solis Tek East, Corporation (“STE”) was incorporated in the State of New Jersey as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. STE was formed for the purpose of commencing its operations and servicing and supplying the Eastern part of North America with our products. In September 2014, STE leased a 10,160 square foot office and warehouse facility in South Hackensack, New Jersey. Also, in 2014, GrowPro Solutions, Inc. (“GrowPro”) was incorporated in the State of California as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. GrowPro was formed to develop, and sell plant nutrients to help expand the market reach and maximize the revenue potential of the Company. GrowPro is sharing facility with STI in Carson, CA.
 
Our ballast products are manufactured in China by a manufacturer that is partially owned by a related party to Alan Lien, our President. Our Lamp Products are manufactured to our specifications and supplied by an unrelated manufacturer in China. Our lamp ancillary products and equipment are also manufactured, to our designs, in China.
 
License Agreement
 
In May of 2015, we entered into an Amended and Restated License Agreement with GAS Technologies, Incorporated (“GAS”) of Kapolei Hawaii, pursuant to which we agreed to pay GAS, a minimum royalty of $100,000 per year plus7% of sales of products licensed by GAS to us over a fixed amount of licensed products sale per calendar year. In 2016 and 2015, the Company owed an additional $41,490 and $43,775, respectively under the amended agreement. The License grants to us an exclusive world-wide license to produce, manufacture, have manufactured, use, import, sell, market, distribute and sell the products and systems (the “Licensed Products”) and any further products and systems that may be developed by the Licensor for use in the horticulture and hydroponic industries (the “Industries”). Such products include our “Single Ended: and “Double Ended” metal halide digital lamps and a new line of light emitting diode (“LED”) lighting technologies and products.
The Cannabis Industry and Government Regulation
 
Currently, there are twenty-eight States plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. In addition, the States of Colorado, Washington, Alaska, Oregon, California, Massachusetts, Nevada as well as the District of Columbia, have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis. The State laws are in conflict with the Federal Controlled Substances Act, which makes marijuana use and possession illegal on a national level. The Trump Administration has effectively stated that it is not an efficient use of resources to direct law federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by State-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical marijuana and we do not have a clear reading from possible changes in the Trump Administration.. Additionally, any new administration that follows could change this policy and decide to enforce the federal laws strongly. Any such change in the federal government’s enforcement of current federal laws could cause significant financial damage to us and our shareholders.

Indoor Lighting Industry
 
Light and plant growth
 
Light is essential for plant growth. Natural sunlight is the cheapest source available, but for horticulture it is not always attainable in sufficient quantities. Therefore, the uses of artificial or alternative light sources have become very common in order to increase production and quality predominantly in indoor or greenhouse environments. Plants have a completely different sensitivity to light spectrum than humans. Every plant has their own sensitivity for colors and intensity of light. Using these alternate light sources for plants, effective light recipes are essential to obtain the optimal results in plant production.
 
Grow lights
 
A grow light or plant light is an artificial light source, generally an electric light, designed to stimulate plant growth by emitting an electromagnetic spectrum appropriate for photosynthesis. Grow lights are used in applications where there is either no naturally occurring light, or where supplemental light is required. For example, in the winter months when the available hours of daylight may be insufficient for the desired plant growth, lights are used to extend the time the plants receive light.
 
Grow lights either attempt to provide a light spectrum similar to that of the sun, or to provide a spectrum that is more tailored to the needs of the plants being cultivated. Outdoor conditions are mimicked with varying color, temperatures and spectral outputs from the grow light, as well as varying the lumen output (intensity) and PAR output of the lamps. Depending on the type of plant being cultivated, the stage of cultivation (e.g., the germination/vegetative phase or the flowering/fruiting phase), and the photoperiod required by the plants, specific ranges of spectrum, luminous efficacy and color temperature are desirable for use with specific plants and time periods.
 
Specially designed artificial light sources can improve diverse growth parameters. These all depends on several factors, like crop, environmental circumstances, light recipe and many more. The following is a list of benefits that can be achieved with specially designed artificial lighting:
 

● | Increased production and yield 
--+-------------------------------------------------
● | Increased aromatic flavor and higher potency 
● | Shortening of the total growth cycle 
● | Better plant uniformity 
● | Better space utility 
● | Improved plant quality 
● | Energy savings 
● | Better germination rate 
● | Higher multiplication factor 
● | Higher survival rate in rooting 
● | Improved/controlled stretching process 
● | Accelerated hardening phase 

Hydroponics
 
The great majority of our customers are retailers that specialize in Hydroponics and sell our products to Hydroponic enclosed farm operators. Hydroponics is a method of growing plants in mineral nutrient solutions, in water, without soil. Terrestrial plants may be grown with their roots in the mineral nutrient solution only or in an inert medium, such as polite, gravel, expanded clay pebbles or coconut husks.

Some of the reasons why hydroponics is being adapted around the world for plant production are the following:
 

● | No soil is needed for hydroponics. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The water stays in the system and can be reused - thus, a lower water requirement. 
● | It is possible to control the nutrition levels in their entirety; thus, lower nutrition requirements. 
● | No nutrition pollution is released into the environment because of the controlled system. 
● | Stable and high yields. 
● | Pests and diseases are easier to get rid of than in soil because of the container’s mobility. 
● | Ease of harvesting. 
● | No pesticide damage. 

Our Business Strategy 
 
Due to the expected increase in the number of States where the use of cannabis, both for medical and recreational use is being legalized, the Company intends to take advantage of what we believe is our premium brand image within the cannabis farming industry. We believe that as participation in the cannabis farming industry grows, in order to supply increasing demand caused by legalization, our Solis Tek brand equipment will be sought out by existing and new cannabis farms and businesses. Further, we intend to broaden our marketing efforts to the non-cannabis lighting market, which includes, among others, hothouse vegetables, decorative plant nurseries, indoor aquariums, and industrial painting facilities. Our strategy is to maintain and increase our market share by expanding our marketing efforts and by introducing new and improved lighting technology to help the industry become more efficient. In addition, the Company has started market and sell a new line of plant nutrients and fertilizers through its wholly owned subsidiary GrowPro Solutions, Inc. to help expand the market reach and maximize the revenue potential of the Company.
Products
 
Ballasts
 
Ballasts provide the proper starting voltage, operating voltage and current to the lamp to initiate and sustain its arc. High Intensity Discharge (HID) lamps have negative resistance, which causes them to draw an increasing amount of current; hence, they require a current-limiting device. The ballast provides the following functions:
 
It provides starting voltage and, in some cases, ignition pulses. All ballasts must provide some specific minimum voltage to ignite the lamp. In the case of pulse start lamps, an additional high voltage pulse is needed to ionize the gases within the lamp. These pulses are superimposed near the peak starting voltage waveform; It regulates the lamp’s current and power. The ballast limits the current through the lamp once it has started. The ballast’s current is set to a level that delivers the proper power to the lamp. In addition, the ballast regulates the lamp’s current through the range of typical line voltage variations, thereby keeping the lamp’s power fairly stable to maximize the lamp’s life and performance and; It provides appropriate sustaining voltage and current wave shape to achieve the lamp’s rated life. The ballast provides sufficient voltage to sustain the lamp as it ages.
 
Solis Tek Digital Ballasts were designed to with “Ignition Control” sequential lamp ignition, and “SenseSmart”, self- diagnostic safety systems. Solis Tek Digital Ballasts are software based, that makes our ballasts more versatile and enables us to incorporate special features such as sequential ballast ignition technology (“Ignition Control”) and SenseSmart technologies that ignites metal halide lamps one at a time based on load stability. Ignition Control is a main feature of our ballasts that comes as a standard feature in all of our ballasts. Ignition Control assures that no matter how many lamps are contained in a lighting array attached to one power source, only one lamp will turn on at a predetermined time. This technology (not a randomized ignition startup) detects the voltage and amperage frequencies of the electrical circuit and ignites an array of metal halide or sodium lamps when the load for each lamp is most stable. We believe that SolisTek digital ballasts are the only ballasts capable of this technology. The use of our technology prevents surges and spikes in electrical environment in which an array of ballasts operate and also prevents the overloading of circuit breakers.
 
Our SenseSmart self-diagnosing system feature, enables our ballasts to internally safety check for over/under voltage, overheating, open circuits, short circuits and more. SmartSense will recognize an unsafe condition and take pre-determined actions to alleviate the safety issue.

We offer a line of remote ballasts that include: 400W 120/240V, 600W 120/240V, 1000W 120/240V, 1000W 120/240V with remote control and timer, 1000W 240V only, and 1000W 277V.
 
A1 1000W Complete Fixture
 
Beginning in 2015, we introduced a new A1 complete fixture equipped with ballast, reflector, and double ended lamp.
 
Digital Lamps
 
Metal halide lamps are a type of HID (High Intensity Discharge) lamp; mercury vapor and high-pressure sodium lamps are also HID lamps. Light is generated by creating an arc between the two electrodes located inside the inner arc tube. The inner arc tube is typically made of quartz, and this is a very harsh environment, with high temperatures approaching 1000°C and pressures of 3 or 4 atmospheres. To start a metal halide lamp, a high starting voltage is applied to the lamp’s electrodes to ionize the gas before current can flow and start the lamp.
 
Solis Tek Digital Lamps are designed to be specifically tuned and matched with Solis Tek digital ballasts. Our lamps feature color enhanced full balanced spectrums, prolonged lamp life , less depreciation of lumen output over time, and precise gas combinations for increased blues, reds, and ultra violet output. Our Lamps emit a full spectrum of light tuned specifically for particular types of plants. As well, our lamps provide ample Ultra Violet light that plants thrive upon. We have designed our lamps using special low iron glass envelopes so as to prevent the blockage of the full spectrum of light that our lamps are designed to provide. Using Solis Tek lamps, growers can expect superior photo-chemical reactions, proper UV balance, advanced HID lamp designed especially for plant growth, plant quality, and plant yield.
 
We offer a select variety of spectrums in both High Pressure Sodium (HPS), Metal Halides (MH), and Ceramic Metal Halides (CMH).
 
LED Technology
 
LED (light emitting diode) lighting supports sustainable design in several ways. It uses less energy than most other types of lamps, produces less heat, lasts longer (which means less frequent replacement and therefore reduced waste), is mercury-free, and is housed in special semi-conductor “chips” designed for easier configuration, disassembly, and recycling.
 
In our ongoing research and development program, we have designed and developed our next generation of high intensity lighting. Our LED technology, unlike other LED lighting sources, uses an advanced UV (Ultra Violet) diode phosphor combination to make our high intensity LED based lighting systems. Our LED systems will be available in the same light spectrums as our current HID lamps. Our design will emit lighting equivalent to the high pressure sodium spectrum and ultra-violet spectrums and eliminate the inadequacies of current LED offerings to the horticultural industry i.e.: a) low intensity; b) lack of proper spectrum for particular plants; and c) longevity. Our LED “chips” will provide, from one LED, a full spectrum of light that mimics sunlight, as compared to other LED manufacturers of LEDs who provide arrays of several color specific LEDs in an attempt to cover the full light spectrum.
 
LED lighting produces significantly less heat than conventional HID and HPS lamps, so growers can control their greenhouse climate more accurately. Less heat also means more effective use of light, for example by increasing light levels, extending lighting periods, or by using LED light in greenhouses on warmer days without having to ventilate. Less heat also means you can place the light source closer to plants, reducing light loss.

Solis Tek Reflectors 
 
Our line of “Reflectors” is designed for use with our digital ballasts and lamps. However, they have standard sockets so that lamps and ballasts manufactured by others may also be used. Each Reflector features air cooling, heavily tinned wiring, low iron glass for less filtering of light, and utilize highly reflective aluminum to reflect light in the desired direction.
 
We offer five different variations and sizes of Reflectors.
 
Plant Nutrients and Fertilizers
 
GrowPro has developed “Terpenez” which is a proprietary product formulated from all organic botanical extracts and is designed to assist plants with processes associated with oil and resin production. Terpenez is all natural and has organic inputs aimed at enhancing the aromatic experience of cultivation. GrowPro commenced test marketing Terpenez in late 2016.
Marketing
 
We currently market our products directly and through distributors, to hydroponic retailers through direct contacts, on-line email advertising, social media, trade magazine advertising, trade show promotions, and cross-promotional offerings. Our officers, along with five sales representatives and four distributors, are engaged in marketing our products. In addition, we work with a select few wholesale distributors who cover parts of the United States, Canada, Spain and the United Kingdom. Approximately 1% and 3% of our revenues were derived from non-U.S. sources in 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Manufacturing and Supply
 
All of our current products are manufactured to our specifications in China. We currently rely upon one manufacturer and supplier of our ballast products. The family of our President’s spouse owns a thirty per cent (30%) interest in the manufacturer with the balance of ownership owned by non-related parties. We believe that the prices charged by this supplier is on terms no more favorable than terms generally available to terms that we may pay to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances. All of our other products, including our lamps, are manufactured and supplied by unaffiliated third-party suppliers.
 
Our reliance upon manufacturers and suppliers located in China, subjects us to various political, economic, and other risks and uncertainties inherent in importing products from this country, including among other risks, export/import duties, quotas and embargoes; domestic and international customs and tariffs; changing taxation policies; foreign exchange restrictions; and political conditions and governmental regulations. There can be no assurance that if there were an interruption of our supply lines from China, that we would be able to find replacement suppliers of our products domestically, or from other countries, and even if we found replacement suppliers, that we would be able to obtain the products at the quality and prices we currently pay.
 
Technology and Development
 
We have entered into an agreement with G.A.S. Technologies Inc. (“GAS”) pursuant to which GAS will provide design, supply and engineering services to the Company as well as exclusively license to the Company certain products for the horticultural industry, including all digital lighting products (the “GAS Agreement”) developed by GAS. The GAS Agreement gives the Company the exclusive right to manufacture, market and distribute all of the licensed technology. Among the technologies licensed are GAS’s designs for some of the Company’s LED products.
 
The GAS Agreement provides that the Company will pay to Licensor a minimum royalty at the rate of $100,000 per year (the “Minimum Annual Royalty”), commencing on the date of this Agreement, plus seven per cent (7%) of all Net Sales in excess of a fixed amount per calendar year (the “Additional Royalty”).
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own number of trademarks and rely on a combination of copyright and trade secrets as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We rely on copyright laws to protect copy on our web site, www.solis-tek.com, and all marketing materials.
 
From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our brand and reputation, or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming.

Government Regulation
 
Almost all of end users of our products have used our products for the growing of cannabis. Currently, there are twenty-eight States plus the District of Columbia that have laws and/or regulation that recognize in one form or another legitimate medical uses for cannabis and consumer use of cannabis in connection with medical treatment. In addition, the States of Colorado, Washington, California, Massachusetts, Alaska, Nevada, and Oregon, as well as the District of Columbia, have recently approved the recreational use of cannabis. Many other States are considering legislation to similar effect. As of June 1, 2015, the policy and regulations of the Federal government and its agencies is that cannabis has no medical benefit and a range of activities including cultivation and use of cannabis for personal use is prohibited on the basis of federal law and may or may not be permitted on the basis of State law. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis on a regional or national basis may directly and adversely affect the willingness of our end user customers to continue to grow cannabis. Active enforcement of the current federal regulatory position on cannabis may thus directly and adversely affect revenues.
Competition
 
Our Lighting Products segment currently faces competition from traditional lighting fixture companies, lamp manufacturers and from non-traditional companies focused on LED lighting systems including fixtures and lamps. Lighting companies such as Acuity Brands, Inc., the Cooper Lighting division of Eaton Corporation plc, General Electric Company, Hubbell Incorporated, Philips, OSRAM, Gavita, Sunlight Supply and Hydrofarm are the main competitors in this market. Increasingly, however, other companies (i.e., start-ups) are beginning to emerge in the LED lighting markets in which we compete. We compete on the basis of product features, quality, product availability and price.
 
Our LED lighting products will compete against traditional lighting products using incandescent, fluorescent, halogen, ceramic metal halide or other lighting technology. Our LED lighting products compete against traditional lighting products based upon superior energy savings, extended life, improved lighting quality and lower total cost of ownership. Also, our LED lighting products have a reduced impact on the environment as compared to fluorescent and compact fluorescent technologies that contain mercury.
 
We will also compete with LED-based products from traditional and non-traditional lamp and fixture companies, some of which are customers for our LED chips and LED components. Our products compete on the basis of color quality and consistency, superior light output, reduced energy consumption, brand and lower total cost of ownership.
 
Patents, trademarks, franchises, concessions, royalty agreements 
 
We own number of trademarks and rely on a combination of copyright and trade secrets as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology and our brand. We will rely on copyright laws to protect copy on our web site, www.solis-tek.com, and all marketing materials.
 
From time to time, we may encounter disputes over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business, our brand and reputation, or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has 15 full-time employees, employed by us in various capacities, including two Executive Officers, five in sales, four administrative, three in the warehouse, and one in research and development. In addition, from time to time, we employ temporary personal to meet the business needs.
