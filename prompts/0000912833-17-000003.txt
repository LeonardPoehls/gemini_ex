ITEM 1—BUSINESS
General 
Each person has a unique connection to the water. At West Marine, our knowledge, enthusiasm and products prepare waterlife adventurers to foster that connection and explore their passions. With 254 stores located in 38 states, Puerto Rico and Canada, and two eCommerce websites reaching domestic, international and professional customers, West Marine is recognized as a leading waterlife outfitter for cruisers, sailors, anglers and paddlesports enthusiasts. Since first opening our doors in 1968, West Marine associates continue to share the same love for the water as our customers and provide helpful advice on the gear and gadgets they need to be safe and have fun. 
West Marine, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in September 1993 as the holding company for West Marine Products, Inc., which was incorporated in California in 1976. Unless the context otherwise requires, “West Marine,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to West Marine, Inc. and its subsidiaries. Our principal executive offices are located at 500 Westridge Drive, Watsonville, California 95076-4100, and our telephone number is (831) 728-2700. Our two distribution centers are located in Rock Hill, South Carolina and Hollister, California.
Business Strategies
West Marine is a leading omni-channel specialty retailer in our industry, serving people who enjoy recreating on or around the water. We offer a broad selection of core boating and water recreation products through physical stores and two eCommerce websites, primarily serving the needs of boat owners and professionals who provide services to them. 
Over the past few years, we have implemented three key strategies to broaden the scope and appeal of West Marine as a waterlife outfitter, while maintaining our position as a leading boat parts specialty retailer. To expand our brand position, we have been focusing our efforts and investments on our omni-channel business model to improve our operating margin, grow our customer base and increase revenues. Our strategic goals are reflected in our "15/50 plan". 
eCommerce
The first number in the 15/50 plan reflects our objective to grow our eCommerce business to 15% of total sales by the end of 2019. Over the past several years, we have invested in our retail and professional eCommerce websites, serving our retail and professional customers at westmarine.com and westmarinepro.com, respectively. In 2016, our eCommerce channel grew by 19.7% and represented 11.4% of our 2016 sales, furthering progress toward our 15% goal. We believe the enhancements we have made will continue to drive growth and strengthen our omni-channel shopping experience. Additionally, we have augmented the westmarine.com website with outlet store pages, which allows us to offer special promotional items to our customers, and we have improved functionality with features such as inventory on hand at specific stores and more efficient check out processes. 
Store Optimization
The second number in the 15/50 plan reflects our goal of deriving 50% of total sales from our optimized and revitalized stores, which we refer to as waterlife stores. We achieved this goal in 2016, which is earlier than we originally projected, and we expect to continue to increase the number of waterlife stores that provide an enhanced shopping experience for our customers, both in terms of store design and expanded product assortment. Our store optimization strategy has evolved over time from store consolidations, where we create fewer and better stores in our major markets, to include revitalizations of select stores. In connection with the store consolidation component of our store optimization strategy, during 2016, we opened five stores, while closing nine stores in those same markets. A store revitalization consists of light remodeling, space optimization, product assortment changes, new product category introduction and associate training. We also deploy more flexible fixtures that enable us to vary our seasonal product assortments in a more cost effective manner. These changes allow us to offer merchandise expansion products, appeal to a broader base of customers, and provide the space and flexibility to appropriately transition products as the seasons change. During 2016, we revitalized 18 stores in key markets and expect to revitalize up to 10 stores in 2017. For more information, see "Stores" below. 
We ended the year with an aggregate of 2.56 million total square feet of space for all stores, down from 2.61 million square feet at the end of 2015, largely the result of store optimization and closing under-performing stores.
Merchandise Expansion
Our eCommerce and store optimization strategies are supported by our merchandise expansion product categories. This strategy also welcomes a broader base of customers who are passionate about recreating on and around the water by providing a wider selection of products. We offer this expanded assortment in our waterlife stores and on our eCommerce website, and a selection of these products also are offered in revitalized stores. During 2016, sales of this group of products increased by 2.0%. In an effort to accelerate our merchandise expansion strategy, we are further increasing the balance of products in certain categories, 
 1

such as footwear, clothing and paddlesports, in our waterlife stores. Additionally, we are testing new product categories to better serve our customers and further position West Marine as the foremost authority for all waterlife needs and wants. 
Merchandising
Our merchandise mix over the last three years is reflected in the following table:

 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Core boating products (1) | 76.5 | % | | 77.1 | % | 81.3 | %
Merchandise expansion products (2) | 23.5 | % | | 22.9 | % | 18.7 | %
Total | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %


(1) | Core boating products are comprised of maintenance, electronics, sailboat hardware, anchors/docking/moorings, engine systems, safety, electrical, plumbing, boats/outboards, ventilation, deck hardware/fasteners, navigation, trailering, seating/boat covers and barbecues/appliances.


(2) | Merchandise expansion products are comprised of apparel, footwear, clothing accessories, fishing, watersports, paddlesports, coolers and waterlife lifestyle accessories.

We are committed to offering a broad assortment of merchandise that provides our customers what they want, when they want it. As we grow revenues through our merchandise expansion strategy, we expect that core boating product sales will continue to grow, but at a slower pace than merchandise expansion product sales. We believe that there is an opportunity to further drive sales of core products, particularly through our smaller traditional stores, and during 2017, we will continue to increase and improve product assortments to achieve this goal.
 Our merchandising department is responsible for vendor and product selections and works closely with our planning and replenishment department, which is responsible for purchasing and managing inventory levels in our distribution centers and in our stores. We also offer our customers the ability to special order products that we do not stock in our stores or at our distribution centers.
Generally, we build inventory levels during the first quarter of each year in preparation of the key boating season and we may also take advantage of key product offerings or opportunistic purchases from our vendors during the fourth quarter of the prior year. We purchased merchandise from more than 800 vendors during 2016, and no single vendor accounted for more than 9% of our merchandise purchases. In 2016, our 20 largest vendors accounted for approximately 43% of our merchandise purchases. Generally, we purchase merchandise from our vendors on an order-by-order basis.
Private brand merchandise, which typically has higher gross margins than other branded products, made up about 23% of our sales in 2016. We added resources to our private brand strategy in 2016 and, in 2017, we are expanding this investment. In addition, we continue to identify key vendor partnerships to increase gross margins over time and provide exciting and differentiating products to our customers. Private brand products, which we sell under the “West Marine,” “Black Tip,” “Third Reef,” “Pure Oceans,” "Lifesling," and “Seafit” brand names, usually are manufactured in Asia, the United States and Europe. 
Omni-channel Shopping Experience
Our strategy is to offer a seamless omni-channel shopping experience to retail and professional customers through our stores, eCommerce websites, catalog and call center operations. Although we sell through all of these channels, our primary sales channel remains our stores. 
Stores
The following table shows the number of stores opened and closed in each of our last three fiscal years:

 | Fiscal 2016 | | Fiscal 2015 | | Fiscal 2014
 | Waterlife (1) | | Traditional (2) | | Total | Waterlife (1) | | Traditional (2) | | Total | Waterlife (1) | | Traditional (2) | | Total
Beginning stores | 64 | | | 199 | | 263 | | | 60 | | 219 | | | 279 | | 48 | | 239 | | 287 | 
New stores | 5 | | | — | | 5 | | | 3 | | — | | | 3 | | 7 | | — | | 7 |

(1) | Waterlife stores typically are larger than 10,000 sq. ft. and include flagship stores that range from 18,000 sq. ft. to 50,000 sq. ft.


(2) | West Marine Traditional stores are less than 10,000 sq. ft.

At the end of 2016, we had 254 stores, compared to 263 stores at the end of 2015. Store count declined by 3.4% year-over-year and selling square footage decreased by 2.0%. In 2017, we expect to open up to six stores and plan to close approximately 15 stores. The store closures include store optimization efforts with the intent of improving operating margin and revenue. 
In addition, we previously announced our intention to wind down the operations of our Canadian retail stores to focus our financial and management resources on our U.S. growth initiatives. As a result, in 2015, we closed eight of our Canadian stores and will be closing the remaining two stores by June 2017.
Our waterlife stores offer an expansive array of merchandise, an enhanced customer experience, a more appealing selling environment, and displays designed to help customers make informed product selections. These stores not only offer an extensive assortment of core boating hardware and supplies, but also present a broader selection of waterlife products. Because these stores are larger, they provide more flexibility to accommodate seasonal product changes and the ability to welcome a broader group of customers who enjoy recreating on or around the water. At our waterlife stores, we have added in-store specialists for key categories such as apparel, paddlesports, fishing and electronics. These associates enhance our ability to understand and meet our customers' needs.
Our smaller, traditional stores focus on carrying core boating products and support our omni-channel strategy by directing our customers to shop through our other channels, such as our eCommerce website, to access the broader and vast array of our merchandise expansion and waterlife products. Beginning in 2016, we tested increasing select lifestyle products relevant to the local market in some of our traditional stores. For example, in markets where our customers enjoy recreational fishing, we increased our offering of fishing-related products while continuing to provide ample selection and inventory of our core boating products. This early test has shown promising results and we expect to increase offerings of select merchandise expansion products in our traditional stores where appropriate. 
Our extensive store network gives us an advantage in serving all of our customers, including professional customers seeking convenience and a larger assortment of products than those carried by typical distributors. Our professional customers include businesses involved in boat sales, boat building, boat commissioning, boat repair, yacht chartering and marina operations. In addition, we sell to government and industrial customers. We believe that with continued professional customer focus and broad product selection and availability, we will continue to be recognized as one of the preferred distributors in the industry. 
Direct-to-Consumer
Our eCommerce websites at westmarine.com and westmarinepro.com and our call center comprise our direct-to-consumer sales channel. This channel complements our stores by building brand awareness, acting as an additional marketing vehicle, and providing our customers with the option of shopping from around the globe, 24 hours a day. We offer a return-to-store option for direct-to-consumer orders and an in-store delivery service for online orders. This "ship-to-store" model provides free delivery to a local store and our customers continue to embrace this service, especially for large bulky items and hazardous products, which provides us an advantage over pure-play ecommerce retailers. In 2016, we rolled out store inventory visibility on our websites giving our customers the ability to view availability of products in their local stores. 
Our westmarine.com website provides our retail customers access to a broad selection of approximately 130,000 products, unique product advisor tips and technical information, over 1,000 product videos and 50,000 total reviews. We also believe our website is a cost-effective means of testing market acceptance of new products and concepts. 
Our westmarinepro.com website provides our professional customers the same functionality as on our retail site, along with the ability to build requisition lists, look up invoices and view their discounted pricing. In 2017, we expect to complete site enhancements that will allow our professional customers to view online inventory availability at their local West Marine retail store.
Our eCommerce websites and call center also provide customers with access to knowledgeable technical advisors, "how to" instructional videos and enhanced product features to assist our customers in understanding the various uses and applications of the products we sell. Our call center operations allows our associates to process customer orders remotely or from our support center in Watsonville, California. Our call center provides enhanced customer service and supports sales generated through our eCommerce website, catalogs and stores. 
Customer Service
Since our founding, exceptional customer service has been the cornerstone at West Marine. Our focus on delivering an outstanding customer experience is accomplished through advanced product and technical training for our associates and then 
 3

empowering them to resolve customer issues at the local level. Through listening to our customers, we continually refine our business processes to meet their needs. 
Marketing
Our marketing objective is to deliver intelligent, consistent, actionable, relevant content and customer experiences across all touch points. Our approach includes a seamless omni-channel customer experience, personalization and customer retention strategies through a fully-integrated marketing program that includes direct mail, email, traditional and digital advertising, such as paid search and digital display ads, digital radio, social media and mobile technology. We position the West Marine brand to stand for a unique value proposition supported by extensive product offerings, friendly and knowledgeable customer service and shopping convenience, whether on-line or in a store. The goal of this work is to expand our customer base and drive business growth, sales and profit.
Our loyalty program, West Advantage Rewards, includes both free and paid memberships that allow our customers to earn points on qualifying purchases for future discounts, exclusive offers and invitations to unique shopping events designed to reward our customers for their support and loyalty. Through West Advantage Rewards, we have built an extensive and proprietary customer list which allows us to provide compelling and relevant offers to our customers. In addition, we acquire potential customer names from a variety of sources. Our customer list is continually updated with customer-provided information and new customer prospects, and to eliminate non-responders and accommodate requests from customers to opt out of our marketing programs.
West Marine is dedicated to promoting boating participation and to being a leader in sustainability within our industry. The West Marine BlueFuture® program is committed to supporting healthy and vibrant marine habitats and sustainable fisheries, as well as connecting future generations to the water through our youth recreation and education initiatives. We also support marine conservation in our daily operations by offering our customers environmentally preferable products, including our own "Pure Oceans” private label brand. These important initiatives are designed to encourage participation in boating and related water activities, promote environmental responsibility and improve West Marine’s brand perception and recognition. 
Logistics and Distribution
We operate two full-service distribution centers: a 472,000 square foot facility in Rock Hill, South Carolina; and a 240,000 square foot facility in Hollister, California. Generally, vendors ship products to our distribution centers where merchandise is received and prepared for shipment to stores or shipped directly to customers. Some vendors ship products directly from their facilities to our stores. We also fulfill orders for our professional customers with van delivery in certain markets, which serve as hubs or regional distribution centers. We believe our network of regional distribution facilities provides us with a competitive advantage to better serve our professional customers who value the service levels our hubs are able to provide to them. We use various third-party domestic and international transportation methods, such as ocean, air and ground, including company-owned vehicles. Our distribution centers utilize material handling equipment and voice-picking technologies, as well as radio frequency systems, to enable real-time management of inventory. 
Information Technology
We continue to invest in information technology to provide a platform for growth over the next several years to improve our customers' experience while shopping on the website. In recent years, we have also invested significant resources to strengthen our cybersecurity programs to protect customer, employee and corporate data and have implemented "tokenization" (i.e., a process by which sensitive credit card information at the point-of-sales terminal or online interface is replaced with randomly generated proxy numbers, or "tokens") and EMV compatibility (i.e., credit cards with chips or integrated circuits on the card). In 2017, we will continue investing in the growth of our eCommerce business, including improvements in our technology infrastructure. 
Competition
The market for marine supplies is highly competitive. Our stores compete with other specialty boating supply stores, and a variety of local and regional specialty stores, sporting goods stores and mass merchants. Many of these competitors have stores in markets where we operate. Also, we have a number of competitors engaged in the catalog, Internet and distribution of marine products. The principal factors of competition in our marketplace are selection, quality, availability, price, customer service, convenience and access to a wide variety of merchandise. Although we face tough competition in the marine market, we believe that we offer our customers a value proposition that is unmatched by our competitors through our 254 stores, our eCommerce websites, our regional distribution capabilities and our knowledgeable, skilled associates. 
Trademarks and Service Marks
We own the trademarks and service marks “West Marine®”, “West Marine ProTM ,” "Pure Oceans®,” among others. These marks and a number of others are registered (or in the process of being registered) with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and in certain foreign countries. Each federal registration is renewable indefinitely if the mark is still in use at the time of renewal.

Associates
As of February 16, 2017, we had 3,831 associates, of whom 1,850 were full-time and 1,981 were part-time or temporary. A significant number of temporary associates are hired during the summer peak selling season. For example, West Marine employed 4,579 associates on July 2, 2016.
International Sales
We promote and sell our marine products internationally, primarily through our direct-to-consumer sales channels. As previously disclosed, to ensure focus and to enable us to redirect resources for investment in our growth strategies, we closed eight of our Canadian stores during 2015, and we will close the remaining two stores by June 2017. For each of 2016, 2015 and 2014, revenues from outside of the United States represented less than 5% of our total net revenues.
