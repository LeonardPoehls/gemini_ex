Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company that discovers and develops novel vaccines and immunotherapies to address diseases with significant unmet needs. We use our proprietary discovery platform, ATLASTM, to rapidly design vaccines and immunotherapies that act, in part, through T cell (or cellular) immune responses, in contrast to approved vaccines and immunotherapies, which are designed to act primarily through B cell (or antibody) immune responses. We believe that by harnessing T cells we can develop first-in-class vaccines and immunotherapies to address diseases where T cells are central to the control of the disease.
We have one product candidate in active Phase 2 clinical development, GEN-003, an immunotherapy for the treatment of genital herpes. We also have a pre-clinical immuno-oncology program focused on personalized cancer vaccines ("GEN-009"). The GEN-009 program leverages ATLAS to identify patient neoantigens, or newly formed antigens unique to each patient, that are associated with that individual's tumor. We have other infectious disease programs, including GEN-004, a Phase 2-ready universal vaccine for the prevention of pneumococcal infections, and early stage programs focused on genital herpes prophylaxis, chlamydia, and malaria. 

ATLAS Platform
Vaccines represent a major healthcare success story, having eradicated or significantly reduced the global prevalence of many infectious diseases. To date, all approved vaccines have been developed primarily to elicit B cell responses. However, there remain many diseases for which no effective vaccines or only partially effective vaccines exist. A major reason, for infectious diseases, is that the organisms that cause these diseases largely evade the antibody immune response generated by B cells, which can generally only address pathogens in the bloodstream. Such organisms may reside in host cells or mucosal surfaces of the nose and throat. To address these pathogens, vaccines targeting responses from the T cell arm of the immune system may present the solution. In the case of cancers, the success of checkpoint blockade therapies, in which essentially the brakes are taken off of T cells, it is clear that the cellular arm of the immune system needs to be engaged.
We believe T cell target discovery has been particularly challenging for two reasons. First, the diversity of human T cell responses contrasts with the generally uniform B cell responses in humans. Second, the number of candidate targets for T cell responses can be exponentially greater than for B cell responses. These complexities represent fundamental barriers that traditional vaccine discovery tools, which rely either on computer predictions, or on empirically selecting the potential targets by iteratively testing them in animal models, have not been able to address.
We have designed the ATLAS platform to overcome these T cell target discovery challenges. We believe ATLAS represents the most comprehensive high-throughput system for T cell vaccine and immunotherapy discovery in the biopharmaceutical industry. ATLAS is designed to mimic the T cell arm of the human immune system in a laboratory setting. Using ATLAS, we are able to measure T cell responses to the entire set of protein targets for a specific pathogen or cancer from patients' blood samples, allowing us to identify vaccine and immunotherapy targets associated with protective T cell responses to disease. By comparing antigens identified in individuals who naturally control their disease with those who do not, we can select the antigens that may have the best likelihood of inducing protective T cell immune responses.
We believe we are a leader in the field of T cell vaccine and immunotherapy discovery and development. Our management and scientific teams possess considerable experience in vaccine, immunotherapy, cancer and anti-infective research, manufacturing, clinical development and regulatory matters.
GEN-003 — Phase 2 immunotherapy for genital herpes

Our lead program is GEN-003, a Phase 2 candidate therapeutic vaccine, or immunotherapy, that we are developing to treat genital herpes infections. Data from our double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating Phase 1/2a trial for GEN-003 represented the first reported instance of a therapeutic vaccine working against an infectious disease. Our second trial was a Phase 2 dose optimization study, which confirmed the Phase 1/2a trial results and tested six combinations of proteins and adjuvant to determine the optimal dose for future trials. Our third trial utilized the top two performing doses identified from our 
4

Phase 2 dose optimization study and is intended to test potential Phase 3 endpoints with an improved formulation of GEN-003, manufactured with commercially-scalable processes, which will be used in future Phase 3 trials. Key data from those trials is described below. 
Phase 1/2a Trial - Completed

Final analysis of the data from the Phase 1/2a trial showed that, for the best performing 30µg per protein dose group, there was a sustained reduction in the viral shedding rate. After completion of dosing for this group, the viral shedding rate was reduced by 52% versus baseline and, at six months after the final dose, the shedding rate remained at 40% below baseline. The reduction in the genital lesion rate after completion of the third dose was greatest for the 30µg dose group at 48%. After six months, the reduction from baseline in genital lesion rate for this dose group was 65% and, after 12 months, the genital lesion rate was 42% lower than baseline. GEN-003 was safe and well tolerated over the 12 months of this trial. 
Phase 2 Dose Optimization Trial - Completed
A 310-subject Phase 2 dose optimization trial was completed in March 2016. Subjects were randomized to one of six dosing groups of either 30μg or 60μg per protein paired with one of three adjuvant doses (25μg, 50μg, or 75μg). A seventh group received placebo. Subjects received three doses of GEN-003 or placebo at 21-day intervals. Baseline viral shedding and genital lesion rates were established for each subject in a 28-day observation period prior to the commencement of dosing by collecting 56 genital swab samples (two per day), which were analyzed for the presence of HSV-2 DNA, and by recording the days on which genital lesions were present. This 28-day observation period was repeated immediately after the completion of dosing, and at six and twelve months following dosing. No maintenance doses were given. After the 28-day observation period immediately after dosing, patients in the placebo arm were rolled over across the six active combinations of GEN-003 and Matrix-M2 under a separate protocol. The primary endpoint of the trial was the reduction in viral shedding rate versus baseline, a measure of anti-viral activity. A number of exploratory secondary endpoints were also studied, including the reduction in genital lesion rates, the percent of patients who were lesion recurrence free up to six and 12 months after dosing and time to first lesion recurrence after dosing. 
The two most promising doses from this dose optimization study were 60 µg per protein combined with either 50 or 75 µg of Matrix-M2 adjuvant ("60/50 Dose" and "60/75 Dose" respectively). In October 2015, we announced positive results from the planned interim analysis of data collected six months after dosing demonstrating that patients dosed with GEN-003 showed a statistically significant 47% (p=0.0004) and 58% (p < 0.0001) reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate for both the 60/50 Dose and 60/75 Dose, respectively. In a planned secondary analysis, the proportion of patients receiving any one of the six GEN-003 doses who were lesion-free at six months after dosing ranged from approximately 30% to 50%, similar to results reported in clinical trials with oral antiviral therapies. In addition, the time to first recurrence after completion of dosing showed a range of 152 days to greater than 180 days among dose groups. In a further secondary analysis measuring the impact on genital lesion rates, GEN-003 demonstrated sustained and statistically significant reductions from baseline in five of six dose groups ranging from 43% to 69%. 
In March 2016, we announced positive results from data collected twelve months after dosing. The 60/50 Dose and 60/75 Dose continued to demonstrate statistically significant reductions of 66% (p < 0.0001) and 55% (p=0.01), respectively, from baseline in the viral shedding rate. These two doses were advanced to our Phase 2b trial evaluating a new Phase 3-ready formulation of GEN-003. 

The Phase 2 dose optimization trial continued to show that GEN-003 is safe and well tolerated by patients, with no serious adverse events ("AEs") related to the vaccine. 
Phase 2b Trial - Ongoing
In December 2015, we initiated a Phase 2b trial which was our first study testing potential Phase 3 endpoints with a Phase 3-ready formulation of GEN-003, manufactured with commercially-scalable processes. The trial enrolled 131 subjects that were randomized to one of three dose groups - placebo, 60/50 Dose, and 60/75 Dose. All subjects received three injections at 21-day intervals. 
In September 2016, we announced positive viral shedding rate reductions from the ongoing Phase 2b study. The study achieved its primary endpoint, with GEN-003 demonstrating a statistically significant (versus placebo and baseline) 40% reduction in the viral shedding rate compared to baseline immediately after dosing in the 60/50 Dose group. This result was consistent with a statistically significant (versus placebo and baseline) viral shedding rate reduction of 41% at this same dose and time point in the previous Phase 2 dose optimization trial. In addition, the reactogenicity profile of this dose, an indication 
5

of the strength of the immune response to GEN-003, was consistent between the trials. This same dose in the prior Phase 2 trial subsequently demonstrated virologic and clinical efficacy durable through at least one year after dosing.
The 60/75 Dose group reduced the viral shedding rate by 27%, lower than that observed in the prior trial, and also showed a less acceptable reactogenicity profile than the prior trial. We believe that the increase in reactogenicity of this dose indicates an overstimulation of the T cell immune system leading to the reduced efficacy with this dose in this trial, as would be expected with the well-known bell-shaped T cell dose response curve. The likely driver of this effect is a more potent adjuvant formulation following customary manufacturing process changes to prepare for Phase 3 trials and commercialization. 
In January 2017, we announced positive clinical results from this ongoing trial. At six months after dosing, GEN-003 demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo across multiple clinical endpoints. The 60/50 Dose significantly reduced the rate of genital lesions during the six months following dosing compared to placebo (41% reduction versus placebo). The genital lesion rate is an important overall measure of disease that captures both the frequency and duration of recurrences, both of which are important to both patients and their caregivers. GEN-003 also consistently demonstrated significant benefits versus placebo across several other clinical endpoints including median duration of recurrences in days (2.8 compared to 4.2 for placebo), median duration of recurrences over six months (1.0 compared to 2.0 for placebo), and estimates of percent recurrence free after first and last dose (29% and 22%, respectively, for the 60/50 Dose versus 10% and 13%, respectively, for placebo). In addition, mean duration of recurrences in days (3.3 compared to 4.8 for placebo) and mean duration of recurrences over six months (2.1 compared to 2.7 for placebo) demonstrated significant benefit versus placebo.
The clinical efficacy data versus placebo at twelve-months post dosing is expected in the middle of 2017. The viral shedding rate reduction data at six-months post dosing is expected in the first half of 2017.
GEN-003 also continues to demonstrate a safety profile appropriate for its therapeutic setting in the judgment of the trial’s independent Drug Monitoring Committee. There was no grade 4 reactogenicity or related serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs were low and similarly distributed across active dose groups and placebo. 

We intend to conduct an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in early 2017. We also expect to commence Phase 3 trials in the fourth quarter of 2017. We plan to commence a clinical trial exploring the potential additive effects of GEN-003 on top of daily administration of valacyclovir in parallel with the Phase 3 program. We retain all rights to GEN-003 and our strategy is to execute a partnership to maximize the potential of GEN-003 and to help fund the costs of the GEN-003 Phase 3 program. 
If GEN-003 successfully completes clinical development and is approved, we believe it would represent an important new treatment option for patients with genital herpes.
Our Immuno-Oncology Program

Guided by our positive clinical results on GEN-003 and our belief in the ATLAS platform, we are focused on combining our antigen selection and vaccine development expertise with that of leading cancer innovators to unlock new targets in immuno-oncology. Our potential cancer vaccines will be designed to educate T cells to recognize and attack specific targets and thereby kill cancers. We are developing personalized cancer vaccines by leveraging ATLAS to identify patient neoantigens, or newly formed antigens unique to each patient, that are associated with that individual's tumor. We anticipate filing a personalized cancer vaccine Investigational New Drug ("IND") application with the FDA in 2017. We are also applying the results from ATLAS, and its utility a prognostic tool, to identify patients that could benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Our strategy in immuno-oncology combines our own internal development programs with a focus on partnering ATLAS for other immuno-oncology applications.
Refer to "Our Immuno-Oncology Program" below for additional details on this program, including our current collaborations. 
In November 2015, we also commenced a new program focused on Epstein-Barr Virus (“EBV”) ("GEN-007"). EBV infection has been linked to cancers with high unmet needs such as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. We believe the ATLAS platform is highly suited to the creation of a new immunotherapy for EBV given that T cell responses are understood to be crucial for protection against EBV. Furthermore, EBV is part of the herpesvirus family, in which we have deep experience through our development of GEN-003. We are currently conducting ATLAS screens for EBV and plan to select antigen candidates for further study in 2017.

Other infectious disease programs
Our other infectious disease programs include GEN-004, a potential universal Streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, vaccine to protect against a leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide and early stage programs focused on genital herpes prophylaxis, chlamydia, and malaria. In October 2015, we announced that top-line results from the Phase 2a clinical trial for GEN-004 showed consistent reductions versus placebo in the pre-specified endpoints of the rate and density of upper airway colonization in a human challenge model, but that neither of the endpoints achieved statistical significance. GEN-004 was safe and well tolerated by subjects. Although we did not achieve statistical significance in this study, the consistent apparent effect gives us confidence in the vaccine concept and in the potential for GEN-004. In November 2016, we paused activities on our other early stage programs focused on genital herpes prophylaxis, chlamydia, and malaria in order to focus all of our internal research and pre-clinical resources on our immuno-oncology investments. Progress made and data generated to date in these infectious disease clinical and research programs remains valuable to Genocea for the future.

GEN-003 Market Opportunity
Genital Herpes
We are developing our lead product candidate, GEN-003, to treat patients with genital herpes infections. GEN-003 consists of two protein antigens. The first antigen is ICP4.2, a large fragment of the protein ICP4 that we discovered in ATLAS screens to be a T cell antigen associated with protection from infection or with less severe infection. The second antigen is glycoprotein D2, or gD2, a B cell antigen that is the target of antibodies that provide anti-viral activity during the time in the life cycle of the herpes virus where the pathogen is susceptible to inactivation by antibodies. gD2 was also a target of T cells in our ATLAS screens and was selected based on such ATLAS screens as ATLAS prioritized gD2 as the B cell antigen most associated with T cell responses. We pair the antigens with Matrix-M2, a novel adjuvant that we have licensed exclusively for this indication from Novavax, Inc. ("Novavax"). See “—Other Collaborations—Novavax”.
Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease. Genital herpes infections have become an epidemic, spreading to approximately 16% of the United States population between the ages of 14 and 49, and more than 500 million people worldwide, according to the World Health Organization.
For infected individuals, the disease can manifest in a number of ways, with so-called viral shedding as the common element. For some of the virus’ life cycle, it lies dormant within nerve cells near the spine. Although there may be no visible sign of infection, the virus lives within these nerve cells. Periodically, the virus reactivates and virus travels to skin cells of the genitalia where they are released. The release of the virus is called viral shedding and can be detected by swabbing the genital area and testing the swab for the presence of viral DNA. For reasons not completely understood, reactivation of the virus within the nerve cells may occur, resulting in a large amount of virus shedding from skin and mucus membranes. If the replication is maintained for a long enough period of time and at a high enough level, the virus destroys the cells it inhabits and causes ulcers to form on the skin. Patients experiencing such visible ulcers are considered symptomatic patients. It is generally believed that the immune system responds to episodes of genital herpes outbreaks by activating T cells that reduce viral replication and destroy infected cells, allowing healing and resolution of genital ulcers, usually after a few days, although for many patients, ulcers return at variable intervals. Patients may also experience periodic, low-frequency viral shedding. Because the shedding at these times does not lead to the development of ulcers, these episodes are called asymptomatic shedding. These asymptomatic patients continue to pose a disease transmission risk through sexual contact while shedding virus.
7

Some people, approximately 60% of those infected, are asymptomatic or fail to recognize or seek medical attention for an initial mild outbreak of ulcers. According to the New England Journal of Medicine, roughly 40% of persons infected with HSV-2 experience visible symptoms. It has been reported in the Annals of Internal Medicine that approximately 70% of the people with visible symptoms experience three or more outbreaks per year, which we consider to be moderate-to-severe disease. Patients with genital herpes experience significant distress because of the potential negative impact on their ability to form and maintain sexual relationships. Infection with genital herpes can involve substantial risks in addition to the infection itself. For example, persons with genital herpes infection have a threefold increased risk for human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, acquisition. Additionally, pregnant women can transmit genital herpes to infants in childbirth, which can result in severe brain damage or death.
_________________________

* | Note: Each bar represents 1 swab; 2 swabs collected per day; the absence of a bar means no shedding was detected on the swab on a particular day.

The total number of days during a month that the herpes virus can be detected in the genital area with or without visible ulcers is called the shedding frequency. A pattern of shedding and outbreak for one person is illustrated in the graph above. Viral shedding is measured by collecting swabs of the genital area, following a protocol that has been used in decades of studies of HSV-2 viral shedding. In the example shown above, the subject collected swabs twice daily for 28 days. HSV-2 DNA was detectable in approximately 66% of the collected swabs, meaning the patient’s shedding frequency is 66% for the period measured. Some swabs had no detectable viral DNA, meaning the subject did not shed virus at the time of sample collection (exemplified by the blank areas of the above graph). The magnitude of viral shedding varied widely from day to day and only sometimes resulted in clinical symptoms such as visible genital ulcers (represented by the dark bars of the above graph).  Ulcers generally appear after several days of asymptomatic shedding and at times when the magnitude of shedding is highest. The extent, frequency, and duration of shedding vary from person to person, but the pattern is relatively consistent for each person.
Limitations of Current Genital Herpes Treatment Options
There is no known cure for genital herpes. For patients infected with genital herpes, oral antiviral drugs are the only treatment option. The most commonly prescribed treatment is valacyclovir including Valtrex, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline. Other medications available are acyclovir (Zovirax, marketed by GlaxoSmithKline) and famciclovir (Famvir, marketed by Novartis). These drugs all work by limiting the ability of the virus to replicate when it emerges from latency. Sales for these oral antivirals totaled $1.6 billion globally in 2008, including nearly $700 million in the United States, according to IMS Health.
Based on market surveys conducted on our behalf, most patients who use oral antivirals treat their disease episodically. At the onset of outbreaks, or in the case of some patients, at the onset of prodrome, a tingling sensation that may precede an outbreak, patients take antiviral medication to reduce the duration and severity of the outbreak. According to the approved Valtrex prescribing information, episodic treatment only reduces the duration of outbreaks by up to 50% when compared to placebo. Patients treating their symptoms episodically are not protected against asymptomatic viral shedding and, therefore, have no reduced risk of transmission of infection to an uninfected sexual partner while asymptomatic.
Some patients treat their infection with daily antiviral medication. This approach is called chronic suppressive therapy, and has been shown to reduce—but not eliminate—viral shedding, the frequency of symptomatic outbreaks of genital ulcers, and the risk of transmission of the infection to an uninfected sexual partner. Even on chronic suppressive therapy, based on the valacyclovir prescribing information, 35% of patients taking chronic suppressive therapy suffer outbreaks within six months 
8

after initiation of treatment and 46% of patients suffer outbreaks within 12 months. Patients taking chronic suppressive therapy reduce their disease transmission risk only by as much as 52%.
A market research survey conducted on our behalf, in 2014, which included primary research with more than 300 physicians in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, France and Brazil, and a review of secondary sources, indicated that approximately 11 million people in the U.S. are diagnosed with genital herpes. Of those diagnosed, approximately 7 million are treated with oral anti-viral medicines. This research also indicated that approximately 2.5 million patients treat their disease chronically with daily anti-viral pills, and approximately 4.5 million patients treat episodically to reduce the severity of outbreaks when they occur. Of those patients treated chronically, approximately 30% continue to suffer three or more outbreaks of genital herpes per year and of those treated episodically, approximately 50% continue to suffer three or more outbreaks per year. This market research also indicated that the prevalence of genital herpes outside the United States is similar to the United States.
Due to the limited effectiveness of oral antiviral therapy, there remains a significant unmet medical need, against both the symptoms of genital herpes and disease transmission risk from viral shedding.
GEN-003: An Immunotherapy Candidate for Genital Herpes
In our three clinical studies we have shown that GEN-003 is the first immunotherapy known to have demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in viral shedding rate and the signs of clinical genital herpes disease as measured by genital lesion rates (see "Clinical Development" below). We believe that these clinical results continue to demonstrate that GEN-003 has the potential to be a first-in-class immunotherapy to treat genital herpes.
We believe that, if approved for the treatment of genital herpes infections, GEN-003 could address the unmet needs of patients in several ways. For patients taking episodic therapy, GEN-003 could offer reduced symptomatic and asymptomatic viral shedding, potentially reducing disease transmission risk. Since episodic therapy offers no protection against disease transmission during asymptomatic shedding, these patients and their sexual partners are unprotected when the infected partner is not taking anti-viral medication.
For patients on chronic suppressive therapy, we believe GEN-003 may provide both improved outcomes and increased convenience. In a 2016 market research survey conducted on our behalf in the United States of almost 300 currently treated patients, more than 80% stated a preference for GEN-003 over their current therapy. For some patients, we anticipate that physicians will prescribe GEN-003 as baseline therapy. Such patients may still take oral antivirals in case of an outbreak to further control symptoms. Replacing daily therapy may offer convenience to these patients. For other patients, we anticipate that physicians may prescribe GEN-003 alongside chronic suppressive therapy. This combination therapy approach mirrors the treatment practice of other chronic viral infections such as HIV and hepatitis C virus. We anticipate that, since the mechanisms of action for GEN-003 and oral antiviral medication should complement each other, the control against symptoms and disease transmission risk offered by the combination would exceed that of either therapy alone.
In a second market research survey conducted on our behalf with more than 400 patients with HSV-2 infections in the United States, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, and more than 300 physicians who treat patients with HSV-2 infections, 56% of patients on chronic suppressive therapy indicated an intent to use GEN-003 in combination with other therapies and 37% of such patients indicated an intent to use GEN-003 on its own, if it were approved; 30% of patients on episodic therapy indicated an intent to use GEN-003 in combination with other therapies and 60% of such patients indicated an intent to use GEN-003 on its own, if it were approved; and 15% of patients not taking any HSV-2 therapy indicated an intent to use GEN-003 in combination with other therapies and 65% of such patients indicated an intent to use GEN-003 on its own, if it were approved.
Taking together the results of the two market research surveys conducted on our behalf, we forecast a potential market share for GEN-003 in the US of approximately 3 million of the 12 million diagnosed patients. We believe that this translates into a global revenue opportunity of over $2 billion annually. These were limited surveys and may or may not be representative of how patients might ultimately use GEN-003, if at all, or how GEN-003 may be reimbursed if GEN-003 successfully completes clinical development and is approved by regulatory authorities.
Clinical Development
Our Phase 1/2a Clinical Trial
9

We completed a Phase 1/2a trial, testing the safety, T and B cell immunogenicity, and impact on viral shedding of GEN-003 in subjects with documented recurrent HSV-2 infection. We also measured, as an exploratory endpoint, the effect of GEN-003 on the genital lesion rate. The trial was conducted at seven sites in the United States, including some of the leading institutions for scientific and clinical research of genital herpes. The trial was double-blind, placebo-controlled and dose-escalating. We enrolled subjects between 18 and 50 years of age. An independent Data Monitoring Committee monitored the safety of subjects enrolled in the clinical trial.
This trial enrolled 143 otherwise healthy subjects with a history of three to nine genital herpes outbreaks per year when not on suppressive therapy. Subjects were randomized into one of three dose cohorts. Within each cohort, subjects were randomized in a 3:1:1 ratio, whereby for every three subjects receiving GEN-003, one would receive placebo and one would receive the ICP4.2 and gD2 proteins without the Matrix-M2 adjuvant. We included this last cohort to demonstrate that Matrix-M2 was necessary to achieve the desired biological responses. There were three vaccine dose groups, based on the amount of protein. The lowest dose group subjects received 10µg of each protein; in the middle dose group, the protein doses increased to 30µg, and in the high dose group the protein dose was 100µg. For all subjects receiving GEN-003 (proteins plus adjuvant), the Matrix-M2 dose was 50µg. Subjects received three vaccinations, on days zero, 21 and 42. 
The primary objective of this trial was to monitor the safety profile of the proposed vaccine. Overall, GEN-003 was well-tolerated. During the seven days following each injection, side-effects were generally those considered typically associated with vaccines, such as fatigue, site injection pain, tenderness and swelling. Among all vaccine dose groups, the frequency of AEs appeared greater among those subjects given the 10µg dose. In the 30µg and 100µg dose cohorts, the AE rate was lower than that of the 10µg cohort. In addition, the frequency of AEs appeared to diminish with subsequent doses. Beyond the week following vaccination with the GEN-003 immunotherapy, the AE types and frequencies appeared similar to those following vaccination with placebo. The AEs have been transient, resolved over a few days and resulted in only two subjects discontinuing further vaccinations: one for a combination of symptoms (myalgia and fatigue; and pain and tenderness at the injection site) and one for injection site pain.
Additionally, we measured the immunotherapy-induced T cell and B cell immune responses. We structured and statistically powered the trial to measure the proposed immunotherapy’s impact on the viral shedding rate, an important marker of virus activity. We selected this endpoint because of the connection between shedding, symptomatic outbreaks, and risk of transmission of virus by sexual contact. Every subject in the study swabbed their genitalia twice per day for 28 days before receiving the first assigned treatment injection, and after treatment, using the standard protocol that has been used for many clinical trials of HSV-2 shedding.
We measured immunotherapy activity in two ways: the impact on viral shedding and the impact on signs of clinical genital herpes disease as measured by genital lesion rates, defined as the total days in which a patient reported the presence of a visible genital lesion during swabbing days, divided by the total number of swabbing days. The impact on viral shedding was determined by viral DNA present in swabs from subjects over the 28-day measurement period before receiving the assigned treatment and immediately after completing the three-dose regimen and again at six months and 12 months after the final dose. The genital lesion rate was measured at the same time points.
Final analysis of the data showed that for the best performing 30µg dose group, there was a sustained and statistically significant reduction in the viral shedding and genital lesion rates. After completion of dosing for this dose group, the viral shedding rate fell by 52% versus baseline (p<0.001) and, at six months after the final dose, the shedding rate remained at 40% below baseline (p<0.001). At 12 months, the viral shedding rate returned to baseline for this dose group. The reduction in the genital lesion rate after completion of the third dose was greatest for the 30µg dose group, at 48% (p<0.001). After six months, the reduction from baseline in genital lesion rate for this dose group was 65% (p<0.001) and after 12 months the genital lesion rate was 42% lower than baseline.
Our data have also demonstrated that GEN-003 induced a broad immune response in vaccinated subjects at all dose levels. T cell responses increased from baseline 21-fold to ICP4.2 and 10-fold to gD2. Subjects also experienced strong increases in antibody response to ICP4.2 and gD2, as measured by immunoglobulin G, or IgG, a standard measure of antibody response. The antibodies generated in response to the vaccine are able to prevent the virus from infecting new cells, as measured by a standard assay for evaluating the ability of the virus to infect cells in vitro. 
Phase 2 Dose Optimization Trial
 The objective of our Phase 2 dose optimization trial was to confirm the results of the best performing dose in the Phase 1/2a trial, and to test other combinations of protein and adjuvant to determine the optimal dose for future trials and potentially improve on the current profile of GEN-003. The Phase 2 study enrolled 310 subjects from 17 institutions in the 
10

United States. Subjects were randomized to one of six dosing groups of either 30 µg or 60 µg per protein paired with one of three Matrix-M2 adjuvant doses (25 µg, 50 µg, or 75 µg). A seventh group received placebo. Subjects received three doses of GEN-003 or placebo at 21-day intervals. Baseline viral shedding and genital lesion rates were established for each subject in a 28-day observation period prior to the commencement of dosing by collecting 56 genital swab samples (two per day), which were analyzed for the presence of HSV-2 DNA, and by recording the days on which genital lesions were present. This 28-day observation period was repeated immediately after the completion of dosing, was repeated at six months following dosing and will be repeated at twelve months following dosing. No maintenance doses were given.
In May 2015, we announced that, at the 28-day observation period immediately after completion of dosing, both the 60/50 Dose and 60/75 Dose demonstrated a highly statistically significant 41% (p=0.01) and 55% (p=0.006) reductions, respectively, from baseline in the viral shedding rate, the primary endpoint of the trial and a measure of anti-viral activity. All dose combinations tested, including the successful 30 µg per protein / 50 µg of adjuvant dose from the prior Phase 1/2a trial, demonstrated a statistically significant viral shedding rate reduction versus baseline and only the lowest dose combination did not demonstrate a statistically significant reduction versus placebo. In a planned secondary analysis to assess impact on patient reported genital lesion rates, all dose groups, including the placebo group, demonstrated a statistically significant reduction from baseline. Furthermore, there was no difference in discontinuations in patient dosing due to AEs across the different treatment arms. 
In October 2015, we announced positive results from the interim analysis of data collected six months after dosing. At its best performing dose, the 60/75 Dose, GEN-003 demonstrated a statistically significant 58% reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rate (p < 0.0001), the primary endpoint of the study. In a planned secondary analysis, the proportion of patients receiving GEN-003 who were lesion-free at six months after dosing ranged from approximately 30% to 50%, similar to results reported in clinical trials with oral antiviral therapies. In addition, the time to first recurrence after completion of dosing showed a range of 152 days to greater than 180 days among dose groups. In a further secondary analysis measuring the impact on genital lesion rates, GEN-003 demonstrated sustained and statistically significant reductions from baseline in five of six dose groups ranging from 43% to 69%. The Phase 2 trial continued to show that GEN-003 was safe and well tolerated by patients, with no serious AEs related to the vaccine. The two most promising doses from this dose optimization study were the 60/50 Dose and the 60/75 Dose. In October 2015, we announced positive results from the planned interim analysis of data collected six months after dosing demonstrating GEN-003 usage resulted in a statistically significant 47% (p=0.004) and 58% (p < 0.0001) reduction from baseline in the viral shedding rates for both the 60/50 Dose and 60/75 Dose, respectively. 
In March 2016, we announced positive results from data collected twelve months after dosing. The 60/50 Dose and 60/75 Dose continued to demonstrated statistically significant reductions of 66% (p < 0.0001) and 55% (p=0.01), respectively, from baseline in the viral shedding rate. These two doses were advanced to our Phase 2b trial evaluating a new Phase 3-ready formulation of GEN-003. 

The Phase 2 dose optimization trial continued to show that GEN-003 is safe and well tolerated by patients, with no serious AEs related to the vaccine. 
Phase 2b Trial
In December 2015, we initiated a Phase 2b trial which was our first study testing potential Phase 3 endpoints with a Phase 3-ready formulation of GEN-003, manufactured with commercially-scalable processes. The trial enrolled 131 subjects that were randomized to one of three dose groups - placebo, 60/50 Dose, and 60/75 Dose. All subjects received three injections at 21-day intervals. 
In September 2016, we announced positive viral shedding rate reductions from this study. The trial achieved its primary endpoint, with GEN-003 demonstrating a statistically significant (versus placebo and baseline) 40% reduction in the viral shedding rate compared to baseline immediately after dosing in the 60/50 Dose group. This result was consistent with a statistically significant (versus placebo and baseline) viral shedding rate reduction of 41% at this same dose and time point in the previous Phase 2 dose optimization trial. In addition, the reactogenicity profile of this dose, an indication of the strength of the immune response to GEN-003, was consistent between the trials. This same dose in the prior Phase 2 trial subsequently demonstrated virologic and clinical efficacy durable through at least one year after dosing.
The 60/75 Dose group reduced the viral shedding rate by 27%, lower than that observed in the prior trial, and also showed a less acceptable reactogenicity profile than the prior trial. We believe that the increase in reactogenicity of this dose indicates an overstimulation of the T cell immune system leading to the reduced efficacy with this dose in this trial, as would be expected with the known bell-shaped T cell dose response curve. The likely driver of this effect is a more potent adjuvant formulation following customary manufacturing process changes to prepare for Phase 3 trials and commercialization. 
11

In January 2017, we announced positive clinical results from this ongoing trial. At six months after dosing, GEN-003 demonstrated statistically significant improvements versus placebo across multiple clinical endpoints. The 60/50 Dose significantly reduced the rate of genital lesions during the six months following dosing compared to placebo (41% reduction versus placebo). The genital lesion rate is an important overall measure of disease that captures both the frequency and duration of recurrences, both of which are important to both patients and their caregivers. GEN-003 also consistently demonstrated significant benefits versus placebo across several other clinical endpoints including median duration of recurrences in days (2.8 compared to 4.2 for placebo), median duration of recurrences over six months (1.0 compared to 2.0 for placebo), and estimates of percent recurrence free after first and last dose (29% and 22%, respectively, for the 60/50 Dose versus 10% and 13%, respectively, for placebo). In addition, mean duration of recurrences in days (3.3 compared to 4.8 for placebo) and mean duration of recurrences over six months (2.1 compared to 2.7 for placebo) demonstrated significant benefit versus placebo.
Next Steps: Phase 2b twelve-month results; End-of-Phase 2 Meeting; Antiviral Combination GEN-003 Study; Initiation of Phase 3 Pivotal Study
The clinical efficacy data versus placebo at twelve-months post dosing is expected in the middle of 2017 for the ongoing Phase 2b trial. The viral shedding rate reduction data at six-months post dosing is expected in the first half of 2017. In the second half of 2017, we also anticipate the 24-month data from a Phase 2 trial to inform the timing of maintenance dosing. We intend to conduct an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in early 2017. We also expect to commence Phase 3 trials in the fourth quarter of 2017. We plan to commence a clinical trial exploring the potential additive effects of GEN-003 on top of daily administration of valacyclovir in parallel with the Phase 3 program. We retain all rights to GEN-003 and our strategy is to execute a partnership to maximize the potential of GEN-003 and to help fund the costs of the GEN-003 Phase 3 program. 
Potential for GEN-003 to Treat HSV-1 Infection
We anticipate that GEN-003 may also help a patient’s immune system fight herpes simplex virus type-1, or HSV-1. HSV-1 is most commonly identified with cold sores and has infected approximately 60% of Americans, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC"). Increasingly, HSV-1 has been associated with outbreaks of genital ulcers, though the frequency and severity of such outbreaks generally is less than those associated with HSV-2. HSV-1 and HSV-2 are related viruses and the proteins in GEN-003 are present in, and nearly identical to, those found in HSV-1. Consequently, we believe that GEN- 003 may be active against HSV-1 and thus intend to study the potential for GEN-003 to combat HSV-1 genital disease in the Phase 3 program.
The Opportunity to Prevent HSV-2 Infections
In addition to treating HSV-2 infection with GEN-003, we believe that ATLAS may help to develop a vaccine that can prevent HSV-2 from infecting healthy persons. We believe that a vaccine that has therapeutic effect may be the foundation for a preventative vaccine. A prophylactic vaccine may be an important step in halting the epidemic, and could be used to treat uninfected partners of HSV-2 infected subjects to prevent them from acquiring the disease. The vaccine could also be used more broadly as a preventative measure. Although we have made important progress in the development of a prophylactic vaccine and we believe this is a valuable asset for us, we have paused our research and development of this product candidate in order to focus on GEN-003 and our immuno-oncology program.
Our Immuno-Oncology Program
Cancer is among the leading causes of death worldwide, with the incidence estimated to grow to 22 million over the next two decades. In 2015 in the U.S., an estimated 1.6 million new cases of cancer will be diagnosed, and approximately 600,000 people will die from the disease.
Cancer starts in the human body when the otherwise orderly process of cell growth, division and death breaks down. As a result, abnormal or damaged cells that should die instead survive, grow and spread, forming solid tumors or cancers of the blood like leukemia. Although the body’s immune system is designed to remove abnormal or damaged cells, cancerous cells are sometimes able to evade the immune system.

A recent breakthrough in treating cancer is the development of Checkpoint Blockade ("CPB") therapies. Immune CPBs function by blocking the activity of checkpoint proteins, which inhibit normal immune responses to cancers. Several CPBs have recently been approved by the FDA, including ipilimumab (Yervoy®), nivolumab (Opdivo®) and pembrolizumab (Keytruda®). Although these therapies unleash a robust T cell response, they don’t work well for all patients - demonstrating limited efficacy and toxic effects in some populations.
12

Guided by our positive clinical results on GEN-003 and belief in the ATLAS platform, we are focused on combining our antigen selection and vaccine development expertise with that of leading cancer innovators to unlock new targets in immuno-oncology. Our potential cancer vaccines will be designed to educate T cells to recognize and attack specific targets and thereby kill cancers. We are developing personalized cancer vaccines by leveraging ATLAS to identify patient neoantigens, or newly formed antigens unique to each patient, that are associated with that individual's tumor. We anticipate filing a personalized cancer vaccine IND application with the FDA in 2017. We are also applying the results from ATLAS, and its utility a prognostic tool, to identify patients that could benefit from checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Our strategy in immuno-oncology combines our own internal development programs with a focus on partnering ATLAS for other immuno-oncology applications.
Our current collaborations in immuno-oncology are as follows: 
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ("DFCI") - Starting in 2014, we entered into a collaboration with F. Stephen Hodi, Jr., M.D., director of the Melanoma Center at DFCI to utilize ATLAS to potentially identify patterns of T cell response in melanoma patients receiving CBP therapy. By analyzing the immune responses of both responders and non-responders to CBP therapy, ATLAS successfully identified the cancer antigens to which either (or both) CD4+ or CD8+ T cells became activated. Although this research was not powered to draw firm conclusions, the analysis of T cell responses in patients receiving CBP therapy revealed a pattern indicating a greater breadth of T cell activation for responders than non-responders. The study also revealed preliminary evidence that different characteristics of T cell responses emerge when comparing patients who respond and those who do not. Some T cell responses did not correspond with improved patient outcomes, and may be classified as “decoys,” further validating the ability of ATLAS to distinguish clinically relevant targets of T cell response. The collaboration with Dana-Farber is ongoing as we continue to analyze more tumor samples to characterize T cell response profiles that may be prognostic of CBP efficacy, and to identify T cell antigens that may be included in novel immunotherapies.
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center ("MSKCC") - In November 2015, we announced a collaboration with Timothy A. Chan, M.D., Ph.D., Vice Chair, Department of Radiation Oncology, and Jedd D. Wolchok, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service at the MSKCC to screen the T cell responses of melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with CBPs against the complete repertoire of patient-specific putative cancer neoantigens. The goals of the collaboration are to identify signatures of T cell response in cancer patients associated with response or non-response to CBP therapy and to discover new T cell cancer vaccine antigens. ATLAS is being used in conjunction with MSKCC’s patient-specific cancer neoantigen sequences and blood samples from the same cancer patients. 
Through this collaboration, ATLAS has discovered several neoantigens as biologically relevant T cell targets associated with significant cytotoxic T cell responses. Importantly, many of these neoantigens were not identified by commonly used predictive computer algorithms, and the majority of neoantigens that were identified by those algorithms were not associated with meaningful T cell responses in ATLAS.
Checkmate Pharmaceuticals ("Checkmate") - In December 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Checkmate. Checkmate is a clinical-phase company developing a product that seeks to activate the innate immune system to attack a tumor. Checkmate’s lead therapeutic candidate is currently in a Phase 1 clinical trial in metastatic melanoma in combination with an immune CBP. We are employing ATLAS to profile the T cell responses of approximately 20 patients enrolled in Checkmate’s ongoing Phase 1b clinical trial to a library of tumor-associated antigens common to patients with advanced melanoma. The T cell response signatures of those patients who respond to CMP-001/pembrolizumab combination therapy will be compared to the signatures of those who do not respond, thereby potentially identifying antigens associated with positive or negative patient outcomes.
US Oncology Research ("US Oncology") - In December 2016, we also announced our entry into a collaboration agreement with US Oncology, one of the largest network of community oncologists in the US. Through collaboration and shared purpose, US Oncology provides the clinical, research, technology and business resources to ensure the growth and vitality of their independent, community-based oncology practices. Pursuant to our agreement, we will screen the T cell responses of cancer patients with solid tumors who will be treated with checkpoint inhibitors against the complete repertoire of patient-specific putative cancer neoantigens. The objective of the collaboration is to use ATLAS to further Genocea's expertise in identifying signatures of T cell responses in cancer patients and to discover new T cell cancer vaccine antigens to support personalized cancer vaccine clinical trials.
Our Epstein Barr Virus Program

13

EBV is associated with a number of cancers, such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma and gastric carcinoma. EBV is also the cause of infectious mononucleosis in adolescence and is associated with higher risk of a number of other serious diseases.

We believe that an effective immunotherapy against EBV needs to direct T cells and may have therapeutic potential against some or all of these diseases with large unmet needs. Furthermore, we believe that ATLAS is well-suited to identify the clinically important antigens which drive protective T cell responses to the virus.

Discovery research using ATLAS is ongoing to identify candidate T cell antigens to form the core of an immunotherapy that could potentially be advanced into clinical development.

Other Infectious Disease Programs 
Pneumococcal Disease
The Gates Foundation has noted that pneumococcus kills more children under age five globally than any other organism. There are more than 90 serotypes, or strains, of pneumococcus known to exist. Pneumococcus is a bacterium that often resides harmlessly in the nose and throat but can cause otitis media, or middle ear infection, as well as pneumonia, an infection in the lungs. Such consequences of infection are considered non-invasive pneumococcal disease. Invasive pneumococcal disease ("IPD") arises when pneumococcus enters the bloodstream and potentially spreads to other organs. The consequences of IPD can be severe and, according to the CDC, 10% of patients with IPD die. 
We believe there are significant limitations with current pneumococcal vaccines given they cover only 13 serotypes of the disease compared to the more than 90 known serotypes of pneumococcus. Incidence of invasive disease caused by the 75+ serotypes not included in that vaccine is rapidly increasing and to our knowledge, other companies’ product candidates are being developed to elicit a B cell response. Our GEN-004 program was designed to prevent infections caused by all serotypes of pneumococcus. GEN-004 consists of three whole Pneumococcal T cell protein antigens, SP0148, SP1912 and SP2108, combined with the adjuvant Alhydrogel, a form of alum that is contained in several approved vaccines.
We demonstrated proof-of-concept of GEN-004 in a mouse model of nasal colonization. We subsequently launched a Phase 1 clinical trial that was a randomized, double-blind, dose-escalation, and placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolling 90 healthy adult volunteers. In June 2014, we announced positive top-line data from a Phase 1 clinical trial in the United States to evaluate the safety of, and immune response to, GEN-004. The Phase 1 clinical trial met its safety, tolerability and immunogenicity goals. 
Based on these data, a Phase 2a trial was initiated in the third quarter of 2014. Subjects in the clinical trial received either 100µg dose of GEN-004 with 350µg of adjuvant or placebo, and then was “challenged” intranasally with live pneumococcus in the nasal cavity. We enrolled approximately 90 healthy adults in this trial and it was designed to monitor AEs, antibody and T-cell immune responses as determined by IgG and IL-17A, and incidence of post-challenge nasopharyngeal colonization. In October 2015, we announced that top-line results from the Phase 2a clinical trial for GEN-004 showed consistent reductions versus placebo in the pre-specified endpoints of the rate and density of colonization, but that neither of the endpoints achieved statistical significance. GEN-004 was safe and well tolerated by subjects. 
Although we did not achieve statistical significance in this study, we believe the consistent apparent effect of the Phase 2a trial supports the vaccine concept and the potential for GEN-004. We believe it is possible that future trials would require a change in some combination of dose, adjuvant or trial population to confirm any effect. GEN-004 is currently not part of any active clinical trials or development as we focus our efforts on GEN-003 and our immuno-oncology program.
Our Chlamydia Program
Chlamydia is the most commonly reported bacterial sexually transmitted disease in the United States. According to the CDC, an estimated 2.9 million infections occur annually in the United States. Despite the widespread availability of antibiotics that are effective against Chlamydia trachomatis, the pathogen that causes chlamydia infections, incidence has increased at greater than 5% per year over the past decade, according to the CDC. A key reason for this is that chlamydia is often an asymptomatic infection, so infected individuals do not seek treatment, which can result in severe consequences, particularly in women, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, infertility and serious neonatal infections. Antibodies appear to be unlikely to protect against infection as the pathogen is intracellular for much of its life cycle. Additionally, as a large genome pathogen, Chlamydia trachomatis represents a large T cell antigen discovery challenge and, we believe, a pathogen for use of ATLAS to identify a vaccine candidate.
14

We have achieved promising preclinical results using chlamydia antigens identified using ATLAS. The ATLAS screening, comprising 144 subjects, identified chlamydia antigen targets that elicit T cell responses preferentially in patients with positive clinical outcomes (spontaneous clearance) versus patients with infertility or pelvic inflammatory disease. Based on our screening analysis, we prioritized 25 Chlamydia trachomatis antigens for pre-clinical testing.  All antigens have been cloned and expressed and twelve have been successfully purified. These proteins were paired with Matrix-M2 adjuvant and evaluated as potential vaccine candidates in an animal efficacy model of chlamydia infection. From these studies we have identified three antigen targets that confer protection against chlamydia challenge based on bacterial burden analysis in the genital tract measured over time. Immunogenicity studies done coincident with the challenge model suggest that these antigens may be protecting mice by different mechanisms of action. Research under this program was paused in the fourth quarter of 2016 to focus on GEN-003 and our immuno-oncology program.
Our Malaria Program
Malaria is one of the deadliest infectious diseases in the world. Approximately 400 thousand to 800 thousand people died in 2013 due to malaria, primarily in the developing world. There is no vaccine to prevent malaria, an infection caused by the plasmodium parasites transmitted by mosquitoes. We previously collaborated with the Naval Medical Research Center "NMRC") and initiated a second collaboration with the Gates Foundation for which malaria is a priority infectious disease. When the parasite is injected into the blood through the bite of an infected mosquito, it rapidly travels to the liver where it replicates exponentially, is released into the bloodstream, and causes sickness. T cells in the liver could potentially be used to kill the cells in which the parasite is hiding, before the parasite is able to replicate itself, and could therefore protect against blood infection. Both the Gates Foundation and NMRC have sponsored several studies investigating killed or attenuated whole organism vaccines, which induce immunity, but are impractical to manufacture because the vaccines are based on irradiated parasites grown within the salivary glands of mosquitoes.
In September 2014, we announced the receipt of a $1.2 million grant from the Gates Foundation for the identification of protective T cell antigens for malaria vaccines, which extended our collaboration through 2016 and supports comprehensive screening of the malaria proteome to identify targets of protective T cell responses. We completed this grant work early in 2016 and presented our results to the Gates Foundation. 
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. Although we believe that our proprietary patent portfolio and T cell vaccine expertise provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical companies. Not only must we compete with other vaccine companies but any products that we may commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
There are other organizations working to improve existing therapies or to develop new vaccines or therapies for our initially selected indications. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success of our GEN-003 product candidate, if approved. 
The current standard of care for the treatment of HSV-2 is valacyclovir, an oral antiviral medicine. Other currently approved oral antiviral medications include acyclovir and famciclovir. AiCuris, a private company based in Germany, is developing a new oral antiviral, pritelivir, for which an existing clinical hold has been partially lifted for certain patient populations. We believe that GEN-003 may offer advantages in terms of improved symptom control, reduced disease transmission risk and improved compliance when compared to oral antivirals.
There are also several companies attempting to develop new therapeutic vaccines against genital herpes, including Agenus Inc., Admedus Ltd, Sanofi Pasteur and Vical Incorporated. GEN-003 is in more advanced clinical development than these product candidates being developed by these companies. Furthermore, we believe that GEN-003 has advantages against each of these product candidates based on the screens of human protection that we have conducted using ATLAS that include these competitors’ antigens, published reports of non-clinical vaccine efficacy, announced clinical results in the case of Agenus, Inc. and Vical, Inc. and our own clinical results to date. However, there can be no assurance that one or more of these companies or other companies will not achieve similar or superior clinical results in the future as compared to GEN-003 or that our future clinical trials will be successful.
15

Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of vaccines and the commercialization of those vaccines. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for vaccines and achieving widespread market acceptance. Our competitors’ vaccines may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any vaccine we may commercialize and may render our vaccines obsolete or non-competitive.
Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any vaccines that we develop and commercialize to compete on the basis of, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic products.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform and on know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the vaccine field. We additionally rely on regulatory protection afforded through data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions where available. Still further, we utilize trademark protection for our company name, and expect to do so for products and/or services as they are marketed.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial products and methods of manufacturing the same.
We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of vaccine products. The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office ("U.S. PTO") in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent.
The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a United States patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and 
16

other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a biologics license application ("BLA") we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use.
As of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our patent portfolio includes the following:
ATLAS
Our discovery platform patent portfolio includes three patent families, currently comprising six issued U.S. patents. We hold an exclusive license from The Regents of the University of California ("UC") to the first patent family, including U.S. Patent 6,004,815 and the related U.S. Patents 6,287,556 and 6,599,502.

U.S. Patents 8,313,894 and 9,045,791 have terms that include Patent Term Adjustments and extend until August 2030 and August 2029, respectively.
GEN-003 (Genital Herpes)
We wholly own a portfolio of patent applications directed to HSV-2 vaccines, including GEN-003. This portfolio includes two patent families covering HSV-2 vaccine compositions and methods for inhibiting or treating HSV-2 infections. The first patent family includes U.S. Patent 8,617,564, and patents granted in Australia, China, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and Singapore. A U.S. application and applications in Europe, Canada, Japan, Brazil, India, China and four additional foreign jurisdictions are pending in the first patent family. The second family includes a pending U.S. application, a patent granted in Japan, and pending applications in Europe, Canada, and Australia. Patents that issue from applications in these families are expected to expire in 2030 and 2031. The term for the issued U.S. Patent 8,617,564 includes Patent Term Adjustment and extends until at least January 2031. We own a further patent family covering follow-on HSV-2 vaccine compositions, with applications pending in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan. Patents issuing from this family are expected to expire in 2032.
We hold a license from Isconova AB (now Novavax, Inc.) to two patent families covering Matrix-M2, the adjuvant used in GEN-003. Both patent families include a pending U.S. application and issued patents in Europe, Canada, Australia, Japan, Brazil, New Zealand and South Africa. These issued patents have patent terms until at least July 2023 and July 2024. The second patent family also includes issued U.S. Patent 8,821,881, which has a term that extends until August 2026 inclusive of a Patent Term Adjustment.
GEN-004 (Pneumococcus)
We co-own with Children’s Medical Center Corporation ("Children's"), a portfolio of patent applications directed to pneumococcus vaccines, including GEN-004. This portfolio includes two patent families covering pneumococcal vaccine compositions and methods for inhibiting or treating pneumococcal infections. A U.S. application and applications in Europe, Canada, Brazil, India, China and eight additional foreign jurisdictions are pending in the first patent family. The first family also includes granted patents in Australia, Japan, New Zealand and Russia. The second patent family includes U.S. Patent 9,393,294, a pending U.S. application, granted patents in Australia, Indonesia, Mexico and New Zealand, and pending applications in Europe, Canada, Japan, Brazil, Russia, India, China and six additional foreign jurisdictions. Patents that issue from applications in these patent families are expected to have patent terms until at least 2030 and 2032, respectively. We hold an exclusive license to Children's interest in these patent rights. We co-own with Children's one further patent family covering follow-on pneumococcal vaccine compositions, with pending applications in the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, and Japan. Children's interest in these patent rights is also exclusively licensed to us.
GEN-001 (Chlamydia)
17

Our chlamydia patent portfolio previously included four patent families (one of which overlaps with the ATLAS portfolio). We held an exclusive license from Harvard to the first three patent families. We notified Harvard of our partial termination of the license agreement with regard to chlamydia antigens covered by these patent families on December 8th 2014. Effective March 8th 2015, the license agreement with Harvard with regard to chlamydia antigens covered by these patent families was terminated and we no longer hold an exclusive license to two of the three patent families, or to a chlamydia antigen covered by the remaining family. The remaining family covers certain aspects of the ATLAS platform, as well as one chlamydia antigen, and we maintain exclusive rights to aspects of the ATLAS platform covered by this family. We determined that the chlamydia antigens covered by these patent families were not relevant to the continued development of GEN-001. We wholly own the fourth patent family, which covers chlamydia vaccine and immunogenic compositions and methods for inhibiting or treating chlamydia infections. A U.S. application and applications in Europe, Canada, Australia and Japan are pending in this patent family. Patents issuing therefrom are expected to expire in 2031.
In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property.

In August 2006, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with UC granting us an exclusive, royalty-bearing sublicensable license to a patent family that includes claims to fundamental aspects of the ATLAS platform, to make, use, offer for sale, import and sell licensed products and services, and to practice licensed methods in all fields of use in the United States. This patent family consists entirely of issued United States patents with a patent term until August 2018. UC retains the right to practice and to allow other educational and non-profit institutions to practice, the licensed intellectual property licensed under the agreement for educational and research purposes.
Until first commercial sale of a licensed product or service, we are obligated to pay UC an annual license maintenance fee in the low five figures. Upon commercialization of our products and services covered by the licensed patents, we are obligated to pay UC royalties in the low single digits, subject to a minimum annual royalty in the low five figures, on the net sales of such products and services sold by us or our affiliates for the life of any licensed patents covering the products or services. The royalties payable to UC are subject to reduction for any third party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. In addition, we agreed to pay UC a flat royalty in the low single digits on net sales of products sold by us or our affiliates which include a polypeptide, nucleotide sequence, biological organism or chemical entity identified in the practice of a licensed method or service, but not otherwise covered, by the licensed patent for the life of the licensed patents. If we receive any revenue (cash or non-cash) from any sublicensees, we must pay UC a percentage of such revenue, excluding certain categories of payments but including royalties on net sales by sublicensees, varying in the low-double digits for any sublicense depending on the scope of the license. Under the terms of the agreement, we are obligated to pay UC a specified development milestone payment and a specified commercial milestone payment up to $500 thousand in the aggregate for the first licensed product covered by the licensed patents, plus up to an additional $250 thousand if specified development and commercial milestones are met for each subsequent licensed product covered by the licensed patents. As of December 31, 2016, we have not made any milestone payments.
We are required to diligently develop and market licensed products, services and methods. If we are unable to meet our diligence obligations, even after any extension thereof, UC has the right, depending on the number of years the agreement has been effective, to either terminate the agreement or convert our exclusive license to a non-exclusive license.
Unless earlier terminated, the agreement with UC will remain in effect until the expiration of the last-to-expire patent under the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement at any time by giving UC advance written notice. The agreement may also be terminated by UC in the event of a material breach by us that remains uncured after a specified period of time. 
Harvard University
In November 2007, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Harvard, granting us an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing, sublicensable license to three patent families, to develop, make, have made, use, market, offer for sale, sell, have sold and import licensed products and to perform licensed services. This agreement was amended and restated in November 2012. The Harvard intellectual property covers methods related to the ATLAS discovery platform, as well as certain 
18

chlamydia immunogenic compositions and methods for inhibiting or treating chlamydia infections. Any patents within this portfolio that have issued or may be issued will expire normally in 2027 and 2028. Harvard retains the right to make and use, and to grant licenses to other not-for-profit research organizations to make and use, the licensed intellectual property for internal research, teaching and other educational purposes. We notified Harvard of our partial termination of the license agreement with regard to intellectual property covering chlamydia antigens on December 8, 2014. Effective March 8, 2015, the license agreement with Harvard with regard to intellectual property covering chlamydia antigens was terminated and we no longer hold a license to two of the three in-licensed Harvard patent families, or to a chlamydia antigen covered by the remaining family. The remaining family covers certain aspects of the ATLAS platform, as well as one chlamydia antigen, and we continue to maintain exclusive rights to aspects of the ATLAS platform covered by this family.
We are obligated to pay Harvard an annual license maintenance fee ranging from the low five figures to the mid-five figures depending on the type of product and the number of years after the effective date of the agreement.  For products covered by the licensed patent rights, we are obligated to pay Harvard milestone payments up to $1.8 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. For products discovered using the licensed methods, we are obligated to pay Harvard milestone payments up to $600 thousand in the aggregate for each of the first three products and up to $300 thousand in the aggregate for each additional product under the agreement upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones. As of December 31, 2016, we paid $198 thousand in aggregate milestone payments. Upon commercialization of our products covered by the licensed patent rights or discovered using the licensed methods, we are obligated to pay Harvard royalties on the net sales of such products and services sold by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees. This royalty varies depending on the type of product or service but is in the low single digits. The royalty based on sales by our sublicensees is the greater of the applicable royalty rate or a percentage in the high single digits or the low double digits of the royalties we receive from such sublicensee depending on the type of product. Depending on the type of commercialized product or service, royalties are payable until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim under the licensed patent rights or for a period of 10 years from first commercial sale of such product or service. The royalties payable to Harvard are subject to reduction, capped at a specified percentage, for any third party payments required to be made. In addition to the royalty payments, if we receive any additional revenue (cash or non-cash) under any sublicense, we must pay Harvard a percentage of such revenue, excluding certain categories of payments, varying from the low single digits to up to the low double digits depending on the scope of the license that includes the sublicense.
We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop licensed products, introduce them into the commercial market and market them, in compliance with an agreed upon development plan. We are also obligated to achieve specified development milestones. If we are unable to meet our development milestones for any type of product or service, absent any reasonable proposed extension or amendment thereof, Harvard has the right, depending on the type of product or service, to terminate this agreement with respect to such products or to convert the license to a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable license with respect to such products and services.
Our agreement with Harvard will expire on a product-by-product or service-by-service and country-by-country basis until the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim under the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement at any time by giving Harvard advance written notice. Harvard may also terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by us that remains uncured; in the event of our insolvency, bankruptcy, or similar circumstances; or if we challenge the validity of any patents licensed to us. 
Other Collaborations
Children’s Medical Center Corporation
In September 2008, we entered into a collaborative research agreement with Children’s, that was funded by PATH Vaccine Solutions ("PATH"). The collaborative research project led to the identification of certain highly conserved pneumococcal antigens that are able to protect against colonization. The intellectual property covering these antigens is co-owned by us and Children's and covers pneumococcal vaccine compositions and methods for inhibiting or treating pneumococcus infections. In February 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Children's, which was amended and restated in March 2012. This agreement grants us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under Children's rights to the jointly-owned intellectual property to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and export licensed products and to practice licensed processes for the prevention and treatment of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Children's retains the right to practice and use, and to allow academic non-profit research organizations to practice and use, the licensed intellectual property for research, educational, clinical and charitable purposes. Under the terms of the agreement, our license from Children's is subject to PATH’s separate non-exclusive, royalty-free license from Children's to develop pneumococcal T cell-based protein vaccines worldwide and to market and sell such vaccines in developing countries.
19

For products covered by the licensed patent rights, we are obligated to pay Children's milestone payments up to $390 thousand in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones. As of December 31, 2016, we paid $140 thousand in aggregate milestone payments. Upon commercialization of our products, we are obligated to pay Children's royalties in the low single digits on the net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees. The royalties payable to Children's are subject to reduction for any third-party payments required to be made, with a minimum floor in the low single digits. Royalties are payable for the term of the license agreement, which is 15 years from the effective date of the amended and restated agreement or until expiration of the last-to-expire patent under the licensed patent rights, whichever period is longer. If we receive any additional revenue (cash or non-cash) under any sublicense, we must pay Children's a percentage of such income varying from the mid-single digits to low double digits depending on the clinical stage of development of the product, provided that such percentage may increase to match our financial obligations to third parties.
We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to bring at least one licensed product to market as soon as reasonably practical, consistent with sound and legal business practices and judgment and to accomplish the objectives set forth in an agreed upon development plan. If we are unable to meet our diligence obligations, even after any extensions thereof, Children's has the right to terminate in this agreement in whole or in part.
Unless earlier terminated, the agreement with Children's will remain in effect until the later of 15 years from the effective date of the amended and restated agreement or the expiration of the last to expire patent under the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement in its entirety or on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis. Children's may terminate the agreement in the event of our bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances; if we use confidential information to formally challenge Children's joint ownership of the licensed patent rights; or if we materially breach the agreement and do not cure such breach within a specified time period.
Novavax
In August 2009, we entered into an exclusive license and collaboration agreement with Isconova AB, a Swedish company which has subsequently been acquired by Novavax. The agreement grants us a worldwide, sublicensable, exclusive license to two patent families, to import, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and otherwise exploit licensed vaccine products containing an adjuvant which incorporates or is developed from Matrix-A, Matrix-C and/or Matrix-M technology, in the fields of HSV and chlamydia, and the time-limited exclusive fields of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, cytomegalovirus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In July 2015, upon expiration of the five-year exclusivity term included in the agreement, the license granted to us converted to a non-exclusive license with respect to all licensed intellectual property rights that were not jointly invented by us and Novavax under the collaboration. Under the terms of this agreement, Novavax also grants us a worldwide, sublicensable, non-exclusive license under such licensed intellectual property rights to import, make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale and otherwise exploit licensed products in the field of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Our rights in the field of Streptococcus pneumoniae are exclusive with respect to all intellectual property rights jointly invented by us and Novavax under the collaboration. The agreement further grants us certain limited rights to use Novavax trademarks.
For licensed products in each unique disease field under the agreement, we are obligated to pay Novavax milestone payments up to approximately $3.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of certain development and commercial milestones. As of December 31, 2016, we paid $275 thousand in aggregate milestone payments. Upon commercialization of our products, we are obligated to pay Novavax royalties on the net sales of licensed products sold by us, our affiliates and our sublicensees. The royalties payable to Novavax are in the low single digits and vary on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis based on the amount of net sales and the nature and timing of the licensed product’s development. The royalties payable to Novavax are subject to reduction if the licensed product is not covered by one or more valid claims of the licensed patent rights, or if we are required to make any third-party payments. Royalties are payable for 10 years from first commercial sale in any particular country or until the date on which offer for sale of a licensed product is no longer covered by a valid claim of the licensed patent rights in such country, whichever period is longer. In addition to the royalty payments, if we receive any additional revenue (cash or non-cash) under any sublicenses, we must pay Novavax a percentage of such revenue, up to the low double digits.
We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform specified research activities in accordance with an agreed-upon research plan. We are also obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts consistent with prudent business judgment and business and market conditions to research, develop and carry out the commercialization of licensed products in HSV and chlamydia.
Our agreement with Novavax will expire on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis on the date of the expiration of the royalty term with respect to such licensed product in such country. We may terminate the 
20

agreement on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis or in its entirety at any time by giving Novavax advance written notice. Both parties may also terminate the agreement in the event of a material breach by the other party that remains uncured or for bankruptcy, insolvency or similar circumstances. Novavax may terminate this agreement if we challenge the validity of any patents licensed to us.
The agreement also contained a research funding clause for which we made monthly payments to Novavax between August 2009 and March 2012 of approximately $1.6 million. All amounts of research funding provided were to be refunded by Novavax. After December 31, 2015, any amounts remaining due from Novavax, including accrued interest, could be received in cash upon 30-day written notice provided by us. We provided this notice in January 2016 and received the $1.6 million refund in February 2016. 
Manufacture Contracts 
Fujifilm
In February 2014, we entered into a supply agreement with FUJIFILM Diosynth Biotechnologies U.S.A., Inc. ("Fujifilm") for the manufacture and supply of antigens for future GEN-003 clinical trials. In June and September 2016, the Company entered into new statements of work under the agreement with Fujifilm for the manufacture and supply of antigens for the Company's Phase 3 clinical trials. Under these agreement, we are obligated to pay Fujifilm milestone payments up to the low-eight figures upon the achievement of certain manufacturing milestones. As of December 31, 2016, we paid approximately $7.0 million in aggregate manufacturing milestone payments. Additionally, raw materials, resins and consumables purchased for the vaccine production are invoiced separately as such costs are incurred by Fujifilm. We pay Fujifilm’s actual costs plus a percentage fee in the mid-single digits for these raw materials, resins and consumables. We also are required to pay reservation fees, which equal a percentage of production fees in the low-double digits, to reserve manufacturing slots in the production timeframe as agreed upon under the agreement. We are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to timely provide Fujifilm with the technology, materials and resources needed to produce and supply the recombinant protein antigen.
Our agreement with Fujifilm will expire on February 25, 2024. Subject to termination fees under applicable circumstances, we may terminate the agreement at any time by giving Fujifilm advance written notice. The agreement may also be terminated by either party due to a material uncured breach by the other party.
Baxter
In October 2014, we entered a product development and clinical supply agreement with Baxter Pharmaceutical Solutions LLC ("Baxter"). The product development and clinical supply agreement provides the terms and conditions under which Baxter will formulate, fill, inspect, package, label and test our lead product, GEN-003 for clinical supply. Under this agreement, we are obligated to pay Baxter amounts up to the low six digits for each batch of GEN-003 manufactured. Additionally, certain set-up fees and equipment purchased for the purposes of batch production will be invoiced separately by Baxter. We will pay set-up fees and equipment costs in the low six digits upon commencement of batch production. We also pay a monthly service fee in the low five digits for project management services for the duration of the arrangement. As of December 31, 2016, we paid approximately $657 thousand under this agreement.
Our agreement with Baxter expires on October 23, 2021. Subject to termination fees under applicable circumstances, we may terminate the agreement at any time by giving Baxter advance written notice. The agreement may also be terminated by either party due to a material uncured breach by the other party.
Trade Secrets
We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.

United States Government Regulation
Biological products such as vaccines are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FD&C Act") and the Public Health Service Act ("PHS Act"), and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C and PHS Acts and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Clinical testing of biological products is subject to FDA review before initiation. In addition, FDA approval must be obtained before marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory review and approval and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
United States Biological Products Development Process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices ("GLP") and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an application for an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices ("GCP") and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use, including approval by an independent Institutional Review Board (“IRB”), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices ("GMPs") to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices ("GTP") for the use of human cellular and tissue products;


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA.

Before testing any biological product candidate in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical study stage. Preclinical studies, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical studies must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA places the clinical trial on a clinical hold within that 30-day time period. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials 
22

are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including stopping rules that assure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain AEs should occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the FDA’s regulations comprising the GCP requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 


• | Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible AEs and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 


• | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate safety, purity, and potential of biological product in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval and product labeling. 

Post-approval clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected AEs, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Sponsors of all controlled clinical trials, except for Phase 1 trials, are required to submit certain clinical trial information for inclusion in the public clinical trial registry and results data bank maintained by the National Institutes of Health, which are publicly available at http://clinicaltrials.gov. 
Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
United States Review and Approval Processes
23

After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all, and for what indications will be approved, if any.
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act ("PDUFA"), as amended, each BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. PDFUA also imposes an annual product fee for biologics and an annual establishment fee on facilities used to manufacture prescription biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business.
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with GMP regulations to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy ("REMS"), is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure GMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months from filing and 90% of priority BLAs in six months from filing, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change 
24

from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Transparency and Privacy Laws
In the United States, our business activities are subject to numerous other laws by federal and state authorities, in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the United States Department of Health and Human Services ("HHS"), and its various divisions, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services ("CMS"). These laws are enforced by various federal and state enforcement authorities, including but not limited to, the United States Department of Justice, and individual United States Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, HHS’ various enforcement divisions, including but not limited to, the Office of Inspector General, the Office for Human Research Protections, and the Office of Research Integrity, and other state and local government agencies.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending, the purchase lease, or order of any good, facility, service or item for which payment is made, in whole or in part, under a federal health care program, such as Medicare. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances.
The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Recently, the civil False Claims Act has been used to assert liability on the basis of kickbacks and improper referrals, improperly reported government pricing metrics such as Medicaid Best Price or Average Manufacturer Price, improper use of supplier or provider Medicare numbers when detailing a provider of services, improper promotion of drugs or off-label uses not expressly approved by the FDA in a drug’s label, and misrepresentations with respect to the services rendered or items provided.
Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute, among other things, imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented, or caused to be presented, claims to a federal health care program that the person knows, or should know, is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any health care benefit program and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items or services relating to health care matters.
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes and regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, private payors.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act within the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or Health Care Reform Law, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report to CMS, information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually to CMS certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
In addition, we may be subject to, or our marketing activities may be limited by, data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.

If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the health regulatory laws described above, or any other laws that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil, criminal, and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment or restructuring of our operations.
Reimbursement
In both domestic and foreign markets, the commercial success of any approved products will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement of such products from third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed care organizations. Patients who are provided vaccinations, and providers providing vaccinations, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated health care costs. Sales of any approved vaccines will therefore depend substantially, both domestically and abroad, on the extent to which the costs of our approved vaccines will be paid by third-party payors. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. The containment of health care costs has become a priority of federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. In addition, there is significant uncertainty regarding the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products. Third-party payors are increasingly examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, the payors may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
Within the United States, if we obtain appropriate approval in the future to market any of our current product candidates, we may seek approval and coverage for those products under Medicaid, Medicare and the PHS Act, pharmaceutical pricing program and also seek to sell the products to federal agencies. These programs are administered by various federal and state agencies to allow for individuals age 65 and over, low income, and disabled beneficiaries access to approved medicines and treatments. Under these programs, manufacturers are required to pay rebates, and the pricing of an approved treatment may be subject to various forms of price modifications. 
Recent legislation, including the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "2009 Act"), the Affordable Care Act enacted in March 2010 (the "2010 Act"), as well as the pending proposals to eliminate or significantly modify the 2010 Act may impact health care financing by both governmental and private payors. The 2009 Act provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payors, it is not clear what effect, if any, the research will have on the sales of any product, if any such product or the condition that it is intended to treat is the subject of a trial. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits in a competitor’s product could adversely affect the sales of any of our approved products. The 2010 Act was designed to reduce the cost of health care which could limit the prices we are able to charge or the amounts of reimbursement available for our vaccine candidates once they are approved. 
Modifications to or repeal of all or certain provisions of the 2010 Act are expected as a result of the outcome of the recent presidential elections and Republications maintaining control of Congress, consistent with statements made by Donald Trump and members of Congress during the presidential campaign and following the election. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any changes to the 2010 Act or other federal and state reform efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our business and financial results, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative, judicial or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business. 
Outside the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for our products will face challenges. In international markets, reimbursement and health care payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts. Third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for medical products and 
26

services, and many third-party payors limit reimbursement for newly-approved health care products. Recent budgetary pressures in many European Union countries are also causing governments to consider or implement various cost-containment measures, such as price freezes, increased price cuts and rebates. If budget pressures continue, governments may implement additional cost-containment measures. Cost-control initiatives could decrease the price we might establish for products that we may develop or sell, which would result in lower product revenues or royalties payable to us. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Foreign Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval from the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may commence clinical trials or market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Certain countries outside of the United States have a process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application ("CTA") much like an IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a CTA must be submitted to the competent national health authority and to independent ethics committees in each country in which a company intends to conduct clinical trials. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed in that country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs and other applicable regulatory requirements.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure is compulsory for medicinal products produced by biotechnology or those medicinal products containing new active substances for specific indications such as the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, viral diseases and designated orphan medicines, and optional for other medicines which are highly innovative. Under the centralized procedure, a marketing application is submitted to the European Medicines Agency where it will be evaluated by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use and a favorable opinion typically results in the grant by the European Commission of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all European Union member states within 67 days of receipt of the opinion. The initial marketing authorization is valid for five years, but once renewed is usually valid for an unlimited period. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more “concerned” member states based on an assessment of an application performed by one member state, known as the “reference” member state. Under the decentralized approval procedure, an applicant submits an application, or dossier, and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days of receiving the reference member state’s assessment report, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states. In light of the United Kingdom’s vote in 2016 to leave the European Union, the so-called Brexit vote, there may be changes forthcoming in the scope of the centralized approval procedure as the terms of that exit are negotiated between the United Kingdom and the European Union.
Manufacturing
We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for non-clinical studies and clinical trials, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. To date, we have obtained materials for GEN-003 from third-party manufacturers who are sole source suppliers to us. We intend to identify and qualify contract manufacturers to provide the protein process development, protein production, adjuvant production, and fill-and-finish services prior to submission of a BLA to the FDA.
