Our Strategy 
Our Business
Our core business is the United States and Canada truck and parts markets, where we participate primarily in the Class 6 through 8 vehicle market segments (our “Core” markets). In the United States and Canada, nearly one in four Class 6 through 8 vehicles on the road today is an International truck, with more than a million trucks on the road. We produce over a third of all school buses used in North America. We have one of the largest commercial vehicle parts distribution networks in the United States and a captive finance company. Outside of our markets in the United States and Canada, International is one of the leading truck brands in Mexico and much of Latin America. We are also the largest independent diesel engine company in Brazil, with our wholly-owned subsidiary International Industria Automotiva da America do Sul Ltda. (“IIAA”), formerly MWM International Industria de Motores da America Do Sul Ltda. We also export trucks, buses, and engines to niche markets around the world.
We continue to take actions that we believe will improve our performance and continue to evaluate additional opportunities to enhance value for our customers. Following is a summary of our 2017 accomplishments and our expectations going forward.
Our 2017 Accomplishments 

I. | Consummated VW T&B Alliance: In February 2017, we consummated our previously announced strategic alliance with VW T&B pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 5, 2016, by and among us and VW T&B (“the Stock Purchase Agreement”), a License and Supply Framework Agreement and a Procurement JV Framework Agreement. Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, we issued and VW T&B purchased 16.2 million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $256 million at $15.76 per share, equal to a 19.9% stake in the Company (16.6% on a fully-diluted basis). 


II. | Launched products and product features: In 2017, we remained committed to focusing on our Core markets and investing in product development to increase customer value. We expect to continue to announce a new or redesigned product, on average, every four to six months through 2018. By the end of 2018, our entire portfolio will consist of newly designed trucks.

We will advance a team-based organization, enhance collaborative work environments, and utilize visual management tools.


VI. | Improve Financial Performance: Our financial performance continues to improve, due to savings from cost reduction actions and revenue growth. The Class 6-8 truck industry has improved in the second half of 2017, a trend that is expected to continue in 2018. We anticipate that 2018 will be a year of further revenue and earnings growth, combined with prudent investments to build a solid base for the longer-term. 

Our Operating Segments 
We operate in four industry segments: Truck, Parts, Global Operations (collectively referred to as "Manufacturing operations"), and Financial Services, which consists of NFC and our foreign finance operations (collectively referred to as "Financial Services operations"). Corporate contains those items that do not fit into our four segments. Selected financial data for each segment can be found in Note 14, Segment Reporting, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
Truck Segment 
Our Truck segment manufactures and distributes Class 4 through 8 trucks, buses, and military vehicles under the International and IC brands, along with production of proprietary engines, primarily in the North America markets that include the U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Our Truck segment also includes our truck export business under the International and IC brands as well as products that support the military truck product lines. The proprietary engines produced in North America are primarily used in our trucks and buses. Our strategy is to deliver the highest quality commercial trucks, buses, and military vehicles. We continue to develop our expansion markets, which includes the exportation of our truck and bus products. The Truck segment is our largest operating segment based on total external sales and revenues. 
We compete primarily in our Core markets. The Truck segment's manufacturing operations in the U.S. and Mexico consist principally of assembling components manufactured by our suppliers, as well as designing, engineering, and producing certain sheet metal components, including truck cabs, and proprietary engines. In 2013, we began offering the Cummins ISX15 engine, as well as the Cummins Selective Catalytic Reduction ("SCR") after-treatment system on certain applications of our proprietary engines. 
 9

In 2014, we began offering the Cummins ISB engine in medium and severe duty truck and bus applications, and in 2016, we began offering the Cummins ISL engine in our medium and severe duty trucks. The products we sell to the U.S. military are derivatives of our commercial vehicles and allow us to leverage our manufacturing and engineering expertise, utilize existing plants, and seamlessly integrate our engines into military vehicles. 
The Truck segment's manufacturing operations also include the production of diesel engines, which are primarily used in our trucks. The operations at the engine manufacturing facilities consist principally of the assembly of components manufactured by our suppliers, as well as machining operations relating to steel and grey-iron components. We market a portion of our commercial products directly to large fleets and the remainder through our extensive independent dealer network in North America, which offers a comprehensive range of services and other support functions to our end users. Our commercial trucks are distributed in virtually all key markets through our distribution and service network retail outlets, which is comprised of 728 outlets in the U.S. and Canada and 87 outlets in Mexico, as of October 31, 2017, and our export truck operations, primarily in Latin America. We occasionally acquire and operate dealer locations ("Dealcors") for the purpose of transitioning ownership. As of October 31, 2017, we did not operate any Dealcors. In addition, our network of used truck centers and International certified used truck dealers in the U.S. and Canada provides trade-in support to our dealers and national accounts group, and markets all makes and models of reconditioned used trucks to owner-operators and fleet buyers.
The Truck business competes on many dimensions, including customer service, price, ease-of-doing-business, uptime, and parts availability. The markets in which the Truck segment competes are subject to considerable volatility and fluctuation in response to cycles in the overall business environment. These markets are particularly sensitive to the industrial sector, which generates a significant portion of the freight tonnage hauled. Government regulation has also impacted, and will continue to impact, trucking operations as well as the efficiency and specifications of trucking equipment. 
The Class 4 through 8 truck and bus markets in North America are highly competitive. Major U.S.-controlled domestic competitors include PACCAR Inc. ("PACCAR"), which sells vehicles under the Kenworth and Peterbilt nameplates in North America, and Ford Motor Company ("Ford"). Competing foreign-controlled domestic manufacturers include Freightliner and Western Star (both subsidiaries of Daimler-Benz AG ("Mercedes Benz")), Volvo and Mack (both subsidiaries of Volvo Global Trucks), and Hino (a subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation ("Toyota")). Major U.S. military vehicle competitors include BAE Systems, General Dynamics Land Systems, and Oshkosh Corporation. In addition, smaller, foreign-controlled market participants such as Isuzu Motors America, Inc. ("Isuzu"), UD Trucks North America (a subsidiary of AB Volvo ("UD Trucks")), and Mitsubishi Motors North America, Inc. ("Mitsubishi") are competing in the U.S. and Canadian truck markets with primarily imported products. In Mexico, the major domestic competitors are Kenmex (a subsidiary of PACCAR) and Freightliner. In our primary truck export market of Latin America, we compete with many truck manufacturers, including PACCAR, Freightliner, and Mack.
Parts Segment 
Our Parts segment supports our brands of International commercial trucks, IC buses, and proprietary engines, as well as our other product lines, by providing customers with proprietary products together with a wide selection of other standard truck, trailer, and engine service parts. We distribute service parts through the dealer network that supports our trucks and engines. The Parts segment is our second largest operating segment based on total external sales and revenues.
We believe our extensive dealer channel provides us with an advantage in serving our customers by having our parts available when and where our customers require service. Goods are delivered to our customers either through one of our eleven regional parts distribution centers operated out of North America, or through direct shipment from our suppliers. We have a dedicated parts sales team within North America, as well as national account teams focused on large fleet customers. We also serve our global markets through our dedicated export business which supports customers globally in Latin America, the Middle East, northern Africa, South Africa and Russia. In conjunction with the Truck sales and technical service group, we provide an integrated support team that works to find solutions to support our customers. 
The Parts business competes on many dimensions including customer service, price, ease-of-doing-business, and parts availability. We sell a substantial amount of all-make parts for light-, medium- and heavy-duty trucks ("All-Make parts"), which are common across OEM truck manufacturers. We sell remanufactured parts through our ReNEWed product line and private label products through our Fleetrite brand name. The dealers and fleets have multiple outlets to purchase All-Make parts including other OEMs (including but not limited to Freightliner, PACCAR, Mack and Volvo), independent distributors, and traditional retail outlets, including Fleetpride, TruckPro, and National Auto Parts Association ("Napa") Auto Parts. In addition, our Uptime Parts business sells RV parts from our legacy Monaco and Workhorse businesses directly to customers. We sell a wide-range of proprietary parts, and we are subject to varying degrees of competition for many of our proprietary parts from alternative parts-providers and independent remanufacturers. 
Also included in the Parts segment is our Blue Diamond Parts, LLC ("BDP") joint venture with Ford, which manages the sourcing, merchandising and distribution of certain service parts for North America Ford vehicles. Major competitors for our BDP joint venture include Alliant Power, Jasper Engine Transmissions, and Delphi Automotive.

Global Operations Segment 
Our Global Operations segment includes businesses that derive revenue from outside our Truck and Parts segments and primarily consisting of the operations of our wholly-owned subsidiary, IIAA. IIAA is a leader in the South American mid-range diesel engine market, manufacturing and distributing mid-range diesel engines and providing customers with additional engine offerings in the agriculture, marine, and light truck markets. Additionally, we also sell our engines to global OEMs for various on-and-off-road applications. We offer contract manufacturing services under IIAA's MWM brand to OEMs for the assembly of their engines, particularly in South America. As part of the Global Operations segment, IIAA has engine manufacturing operations in Argentina. The Global Operations segment is our third largest operating segment based on total external sales and revenues.
Our commercial products are marketed through our independent dealer network, which offers a comprehensive range of services and other support functions to our end users.
From time to time, we enter into collaborative strategic relationships that allow us to generate manufacturing efficiencies, economies of scale, and market growth opportunities. The Global Operations segment has a joint venture in China with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co ("JAC"), which allows us to further our reach to global markets. The joint venture focuses on meeting the emerging needs of the Chinese commercial truck market by providing JAC with access to our Euro IV and Euro V emission standard technologies. IIAA also has a commercial agreement with an Indian company, Mahindra Heavy Engines Ltd. (Mahindra), under which MWM engines (4.8L and 7.2L) are manufactured at a plant located in the Chakan Industrial Area - city of Pune/India. The engines produced at that plant are exclusively sold by MWM outside of the Indian market, providing a cost competitive export platform in support of the Asian markets.
In Brazil, IIAA's engines compete with Cummins, Mercedes Benz, and Fiat Powertrain ("FPT") in the light and medium truck markets; Mercedes Benz, Cummins, Scania, MAN, Volvo, and FPT in the heavy truck market; Mercedes Benz in the bus market; New Holland (a subsidiary of CNH Industrial N.V.), Sisu Diesel (a subsidiary of AGCO Corporation), and Deere & Company in the agricultural market; and Scania and Cummins in the stationary market.
Financial Services Segment 
Our Financial Services segment provides and manages retail, wholesale, and lease financing of products sold by the Truck and Parts segments and their dealers. We also finance wholesale and retail accounts receivable. Substantially all revenues earned by the Financial Services segment are derived from supporting the sales of our vehicles and products. The Financial Services segment continues to meet the primary goal of providing and managing financing to our customers in U.S. and Mexico markets by providing or arranging cost-effective funding sources, while working to mitigate credit losses and impaired vehicle asset values. NFC provides wholesale financing for 100% of new truck inventory sold to our dealers and distributors in the U.S. through the customary free interest period offered by NI. At both October 31, 2017 and 2016, NFC retained floor plan financing for approximately 80% of the dealers after the expiration of any free interest period. The Financial Services segment also facilitates financing relationships in other countries to support our Manufacturing Operations.
The Financial Services segment manages the relationship with Navistar Capital, an alliance with BMO Financial Group and its wholly-owned subsidiary BMO Harris Bank N.A. (together, "BMO"), our third-party preferred source of retail and lease customer financing for equipment offered by us and our dealers in the U.S. In addition, BMO provides financing to support the sale of our products in Canada ("Navistar Capital Canada"). 
Government Contracts 
As a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to specific regulations and requirements as mandated by our contracts. These regulations include Federal Acquisition Regulations, Defense Federal Acquisition Regulations, and the Code of Federal Regulations. We are also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Management Agency and Defense Contract Audit Agency. These agencies review and assess compliance with contractual requirements, cost structure, cost accounting, and applicable laws, regulations, and standards.
A portion of our existing U.S. government contracts extend over multiple years and are conditioned upon the continuing availability of congressional appropriations. In addition, our U.S. government contracts generally permit the contracting government agency to terminate the contract, in whole or in part, either for the convenience of the government or for default based on our failure to perform under the contract.
 11

Engineering and Product Development 
Our engineering and product development programs are focused on new product introductions, enhancements of current products, quality improvements and continuous material cost-reductions across our truck and bus product lines.  We have shifted our investment focus from engine to truck by developing driver-centric designs with world class uptime and fuel economy that incorporates industry leading connected technologies utilizing Navistar’s OnCommand open architecture telematics solution. In 2017, we completed the launch of the LT™ and RH™ vehicles as well as the A26 12.4L diesel engine that leads the industry in fuel economy and is the lightest weight engine in its class.  Additionally, we introduced an updated International® LoneStar™ Series, the aerodynamic leader in the Advanced Classic segment, as well as the International® HV™ Series for the Class 8 Severe Service segment.  These product introductions are the continuation of the vehicle line overhaul which is the most significant product investment the Company has made in the last ten years.  During the first six months of 2018, we expect to complete the launch of the Horizon suite of vehicles with HV™ and MV™, an 8.0L gasoline engine in the CE Bus™, and finish the year with the launch of a brand new Class 4/5 vehicle in conjunction with General Motors.  Furthermore, we expect to complete the expansion of our powertrain offerings by finishing the implementation of the ISL engine in our medium and vocational products.  Navistar is investing in ADAS, connected technologies and electric vehicles, working with strategic suppliers and partners.  The alliance with VW T&B will further expand our capabilities in these areas.  
We participate in very competitive markets with more stringent regulatory requirements and faster technology adoptions, and we continue to believe that a strong commitment to engineering and product development is required to drive long-term growth. Our engineering and product development costs were $251 million in 2017, compared to $247 million in 2016 and $288 million in 2015. We expect that GHG phase 2 regulations announced in 2016 will drive significant investments in product development by us and our competitors.
Backlog
We define order backlogs ("backlogs") as orders yet to be built as of the end of the period. Our backlogs do not represent guarantees of purchases by customers or dealers and are subject to cancellation. 
The following table provides our worldwide backlog of unfilled truck orders as of October 31, 2017 and 2016:

 | Units | Value 
As of October 31: | | (in billions)
2017 | 16,000 | | $ | 1.4
2016 | 14,000 | | 1.1 | 

Production of our October 31, 2017 backlog is expected to be substantially completed during 2018. The backlog of unfilled orders is one of many indicators of market demand; factors such as changes in production rates, internal and supplier available capacity, new product introductions, and competitive pricing actions may affect point-in-time comparisons. 
Employees 
As our business requirements change, fluctuations may occur within our workforce from year to year. In 2017, our employee headcount was relatively stable compared to prior years. We carefully managed our attrition, approving the replacement of key positions that we believe are critical to sustaining the improved business performance seen in 2017. For more information, see Note 2, Restructurings and Impairments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In 2017, we sold our Conway, Arkansas location, a components business focused on supplying parts to our Tulsa, Oklahoma bus plant. In addition, we announced the cessation of engine production at the Melrose Park Facility in the third quarter of fiscal 2018. In 2016, we sold Pure Power Technologies, LLC, a components business focused on air and fuel systems, and our engine and foundry facilities in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 2015, we sold our foundry operations in Waukesha, Wisconsin and closed our foundry in Indianapolis, Indiana. For more information, see Note 2, Restructurings and Impairments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
The following tables summarize the number of employees worldwide as of the dates indicated and an additional subset of active union employees represented by the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America ("UAW"), and other unions, for the periods as indicated:

__________________ 

(A) | Employees are considered inactive in certain situations including disability leave, leave of absence, layoffs, and work stoppages. Included within inactive employees are approximately 300 employees and 200 employees as of October 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, represented by the National Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of Canada ("CAW") at our Chatham, Ontario heavy truck plant, which was closed in 2011 due to an inability to reach a collective bargaining agreement with the CAW. For more information, see Note 2, Restructurings and Impairments, to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for further discussion related to the risk associated with labor and work stoppages. 
Patents and Trademarks 
We seek and obtain patents on our inventions and own a significant patent portfolio. Additionally, many of the components we purchase for our products are protected by patents that are owned or controlled by the component manufacturer. We license third-party patents for the manufacture of our products and also grant licenses of our patents. The monetary royalties paid or received under these licenses are not material.
Our primary trademarks are an important part of our worldwide sales and marketing efforts and provide clear identification of our products and services in the marketplace. To support these efforts, we maintain, or have pending, registrations of our primary trademarks in those countries in which we do business or expect to do business. We grant licenses under our trademarks for consumer-oriented goods, such as toy trucks and apparel, outside the product lines that we manufacture. The monetary royalties received under these licenses are not material.
Supply 
We purchase raw materials, parts, and manufactured components from numerous third-party suppliers. To avoid duplicate tooling expenses and to maximize volume benefits, single-source suppliers fill a majority of our requirements for parts and manufactured components. Some parts and manufactured components are generic to the industry while others are of a proprietary design requiring unique tooling, which require additional effort to relocate. However, we believe our exposure to a disruption in production as a result of an interruption of raw materials and supplies is no greater than the industry as a whole. 
Our costs for trucks and parts sold consist primarily of material costs which are influenced by commodities prices such as steel, precious metals, resins, and petroleum products. We continue to look for opportunities to mitigate the effects of market-based commodity cost increases through a combination of design changes, material substitution, alternate supplier resourcing, global sourcing efforts, and hedging activities. The objective of this strategy is to ensure cost stability and competitiveness in an often volatile global marketplace. Generally, the impact of commodity cost fluctuations in the global market will be reflected in our financial results on a delayed basis, depending on many factors including the terms of supplier contracts, special pricing arrangements, and any commodity hedging strategies employed.
Impact of Government Regulation 
Truck and engine manufacturers continue to face significant governmental regulation of their products, especially in the areas of environmental and safety matters. On-highway emissions standards commenced in the U.S. on January 1, 2007, which reduced allowable particulate matter and oxides of nitrogen ("NOx") and have reached the last phase-in period effective with engine model year 2010. Meeting these emissions standards resulted in a significant increase in the cost of our products.
In 2010, the initial phase-in of onboard diagnostic ("OBD") requirements commenced for the initial family of truck engines and those products have been certified. The phase-in for the remaining engine families occurred in 2013. Canadian heavy-duty engine emissions regulations essentially mirror those of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"). In Mexico, we offer EPA 2004 and Euro IV engines that comply with current standards in that country. Mexico is lowering NOx emission standards in 2019 and 2021 to Euro V and VI levels, respectively. Navistar Heavy Duty Diesel ("HDD") engines meet the EURO V and VI with current controls technology.

Truck manufacturers are also subject to various noise standards imposed by federal, state, and local regulations. As the engine is one of a truck's primary sources of noise, we invest a great deal of effort to develop strategies to reduce engine noise. We are also subject to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act ("Safety Act") and Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards ("Safety Standards") promulgated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ("NHTSA").
Government regulation related to climate change is under consideration at the U.S. federal and state levels. Because our products use fossil fuels, they may be impacted indirectly due to regulation, such as a cap and trade program, affecting the cost of fuels. The EPA and the NHTSA issued final rules for GHG emissions and fuel economy on September 15, 2011. These began to apply in calendar year 2014 and were fully implemented in model year 2017. The agencies' stated goals for these rules were to increase the use of currently existing technologies. We are complying with these rules through use of existing technologies and implementation of emerging technologies as they become available. The EPA and NHTSA adopted a final rule on October 25, 2016 with the second phase of federal GHG emission and fuel economy regulations. This rule contains significantly more stringent emissions levels for engines and vehicles, which will require substantial investments of capital. The rule will take effect in model year 2021 and be implemented in three stages culminating in model year 2027. We continue to assess the impact of the rule on us and our stakeholders as we develop our product planning for that period.
Canada adopted its version of fuel economy and GHG emission regulations in February 2013. These regulations are substantially aligned with U.S. fuel economy and GHG emission regulations. Canada has announced it also is considering a heavy duty phase 2 GHG rulemaking aligned with EPA and NHTSA phase 2 rules.
In December 2014, California adopted GHG emission rules for heavy duty vehicles equivalent to EPA rules and an optional lower emission standard for NOx in California. California has stated its intention to lower NOx standards for California-certified engines and has also requested that the EPA lower its standards. In June 2016, several regional air quality management districts in California and other states, as well as the environmental agencies for several states, petitioned the EPA to adopt lower NOx emission standards for on-road heavy duty trucks and engines. In addition to lower NOx, EPA and the California Air Resources Board ("CARB") may consider other actions, including extending emission warranty periods. California is currently considering regulatory requirements to expand the zero emissions truck market, including the mandated sale of certain vehicles. We expect that heavy duty vehicle and engine fuel economy and GHG emissions rules will be under consideration in other global jurisdictions in the future. These standards will require significant investments of capital, will significantly increase costs of development for engines and vehicles, and will require us to incur administrative costs arising from implementation of the standards.
The EPA also issued a final rule in October 2015 that lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ozone to 70 parts per billion. This rule could lead to future lower emission standards for substances that contribute to ozone, including NOx from vehicles, at the federal and state levels.
Our facilities may be subject to regulation related to climate change, and climate change itself may also have some impact on our operations. However, these impacts are currently uncertain and we cannot predict the nature and scope of those impacts.
