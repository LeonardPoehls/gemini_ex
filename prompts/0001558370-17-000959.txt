     ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
     COMPANY OVERVIEW
     Depomed is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on pain and other central nervous system (CNS) conditions. Our current specialty pharmaceutical business includes the following six products marketed in the United States for various pain states:
· | The NUCYNTA® franchise of pain products that we acquired in April 2015 (the Nucynta Acquisition), which includes two products currently marketed in the U.S.:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NUCYNTA® ER (tapentadol extended release tablets), a product for the management of pain severe enough to require daily, around‑the‑clock, long term opioid treatment, including neuropathic pain associated with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in adults, and for which alternate treatment options are inadequate; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | NUCYNTA® IR (NUCYNTA) (tapentadol), an immediate release version of tapentadol for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gralise® (gabapentin), a once‑daily product for the management of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), that we launched in October 2011.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | CAMBIA® (diclofenac potassium for oral solution), a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug for the acute treatment of migraine attacks, that we acquired in December 2013.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Lazanda® (fentanyl) nasal spray, a product for the management of breakthrough cancer pain in cancer patients 18 years of age and older who are already receiving and who are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain, that we acquired in July 2013.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Zipsor® (diclofenac potassium) liquid filled capsules, a non‑steroidal anti‑inflammatory drug for the treatment of mild to moderate acute pain, that we acquired in June 2012.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      We actively seek to expand our product portfolio through acquiring or in‑licensing commercially available products or late‑stage product candidates that may be marketed and sold effectively with our existing products through our sales and marketing capability, which currently includes approximately 300 full‑time sales representatives.
     We currently have one product candidate in development, cebranopadol, a novel, first‑in‑class analgesic in development for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic nociceptive and neuropathic pain. We licensed the U.S. and Canadian rights to cebranopadol from Grünenthal GmbH (Grünenthal) in December 2015. We currently expect to initiate Phase 3 clinical trials for cebranopadol in 2017.
     We also have royalty and milestone producing license arrangements based on our proprietary Acuform® gastroretentive drug delivery technology with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Ironwood) and Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen Pharma). 
     In October 2013, we sold our interests in royalty and milestone payments under our license agreements in the Type 2 diabetes therapeutic area to PDL BioPharma, Inc. (PDL) for $240.5 million (the PDL Transaction).

 Mallinckrodt—Acetaminophen/Opiate Combination Products
     In November 2008, we entered into a license agreement related to acetaminophen/opiate combination products with Mallinckrodt. The license agreement grants Mallinckrodt worldwide rights to utilize our Acuform technology for the exclusive development of Mallinckrodt’s XARTEMIS XR product and MNK 155 product candidate. We have received $27.5 million in upfront fees and milestones under the agreement, including $5.0 million milestone following the FDA’s July 2013 acceptance for filing of the NDA for XARTEMIS™ XR (oxycodone hydrochloride and acetaminophen) Extended Release Tablets (CII), a $10.0 million milestone on FDA approval of XARTEMIS XR, and a $5.0 million milestone following the FDA’s May 2014 acceptance for filing of the NDA for MNK 155. We received high single digit royalties on net sales of XARTEMIS™ XR, which was launched in March 2014. Mallinckrodt ceased commercial promotion of XARTEMIS™ XR in 2015. We will receive the same high single digit royalty on net sales of MNK 155 if it is approved.      MARKETING AND SALES
     We have developed capabilities in various aspects relating to the commercialization of our marketed products, including sales, marketing, manufacturing, quality assurance, wholesale distribution, managed market contracting, government price reporting, medical affairs, compliance, and regulatory. Members of our commercial organization are also engaged in the commercial and marketing assessments of other potential product candidates.
     Our sales organization includes approximately 300 full time sales representatives. Our sales force primarily calls on pain specialists, neurologists and primary care physicians throughout most of the United States. Our marketing organization is comprised of professionals who have developed a variety of marketing techniques and programs to promote our products, including promotional materials, speaker programs, industry publications, advertising and other media.
     RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES
     Our research and development expenses were $32.6 million in 2016, $17.5 million in 2015 and $7.1 million in 2014. We expect research and development expenses in 2017 to approximate, or slightly increase from, 2016 levels. 2017 research and development expenses will consist primarily of (i) studies relating to NUCYNTA that we intend to initiate in 2017, (ii) the development work relating to cebranopadol and (iii) pediatric studies relating to NUCYNTA. We intend to initiate phase 3 studies for cebranopadol in 2018.      MANUFACTURING
     Our facility is used for office and research and development (R&D) purposes. No commercial manufacturing takes place at our facility. The R&D work includes preclinical development of pharmaceutical formulations, their characterization, and the development of pharmaceutical processes for external commercial manufacturing. The total laboratory area includes the following individual labs: Analytical Development Lab, Formulation Dry Lab, Process Lab, and Quality Control Lab.
     We are responsible for the supply and distribution of our marketed products. We have manufacturing and supply agreements with sole commercial suppliers for each of our marketed products, as follows: for NUCYNTA and NUCYTNA ER, with an affiliate of Janssen Pharma; for Gralise, with Patheon Puerto Rico Inc. (Patheon); for CAMBIA, with MiPharm, S.p.A. (MiPharm); for Lazanda, with DPT Lakewood, Inc. (DPT); and for Zipsor, with Accucaps Industries Limited (Accucaps).
     We have one qualified supplier for the active pharmaceutical ingredient in each of marketed products, and have supply agreements with the suppliers of the active pharmaceutical ingredients in each of our marketed products other than Lazanda. We also obtain polyethylene oxide, one of the excipients common to Gralise and products under development by our partners, on a purchase order basis from Dow Chemical, our sole source for polyethylene oxide. We currently have no long term supply arrangement with respect to polyethylene oxide.
     Applicable current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements and other rules and regulations prescribed by foreign regulatory authorities apply to the manufacture of our products, including products using the Acuform technology. We depend on the manufacturers of our products to comply with cGMP and applicable foreign

 *(1) Subject to six‑month pediatric patent term extension beyond scheduled expiration date.
     (2)   Patent rights are exclusively in‑licensed by the Company.
     Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technologies. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary rights, by among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and foreign jurisdictions to cover certain aspects of our technology. In addition to those patents noted on the above table, we have 11 patent applications pending in the United States. Our pending patent applications may lack priority over other applications or may not result in the issuance of patents. Even if issued, our patents may not be sufficiently broad to provide protection against competitors with similar technologies and may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or may not provide us with competitive advantages against competing products. We also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how, which are difficult to protect. We seek to protect such information, in part, through entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborative partners and others before such persons or entities have access to our proprietary trade secrets and know how. These confidentiality agreements may not be effective in certain cases. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.

 Our ability to develop our technologies and to make commercial sales of products using our technologies also depends on not infringing other patents or intellectual property rights. We are not aware of any intellectual property claims against us. However, the pharmaceutical industry has experienced extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. If claims concerning any of our products were to arise and it is determined that these products infringe a third party’s proprietary rights, we could be subject to substantial damages for past infringement or be forced to stop or delay our activities with respect to any infringing product, unless we can obtain a license, or we may have to redesign our product so that it does not infringe upon such third party’s patent rights, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds or time. Such a license may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Even if we, our collaborators or our licensors were able to obtain a license, the rights may be nonexclusive, which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property.
     From time to time, we may become aware of activities by third parties that may infringe our patents. We may need to engage in litigation to enforce any patents issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity of third‑party proprietary rights, such as litigation described in “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS”. Our issued or licensed patents may not be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction. Whether or not the outcome of litigation is favorable to us, defending a lawsuit takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns. Adverse determinations in litigation or interference proceedings could require us to seek licenses which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. If we need but cannot obtain a license, we may be prevented from marketing the affected product.
     COMPETITION
     General. We believe that we compete favorably in our markets on the basis of the safety and efficacy of our products. However, competition in pharmaceutical products is intense, and we expect competition to increase. There may be other companies developing products competitive with ours of which we are unaware. Many of our principal competitors have greater financial, sales, marketing, personnel and research and development resources than we do. Competing products developed in the future may prove superior to our products, either generally or in particular market segments. These developments could make our products noncompetitive or obsolete.
     NUCYNTA ER (tapentadol extended release tablets). NUCYNTA ER competes against other long‑acting opioid medications. Those include, among others: OxyContin® (oxycodone hydrochloride extended‑release tablets); Butrans® (buprenorphine); BelbucaTM (buprenorphine buccal film); OPANA® ER (oxymorphone hydrochloride); Hysingla® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate); Xtampza® ER (oxycodone); Zohydro® ER (hydrocodone bitartrate); Embeda® (morphine sulfate and naltrexone hcl); and numerous generically available long‑acting opioids.
     NUCYNTA (tapentadol). NUCYNTA (tapentadol) competes primarily against short‑acting opioids used for the management of moderate to severe acute pain in adults. There are numerous such medicines, including, among others: Oxaydo® (oxycodone hcl); generic oxycodone hcl; XartemisTM XR (oxycodone/APAP); generic oxycodone acetaminophen; Opana® (oxymorphone); generic oxymorphone; generic hydrocodone acetaminophen; generic hydromorphonne; generic morphine; generic tramadol hcl and generic tramadol acetaminophen. 
     Gralise for Postherpetic Neuralgia. Gabapentin is currently sold by Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) as Neurontin® and by several generic manufacturers for adjunctive therapy for epileptic seizures and for the management of PHN. In addition, Pfizer’s product Lyrica® (pregabalin) has been approved for marketing in the United States for the management of PHN, diabetic nerve pain, spinal cord injury nerve pain, fibromyalgia, and for therapy in partial onset seizures. Pfizer announced positive Phase 3 clinical trial results for its Lyrica® controlled release formulation for fibromyalgia and for PHN (in 2012 and 2014, respectively), though its epilepsy trial did not meet primary endpoint (2012). Gralise competes against these products and other neuropathic pain treatments, such as anti depressants, anti convulsants, local anesthetics used as regional nerve blockers, anti arrhythmics and opioids. Arbor Pharmaceutical, LLC.’s HorizantTM (gabapentin enacarbil extended-release tablets) product, a prodrug of gabapentin, is also marketed for the management of PHN in the U.S as well as for Restless Leg Syndrome.
     CAMBIA for the Acute Treatment of Migraine Attacks. Diclofenac, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in CAMBIA, is a NSAID approved in the United States for the acute treatment of migraine in adults. CAMBIA competes with a number of triptans which are used to treat migraine and certain other headaches. Currently, seven triptans are available generically and sold in the United States (almotriptan, eletriptan, frovatriptan, naratriptan, rizatriptan, sumatriptan and zolmitriptan). Branded competitors include Zomig® Nasal Spray, Onzetra® Xsail®, ZembraceTM
 
  10

 
SymTouchTM and Treximet®, which is a fixed dose combination product containing sumatriptan plus naproxen. Pfizer’s Relpax® patent expired in December 2016. There are other products prescribed for or under development for the treatment of migraines which are now or may become competitive with CAMBIA.
     Zipsor for Mild to Moderate Pain. Diclofenac, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Zipsor, is a NSAID that is approved in the United States for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and inflammation, including the symptoms of arthritis. Both branded and generic versions of diclofenac are marketed in the United States. Zipsor competes against other drugs that are widely used to treat mild to moderate acute pain. In addition, a number of other companies are developing NSAIDs in a variety of dosage forms for the treatment of mild to moderate pain and related indications. Other drugs are in clinical development to treat acute pain.
     Lazanda for the Management of Breakthrough Pain in Cancer Patients. Lazanda (fentanyl) nasal spray is an intranasal fentanyl drug for the management of breakthrough pain in adults (18 years of age or older) who are already routinely taking other opioid pain medicines around‑the‑clock for cancer pain. Fentanyl, an opioid analgesic, is currently sold by a number of companies for the treatment of breakthrough pain in opioid‑tolerant cancer patients. Branded fentanyl products against which Lazanda currently competes include Subsys®, which is sold by Insys Therapeutics, Inc. (Insys), Fentora® and Actiq®, which are sold by Teva, and Abstral®, which is sold by Sentynl Therapeutics Inc. (Sentynl). Generic fentanyl products against which Lazanda currently competes are sold by Mallinckrodt, Teva, and Endo. 
     GOVERNMENT REGULATION
     Product Development
     Numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries regulate our research and development activities and those of our collaborative partners. Governmental approval is required of all potential pharmaceutical products prior to the commercial use of those products. The regulatory process takes several years and requires substantial funds. If cebranopadol does not receive regulatory approval or if such an approval is delayed, our business could be materially adversely affected. We cannot be certain that the requisite regulatory approvals will be obtained without lengthy delays, if at all.
     In the United States, the FDA rigorously regulates pharmaceutical products. If a company fails to comply with applicable requirements, the FDA or the courts may impose sanctions. These sanctions may include civil penalties, criminal prosecution of the company or its officers and employees, injunctions, product seizure or detention, product recalls, and total or partial suspension of production. The FDA may withdraw approved applications or refuse to approve pending new drug applications, premarket approval applications, or supplements to approved applications.
     We may be required to conduct preclinical testing on laboratory animals of new pharmaceutical products prior to commencement of clinical studies involving human beings. These studies evaluate the potential efficacy and safety of the product. If preclinical testing is required, we must submit the results of the studies to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug Application, which must become effective before beginning clinical testing in humans.
     Some of the products we have developed have been submitted for approval under Section 505(b) (2) of the FDCA which was enacted as part of the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, otherwise known as the Hatch‑Waxman Act. Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of a NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. For instance, the NDA for Gralise relies on the FDA’s prior approval of Neurontin® (gabapentin), the immediate release formulation of gabapentin initially approved by the FDA.
     Typically, human clinical evaluation involves a time‑consuming and costly three‑phase process:
    
· | In Phase 1, we conduct clinical trials with a small number of subjects to determine a drug’s early safety profile and its pharmacokinetic pattern.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | In Phase 2, we conduct limited clinical trials with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and further evidence of safety.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

     
 
  11

 


· | In Phase 3, we conduct large‑scale, multi‑center, comparative trials with patients afflicted with a target disease in order to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product candidate, as required by the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      The FDA closely monitors the progress of each phase of clinical testing. The FDA may, at its discretion, re‑evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to patients. The FDA may also require additional clinical trials after approvals, which are known as Phase 4 trials.
     The results of preclinical and clinical testing are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA, for approval prior to commercialization. An NDA requires that our products are compliant with cGMP. Failure to achieve or maintain cGMP standards for our products would adversely impact their marketability. In responding to an NDA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application. Failure to receive approval for any products using the Acuform technology would have a material adverse effect on us.
     Foreign regulatory approval of a product must also be obtained prior to marketing the product internationally. Foreign approval procedures vary from country to country. The time required for approval may delay or prevent marketing in certain countries. In certain instances we or our collaborative partners may seek approval to market and sell certain products outside of the United States before submitting an application for United States approval to the FDA. The clinical testing requirements and the time required to obtain foreign regulatory approvals may differ from that required for FDA approval. Although there is now a centralized European Union (EU) approval mechanism in place, each EU country may nonetheless impose its own procedures and requirements. Many of these procedures and requirements are time‑consuming and expensive. Some EU countries require price approval as part of the regulatory process. These constraints can cause substantial delays in obtaining required approval from both the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities after the relevant applications are filed, and approval in any single country may not meaningfully indicate that another country will approve the product.
     Reimbursement
     Sales of pharmaceutical products in the United States depend in significant part on the extent of coverage and reimbursement from government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, as well as other third party payers. Third party payers are undertaking significant efforts to control the cost of pharmaceutical products, including by implementing cost containment measures to control, restrict access to, or influence the purchase of drugs, and other health care products and services.
     Government programs may regulate reimbursement, pricing, and coverage of products in order to control costs or to affect levels of use of certain products. Private health insurance plans may exclude or restrict coverage of some products, such as by using payer formularies under which only selected drugs are covered, variable co‑payments that make drugs that are not preferred by the payer more expensive for patients, and by employing utilization management controls, such as requirements for prior authorization or prior failure on another type of treatment.
     Fraud and Abuse
     Pharmaceutical companies that participate in federal healthcare programs are subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare “fraud and abuse,” including anti‑kickback and false claims laws. Violations of U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid).
     Federal statutes that apply to us include the federal Anti‑Kickback Statute, which prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration in exchange for or to generate business, including the purchase or prescription of a drug, that is reimbursable by a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the Federal False Claims Act (FCA), which generally prohibits knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to the federal government any false, fraudulent or medically unnecessary claims for reimbursed drugs or services. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have asserted liability under the FCA for claims submitted involving inadequate care, kickbacks, improper promotion of off‑label uses and misreporting of drug prices to federal agencies.

 Similar state laws and regulations, such as state anti‑kickback and false claims laws, may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non‑governmental payers, including private insurers. These state laws may be broader in scope than their federal analogues, such as state false claims laws that apply where a claim is submitted to any third‑party payer, regardless of whether the payer is a private health insurer or a government healthcare program, and state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to certify compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines.
     Federal and state authorities have increased enforcement of fraud and abuse laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the law and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the FCA. These laws are broad in scope and there may not be regulations, guidance, or court decisions that definitively interpret these laws and apply them to particular industry practices. In addition, these laws and their interpretations are subject to change.
     Other U.S. Healthcare Laws
     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the ACA) contains provisions that have or could potentially impact our business, including (a) an increase in the minimum Medicaid rebate to states participating in the Medicaid program on branded prescription drugs; (b) the extension of the Medicaid rebate to managed care organizations that dispense drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries; and (c) the expansion of the 340B Public Health Service Act drug pricing program (340B Program), which provides outpatient drugs at reduced rates, to include certain children’s hospitals, free standing cancer hospitals, critical access hospitals and rural referral centers.
     Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (“the Sunshine Act”) provisions, enacted in 2010 as part of ACA, require pharmaceutical manufacturers, among others, to disclose annually to the federal government (for re‑disclosure to the public) certain payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare practitioners or to teaching hospitals. State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures and impose penalties for failures to disclose. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements. As a result of the ambiguity in certain of these laws and their implementation, our reporting actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
     Our operations and business are subject to a number of other laws and regulations, including those relating to the workplace, privacy, laboratory practices and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances as well as controlled substances. In addition, state laws may also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances and may contain different or broader privacy protections than the federal provisions.
     EMPLOYEES
     As of December 31, 2016, we had 490 full‑time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
