Item 1. Business 
Overview 
 ChemoCentryx is a biopharmaceutical company developing new medications targeted at inflammatory disorders, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Each of our drug candidates focuses on a specific chemoattractant receptor that selectively blocks its negative inflammatory or suppressive response, leaving the rest of the immune system intact. Our drug candidates are small molecules, which are orally administered, offering significant quality of life benefits, since patients swallow a capsule or pill instead of having to visit a clinic for an infusion or undergo an injection. 
 In 2016 we executed on our strategy to form an alliance with a partner that could provide upfront commitments and milestones to support the clinical development of our leading two drugs to registration and pay us royalties upon sales in international markets, while we develop our own commercial infrastructure to sell directly in the United States. 
 To help us manage the wide array of opportunities, we have segmented our pipeline into early stage and late stage compounds. 
 Late Stage Compounds 
 We have chosen to focus initially on kidney disease, particularly on rare indications, where orphan drug candidates tend to enjoy a faster path to market and better reimbursement. Our leading drug candidates address areas of clear unmet need, where the current standard of care, or SOC, is insufficient to halt progression of the disease and/or where todays treatment options come with serious side effects, such as those which accompany the prolonged use of steroids: 
Avacopan (CCX168)  Complement Inhibition in Orphan and Rare Diseases 
 Avacopan (CCX168) is an orally-administered complement inhibitor targeting the C5a receptor, or C5aR, and is being developed for orphan and rare diseases, including 1) anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic auto-antibody associated vasculitis, or AAV, a devastating autoimmune disease that destroys blood vessels and can lead to kidney failure; 2) atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, or aHUS, a rare, life threatening disease; and 3) complement 3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, a debilitating kidney disease. 
 Avacopan has been granted orphan drug designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for the treatment of AAV and aHUS and by the European Medicines Agency, or EMA for the treatment of microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis, both forms of AAV. Additionally, avacopan has been granted PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, designation from the EMA, to expedite its clinical development, and to accelerate its marketing authorization. 
 Following completion of two Phase II clinical trials in patients with AAV, the results of which demonstrated that avacopan was safe, well-tolerated and provided effective steroid-free control of the disease, we launched the Phase III ADVOCATE trial in December 2016. The FDA and the EMA concurred with the design of the study. ADVOCATE is a randomized, double-blind two-arm study enrolling 300 patients in up to 200 sites in the United States and Europe. We also plan to initiate clinical endpoint trials, ones that could potentially serve as registration trials, of avacopan for the treatment of patients with C3G and aHUS in 2017. 
 CCX140  Chronic and Rare Kidney Diseases 
 CCX140 is an orally-administered inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2, has been in development for diabetic nephropathy, or DN, a form of chronic kidney disease, or CKD, and is now being developed for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, or FSGS, a rare renal disease characterized by progressive proteinuria  excess protein in the urine  and impaired renal function. 
 
3 
 
A Phase II clinical trial of CCX140 in patients with DN met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that CCX140 given orally once daily added to an SOC renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitor treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in proteinuria, beyond that achieved with SOC alone. Based on the safety and efficacy data related to reduction in proteinuria and improvement of renal function observed in the Phase II trial in DN, we plan to initiate in 2017 a clinical endpoint trial of CCX140 for the treatment of patients with FSGS, for which there are currently no FDA-approved treatments. 
 Global Kidney Health Alliance with Vifor 
 In May 2016 we announced a partnership with Vifor (International) Ltd., or Vifor, a European-based world leader specializing in kidney disease, for the commercial rights to avacopan in Europe and certain other international markets, the Avacopan Agreement. We expanded our partnership with Vifor in December 2016 with an additional deal for our other late stage drug candidate, CCX140, whereby we granted Vifor worldwide rights outside of the United States and China; and in February 2017, we announced a further deal with Vifor that harmonized the geographic commercialization rights underlying the agreements for both drug candidates. 
 We have secured $155 million in upfront cash payments and commitments, plus substantial potential milestone payments pursuant to our agreements with Vifor. Through our alliance, we maintain the commercial rights of avacopan and CCX140 in the United States and China, and also retain control of the clinical development programs for rare renal disease. Vifor gains the commercial rights for all other international markets, and will pay us double-digit tiered royalties on potential net sales. 
 At a future time defined in the contract, Vifor has an option to solely develop and commercialize CCX140 in more prevalent forms of CKD. Should Vifor later exercise the CKD option, we would receive co-promotion rights for CKD in the United States, and we estimate that the clinical development and registration process for CKD would end at approximately the same time as Orphan Drug exclusivity. 
 Early Stage Compounds 
 While the science has led us to focus initially on kidney disease, our targeted blocking system designed to stop the spread of inflammatory disease-inducing cells shows promise in other disease areas. Over time we plan to bring forward drug candidates from other areas of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and psoriasis, as well as cancer, where our drug candidate CCX872 has shown promise in a Phase I trial for non-operable pancreatic cancer. Our ability to do so will grow as we increase our scale and start to earn revenues and royalties from the commercialization of our late stage kidney disease franchise.

CCXI Early Stage Drug Candidates 
 


Late Stage Compounds 
 Avacopan (Formerly CCX168)  Complement Inhibition in Orphan and Rare Diseases 
 In our complement inhibition orphan and rare diseases program, our lead drug candidate is avacopan. Avacopan is a small molecule that targets the chemoattractant receptor known as C5aR, and is being developed for inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Avacopan blocks the activity of complement C5a, a component of the complement system and the natural ligand for C5aR. The complement system is a group of proteins that work together to destroy foreign invaders (such as bacteria and viruses), trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. The complement system must be carefully regulated so it targets only unwanted materials and does not attack the bodys healthy cells. 
 In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA has granted orphan drug designation for avacopan for the treatment of AAV, including granulomatosis with polyangiitis or Wegeners granulomatosis, microscopic polyangiitis, and Churg-Strauss syndrome, and also for aHUS. In April 2016, we announced the award of an FDA Orphan Products Development grant of $500,000 to support the clinical development of avacopan for the treatment of patients with AAV in the United States. The European Commission granted orphan drug designation for avacopan for the treatment of granulomatosis with polyangiitis or Wegeners granulomatosis and microscopic polyangiitis. 
 Our most advanced clinical program in complement inhibition of orphan and rare diseases is in Phase III development in patients with AAV. We also have conducted a pilot clinical trial in patients with aHUS. Additionally, through a Special Needs protocol in the United Kingdom, we have treated one patient with C3G. In May 2016, pursuant to the Avacopan Agreement, Vifor licensed the rights to commercialize avacopan for orphan and rare renal diseases in Europe, certain other markets outside the United States and most of Asia. In February 2017, we agreed to amend the Avacopan Agreement to expand the Vifor territories to include all markets outside the United States and China. We retain all rights to commercialize avacopan in the United States and China. 
 AAV, C3G and aHUS are all rare autoimmune diseases that are characterized by inflammation that often affects the kidneys. 
 ANCA-Associated Vasculitis (AAV) 
 AAV is a rare, severe, and often fatal autoimmune disease that is caused by autoantibodies called anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and is characterized by inflammation that can affect many different organ systems, and commonly involves the kidneys. 
 AAV affects approximately 40,000 people in the United States, with approximately 4,000 new cases each year, and more than 75,000 people in Europe, with at least 7,500 new cases each year. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 AAV is currently treated with courses of immuno-suppressants (cyclophosphamide, or CYC, or rituximab, or RTX) combined with high-dose glucocorticoid (steroid) administration. Following initial treatment, up to 30% of patients relapse within six to 18 months, and approximately 50% of all patients will relapse within three to five years. 
 
5 
 
The current SOC for AAV is associated with significant safety risks. First year mortality is approximately 11% to 18%. The single greatest cause of premature mortality is not disease related adverse events, but rather infection and other side effects that are thought largely to be a consequence of steroid administration. The multiple adverse effects of courses of steroid treatment (both initial courses and those that are repeated as a consequence of relapse) are major causes of both short-term and long-term disease and death. Such therapy-related adverse events contribute significantly to patient care costs, as well as to the diminution of quality of life for patients. 
 Role of C5a and C5aR in AAV 
 Complement C5a, acting through its receptor C5aR, is thought to play a pro-inflammatory role in AAV. Autoantibodies against neutrophil enzymes lead to the priming and activation of neutrophils. Activation of the complement pathway occurs with production of C5a, one of the most potent pro-inflammatory mediators of the complement system. C5a, through binding to its receptor C5aR, induces expression of adhesion molecules and chemotactic migration of neutrophils and other white blood cells. These accumulating adhering neutrophils initiate an inflammatory cascade in the small blood vessels by secreting pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemoattractants that lead to necrotizing vasculitis. 
 Avacopan  A Novel C5a Receptor Inhibitor 
 Avacopan is a potent and highly specific inhibitor of the human C5a receptor. Avacopan is orally bioavailable and has demonstrated an excellent preclinical safety profile, consistent with its intended chronic use in patients. Avacopan does not affect formation of the C5b-9 terminal complement complex (or membrane attack complex), unlike the anti-C5-antibody, eculizumab. Therefore, avacopan is believed not to increase the susceptibility to infections such as Neisseria meningitidis. 
 The efficacy of avacopan was demonstrated in a mouse model of the renal manifestations of AAV, which closely mimics many of the histological features of the human disease. In these studies, oral doses of avacopan completely blocked the glomerulonephritis induced by intravenous injection of anti-myeloperoxidase antibodies (one of the anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies that are implicated in AAV in humans). Levels of avacopan in the blood of these mice were comparable to levels in the blood of AAV patients who participated in our Phase II CLEAR and CLASSIC clinical trials with avacopan. 
 Clinical Development 
 Avacopan Phase I Clinical Trials 
 We have completed four Phase I clinical trials with avacopan in a total of 102 healthy subjects. These studies evaluated the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetic, or PK, and pharmacodynamic, or PD, profiles of avacopan, given orally at doses ranging from a single dose of 1 mg up to 100 mg given twice daily for five days. Avacopan was well-tolerated and appeared to be safe in these studies. No serious adverse events or dropouts due to adverse events were observed in these studies. The most commonly reported adverse events in subjects receiving avacopan in these studies were headache, diarrhea, dizziness, sore throat, upper respiratory tract infections and decrease in white blood cells. These adverse events typically were mild and dosing was not stopped as a result. 
Avacopan Phase II Clinical Trials 
 We have completed and reported positive clinical data from two Phase II clinical trials, known as the CLEAR and CLASSIC trials, with avacopan in patients with AAV. 
 CLEAR was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in 67 patients with AAV in Europe. The aim of this trial was to provide effective therapy for AAV with an inhibitor of the C5a receptor 
 
6 
 
 while reducing toxicity associated with SOC therapy by eliminating or reducing exposure to high-dose systemic steroid use. The primary safety objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of avacopan in patients with AAV on background CYC or RTX treatment. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of avacopan based on the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, or BVAS. BVAS measures AAV disease activity across all organ systems and is the most widely used and clinically validated outcome measure in AAV clinical trials. The higher the BVAS score, the higher the level of disease activity. The greater the reduction in BVAS score with treatment, the greater the disease improvement. The secondary objectives of this clinical trial included assessment of the feasibility of reducing or eliminating the use of steroids in the treatment of patients with AAV without the need for rescue steroid measures; assessment of changes in renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR, hematuria, and proteinuria with avacopan compared to SOC treatment, assessment of the effect of avacopan on health-related quality of life measurements, and evaluation of the PK and PD profiles of avacopan in patients with AAV. 
 The CLEAR trial met its primary endpoint based on the BVAS response at week 12 in patients receiving avacopan, compared to those patients receiving the high-dose steroid-containing SOC. Specifically, all treatment groups receiving avacopan demonstrated a statistically significant (P=0.002) non-inferior clinical efficacy outcome when compared to SOC. The study contained two avacopan treated groups: one group which received avacopan with a low dose of steroids (one third the steroid in the SOC group), in which the BVAS response was 86% at week 12 versus 70% for SOC; P=0.002 for non-inferiority. A separate group received avacopan without steroids; in this group the BVAS response was 81% (P=0.01 for non-inferiority). SOC treatment included a standard background immunosuppressant (CYC or RTX), given to all patients. The primary endpoint of BVAS response was prospectively defined as the proportion of patients with a decrease from baseline of at least 50% in BVAS plus no worsening in any body system. 
 Other beneficial changes were noted, including in pre-specified secondary endpoints: 
 

1) | Avacopan exhibited a more rapid onset of improvement than SOC treatment, as evidenced by beneficial changes in proteinuria (measured as urinary albumin to creatinine ratio or, UACR); also rapid beneficial reductions from baseline in BVAS, as well as reductions in the levels of MCP-1 (a marker of kidney inflammation) found in the urine;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2) | Improvements in eGFR and hematuria were seen in all three treatment groups, indicating these disease activities did not require high-dose chronic steroid administration to be controlled; and
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3) | Improvements in Quality of Life (as defined by the visual analogue scale of the EuroQOL-5D-5L) and measurements, such as physical functioning, emotional role functioning, pain and vitality based on the Medical Outcomes Survey Short Form-36 were seen in avacopan treatment groups, but not in the SOC group.

 CLASSIC was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled Phase II clinical trial in patients in the United States and Canada with either newly diagnosed or relapsing AAV who required either CYC or RTX treatment. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either placebo plus CYC or RTX plus full dose starting steroids; 10mg avacopan twice daily plus CYC or RTX plus full dose starting steroids; or 30mg avacopan twice daily plus CYC or RTX plus full dose starting steroids. The treatment period was 12 weeks, with a 12-week follow-up period. The aim of the CLASSIC trial was different from the CLEAR trial. The CLASSIC trial was mainly a regulatory and safety trial. As such, the main goal of CLASSIC was to evaluate the safety of avacopan when given with high-dose steroid-containing SOC treatment, which also includes CYC or RTX. Therefore, the primary safety objective of this clinical trial was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of avacopan in patients with AAV on background CYC or RTX treatment. The primary efficacy objective was to evaluate the efficacy of avacopan based on BVAS. The study was not sized to formally evaluate efficacy. A total of 42 patients were enrolled in this trial. 
 The CLASSIC safety study met its objectives. Avacopan was shown to be well-tolerated in patients with AAV when added to the current SOC regimen. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar across 
 
7 
 
 treatment groups in the study. While the CLASSIC safety study was not designed or powered for inferential statistical analyses on efficacy, treatment response for each cohort was assessed at week 12 using the BVAS. Results showed that the BVAS response was numerically higher in patients receiving avacopan compared to control. The 30 mg avacopan dose appeared to be most effective, based on a higher number of patients achieving early remission (based on BVAS of 0) at week four. The renal function, measured by estimated glomerular filtration rate appeared to improve most in the 30 mg avacopan group, and renal response (based on improvement in hematuria, albuminuria, and eGFR) appeared to be highest in the 30 mg avacopan group. 
 Taken together, these results suggest that avacopan, a target-specific complement inhibitor, may be able to provide effective control of the disease while eliminating chronic steroids in the treatment of AAV. Avacopan also appeared safe and well-tolerated in the trial. There were no observations that would prevent further clinical development of avacopan. We also completed the long-term toxicology program with avacopan. The results provide support for chronic dosing of avacopan in future clinical trials. 
 In May 2016, we received PRIME designation for avacopan for AAV in Europe. This was based on the assessment by the EMA that (i) AAV is a highly severe disease with high mortality; (ii) current therapies (including steroids) have partial efficacy and severe toxicity, indicating a high unmet medical need in AAV; and (iii) avacopan provides a new mechanism of action for the treatment of AAV and has the potential to significantly address the unmet medical need based on nonclinical and clinical data. We held End-of-Phase II meetings with the FDA, and Protocol Assistance/Scientific Advice meetings with the EMA in 2016, and we reached agreement on the design and scope of the Phase III registration clinical trial in AAV, which was initiated in December 2016. 
 Avacopan Phase III Clinical Trial 
 In December 2016, we initiated the ADVOCATE, or Avacopan Development in Vasculitis to Obtain Corticosteroid elimination and Therapeutic Efficacy, Phase III clinical trial. ADVOCATE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled worldwide clinical trial to include approximately 300 patients with newly diagnosed or relapsing AAV. The aim of the trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of avacopan in inducing and sustaining remission in patients with AAV. The study includes two treatment arms: the test arm contains 30mg twice-daily oral doses of avacopan and eliminates corticosteroids, and the control arm contains an avacopan-matching placebo and maintains a standard regimen of high-dose chronic steroids. All patients will also receive a standard background immunosuppressant, either CYC or RTX. Primary endpoints will be measured by BVAS, assessing disease remission at weeks 26 and 52. Other key endpoints include early remission (BVAS of 0 at week 4), quality of life, and corticosteroid-related toxicities. We believe that ADVOCATE, if successful, could initiate avacopans commercial opportunity by achieving a marketing authorization in Europe and in the United States. 
Complement 3 Glomerulopathy (C3G) 
 C3G disease is an ultra-rare disease of the kidney that is characterized by deposition of the complement fragment known as C3 in the glomeruli, or filtration units of the kidney, leading to inflammatory cell accumulation, profound kidney damage and eventual renal failure. The prevalence of C3G is estimated at two to three per million people or approximately 800 patients in the United States and about 2,000 in Europe. 
 Role of C5a and C5aR in C3G 
 While the disease name refers to complement 3, it is well known that the C5a receptor pathway, which is further downstream of C3 in the complement cascade and the target of avacopan, is an essential part of the disease causing pathology. Hence, C3 is a marker of complement activation. 
 
8 
 
Limitations of Current Therapies 
 There is currently no approved effective standard therapy for C3G. Typically, patients receive one or more non-specific immunosuppressants. Without treatment C3G invariably leads to kidney failure, and the current array of unapproved therapies at best only delays end stage renal disease, or ESRD. Kidney transplant is frequently the only option, and even after transplantation, the disease invariably returns. 
Clinical Development 
 Under the Special Needs program in the United Kingdom (similar to compassionate use protocols in the United States), in September 2015 a C3G renal transplant recipient with deteriorating kidney function initiated treatment with and has responded well to treatment with avacopan. After only one month of initial treatment with avacopan, renal function (based on estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR) stabilized. Moreover, sequential kidney biopsies taken after the patient had been on avacopan for two and seven months showed continued improvement in kidney histology based on a decrease in glomerular endocapillary proliferation and a marked reduction in the number of glomerular inflammatory macrophages, both histologic markers of disease activity as compared to the pre-treatment biopsy. 
 Prior to receiving treatment with avacopan, the C3G patient had received treatment with a wide spectrum of immunosuppressant drugs including RTX, CYC, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and glucocorticosteroids. All of these previous treatments had failed to prevent disease recurrence and progression, including new disease in the patients transplanted kidney. The patient has been successfully treated with avacopan since September 2015 and remains on treatment. These findings provide the first evidence that avacopan may be effective in treating patients with this rare and debilitating disorder for which there are no approved therapies. We plan to initiate a clinical trial to potentially support registration of avacopan for the treatment of patients with C3G in 2017. 
 Atypical Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (aHUS) 
 aHUS is a genetic, chronic, rare disease that is caused by the formation of blood clots within small blood vessels, or thrombosis, throughout the body. aHUS affects both adults and children and can progressively damage vital organs, including the kidneys, but also other organs such as the brain, heart, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and pancreas. These clots can cause serious medical problems if they restrict or block blood flow. 
 As a result of clot formation in small blood vessels, people with aHUS experience kidney damage and acute kidney failure that lead to ESRD in about half of all cases. These life-threatening complications prevent the kidneys from filtering plasma and eliminating waste products from the body effectively. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Current aHUS treatment has limited efficacy or is very expensive, and as a result, is not a practical option for many patients with aHUS. 
 Plasma exchange or infusion has decreased mortality from 50% to 25% in patients with aHUS. In patients with complement factor H, or CFH, mutations, leading to de-regulation of complement activation, plasma exchange or infusion resulted in partial or complete remission in approximately 60% of patients. Plasma exchange with immunosuppressive therapy such as steroids and azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil and RTX resulted in long-term dialysis-free survival in 60% to 70% of patients. Patients may become non-responsive to plasma exchange or infusion. It is also debatable whether renal transplantation is appropriate for patients with aHUS with ESRD as the disease recurs in approximately 50% of patients after transplantation, and graft failure occurs in 80% to 90% with recurrent disease. 
 
9 
 
Eculizumab (Soliris®) has been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with aHUS to inhibit complement-mediated thrombotic microangiopathy. Eculizumab treatment improves the disease activity based on improvement in platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase, hemoglobin, and serum creatinine levels, and need for plasma exchange, infusion, or dialysis. Eculizumab is an anti-C5 antibody, designed to block the conversion of C5 to C5a and C5b. Eculizumab needs to be administered by frequent intravenous infusion, is associated with an increased risk of Neisseria infections, and can cost approximately $500,000 per year in the United States. 
 Role of C5a and C5aR in aHUS 
 aHUS often results from a combination of environmental and genetic factors. The genes associated with aHUS provide instructions for making proteins involved in regulating the complement system. In aHUS, the regulatory proteins that prevent uncontrolled activation of the complement system are defective due to gene mutations. The resulting uncontrolled activation of the complement system, including uncontrolled production of the anaphylatoxin C5a, results in damage to the vasculature and organs such as the kidneys. 
 The fact that C5a and its receptor C5aR play a role in the pathogenesis of aHUS is supported by studies in mice. Mice deficient in CFH develop proliferative glomerulonephritis, which is improved in mice where both the CFH and C5aR genes are deleted. Mice lacking C5aR were significantly protected from functional renal disease as assessed by blood urea nitrogen levels. This is relevant as loss-of-function CFH mutations are relatively common in humans with aHUS. In addition, C5a can prime neutrophils and enhance neutrophil activation. C5a, acting on C5aR, is a potent neutrophil chemoattractant and agonist, which triggers neutrophil aggregation. Further, C5a activates endothelial cells, promoting retraction and increased permeability. 
 Avacopan, as a potent and specific inhibitor of C5aR, may therefore be effective in the treatment of patients with aHUS. Compared to intravenously administered eculizumab, avacopan is a convenient, orally administered treatment. Avacopan blocks the effect of C5a without compromising the formation of the C5b-9 terminal complement complex (or membrane attack complex), which is important in fighting Neisseria infections. Since avacopan is a small molecule, manufacturing cost is anticipated to be lower than the protein-based drugs such as eculizumab. As a small molecule, avacopan has a shorter plasma half-life (terminal half-life is approximately 70 hours) than eculizumab (272 hours, according to eculizumab prescribing information). Therefore, in the event of an undesirable adverse event requiring discontinuation of treatment, plasma clearance would be faster with avacopan. 
 Clinical Development 
 In collaboration with external scientists, we have demonstrated that avacopan, when added to the serum of patients with aHUS, reduces the size of thrombus (blood clot) formation on vascular endothelial cells that has been stimulated by the aHUS serum. The positive effect of avacopan was concentration dependent, and the magnitude of the effect was similar to that observed with eculizumab or soluble complement receptor 1. 
 Based on these encouraging in vitro findings, we have performed a Phase II pilot clinical trial with avacopan in six patients with aHUS who are on dialysis. The primary efficacy objective of the trial is to evaluate whether treatment with avacopan may reduce thrombosis formation in chronic dialysis patients with aHUS. In 2016, we reported positive data from five patients from this clinical trial. After 14 days of dosing in aHUS patients, the mean decrease in thrombus size was 83%, with 100% inhibition in three of these patients. Treatment appeared to be mechanism specific, as the thrombus size returned to baseline levels when avacopan treatment was stopped. There was one serious adverse event, not considered related to avacopan use, in a patient with long-standing cardiovascular and renal disease of cardiac asystole. Two patients in the study had relatively low platelet counts which appeared to improve on avacopan treatment. We plan to initiate a clinical trial for the treatment of patients with aHUS in 2017 to potentially support registration of avacopan in aHUS.

Avacopan Commercialization Strategy 
 We plan on building a sales infrastructure in the United States to commercialize our rare and orphan disease drug candidates such as avacopan. Given that all three orphan indications for which avacopan is being developed may have significant renal involvement, our future sales force will focus on nephrologists. Other physician specialists such as rheumatologists, involved in the diagnosis and treatment of those diseases will also be targeted by our sales forces. In territories outside of the United States, our partner Vifor will be responsible for the commercialization of avacopan. 
 In May 2016, we entered into the Avacopan Agreement with Vifor to commercialize avacopan for orphan and rare renal diseases in Europe and certain other markets. In connection with the Avacopan Agreement, we received a non-refundable upfront payment of $85.0 million, comprising $60.0 million in cash and $25.0 million in the form of an equity investment to purchase 3,333,333 shares of our common stock at a price of $7.50 per share. In February 2017, we and Vifor agreed to amend the Avacopan Agreement expand the licensed territory to include all markets outside the United States and China and we received an additional $20 million upfront cash commitment. We retain control of ongoing and future development of avacopan (other than country-specific development in the licensed territories), and all commercialization rights to avacopan in the United States and China. Upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales based milestones with avacopan, we will receive additional payments under this agreement. In addition, we will receive royalties, with rates ranging from the teens to mid-twenties, on future potential net sales of avacopan by Vifor in the licensed territories. 
 Under a prior development and commercialization agreement with Glaxo Group Limited, or GSK, an affiliate of GlaxoSmithKline, which ended in 2013, we are subject to reverse royalties to GSK of 3% on annual worldwide net sales of avacopan, not to exceed $50.0 million in total royalties. 
 CCX140  Chronic and Rare Kidney Diseases 
 Our second drug candidate in the orphan and rare disease space is CCX140, an inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2. 
 Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) 
 FSGS is a histologic lesion that is associated with the clinical presentation, in children or adults, of proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome and progressive renal insufficiency. Nephrotic syndrome is the combination of nephrotic-range proteinuria (loss of more than three grams of protein per day into the urine) with a low serum albumin level and edema. Each kidney is made up of approximately one million tiny filters called glomeruli. Glomeruli filter blood, taking out the water-like part that becomes urine and leaving protein in the blood. When glomeruli, or sections of the glomeruli become damaged or scarred (sclerosis), proteins leak into the urine (proteinuria). FSGS is understood to start with damage to podocytes, cells that wrap around capillaries of the glomerulus. Podocytes form part of the barrier that enable the glomerulus to filter the blood in a manner that retains large molecules such as proteins, while smaller molecules such as water, salts, and sugars are filtered as the first step in the formation of urine. 
 FSGS is classified as primary or idiopathic when the cause is not known, and secondary when it occurs in the setting of recognized genetic mutations or associated disease. The distinction between primary and secondary FSGS can be difficult, but it has been estimated that in 80% of the cases the etiology is unknown. Primary or idiopathic FSGS, often presents with the nephrotic syndrome. Secondary FSGS, which most often presents with non-nephrotic proteinuria and some degree of renal insufficiency, can occur in the setting of genetic vulnerability, podocyte injury due to toxins or infections, or as an adaptive response to glomerular hypertrophy or hyper-filtration. 
 Symptoms or signs of FSGS may not be noticeable early in the course of disease, presenting only when sufficiently advanced to cause edema, or when physical examination and laboratory assessment reveal 
 
11 
 
 proteinuria, low blood albumin levels, high cholesterol and/or high blood pressure. FSGS is a disease characterized by progressive glomerular scarring and is life threatening. In 20% of children and in 40% of adults, it is the underlying cause of nephrotic syndrome. When accompanied by high levels of proteinuria at the time of presentation, 50% of patients with FSGS will progress to ESRD within three to eight years. FSGS is causal for 4% of all ESRD cases. Furthermore, after kidney transplantation for primary FSGS, the recurrence rate is 40%. 
 FSGS is a rare form of chronic kidney disease that affects approximately 80,000 patients in the United States, with 5,500 to 9,500 new cases each year. FSGS attacks the glomeruli causing scarring which leads to permanent kidney damage. Progressive FSGS can lead to ESRD, ultimately requiring kidney transplant or renal dialysis and total health expenditures of hundreds of thousands of dollars each year per patient. 
 Current Treatment Approaches 
 There are no approved drugs for the treatment of FSGS. Moreover, current treatment approaches are not very effective in halting the disease. Usually, treatments for FSGS include renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system blockers, corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, diuretics and diet change (reducing sodium and protein intake). 
 Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, or RAAS, inhibition reduces proteinuria and slows progression in proteinuric kidney diseases, and is commonly used for treatment of secondary FSGS. Whether or not this is effective in primary FSGS is unknown. Patients with histologic evidence of primary FSGS who have nephrotic syndrome are usually offered disease-modifying therapy with glucocorticoids and other immunosuppressive drugs. However, in the absence of nephrotic range proteinuria (>3.5 g/day), administration of steroids or other immunosuppressive drugs is generally not recommended. In many cases, an overall course of treatment of at least six months is required and complete remission may not be attained for 12 months or longer. Shorter courses (two months or less) result in much lower remission rates (20% to 30%). 
 Patients with little or no reduction in protein excretion at 12 to 16 weeks are considered steroid resistant. Initial therapy of steroid-dependent or steroid-resistant FSGS consists of a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine or tacrolimus) with or without low-dose prednisone. Among those unresponsive to this combination, or among those with substantially reduced eGFR (<40 mL/min per 1.73 m2), mycophenolate mofetil in combination with glucocorticoids is recommended. In addition, in patients at increased risk for glucocorticoid-associated toxicity (e.g., obese patients, diabetic patients, patients with severe osteoporosis, patients >70 years of age), cyclosporine or tacrolimus with or without low-dose prednisone has been recommended, although data evaluating this strategy are limited. Calcineurin inhibitors must be used with caution in patients with impaired renal function because of the nephrotoxicity of these drugs, and some authors recommend avoiding these in subjects whose kidney function approaches renal failure, i.e., subjects with an eGFR of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 As described above, there are no effective therapies available for FSGS. Control of hypertension, particularly with angiotensin inhibitors, is supportive but does not address the underlying pathology. Glucocorticoids and immunosuppressants are also used, but the results have been inconsistent. The increased risk of infection associated with these agents is a significant concern. Histologic recurrence in renal transplants is high, with high levels of proteinuria portending a poor renal prognosis. 
 Role of CCR2 inhibition in FSGS 
 There is evidence that the chemokine receptor known as CCR2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of FSGS. CCR2 is a major driver of monocyte migration and activation, and has been shown to mediate renal interstitial inflammation and tubular atrophy in a number of chronic renal diseases by recruiting monocytes to the renal interstitium. Further, studies have shown that the degree of protein excretion correlates with urine MCP-1 levels, 
 
12 
 
 one of the signature ligands of MCP-1 and a biomarker of inflammation, and the infiltration of immune cells called macrophages into the kidney in patients with chronic kidney disease. Experiments performed in vitro have added to the mechanistic rationale for the notion that CCR2 is an important driver of FSGS. Proteinuria is the hallmark characteristic of FSGS, and in vitro experiments have found that tubular epithelial cells release MCP-1 (CCL2, the ligand of CCR2) when exposed to serum proteins on the inside of the tubules. Clinically, in children with FSGS, urinary MCP-1 levels correlate with the degree of proteinuria. 
 Blocking CCR2 provided significant and rapid renal protection in two distinct models of FSGS, as measured both by reduction in proteinuria and improvement in multiple histological parameters, and it thus represents a novel and mechanistically distinct approach for the treatment of FSGS. 
 In the 5/6 remnant kidney model, mice had a rapid reduction in protein excretion when treated with a CCR2 inhibitor and a RAAS inhibitor. Combining a CCR2 inhibitor with a RAAS inhibitor reduced the protein excretion by 91%. The protective effects were evident within one week of treatment and were maintained for the duration of the study (six weeks). The same renal protective effects of CCR2 blockade were seen in the adriamycin nephropathy model. Administration of adriamycin caused significant proteinuria, which was significantly reduced by the combination of a CCR2 inhibitor and a RAAS inhibitor after two weeks of treatment. Histological parameters also improved with the combination of the CCR2 inhibitor and a RAAS inhibitor; these included reduced glomerular hypertrophy, glomerular sclerosis, kidney fibrosis, and mesangial expansion and increased podocyte density 
 Clinical Development 
 Our clinical development strategy was to first assess the safety and tolerability of CCX140 in healthy subjects, then in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function, and finally to evaluate the drug in patients with DN. As a precursor to our clinical trials in patients with DN, we completed a 159-patient randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the safety and tolerability of CCX140 in patients with type 2 diabetes, one of the most common causes of nephropathy. We also subsequently completed a 332-patient randomized Phase II clinical trial to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CCX140 in patients with DN. 
 Based on safety and encouraging efficacy signals related to reduction in proteinuria and stabilization/improvement of renal function observed in the Phase II study in patients with DN, we plan to initiate a clinical endpoint study of CCX140 for the treatment of patients with FSGS. 
 CCX140 Phase I Clinical Trials 
 We completed four Phase I clinical trials in 118 healthy volunteers. A CCX140 dose range of 0.05 to 15mg was studied. CCX140 was generally well-tolerated with no SAEs observed in these Phase I clinical trials. The PK profile was supportive of once-daily oral dosing of CCX140 in the Phase II clinical trials in patients with type 2 diabetes and in patients with DN. 
CCX140 Phase II Clinical Trial in Type 2 Diabetes 
 Our Phase II clinical trial was designed to demonstrate safety of CCX140 in patients with type 2 diabetes and normal renal function, and to examine the effect of CCX140 on glycemic indices. We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo and active controlled clinical trial in 159 patients with type 2 diabetes on a stable dose of metformin for at least eight weeks, with 32 patients receiving placebo, 32 receiving pioglitazone hydrochloride (an approved therapeutic for type 2 diabetes serving as the active control), 63 receiving 5mg of CCX140 and 32 receiving 10mg of CCX140 orally once-daily for 28 days. 
 The clinical trial met its primary objective by demonstrating the safety and tolerability of CCX140 in these patients. In addition, CCX140 showed encouraging signs of biological activity based on a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c, a marker of glycemic control, for the 10mg dose group.

CCX140 Phase II Clinical Trial in Diabetic Nephropathy 
 We have completed a Phase II clinical trial in patients with DN. A total of 332 patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. The goals of this clinical trial were to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CCX140 in patients with DN. The primary efficacy objective was evaluation of the effect of CCX140 on albuminuria. Secondary efficacy objectives were evaluation of the effect of CCX140 on HbA1c and eGFR. The three treatment groups consisted of SOC, a RAAS inhibitor, plus placebo (control group), 5mg and 10mg of CCX140 once-daily plus SOC. The treatment duration was up to 52 weeks, with a four-week follow-up period. Patients with residual albuminuria, despite being on a stable therapeutic dose of a RAAS inhibitor were included in this clinical trial. The key efficacy endpoint was a change from baseline in first morning UACR, a major indicator of renal health. 
 The Phase II trial met its primary endpoint by demonstrating that treatment with 5mg of CCX140 given orally once daily added to a SOC regimen of RAAS inhibitor treatment resulted in a statistically significant (p=0.01) improvement in UACR, beyond that achieved with SOC alone. The maximum treatment effect (24% reduction) was reached at 12 weeks, and sustained reduction in albuminuria induced by CCX140 relative to SOC alone observed over the full year (UACR at each one of the ten time points over the 52-week treatment period in the patients who received 5mg CCX140 continuously for 52 weeks, were below those of the SOC alone group). A dose of 10mg CCX140 per day did not provide more improvement in albuminuria as compared to the 5mg dose. CCX140 did not affect systematic blood pressure, suggesting that the beneficial effect of CCX140 is mediated locally in the kidney micro-environment, possibly through a beneficial reduction in renal inflammation. CCX140 was well-tolerated with a low overall dropout rate over the 52-week treatment period (10%). No safety issues were observed that would prevent further clinical development of CCX140 in DN. 
 In 2017, we plan to initiate a controlled clinical trial of CCX140 in patients with FSGS. Reduction in proteinuria is widely considered as a beneficial outcome in the treatment of CKD including FSGS, and many experts regard the reduction of proteinuria as the likely registration endpoint for a new therapeutic in FSGS. 
 CCX140 Commercialization Strategy 
 We plan on building a sales infrastructure in the Unites States to commercialize our rare and orphan disease product candidates such as CCX140. FSGS patients are primarily being treated by nephrologists in so-called centers of excellence in renal diseases. Similar to avacopan, we plan on establishing a commercial presence focused on the nephrology arena. In certain territories outside of the United States our partner Vifor will be responsible for the commercialization of CCX140. 
 In December 2016, we entered into a second collaboration and license agreement with Vifor, the CCX140 Agreement, pursuant to which we granted Vifor exclusive rights to commercialize CCX140 in rare renal diseases in markets outside the United States and China. We retain marketing rights for rare renal disease in the United States and China, while Vifor has commercialization rights in the rest of the world. We will be responsible for the clinical development of CCX140 in rare renal diseases, while sharing the cost of such development with Vifor. In connection with the CCX140 Agreement, we received non-refundable upfront commitment totaling $50 million and will receive additional payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales based milestones, as well as tiered double-digit royalties on potential net sales of CCX140 in the licensed territories. Under the CCX140 Agreement, Vifor retains an option to solely develop and commercialize CCX140 in more prevalent forms of chronic kidney disease, or CKD. Should Vifor later exercise the CKD option, we would receive co-promotion rights in CKD in the United States. 
 Early Stage Compounds 
 Immuno-Oncology and Other Therapeutic Areas 
 In oncologic disease, tumors can profoundly subvert inflammatory and effector immune responses. In the tumor cellular microenvironment, CCR2 bearing cells are thought to largely have an immunosuppressive 
 
14 
 
 behavior. These are the so-called myeloid derived suppressor cells, or MDSCs. These cells effectively help tumors hide from the bodys cytotoxic immune response to tumor cells. Inhibiting CCR2, and thus the MDSCs controlled by CCR2, could therefore lead to the liberation of the cytotoxic immune response against the tumor cells, tumor shrinkage, and improved patient survival. We have an ongoing clinical development program for the treatment of patients with advanced pancreatic cancer with our drug candidate CCX872, our second inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2. 
 Understanding Pancreatic Cancer 
 Pancreatic cancer is a rare but deadly cancer. It is the 15th most common cancer worldwide but the fourth highest cause of cancer-related death. In the United States in 2014, approximately 46,000 people are expected to develop pancreatic cancer, and 40,000 of those patients are expected to succumb to the disease. Primarily due to the aging of the population, the incidence of pancreatic cancer is predicted to increase to 62,000 new cases per year by 2030. Pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which represents 85% of all pancreatic cancers, is characterized by rapid progression and a dismal prognosis. Because of the deep location of the pancreas in the abdomen and the lack of markers of early disease, most cancers remain asymptomatic until they obstruct the biliary tract, which usually occurs with tumors of the pancreatic head, or until they become metastatic. Hence, less than 15% of patients initially present with a resectable cancer (stage 1 or 2), while the majority of patients have either a locally advanced, nonresectable, stage 3 cancer or a metastatic, stage 4 cancer at the time of diagnosis. Even with the best current treatment, the median overall survival of these patients is less than one year, an outlook that has remained largely unchanged over the last few decades. 
 The dismal prognosis of this cancer results from the combination of the late diagnosis, the early metastatic dissemination, and resistance to most chemotherapies. The main factors explaining this resistance to treatment include a very high rate of activation of the Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene, or KRAS, mutations, a propensity for both local extension and distal spreading, the presence of a dense stromal tissue surrounding the tumor that results in a hypoxic, hypovascularized environment with high interstitial pressure, which may impede drug delivery, and ultimately the loss of immune control. Therapeutic interventions that improve the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer are urgently needed. 
 Limitations of Current Therapies 
 Current SOC regimens are not only limited by modest efficacy but also by significant toxicity. For patients with nonresectable cancer (stage 3 or 4), FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, leucovorin, and 5-fluorouracil) or a combination of gemcitabine and nanoparticle albumin-bound-, or nab-, paclitaxel are considered standard treatments, but the median overall survival of patients remains less than one year. Further, these treatments often are poorly tolerated. FOLFIRINOX is associated with a high rate of Grade 3-4 adverse events, can rarely be administered for more than six months, and is mostly prescribed to patients with excellent performance status. Frail, elderly patients usually receive palliative treatment. Extensive research is ongoing to identify novel agents with improved efficacy and a reduced toxicity profile, including chemotherapies with improved formulations of currently available agents, therapies targeted against specific oncogenic pathways, or cancer vaccines. 
 Role of CCR2 in Pancreatic Cancer 
 Human pancreatic tumors are characterized by a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment. In the tumor cellular microenvironment, CCR2 bearing cells are thought to be largely of an immunosuppressive behavior; these are the so-called MDSCs. These cells effectively help tumors hide from the bodys cytotoxic immune response to tumor cells. Inhibiting CCR2, and thus the MDSCs controlled by CCR2, could therefore lead to the liberation of the cytotoxic immune response against the tumor cells, and improved patient survival. 
 Clinical Development 
 CCX872 is a potent and selective inhibitor of the human CCR2. The objective of using a CCR2 inhibitor such as CCX872 is to reduce the suppressive myeloid cell presence in the tumor and, in doing so, slow the 
 
15 
 
 progression of disease in these patients. We believe that CCX872 may represent a promising novel immunotherapeutic approach. Drugs that block CCR2 have shown evidence of activity in patients with pancreatic cancer as well as in a mouse orthotopic pancreatic cancer model. 
 Phase I Clinical Trials 
 We completed a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial in healthy subjects. This clinical trial was a combined single-and-multiple-ascending dose clinical trial in 40 subjects. The clinical trial was conducted in the Netherlands. CCX872 doses of 3mg, 10mg, 30mg, 100mg and 300mg were given as a single dose in the first study period and once-daily doses for seven days in the second study period. Data showed that CCX872 was well-tolerated and appeared to be safe in healthy volunteers at all dose levels studied. There were no SAEs or dropouts due to adverse events in the trial. The most common adverse events reported by subjects receiving CCX872 in the multi-dose period were dizziness, diarrhea, and headache. These events typically were mild in intensity and did not result in dosing discontinuation. The results showed that CCX872 was safe and well-tolerated. CCX872 was able to block CCR2 in the circulation, and it had a predictable dose-linear PK profile. 
 Our Phase Ib study for CCX872 explores a novel approach (CCR2 inhibition) for the treatment of patients with stage 3 and 4 pancreatic cancer. Beyond the field of pancreatic cancer, the results of this study will also advance our understanding of the role of chemokines in solid tumors and of the potential for chemokine receptor inhibitors as therapeutic options in cancer patients when combined with SOC regimens. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of orally administered CCX872 with respect to disease progression in patients with nonresectable pancreatic cancer being treated with FOLFIRINOX, one of the current SOC treatments for this disease. Enrollment in the trial occurred in two stages, Part A (single dose) and Part B (multiple dose). Part A has been completed. Results showed that a single oral dose of 150-mg CCX872 was well-tolerated and safe in this study. The PK profile in patients with pancreatic cancer was in line with the PK profile observed in healthy volunteers in the previous clinical trial. CCX872 was effective in blocking CCR2 in circulating cells as measured by CCR2 occupancy and internalization assays, as well as migration assays. Successful completion of Part A led to initiation of Part B. 
 Enrollment of 50 patients in Part B was completed in 2016. In January 2017, we reported 24-week progression-free survival, or PFS data, 12-week objective response rate, or ORR, data , and initial overall survival data. PFS rate was 57% at week 24 in the primary analysis population and median PFS was 179 days. ORR was 37% at week 12 in the primary analysis population. Overall survival rate was 52% at week 48 in the primary analysis population and median survival time was 11.5 months. The longest ongoing CCX872 treatment period for a patient in the study to date is 73 weeks (and continuing). CCX872 has been well-tolerated in the clinical trial. There has been no apparent additional safety burden of combining CCX872 with FOLFIRINOX, as evidenced by an incidence and rate of adverse events in the trial to date consistent with data reported historically for FOLFIRINOX on its own. We will continue to follow the patients to assess overall survival later in 2017. 
 Preclinical Development in Immuno-Oncology 
 One of the most exciting advances in oncology in decades is the recent observation that modifiers of the activity of the patients own immune system can profoundly enhance their response to chemotherapy. 
 A critical cellular component of this response are the MDSCs, which inhibit the activity of the effector T cells, and thus dampen the immune response of the body to the tumor. These MDSCs express chemokine and chemoattractant receptors that they use to migrate to the tumor microenvironment. We believe that blocking these chemokine receptors with small molecule antagonists could be effective either as stand-alone therapies for certain cancers or by synergistic effect when given in combination with traditional chemotherapies or other immunotherapies. 
 We have discovered small molecule inhibitors that target these chemoattractant receptors, and one or more of them may be developed in certain oncology indications targeting both solid and liquid tumors. 
 
16 
 
In our preclinical research, we are conducting studies with various chemokine receptor inhibitors in combination with check point inhibitors, such as those inhibiting the programmed death-ligand 1, or PD-L1, pathway, that we believe may result in a greater anti-tumor effect, than with check-point inhibition alone. 
 A growing body of data suggests that a number of chemokine receptors, including, but not limited to, CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, and CXCR2, may play diverse roles in cancer growth, cancer metastasis, cancer angiogenesis, or the composition of the tumor microenvironment. Given the potential role of chemokine receptors in cancer cell survival, the combination of chemokine receptor antagonists with traditional chemotherapeutic agents or with immunotherapy, such as programmed cell death protein-1, or PD-1, or PD-L1 inhibitors is an attractive strategy because it may result in greater efficacy and/or allow dose reductions of the chemotherapeutic drugs and therefore limit systemic side effects. 
 Other Therapeutic Areas 
 Also in our CCR2 program, in October 2016, we announced the presentation of data from in vivo models of NASH, a severe type of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease caused by chronic inflammation that can lead to fibrosis (scarring) of the liver, with CCX872, a selective orally administered inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR2, at the October 2016 American College of Gastroenterology Annual Meeting. CCX872 demonstrated significant reductions in liver fibrosis when compared to either placebo or a separate compound which is a dual inhibitor of the chemokine receptors CCR2 and CCR5 currently in clinical development by another party. The data suggest a potential application of CCX872 for the treatment of patients with NASH. NASH affects 3% to 5% of the U.S. population. 
Other Inflammatory and Autoimmune Diseases 
 Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or IBD/Crohns Disease and Ulcerative Colitis 
 IBD refers to two diseases  Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis  both characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohns disease can cause inflammation in any part of the digestive tract but often affects the tail end of the small intestine. Ulcerative colitis is inflammation of the large intestine. Both Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic and recurring inflammatory conditions. Researchers believe that these conditions occur when the bodys inflammatory cells become over-reactive and mount a destructive inflammatory response. Current treatments for IBD include steroids, 5-aminosalicylic acids, immunosuppressive therapies, such as azathioprine or biologic agents such as TNF-a inhibitors and integrin inhibitors, such as the anti-a4b7 antibody, vedolizumab, and when all else fails, surgery. 
 Vercirnon 
 Our drug candidate vercirnon is intended to control the inflammatory response underlying IBD by targeting the chemokine receptor known as CCR9. In adults, CCR9 is found primarily on a population of T cells, a subset of the bodys inflammatory cells, which migrate selectively to the digestive tract. It is believed that when CCR9s ligand, CCL25 (also known as TECK), is over-expressed, the migration of T cells to the small and large intestine causes persistent inflammation that may result in Crohns disease or ulcerative colitis. 
 We completed nine clinical trials with vercirnon in a total of 785 subjects, including five Phase I clinical trials (three in the United States and two in the United Kingdom), one Thorough QT study in the United States (an assessment of cardiovascular safety which is required for regulatory approval), and three Phase II clinical trials (one in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States, one in Finland and one (PROTECT-1) in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, the Netherlands, Poland, South Africa, Sweden and the United Kingdom). We completed our PROTECT-1 Phase II clinical trial in 436 patients with moderate-to-severe Crohns disease in 2009. Results from this clinical trial indicated that vercirnon was effective in inducing a clinical response over a 12-week treatment 
 
17 
 
 period. The results also indicated that vercirnon was effective in maintaining clinical remission over an additional 36-week treatment period. Vercirnon was safe and well-tolerated in all clinical trials completed to date. Data from the first of four Phase III clinical trials, the SHIELD-1 study, conducted by our former collaboration partner, GSK, investigating vercirnon in 608 patients with moderate-to-severe Crohns disease, did not achieve the primary endpoint of improvement in clinical response and the key secondary endpoint of clinical remission. Results from SHIELD-4, a second induction study showed higher Crohns disease activity index, or CDAI, response and remission rates with 500mg vercirnon twice daily compared to 500mg once daily. This is in contrast to the lack of dose response observed in the SHIELD-1 trial, and the response observed in the population of patients who completed 12 week dosing in SHIELD-4 was similar to the positive results from the Phase IIb PROTECT-1 clinical trial conducted by us. We are evaluating a potential future development and funding strategy for vercirnon. The assets, including vercirnon, all clinical study data, and IND are wholly owned by us. 
 Under the prior development and commercialization agreement with GSK which ended in 2013, we are subject to reverse royalties to GSK of 3% on annual worldwide net sales of vercirnon only if a regulatory agency were to deem one of GSKs SHIELD trials to be a pivotal Phase III clinical trial. 
 Second Generation CCR9 Inhibitor CCX507 
 Also in the area of IBD, our drug candidate CCX507 builds on our expertise in the area of CCR9 inhibitors and IBD. CCX507 is a second generation CCR9 inhibitor. CCX507 is selective for CCR9 relative to all other chemokine receptors, orally bioavailable, and has an excellent preclinical safety profile. CCX507 has a greater potency towards CCR9 than vercirnon. We completed Phase I clinical development, which demonstrated that CCX507 was safe and well-tolerated, and blocked CCR9 on circulating leukocytes. Additionally, preclinical data of CCX507 in combination with an anti-a4b7 antibody or anti-TNF showed that combined treatment reduced the severity of colitis better than monotherapy with either drug alone. We plan to move CCX507 forward to Phase II clinical trials, potentially in conjunction with a strategic partner. 
Th17 Driven Diseases and CCR6 
 One of the most intriguing areas of current research in immunology involves a newly discovered type of helper T cells known as Th17 cells. There is a large amount of preclinical and clinical data that implicate Th17 cells, as well as Interleukin 17, or IL-17, in the development of a large number of autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and multiple sclerosis. 
 Activated Th17 cells isolated from chronically inflamed human tissues produce high levels of TNF-a and other cytokines. A hallmark of Th17 cells is that they express high levels of the chemokine receptor known as CCR6, which is not found on Th1 and Th2 cells. High levels of the CCR6 chemokine ligand, CCL20, have been found in psoriatic skin, in rheumatoid arthritis joint biopsies, and in asthmatic lungs. 
 We believe that these are potential therapeutic opportunities for a CCR6 inhibitor. We have produced several unique CCR6 inhibitor leads, which are now being optimized through medicinal chemistry approaches. 
 We have shown in preclinical models that an orally bioavailable, small molecule inhibitor of the chemokine receptor known as CCR6 confers protection against IL17-mediated inflammation. We have generated potent orally bioavailable CCR6 inhibitors that inhibit CCL20-mediated chemotaxis of both human and mouse CCR6-positive cells. The utility of CCR6 inhibition was tested in preclinical models of psoriasis, and demonstrated that animals treated with our CCR6 inhibitor were protected against imiquimod induced skin thickening. Histological analysis of the skin confirmed the protective effect of our CCR6 inhibitor compared to an aqueous vehicle control and significantly reduced ear-thickening induced by intradermal injections of Interleukin 23, or IL-23, a cytokine that is important for the terminal differentiation and pathogenicity of Th17 cells. 
 The mechanism of action for CCR6 inhibitors is different from other therapeutics targeting IL-17, because inhibition of CCR6 disrupts the recruitment of infiltrating leukocytes into the epidermis upon skin damage, 
 
18 
 
 thereby protecting against epidermal hyperplasia, or an abnormal increase in the number of cells on the skin. Thus, pharmacological inhibition of CCR6 with an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor mitigates IL-17-driven inflammation in psoriasis models, and its distinct mechanism of action suggests it may offer additional efficacy when added to current SOC. 
 Recent work by others in the field has also revealed potential roles for CCR6 inhibitors in the treatment of colorectal cancer, or CRC. Specifically, in a mouse CRC model, mice that are genetically deficient in CCR6, as well as wild-type mice treated with a CCR6 inhibitor develop fewer intestinal polyps.

 Nonetheless, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. 
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have a material adverse impact on us. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine priority of invention. 
 Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Millennium, has obtained certain United States patents which include claims to small molecules that modulate CCR9, compositions thereof, and methods of using them to treat conditions such as IBD. Millennium may contend that the claims of these patents cover our patented vercirnon drug candidate. We believe that our activities related to vercirnon are currently exempt from patent infringement liability because these activities are strictly limited to obtaining information for regulatory approval. However, if and when our vercirnon related activities extend beyond those related to seeking regulatory approval, such as, for example, if and when we commercialize vercirnon, Millennium might then commence an infringement action against us based on these patents and/or other related patents that it may be granted in the future. If Millennium elects to sue us, we believe that we may have viable defenses to any such infringement suit. However, we cannot assure you that the relevant court would find in our favor with respect to such defenses.

Competition 
 We compete in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that address AAV, aHUS, DN and other renal diseases, IBD, rheumatoid arthritis, other autoimmune diseases and inflammatory disorders, and cancer. We face significant competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are also researching and selling products designed to address these markets. Many of our competitors have materially greater financial, manufacturing, marketing, research, and drug development resources than we do. Large pharmaceutical companies in particular have extensive expertise in preclinical and clinical testing and in obtaining regulatory approvals for drugs. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection with respect to potentially competitive products or technologies. These organizations may also establish exclusive collaborative or licensing relationships with our competitors. 
 It is possible that our competitors will develop and market drugs that are less expensive and more effective than our drug candidates, or that will render our drug candidates obsolete. It is also possible that our competitors will commercialize competing drugs before we or our partners can launch any drugs developed from our drug candidates. 
 Avacopan, our C5aR inhibitor, if approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of AAV, might compete with current treatments, such as steroids, CYC, RTX, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate mofetil. If avacopan were approved for the treatment of aHUS, it would potentially compete with eculizumab (Soliris®). 
 CCX140, our first CCR2 inhibitor, if approved for marketing by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of DN, might compete with treatments commonly used for type 2 diabetes and hypertension patients, RAAS inhibitors, are commonly prescribed treatments used to reduce blood pressure and preserve kidney function, reducing the progression of DN. 
 CCX872, our second CCR2 inhibitor, if approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies for the treatment of pancreatic cancer, might compete with treatments that are currently available, such as chemotherapeutic drugs including gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, or new treatments in development. 
 Our CCR9 small molecule inhibitors such as CCX507 and vercirnon for the treatment of IBD, might compete against existing IBD treatments such as Remicade, Humira, and other TNF-a inhibitors, anti-a4b7 antibodies such as vedolizumumab (Entyvio), immunomodulatory drugs and steroids and potentially against other novel IBD drug candidates that are currently in development. Remicade is a humanized monoclonal antibody targeted to TNF-a, indicated for the treatment of Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Humira, a similar drug, is also a human monoclonal antibody that acts as a TNF-a inhibitor. Marketed by AbbVie in the United States and Europe, Humira is approved for the treatment of Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis. Biosimilar drugs to Humira, for example, may also become available to treat patients with IBD. 
 Many of these currently approved treatments have notable and common adverse events including liver and bone marrow toxicity, renal toxicity, pneumonitis, immunosuppression, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases and infections. 
 We expect that competition among any of our drugs approved for sale will be based on various factors, including drug safety and efficacy, prevalence of negative side effects, reliability, ease of administration, availability, price, insurance coverage and reimbursement status and patent position. We believe that our ability to compete depends largely upon our ability to research, develop and commercialize our existing and future drug candidates. Further, we need to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel, obtain patent protection, 
 
21 
 
 develop proprietary technology or processes and secure sufficient capital resources for the substantial time period between technological conception and commercial sales of drugs. Our ability to compete will also be affected by the speed at which we are able to identify and develop, conduct clinical testing and obtain regulatory approvals of our drug candidates. Potential competitors may develop treatments that are more effective and/or safer than our drug candidates or that would make our technology and drug candidates obsolete or non-competitive.
Established pharmaceutical companies that currently sell or are developing drugs in our markets of interest include AbbVie, Alexion, Amgen, AstraZeneca, Biogen Idec, Bayer, Elan, GlaxoSmithKline, Johnson & Johnson, Merck, Merck Serono, Roche/Genentech, Takeda, Novartis, Pfizer, Sanofi and Teva. In addition, in some instances we may face competition from companies that sell generic versions of approved drugs that are part of the current SOC. Many or all of these established competitors are also involved in research and drug development regarding various chemokine receptors. Pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies which are known to be involved in chemokine and chemoattractant research and related drug development include Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Takeda, Sanofi, Incyte, Alexion, Allergan, Omeros, Dimerix, X4 Pharmaceuticals, Biolinerx, Akari Therapeutics and UCB Pharma among others. These companies and others also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, and in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 Manufacturing 
 Our current drug candidates are manufactured using common chemical engineering and synthetic processes from readily available raw materials. We rely on contract manufacturing organizations to produce our drug candidates in accordance with the FDAs current good manufacturing practices, or cGMP, regulations for use in our clinical trials. However, we currently rely on a single source supplier for our requirements of the API of each of these other drug candidates. The manufacture of pharmaceuticals is subject to extensive cGMP regulations, which impose various procedural and documentation requirements and govern all areas of record keeping, production processes and controls, personnel and quality control. We expect to rely on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of clinical and commercial supplies of our compounds. 
 We purchase quantities of our drug candidates from our contract manufacturers pursuant to purchase orders that we place from time to time. If we were unable to obtain sufficient quantities of drug candidates or receive raw materials in a timely manner, we could be required to delay our ongoing clinical trials and seek alternative manufacturers, which would be costly and time-consuming. We believe we have multiple potential sources for our contract manufacturing. 
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, export and import of our drug candidates. 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the FDAs implementing regulations. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the drug development process, clinical testing, the approval process or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before our drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDAs good laboratory practices, or GLP, regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
22 
 

 | submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug, or IND, application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of a new drug application, or NDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing, sale or shipment of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Once a pharmaceutical drug candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing the clinical trials to commence or not allowing the clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. An independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, requirements, including the requirements for informed consent. 
 All clinical research performed in the United States in support of an NDA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to FDA in support of an NDA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial. We conducted our PROTECT-1 clinical trial solely at foreign clinical research sites, and we did not have authorization from the FDA under an IND to conduct that clinical trial in the United States. We designed the clinical trial to comply with FDA regulatory requirements for the use of foreign clinical data in support of an NDA, and the data were submitted from the PROTECT-1 clinical trial in support of future U.S. marketing application for vercirnon. We are pursuing a similar development strategy for CCX140 which has recently completed a Phase II clinical trial in patients with DN in Europe. One of the Phase II clinical trials with avacopan in patients with AAV has also been conducted in Europe. The second clinical trial was conducted in North America. We have an open IND in the United States for avacopan, 
 
23 
 
 CCX140, and CCX872. All of our clinical trials are designed to comply with FDA regulatory requirements so that the data from all trials can be used to support a regulatory filing in the United States. We are including the United States, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand in our Phase III study of avacopan in AAV. Other planned studies with avacopan and CCX140 will likely include the United States and Europe, and potentially other geographies. 
 Clinical Trials 
 For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. 
 

 | Phase I clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase II clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to:
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


 | evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase III clinical trials, commonly referred to as pivotal studies, are typically conducted when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the drug candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase III clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites. An exception might be drugs developed for an orphan indication, where smaller clinical trials might be acceptable to the FDA and the EMA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA on the sponsors agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drugs safety and effectiveness after NDA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 New Drug Applications 
 The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use. 
 Once an NDA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA has 180 days to review and examine the application and respond to the applicant. However, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA has a 
 
24 
 
 goal of responding to NDAs within ten months of the filing date for standard review, but this timeframe is also often extended. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or it may require additional clinical data or an additional Phase III clinical trial. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Once the FDA approves an NDA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the drug reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such drug or require a recall of any drug already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved drugs which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing programs. 
 A sponsor may also seek approval of its drug candidates under programs designed to accelerate FDAs review and approval of NDAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a fast track product. Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of an NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for submission to the FDA of the remaining information. In some cases, a fast track product may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Approvals of this kind, referred to as accelerated approvals, typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval Phase IV clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established a new category of drugs referred to as breakthrough therapies that may be subject to accelerated approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drug candidates may also be eligible for priority review, or review within a six month timeframe from the date a complete NDA is accepted for filing, if a sponsor shows that its drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs. Fast track designation, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. When appropriate, we intend to seek fast track designation, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review, as applicable for our drug candidates. We cannot predict whether any of our drug candidates will obtain such designations or approvals, or the ultimate impact, if any, of such designations or approvals on the timing or likelihood of FDA approval of any of our proposed drugs. 
 Drugs may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the finished drug product, and sometimes the active drug ingredient, is manufactured, and will not approve the drug unless cGMP 
 
25 
 
 compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the drug unless compliance with GCP requirements is satisfactory. 
 The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our drug candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing drugs. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial application of the drugs. 
 Orphan Drug Designation 
 In the United States, under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition. Such diseases and conditions are those that affect fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if they affect more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for these types of diseases or conditions will be recovered from sales of the drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. If the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by that agency. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but it can lead to financial incentives, such as opportunities for grant funding toward clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. 
 If a drug that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to orphan drug marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity generally prevents the FDA from approving another application, including a full NDA, to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, including if the FDA concludes that the later drug is safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. For purposes of small molecule drugs, the FDA defines same drug as a drug that contains the same active chemical entity and is intended for the same use as the drug in question. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug marketing exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Orphan drug marketing exclusivity rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. 
 The criteria for designating an orphan medicinal product in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as orphan if (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; (2) either (a) such condition affects no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (b) the product, without the benefits derived from orphan status, would not generate sufficient return in the EU to justify investment; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the marketing authorization application if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. 
 
26 
 
The ten-year market exclusivity in the EU may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan designation, for example, if the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Additionally, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar product for the same indication at any time if: 
 

 | the second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the applicant consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the applicant cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Any drugs manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution or withdraw approval of the NDA for that drug. 
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the products labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off-label use. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In March 2010, President Barack Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively known as the Affordable Care Act. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes and fraud and abuse, which have impacted existing government healthcare programs and resulted in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act: 

 | imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell branded prescription drugs to specified federal government programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
27 
 

 | required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | mandated a further shift in the burden of Medicaid payments to the states.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | created the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, once empaneled, will have authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program that could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established a Center for Medicare Innovation at the CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We expect that the new presidential administration and U.S. Congress will seek to modify, repeal or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the Affordable Care Act. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the Affordable Care Act. In January 2017, the House and Senate passed a budget resolution that authorizes congressional committees to draft legislation to repeal all or portions of the Affordable Care Act and permits such legislation to pass with a majority vote in the Senate. President Trump has also recently issued an executive order in which he stated that it is his administrations policy to seek the prompt repeal of the Affordable Care Act and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from or delay the implementation of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trumps administration and the U.S. Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold, and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for healthcare items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Affordable Care Act. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, was enacted, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently, there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. The full impact on our business of the Affordable Care Act and other new laws is uncertain. Nor is it clear whether other legislative changes will be adopted, if any, or how such changes would affect the demand for our drugs if commercialized. 
 Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Although none of our drug candidates has been commercialized for any indication, if they are approved for marketing, commercial success of our drug candidates will depend, in part, upon the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at the federal, state, and private levels. Government payor programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health care insurance companies, and managed-care plans have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular procedures or drug treatments. The U.S. Congress and state legislatures from time to time propose and adopt initiatives aimed at cost-containment. Ongoing federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health 
 
28 
 
 care will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems. Examples of how limits on drug coverage and reimbursement in the United States may cause reduced payments for drugs in the future include: 
 

 | changing Medicare reimbursement methodologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | fluctuating decisions on which drugs to include in formularies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | revising drug rebate calculations under the Medicaid program; and

 Some third-party payors also require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse health care providers who use such therapies. While we cannot predict whether any proposed cost-containment measures will be adopted or otherwise implemented in the future, the announcement or adoption of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain adequate prices for our drug candidates and operate profitably. 
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations 
 We are also subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include: 

 | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act;

 | federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;

 | federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation;

 | the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Childrens Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians (as defined above) and their immediate family members and payments or other transfer of value to such physician owners;

 | the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;

 | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal

government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.

International Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our future drugs. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we must obtain approval of a drug by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 Under the European Economic Area, or EEA (which is comprised of the 28 member states of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under the Centralized, Mutual Recognition, Decentralized or national EEA member state procedures. The Centralized Procedure provides for the grant of a single marking authorization that is valid for all member states of the EEA. The Mutual Recognition Procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marking authorization may submit an application to the remaining Member States. Under the Decentralized Procedure, if the product has not received a marketing authorization in any EEA member state at the time of application, the applicant can file an application to various EEA member states (choosing once as the so-called reference member states) of its choice which will be reviewed and approved simultaneously by them. 
 In addition to regulations in Europe and the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial distribution of our future drugs.
