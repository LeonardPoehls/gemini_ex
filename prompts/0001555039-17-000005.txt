Item 1. Business 
Overview
Altisource Residential Corporation (“we,” “our,” “us,” or the “Company”) is a Maryland real estate investment trust (“REIT”) focused on acquiring and managing quality, affordable single-family rental (“SFR”) properties for working class families throughout the United States. We commenced operations in December 2012. We conduct substantially all of our activities through our wholly owned subsidiary, Altisource Residential, L.P., and its subsidiaries (“ARLP” or the “Operating Partnership”). We operate in a single segment focused on the acquisition and ownership of residential rental properties.
We are managed by Altisource Asset Management Corporation (“AAMC” or our “Manager”). We do not have any employees, and, as a result, AAMC provides us with dedicated personnel to administer our business and perform certain of our corporate governance functions. AAMC also provides portfolio management services in connection with our acquisition and management of SFR properties and the management of our residential mortgage loans and real estate owned (“REO”) properties. On March 31, 2015, we entered into a new asset management agreement with AAMC (the “Current AMA”) with an effective date of April 1, 2015.
We have also entered into property management service agreements with two separate third-party property managers, Altisource Portfolio Solutions, SA (“ASPS”) and Main Street Renewal, LLC (“MSR”, together with ASPS, our “Property Managers”), to provide, among other things, leasing and lease management, operations, maintenance, repair and property management services in respect of our SFR portfolios. ASPS also provides similar property management, property preservation, maintenance and repair services in respect of our REO portfolio while we determine whether to convert such properties into rental properties or sell them. We believe that our relationships with our Property Managers and our access to their respective nationwide renovation and property management vendor and internal networks enables us to competitively acquire and operate large portfolios of SFR properties or individual SFR properties on a targeted basis.
We also have servicing agreements with two mortgage loan servicers with respect to the remaining mortgage loans in our portfolio.
Since we commenced operations in 2012, we have financed our business through a combination of equity offerings, repurchase
agreements, warehouse lines, seller financing arrangements and securitizations.
Our Business Strategy
We are committed to being one of the top single-family rental REITs serving working class American families and their communities with a view to providing consistent and robust returns on equity and long-term growth for our investors. We believe that our business model provides us with a competitive advantage and that our operating capabilities are difficult to replicate, which positions us to opportunistically grow and effectively manage our portfolio of SFR properties.
We believe there is a compelling opportunity in the SFR market and that we have implemented the right strategic plan to capitalize on the sustained growth in SFR demand. We target the moderately priced single-family home market to acquire rental units, which in our view offer optimal yield opportunities. In the current market, tighter credit availability for lower-income buyers and the relative scarcity of institutional buyers and operators should result in reduced price competition for reasonably priced homes. We believe that, when combined with sustained renter demand for working class homes, our lower home acquisition costs and our careful evaluation of capital expenditure requirements prior to acquisition will offer optimal yield opportunities. We view this as a significant differentiator for us.
We expect to hold SFR property assets over the long term with a focus on developing our brand. We also believe that the forecasted growth for the SFR marketplace, in combination with our our ability to acquire high yielding assets nationwide and our projected asset management and acquisition costs, provides us with a significant opportunity to establish ourselves as a leading SFR equity REIT.
From an operational standpoint, our Property Managers both employ established, nationwide renovation and property management infrastructures that provide us with geographic reach and a low cost scalable property management structure that is difficult to replicate in the industry today. Due to these partnerships with our Property Managers, we believe that our growth is not constrained by the cost and operational obstacles associated with building a new property management services platform.

We do not need to develop our own infrastructure for the collection of rents, the completion of renovations and other operational matters critical to the management of properties on a large scale because our Property Managers have well-developed platforms to do so.
Acquisition Strategy
Through our judicious use of cash, our strong financing relationships and the sale of mortgage loans and REO properties that we determine will not become SFR properties, we have capitalized on opportunities to buy pools of stabilized rental homes and individual residential properties at attractive yields. We anticipate executing upon similar opportunities as they become available. In addition, we will continue our efforts, through our mortgage servicers, to grow our SFR portfolio through the resolution of the remaining sub-performing and non-performing loans (“NPLs”) in our portfolio, which will result in a portion of the underlying properties being converted to rental units. We also anticipate additional NPL or REO liquidations that will generate cash that we may reinvest in acquiring additional SFR properties. We believe this diversified approach provides us with more avenues of growth and provides us with an advantage over other acquisition strategies.
Initially, our preferred acquisition strategy involved acquiring portfolios of sub-performing and non-performing mortgage loans. However, as market conditions evolved and the acquisition of sub-performing and non-performing mortgage loan pools became more competitive and higher-priced, we expanded our acquisition strategy to opportunistically acquire SFR properties, both individually and in pools, in order to more quickly achieve scale in our rental portfolio while allowing us to make purchase decisions in a more informed and operationally efficient manner.
We have been successful in our pursuit of this strategy, having increased our SFR portfolio by 993% from 787 properties at December 31, 2014 to 8,603 properties at December 31, 2016 and 215% year-over-year from December 31, 2015 to December 31, 2016. We expect to continue to opportunistically source, bid on and acquire additional SFR properties that meet our targeted metrics over the course of 2017.
Access to Established Nationwide Property Management Infrastructures
Pursuant to our property management agreements with ASPS and MSR, our Property Managers provide us with, among other services, property management, leasing, renovation management and valuation services. Our arrangements with each of our Property Managers are scalable and allow us to operate and manage our SFR properties with cost and operational efficiency as well as predictability. Information with respect to each of our Property Managers is provided below:
ASPS
ASPS has developed a nationwide operating infrastructure enabled by technology and standardized and centrally managed processes. It also has a global back office organization that qualifies property management and renovation vendors, solicits the appropriate vendors to perform requested work, assigns the work to the vendor with the best possible combination of cost and delivery capabilities, provides uniform property management and inspection criteria and technology to review and assess properties, verifies that the vendor’s work is complete and pays the vendor. This technology and organizational infrastructure allows ASPS to provide services that we believe provide us with the following competitive advantages:

• | Our SFR property and sub-performing and non-performing loan portfolios typically contain properties that are geographically dispersed, requiring a cost-effective nationwide property management system; we believe the use of ASPS positions us to acquire single-family asset portfolios with large geographic dispersion;


• | ASPS provides us with full lifecycle rental property management services, including due diligence and acquisition support (i.e., title work, inspections and settlement), renovations and repairs, lease marketing, tenant management and customer care;


• | ASPS's rental marketing strategy is specifically designed to advertise listings across popular industry-focused websites, utilizing their high organic and paid search rankings to generate large volumes of prospective tenants;


• | ASPS's contracted relationships with nationwide manufacturers and material suppliers enable us to manage the ordering and delivery of flooring, appliances, paint, fixtures and lighting for all renovation and unit turn work (i.e. work associated with turnover from one tenant to the next);


• | We have direct access to ASPS's inspection and estimating application which is utilized by the third-party general contracting vendors to identify required renovation work and prepare detailed scopes of work to provide a consistent end product. In addition, this application catalogs major HVAC systems, appliances and construction materials, which can enable more accurate forecasting of long term maintenance requirements; and


• | Ongoing tenant management services are coordinated through an internal “24/7” customer service center.

As of December 31, 2016, ASPS managed more than 32,000 vacant pre-foreclosure and REO assets in all 50 states, and these types of properties are far more intensive to manage than tenant-occupied rentals. ASPS has the capacity to conduct more than 205,000 inspections and 117,000 repair and maintenance orders on a monthly basis and has more than 9,600 centrally managed vendors operating nationwide. ASPS also leverages sophisticated systems and strong vendor oversight to mitigate risks for its clients, stringent enough to satisfy the requirements of two top-10 bank clients and three of the largest non-bank mortgage servicers in the United States. ASPS's brokerage is the sixth largest real estate brokerage in the United States, operating in 50 states and managing over 29,000 transactions annually.
Main Street Renewal
MSR is a vertically integrated property manager, purpose built to provide end-to-end acquisition, development and management services. MSR’s centralized platform consists of teams dedicated to acquisitions, renovation, marketing and leasing, property management and other support functions. In addition, MSR’s technological partnerships provide it with proprietary technology solutions that support field efficiency and performance. Our relationship with MSR offers important diversification for our cost-effective external property management structure. Other benefits of our relationship with MSR include the following:

• | As of December 31, 2016, MSR managed approximately 11,000 homes and has substantial experience in approximately 20 of our current and target markets.


• | MSR provides us with a cost-effective renovation solution through its internal renovation and maintenance structure as well as its external vendor network. MSR has a team of dedicated personnel to oversee renovations of properties based on the approved bid prepared by an MSR inspector. All work is scheduled through local MSR personnel and MSR-certified contractors utilizing a pre-set market specific price list. MSR has negotiated substantial quantity discounts in each of its markets for products that it regularly uses during the renovation process, such as paint, appliances, HVAC systems, window blinds, carpet and flooring. MSR has also established and enforces best practices and quality consistency, reducing the costs of both materials and labor.


• | MSR's market analysis capabilities help us to optimize the yields on our SFR portfolio. MSR's in-house leasing agents work closely with its investment team to establish rental rates utilizing proprietary technology and input from its local leasing team. In establishing rental rates, MSR performs a competitive analysis of rents, the size and age of the property and many qualitative factors, such as neighborhood characteristics and access to quality schools, transportation and services.


• | MSR has an extensive in-house property management infrastructure, with technology systems, corporate process oversight and local personnel in the markets in which it operates. In these markets, property managers who are employees of MSR execute all property management functions. In addition, as part of its ongoing property management, MSR's in-house technicians conduct routine repairs and maintenance as appropriate to maximize long-term rental income and cash flows from all of the properties it manages. In addition, MSR's local property management teams make periodic neighborhood visits to monitor the condition of the homes and to ensure compliance with HOA rules and regulations.


• | MSR also manages property repairs and maintenance and tenant relations through a centralized call center, which offers a 24/7 emergency line to handle after hours issues, or through its web-based tenant platform. The maintenance call center technicians are trained to perform first level phone diagnosis and instruct self-service for minor issues to avoid on-site maintenance visits where possible. Maintenance vendors or in-house maintenance technicians are dispatched through our central maintenance call center depending on the severity of the repair.

We believe MSR's cost-effective property management infrastructure and technology-driven market analyses will result in increased long-term value for our stockholders. 
In addition, MSR has a proprietary acquisition platform that is capable of simultaneously deploying capital across multiple acquisition channels and in multiple markets. The acquisition team reviews a number of factors, such as the local housing market, population growth, market economics and yield considerations. We continue to explore additional opportunities to leverage MSR's property acquisition abilities to further grow our SFR portfolio.
AAMC works directly with our Property Managers' vendor management teams and internal maintenance and repair professionals on our behalf. AAMC’s construction and vendor management team also often interfaces with the general contractors and vendors themselves to maintain relationships with the vendor networks. Through AAMC’s team, we coordinate with Property Managers and their vendor networks to establish a collective approach to the renovation management, maintenance, repair and materials supply chain in an effort to create a unified look and feel for our SFR properties.

Portfolio Overview
Real Estate Assets
We seek to acquire SFR properties with attractive return profiles. We also convert a portion of the REO properties that we acquire through resolution of our mortgage loans into SFR properties. The REO properties that we acquire through our mortgage loan resolution activities that do not meet our rental criteria are liquidated to generate cash for reinvestment in other acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, dividend distributions or such other purposes as we may determine.
Acquisitions
Our current SFR portfolio was acquired during the period from 2013 through 2016 through direct purchases of SFR properties or REO or through the resolution of our non-performing mortgage loans as set forth below:

• | On September 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 4,262 SFR properties from two investment funds sponsored by Amherst Holdings, LLC (“Amherst”) for an aggregate purchase price of $652.3 million. We refer to the acquisition of these properties as the “HOME SFR Transaction.”


• | On March 30, 2016, we completed the acquisition of 590 SFR properties located in five states from a third party seller for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $64.8 million.


• | On August 18, 2015, we completed the acquisition of 1,314 single-family rental properties in the Atlanta, Georgia market from a third party seller for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $111.4 million.


• | During the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 237 REO properties as part of our mortgage loan portfolio acquisitions. The aggregate purchase price attributable to these acquired REO properties was $34.1 million.


• | In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we converted an aggregate of 1,112, 2,443 and 3,682 mortgage loans to REO properties. We also directly acquired 714 and 98 properties on an individual basis during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Dispositions
During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we sold 2,668, 1,321 and 221 REO properties that did not meet our rental investment criteria, respectively. Much like our disposition of NPLs, we have utilized a significant portion of the net proceeds from these sales to acquire additional SFR properties for our rental portfolio.
Real Estate Portfolio Summary
The following table presents the status of our real estate assets as of the dates indicated:

 | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2015 | | December 31, 2014
Rental: | | | | 
Leased | 7,293 | | 2,118 | | 336 
Listed and ready for rent | 703 | | 264 | | 197 
Renovation or unit turn | 607 | | 350 | | 254 
Total rental | 8,603 | | 2,732 | | 787 
Evaluating for rental strategy | 1,336 | | 2,201 | | 2,562
Held for sale | 594 | | 1,583 | | 611 
 | 10,533 | | 6,516 | | 3,960

As of December 31, 2016, we had 10,533 properties, consisting of 9,939 properties held for use and 594 held for sale. Of the 9,939 properties held for use, 7,293 properties had been leased, 703 were listed and ready for rent and 607 were in varying stages of renovation and unit turn status. With respect to the remaining 1,336 REO properties held for use, we will make a final determination whether each property meets our rental profile after (a) applicable state redemption periods have expired, (b) the foreclosure sale has been ratified, (c) we have recorded the deed for the property, (d) utilities have been activated and (e) we have secured access for interior inspection. A majority of the REO properties are subject to state regulations, which require us to await the expiration of a redemption period before a foreclosure can be finalized. The costs of holding our REO properties during these redemption periods was considered in our pricing, which generally reduced the price we paid for the mortgage loans. Once the redemption period expires, we immediately proceed to record the new deed, take possession of the property, 
4

(table of contents)

activate utilities, and start the inspection process in order to make a final determination on whether to rent or liquidate the property. If an REO property meets our rental investment criteria, we determine the extent of renovations that are needed to generate an optimal rent and maintain consistency of renovation specifications to match our branding. If it is determined that the REO property will not meet our rental investment criteria, the property is listed for sale, in some instances after renovations are made to optimize the sale proceeds.
As of December 31, 2015, we had 6,516 properties, consisting of 4,933 properties held for use and 1,583 properties held for sale. Of the 4,933 properties held for use, 2,118 had been leased, 264 were listed and ready for rent and 350 were in various stages of renovation. With respect to the remaining 2,201 REO properties at December 31, 2015, we were in the process of determining whether these properties would meet our rental profile.

_____________

(1) | The carrying value of an asset is based on historical cost, which generally consists of the market value at the time of acquisition plus renovation costs, net of any accumulated depreciation and impairment. Assets held for sale are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or estimated fair value less costs to sell.


(2) | Weighted average age is based on the age of each property weighted by its proportion of the total carrying value for its respective state.

As of December 31, 2016, our highest concentrations of real estate were in three states, Florida, Georgia and Texas, which accounted for 5,799 properties (55.1% of our real estate assets) with an aggregate carrying value of $748.3 million (48.5% of the carrying value of our real estate assets), with the remainder dispersed among 43 other states and the District of Columbia.
Mortgage Loan Assets
The management and/or sale of our remaining portfolio of residential mortgage loans is an important focus of our business. The sale of our mortgage loans from time to time has allowed us to recycle our capital to grow our rental portfolio. For the mortgage loans remaining in our portfolio, we seek to employ various loan resolution methodologies. To help us achieve our business objectives, we continue to focus on converting a portion of our remaining sub-performing and non-performing loans to performing status and managing the foreclosure process and timelines with respect to the remainder of those loans. Due to the continually evolving market dynamics and pricing of distressed mortgage loans, we continually evaluate the different alternatives with respect to our loan portfolio, including potential sales and continued resolution of such loans.
Disposition of Loans
During 2015, we also commenced efforts to sell certain non-performing loan portfolios to take advantage of attractive market pricing and evolving market conditions. Sales of non-performing loans that do not meet our rental property criteria have been growth catalyst for our company, allowing us to recycle capital that we may use to purchase rental properties that meet our return profile. During 2016 and 2015, we completed the sale of 1,975 and 961 mortgage loans, respectively, to unrelated third parties.
During the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed the auction process and awarded the sale of 556 re-performing mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance (“UPB”) of $120.3 million to an unrelated third party. This sale was completed on January 23, 2017.
In addition, in January 2017, we commenced an auction process to sell an additional portfolio of 2,384 mortgage loans with an aggregate UPB of $574.4 million, representing approximately 82% of our remaining loan portfolio by UPB (excluding the 556 loans sold in January 2017). On February 15, 2017, following the auction process, we agreed in principle to award the sale to an unrelated third party. Subject to typical confirmatory due diligence and negotiation of a definitive purchase agreement, we expect to consummate this transaction during the second quarter of 2017. As is customary in these transactions, this confirmatory due diligence process may result in certain loans being removed from the sale or a repricing of certain loans; therefore, the final composition and proceeds of this portfolio sale are subject to adjustment depending on the final diligence 
6

(table of contents)

results and further negotiation by the parties. No assurance can be given that this transaction will be completed on a timely basis or at all.
Following completion of the sale of this additional mortgage loan portfolio, we will have sold a substantial majority of our non-performing and re-performing loans that were not expected to be rental candidates. We may conduct additional sales of non-performing loans that do not meet our rental criteria. It is anticipated that the proceeds generated from any such transactions would be utilized, in part, to continue to facilitate our strategy to grow our SFR portfolio through the purchase of additional SFR properties.
Resolution of Loans
In our operations to date, certain of our residential mortgage loans have been liquidated as a result of a short sale, third party sale of the underlying property, refinancing or full debt pay-off of the loan. Upon the liquidation of loans, we have recorded net realized gains, including the reclassification of previously accumulated net unrealized gains on those mortgage loans. We expect the timeline to liquidate loans will vary significantly by loan, which has resulted and could continue to result in fluctuations in revenue recognition and operating performance from period to period. Additionally, the proceeds from loan sales and liquidations may vary significantly depending on the resolution methodology used by us for each loan.
A portion of our residential mortgage loans have been converted into REO properties either through foreclosure or as a result of our acquisition of the property via alternative resolution such as deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. The timeline to convert acquired loans into REO can vary significantly by loan, which has resulted and could continue to result in fluctuations in our revenue recognition and our operating performance from period to period. The factors that may affect the timelines to foreclose upon a residential mortgage loan include, without limitation, state foreclosure timelines and deferrals associated therewith; unauthorized parties occupying the property; federal, state or local legislative action or initiatives designed to provide homeowners with assistance in avoiding residential mortgage loan foreclosures; continued declines in real estate values and/or sustained high levels of unemployment that increase the number of foreclosures and that place additional pressure and/or delays on judicial and administrative proceedings. 
We anticipate that REO properties that meet our investment criteria will be converted into SFR properties, which we believe will generate long-term returns for our stockholders. If an REO property does not meet our rental investment criteria, we expect to liquidate the property and generate cash for reinvestment in other acquisitions, repurchases of common stock, dividend distributions or such other purposes as we may determine.
Acquisitions
Due to changing market conditions and the evolution of our business model toward acquiring residential properties directly, we did not complete any residential mortgage loan portfolio acquisitions during the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015. During 2014, we completed the acquisition of an aggregate of 8,205 residential mortgage loans having an aggregate UPB of approximately $2.1 billion. As described above, these loans subsequently were either converted into REO properties for rental or sale or were sold to unrelated third parties to generate liquidity to acquire additional SFR properties.
Mortgage Loan Portfolio Summary
As of December 31, 2016, we had 2,891 mortgage loans at fair value with an aggregate carrying value of $460.4 million. The carrying value of mortgage loans is based on our Manager's proprietary pricing model. The significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of our mortgage loans at fair value are discount rates, forecasts of future home prices, alternate resolution probabilities and foreclosure timelines. Significant changes in any of these inputs in isolation could result in a significant change to the fair value measurement. For a more complete description of the fair value measurements and the factors that may significantly affect the carrying value of our mortgage loans at fair value, please see Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements.
Our sub-performing and non-performing mortgage loans become REO properties when we obtain legal title to the property upon completion of the foreclosure process or as a result of our acquisition of the property via alternative resolution, such as deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Additionally, some of the portfolios we purchased contained a small number of residential mortgage loans that have already been converted to REO.

Following the completed loan sales and resolutions, the remainder of our mortgage loans at fair value as of December 31, 2016 consisted of a diversified pool of sub-performing, non-performing and re-performing residential mortgage loans with the underlying properties located across the United States. The table below provides a summary of our mortgage loans at fair value based on the respective carrying value, UPB and market values of underlying properties as of December 31, 2016 ($ in thousands):

_____________

(1) | Market value of the underlying property is based on broker price opinions (“BPOs”).

As of December 31, 2016, our highest concentrations of loans were in California, Florida, New Jersey and New York, which accounted for 1,455 loans (50.3% of our mortgage loans at fair value) with an aggregate UPB of $415.1 million (59.5% of the UPB of our mortgage loans at fair value), with the remainder dispersed among 42 other states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.
The chart below sets forth our mortgage portfolio by delinquency as of December 31, 2016:
Our Strengths
We are committed to a business strategy that will enable us to grow and maintain a substantial SFR portfolio and become one of the largest nationwide single-family rental REITs. Our goal is to enhance long-term stockholder value through the execution of our business plan with a focus on our competitive strengths. Our strong competitive position is based on the following factors:

• | Acquisition Strategy Enables us to Build a Portfolio that we Expect will Provide High Yields to Stockholders. Through AAMC’s personnel and technical expertise, we have developed a valuation model that uses proprietary historical data to evaluate and project the performance of SFR assets and residential mortgage loans. This valuation model has been built with multiple broad economic inputs as well as individual property-level inputs to determine which properties will produce the highest possible yields and how much to pay for these properties to best achieve optimal results. These internally-developed tools help us to evaluate the most attractive SFR portfolios for sale while leveraging our Property Managers' property inspection, management and rental infrastructure and related data flows to identify and acquire higher yielding assets in any geographical location into which we desire to enter or expand. We intend to continue to build upon this infrastructure and employ regional teams that will focus on specified geographical areas and use their developed regional experience to continually build a better, more predictable model meant to achieve

high rental yield portfolio growth with properties marked by strong stabilized occupancy rates and optimal economic returns.

• | Relationships with our Property Managers and their Nationwide Property Management Infrastructures. With the support of our Property Managers' nationwide vendor networks, we believe that we are strategically positioned to operate SFR properties across the United States at an attractive cost structure. These vendor networks have been developed over many years, and we believe our Property Managers' infrastructures would be difficult and expensive for certain competitors and/or new market participants to replicate. We believe, therefore, that our existing relationships with ASPS and MSR, along with their respective vendor networks, give us a distinct advantage in bidding on SFR portfolios.


• | Depth of Management Experience. We believe the experience and technical expertise of our management team and the personnel from AAMC is one of our key strengths. Our team has a broad and deep knowledge of the real estate and mortgage markets with decades of experience in real estate, mortgage trading, housing, financial services and asset management markets. Their experience in the real estate industry brings a wealth of understanding of the markets in which we operate and can help us build our portfolio in a manner that brings the highest potential returns to stockholders. Management and its supporting teams have expertise and a multitude of contacts that enable us to source SFR assets through access to auctions and sellers of SFR assets and obtain financing to optimize available leverage. Due to our management team's expertise, we have been able to strategically sell non-performing and re-performing loans to create taxable income and sustain a strong dividend while also using the liquidity generated from these sales to increase our SFR portfolio by approximately 215% in 2016. We believe that AAMC’s asset evaluation process and the experience and judgment of its executive management team in identifying, assessing, valuing and acquiring new SFR assets will help us to appropriately value the portfolios at the time of purchase and operate them profitably as we continue to grow.


• | Strong Understanding of Mortgage Loan Management. Our key personnel have extensive experience with managing mortgage loan assets that allows us to capitalize on the servicing capabilities of our third party servicers and ensure cost effective servicing of our residential mortgage loan portfolios. We will continue to work closely with our mortgage loan servicers as we resolve the mortgage loans that remain our portfolio.

Other Services Provided by ASPS
In addition to the ASPS property management services agreement described above, we also have a trademark license agreement with ASPS that provides us with a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty free license to use the name “Altisource.” We also have a support services agreement with ASPS, pursuant to which ASPS may provide services to us in areas such as human resources, vendor management operations, corporate services, risk management, quality assurance, consumer psychology, treasury, finance and accounting, legal, tax and compliance.
During 2015, AAMC internalized certain of the support services that had been provided to us by ASPS by directly hiring 31 of the ASPS employees that had previously provided those services. We believe the direct hire of these employees has further increased the infrastructure of our Manager so that they are better able to serve us operationally while enabling ASPS to focus on the property management, maintenance and brokerage services that matter most to us. As our Manager continues to build its infrastructure, we expect that additional support services provided by ASPS will be phased out and conducted entirely by our Manager.
Our Investment Process
Our Manager continues to hire key personnel and portfolio managers with substantial experience in the real estate market. Using deep market connections and employing advanced quantitative models and reasoning, AAMC's capital markets group has demonstrated expertise in sourcing, analyzing and negotiating the purchase of large portfolios of rented single-family properties. This expertise has enabled us to purchase a total of 6,978 SFR properties, the majority of which were stabilized rentals at acquisition, in our targeted markets since the third quarter of 2015.

Our Financing Strategy 
We intend to continue to finance our investments with debt and equity, the proportions and character of which may vary based upon the particular characteristics of our portfolio and on market conditions. To the extent available at the relevant time, our financing sources may include bank credit facilities, seller financing arrangements, warehouse lines of credit, securitization financing and other term financing, structured financing arrangements and repurchase agreements, among others. We may also seek to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of debt or equity securities, depending upon market conditions. For additional information on our financing arrangements, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Liquidity and Capital Resources.”
Investment Committee and Investment Policy
Substantially all of our investment activities are conducted by AAMC on our behalf pursuant to the Current AMA. Our principal objective is to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for our stockholders over the long-term through dividends and capital appreciation.
Our Board of Directors has adopted a broad investment policy designed to facilitate the management of our capital and assets and the maintenance of an investment portfolio profile that meets our objectives. Our Board has appointed an Investment Committee consisting of our Chairman, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer. The Investment Committee's role is to act in accordance with the investment policy and guidelines approved by our Board of Directors for the investment of our capital. As part of an overall investment portfolio strategy, the investment policy provides that we can purchase or sell real estate assets, non-performing or sub-performing residential mortgage loans and residential mortgage backed securities. We are also authorized to offer leases on acquired SFR properties. The investment policy may be modified by our Board of Directors without the approval of our stockholders.
The objective of the investment policy is to oversee our efforts to achieve a return on assets consistent with our business objective and to maintain adequate liquidity to meet financial covenants and regular cash requirements.
The Investment Committee is authorized to approve the financing of our investment positions through repurchase agreements, warehouse lines of credit, securitized debt and other financing arrangements, provided such agreements are negotiated with counterparties approved by the Investment Committee. We are also permitted to hedge our interest rate exposure on our financing activities through the use of interest rate swaps or caps, forwards, futures and options, subject to prior approval from the Investment Committee.
Investment Committee Approval of Counterparties
The Investment Committee is authorized to consider and approve:

• | the financial soundness of institutions with which we plan to transact business and make recommendations with respect thereto;


• | our risk exposure limits with respect to the dollar amounts of total exposure with a given institution; and


• | investment accounts and trading accounts to be opened with banks, broker-dealers and financial institutions.

Investment Committee Guidelines
The activities of our Investment Committee are subject to the following guidelines:

• | No investment will be made that would cause us or any of our subsidiaries to fail to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes;


• | No investment will be made that would cause us to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”); and


• | Until appropriate investments can be identified, we may invest available cash in interest-bearing and short-term investments that are consistent with (a) our intention to qualify as a REIT and (b) our exemption from registration as an investment company under the Investment Company Act.

Broad Investment Policy Risks
Our investment policy is very broad and provides our Investment Committee and AAMC with extensive latitude to determine the types of assets that are appropriate investments for us and to make individual investment decisions. In the future, AAMC may make investments with lower rates of return than those anticipated under current market conditions and/or may make investments with greater risks to achieve those anticipated returns. Our Board of Directors will periodically review our investment policy and our investment portfolio but will not typically review or approve each proposed investment by AAMC unless, for example, it falls outside our previously approved investment policy or constitutes a related party transaction.
In addition, in conducting its periodic reviews, our Board of Directors will rely primarily on information provided to it by AAMC, and the Board has delegated the oversight of certain investment decisions to the Investment Committee, which includes our Chairman of the Board of Directors. AAMC may use complex strategies, and transactions entered into by AAMC may be costly, difficult or impossible to unwind. Further, we may change our investment policy and targeted asset classes at any time without the consent of our stockholders, which could result in our making investments that are different in type from, and possibly riskier than, our current investments or the investments currently contemplated. Changes in our investment strategy, investment policy and targeted asset classes may increase our exposure to interest rate risk, counterparty risk, default risk and real estate market fluctuations, which could materially and adversely affect us.
Our Manager and the Asset Management Agreement
We are externally managed by AAMC, an asset management company that provides portfolio management and corporate governance services. Under the Current AMA, AAMC is responsible for, among other duties: (1) performing and administering all of our day-to-day operations; (2) defining investment criteria in our investment policy in cooperation with our Board of Directors; (3) sourcing, analyzing and executing asset acquisitions, including the related financing activities; (4) analyzing and executing sales of REO properties and residential mortgage loans; (5) overseeing our Property Managers’ renovation, leasing and property management of our SFR properties; (6) overseeing the servicing of our residential mortgage loan portfolios; (7) performing asset management duties and (8) performing corporate governance and other management functions, including financial, accounting and tax management services.
AAMC provides us with a management team and support personnel who have substantial experience in the acquisition and management of residential properties and residential mortgage loans. AAMC’s management also has significant corporate governance experience that enables it to manage our business and organizational structure efficiently. AAMC has agreed not to provide the same or substantially similar services without the prior written consent of our Board of Directors to any business or entity competing against us in (a) the acquisition or sale of SFR and/or REO properties, non-performing and re-performing mortgage loans or other similar assets, (b) the carrying on of a single-family rental business or (c) any other activity in which we engage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, AAMC may engage in any other business or render similar or different services to any businesses engaged in lending or insurance activities or any other activity other than those described above. Further, at any time following our determination and announcement that we will no longer engage in any of the above-described competitive activities, AAMC would be entitled to provide advisory or other services to businesses or entities in such competitive activities without our prior consent.
On March 31, 2015, we entered into the Current AMA with AAMC. The Current AMA, which became effective on April 1, 2015, provides for a new management fee structure that replaces the fee structure under the original asset management agreement with AAMC (the “Original AMA”) as follows:

• | Base Management Fee. AAMC is entitled to a quarterly Base Management Fee equal to 1.5% of the product of (i) our average invested capital (as defined in the Current AMA) for the quarter multiplied by (ii) 0.25 while we have fewer than 2,500 single-family rental properties actually rented (“Rental Properties”). The Base Management Fee percentage increases to 1.75% of average invested capital while we have between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 2.0% of average invested capital while we have 4,500 or more Rental Properties;


• | Incentive Management Fee. AAMC is entitled to a quarterly Incentive Management Fee equal to 20% of the amount by which our return on invested capital (based on AFFO, defined as our net income attributable to holders of common stock calculated in accordance with GAAP plus real estate depreciation expense minus recurring capital expenditures on all of our real estate assets owned) exceeds an annual hurdle return rate of between 7.0% and 8.25% (depending on the 10-year treasury rate). The Incentive Management Fee increases to 22.5% while we have between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 25% while we have 4,500 or more Rental Properties; and

12

(table of contents)


• | Conversion Fee. AAMC is entitled to a quarterly Conversion Fee equal to 1.5% of the market value of assets converted into leased single-family homes by us for the first time during the quarter.


We have the flexibility to pay up to 25% of the incentive management fee to AAMC in shares of our common stock.
Under the Current AMA, AAMC continues to be the exclusive asset manager for us for an initial term of 15 years from April 1, 2015, with two potential five-year extensions, subject to our achieving an average annual return on invested capital during the initial term of at least 7.0%.
Neither party is entitled to terminate the Current AMA prior to the end of the initial term, or each renewal term, other than termination (a) by us and/or AAMC “for cause” for certain events such as a material breach of the Current AMA and failure to cure such breach, (b) by us for certain other reasons such as our failure to achieve a return on invested capital of at least 7.0% for two consecutive fiscal years after the third anniversary of the Current AMA or (c) by us in connection with certain change of control events.
If the Current AMA were terminated by AAMC, our financial position and future prospects for revenues and growth could be materially adversely affected.
Manager’s Management of the Operating Partnership
General
Substantially all of our assets are and will be held by, and substantially all of our operations will be conducted through, the Operating Partnership, either directly or through its subsidiaries or Delaware statutory trusts for its benefit. Altisource Residential GP, LLC is the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership (the “General Partner”). We own 100% of the membership interests in the General Partner. We also own 100% of the limited partnership interests of the Operating Partnership. We do not intend to list any Operating Partnership interests on any exchange or any national market system. The provisions of the limited partnership agreement are described below.
The General Partner is managed by AAMC through our asset management agreement with AAMC. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the limited partnership agreement and subject to the rights of holders of any class or series of operating partnership interests, all management powers over the business and affairs of the Operating Partnership are exclusively vested in AAMC through its management of us and the General Partner, subject to the oversight of our Board of Directors. No limited partner, in its capacity as a limited partner, has any right to participate in or exercise control or management power over the Operating Partnership’s business and affairs other than through our Board of Directors’ oversight of AAMC’s executive officers who manage our business and that of the General Partner. With limited exceptions, the General Partner, through its management by AAMC, may execute, deliver and perform agreements and transactions on behalf of the Operating Partnership without the approval or consent of any limited partner.
Terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement
Capital Contributions, Profits and Losses and Distributions 
Neither the General Partner nor the limited partner is required to make any additional capital contribution to the Operating Partnership, although we intend to contribute funds generally from equity offerings, repurchase facilities, securitization financings or other financing arrangements into the Operating Partnership in order to (a) make additional acquisitions of SFR properties, (b) pay property management fees, mortgage loan servicing fees and other expenses related to the management of our assets, (c) conduct the renovation, leasing and property management services for SFR properties and (d) provide funds for general corporate purposes.
The profits and losses of the Operating Partnership shall be allocated in proportion to the capital contributions of the partners of the Operating Partnership.
At the time or times determined by the General Partner, the General Partner may cause the Operating Partnership to distribute any cash held by it that is not reasonably necessary for the operation of the Operating Partnership. If the General Partner determines that cash will be distributed, the cash available for distribution will be distributed to us, as the sole limited partner of the Operating Partnership and sole contributor of all the funds in the Operating Partnership’s capital account.

(table of contents)

Restrictions on Transfer of Partnership Interests; Withdrawals
Any partner of the Operating Partnership may transfer all or any part of its interest in the Operating Partnership only with the consent of the General Partner. Because we are the only limited partner and control the General Partner, we do not expect to transfer our limited partnership interests for the foreseeable future.
No partner may withdraw from the Operating Partnership except pursuant to an amendment to the limited partnership agreement signed by all of the partners. The withdrawal of the limited partner, and admission of a new or substitute limited partner, as applicable, will be effective as of the date of any such amendment. Upon the withdrawal of any partner, the withdrawing partner shall, to the extent permitted by Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (“DRULPA”) be entitled to payment of the balance of its capital account and shall have no further right, interest or obligation of any kind whatsoever as a partner in the Operating Partnership. We do not intend to withdraw as a partner of the Operating Partnership for the foreseeable future.
Amendments; Admission of Additional Partners
Without our approval as the limited partner, the General Partner may amend, and may amend and restate, the limited partnership agreement. The General Partner may admit additional limited partners to the Operating Partnership. The admission of additional limited partners to the Operating Partnership may be accomplished by the amendment, or the amendment and restatement, of the limited partnership agreement without our consent, and, if required by DRULPA, the filing of an appropriate amendment of the Operating Partnership’s certificate of formation. 
NewSource Investment and Divestiture
On October 17, 2013, we invested $18.0 million in the non-voting preferred stock of NewSource Reinsurance Company Ltd. (“NewSource”), an insurance and reinsurance company focused on real estate related insurance products in Bermuda. On September 14, 2015, NewSource completed the repurchase of all of our shares of non-voting preferred stock for aggregate proceeds of $18.0 million, which was the aggregate par value of the shares being repurchased. Until September 10, 2015, we received a 12% annual cumulative preferred dividend on our investment. In connection with the repurchase of the preferred stock, NewSource paid to us the accrued but unpaid dividend on our shares from January 1, 2015 through September 10, 2015 amounting to $1.5 million.
Policies with Respect to Certain Other Activities
We intend to raise additional funds through equity offerings, repurchase facilities, securitization financings, other debt arrangements, the retention of cash flow (subject to REIT distribution requirements) or a combination of these methods. In the event that our Board of Directors determines to raise additional equity capital, it has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration as it deems appropriate, at any time, subject to compliance with NYSE listing requirements.
In addition, we have borrowed and intend to continue to borrow money to finance or refinance the acquisition of SFR properties and for general corporate purposes. Our investment policy, the assets in our portfolio, the decision to use leverage and the appropriate level of leverage will be based on AAMC’s assessment of a variety of factors, including our historical and projected financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, financing covenants, the cash flow generation capability of assets, the availability of credit on favorable terms, our outlook for borrowing costs relative to the unlevered yields on our assets, maintenance of our REIT qualification, applicable law and other factors as AAMC and/or our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Our decision to use leverage will be at AAMC’s discretion and will not be subject to the approval of our stockholders. We are not restricted by our governing documents in the amount of leverage that we may use. 
As of the date of this report, we do not intend to invest in the securities of other REITs, other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such entities. We do not intend that our investments in securities will require us to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and we would intend to divest such securities before any such registration would be required. We do not intend to underwrite securities of other issuers.
Our Board of Directors may change any of these policies without prior notice to, or the consent of, our stockholders.

(table of contents)

REIT Qualification
We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 859 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the “Code”) beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013, and we currently expect to maintain this status for the foreseeable future. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet on a continuing basis, through actual investment and operating results, various complex requirements under the Code relating to, among other things, the sources of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the diversity of ownership of our common stock. We believe that we are organized in conformity with the requirements for qualification and taxation as a REIT under the Code, and that our manner of operation enables us to meet these requirements. As a REIT, we generally are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the REIT taxable income we distribute to our stockholders.
Even though we elected to be taxed as a REIT, we are subject to some U.S. federal, state and local taxes on our income or property. A portion of our business is expected to be conducted through, and a portion of our income is expected to be earned in, one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (each a “TRS”). In general, a TRS may hold assets and engage in activities that the REIT cannot hold, may choose not to hold to maintain REIT compliance and/or cannot engage in directly. Additionally, a TRS may engage in any real estate or non-real estate related business. A TRS is subject to U.S. federal, state and local corporate income taxes. To maintain our REIT election, at the end of each quarter, no more than 25% of the value of a REIT’s assets may consist of stock or securities of one or more TRS. If our TRS generates net income, our TRS can declare dividends to us, which will be included in our taxable income and necessitate a distribution to our stockholders. Conversely, if we retain earnings at the TRS level, no distribution is required, and we can increase stockholders’ equity of the consolidated entity. As discussed under “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Qualification as a REIT,” the combination of the requirement to maintain no more than 25% of our assets in the TRS coupled with the effect of TRS dividends on our income tests creates compliance complexities for us in the maintenance of our qualified REIT status.
Exemption from Investment Company Act
We rely on the exception from the Investment Company Act set forth in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Investment Company Act, which excludes from the definition of investment company “any person who is not engaged in the business of issuing redeemable securities, face-amount certificates of the installment type or periodic payment plan certificates, and who is primarily engaged in one or more of the following businesses… (C) purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate.” The SEC Staff generally requires that, for the exception provided by Section 3(c)(5)(C) to be available, at least 55% of an entity’s assets be comprised of mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate, also known as “qualifying interests,” and at least another 25% of the entity’s assets must be comprised of additional qualifying interests or real estate-type interests (with no more than 20% of the entity’s assets comprised of miscellaneous assets). Any significant acquisition by us of non-real estate assets without the acquisition of substantial real estate assets could cause us to meet the definitions of an “investment company.” If we are deemed to be an investment company, we may be required to register as an investment company if we are unable to dispose of the disqualifying assets, which could have a material adverse effect on us. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Structure – We could be materially and adversely affected if we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.”
Employees
We do not currently have any employees and do not expect to have any employees in the foreseeable future. Currently, services necessary for our business are provided by individuals who are employees of AAMC and our service providers. Each of our executive officers is an employee, officer or both of AAMC, and they are paid by AAMC. As of December 31, 2016, AAMC had 55 full-time employees.
On January 18, 2016, AAMC hired a new dedicated General Counsel for our company. Although he is not employed by us, his primary duties are to act as our General Counsel, and he reports to our Board of Directors. We also direct and approve his compensation and reimburse AAMC for all costs associated with his employment.
Competition
We face competition from various sources for the acquisition of SFR properties. Our competition includes other REITs, hedge funds, developers, private equity funds and partnerships. To effectively compete, we will rely upon AAMC's management team and their substantial industry expertise. We believe our relationship with AAMC and the terms of the Current AMA provide us with a competitive advantage and help us assess the investment risks and determine appropriate pricing. We expect our integrated approach of directly acquiring SFR properties as well as converting sub-performing and non-performing residential mortgage loans into SFR properties will enable us to compete more effectively for attractive investment opportunities. 
15

(table of contents)

However, we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve our business goals or expectations due to the competitive pricing and other risks that we face. Our competitors may have greater resources and access to capital and higher risk tolerances than we have, may be able to pay higher prices for assets or may be willing to accept lower returns on investment. As the inventory of available SFR properties and related assets will fluctuate, the competition for assets and financing may increase.
We also face significant competition in the SFR market from other real estate companies, including REITs, investment companies, partnerships and developers. To effectively manage rental yield and occupancy levels, we will rely upon the ability of AAMC's management team to supervise the renovation, yield management and property management services on our acquired properties. Despite these efforts, some of our competitors' SFR properties may be of better quality, be in more desirable locations than our properties or have leasing terms more favorable than we offer. In addition, our ability to compete and meet our return objectives depends upon, among other factors, trends of the national and local economies, the financial condition and liquidity of current and prospective tenants, availability and cost of capital, taxes and governmental regulations. Given the significant competition, complexity of the market, changing financial and economic conditions and evolving single-family tenant demographics and demands, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring or managing SFR properties that satisfy our return objectives.
Environmental Matters
As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could incur liabilities to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance with environmental laws at our properties. Environmental laws can impose liability on an owner or operator of real property for the investigation and remediation of contamination at or migrating from such real property without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of the contaminants. The costs of any required investigation or cleanup of these substances could be substantial. The liability is generally not limited under such laws and could exceed the property's value and the aggregate assets of the liable party. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties also may expose us to third-party liability for personal injury or property damage or adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or renovate the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. These and other risks related to environmental matters are described in more detail in “Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Government Approval
Outside of routine business filings, we do not believe it is necessary to obtain any government approval to operate our business.
Governmental Regulations
We do not believe there are any governmental regulations that will materially affect the conduct of our business.
