Item 1. Business
General
 
Aceto Corporation, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, are referred to herein collectively as “Aceto”, “the Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our”, unless the context indicates otherwise. Aceto was incorporated in 1947 in the State of New York. We are an international company engaged in the development, marketing, sales and distribution of finished dosage form generic pharmaceuticals, nutraceutical products, pharmaceutical active ingredients and intermediates, specialty performance chemicals inclusive of agricultural intermediates and agricultural protection products. Our business is organized along product lines into three principal segments: Human Health, Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals.
 
We believe our main business strengths are sourcing, regulatory support, quality assurance and marketing and distribution. Aceto functions as a virtual manufacturing company, distributing more than 1,100 chemical compounds used principally as finished products or raw materials in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, agricultural, coatings and industrial chemical industries. With business operations in ten countries, we believe that our global reach is distinctive in the industry, enabling us to source and supply quality products on a worldwide basis. Leveraging local professionals, we source more than two-thirds of our products from Asia, buying from approximately 500 companies in China and 200 in India. One supplier accounted for 39% of purchases in fiscal 2018 and 16% in 2017.
 
Strategic relationships with manufacturers of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, agricultural and specialty chemical products in the United States and internationally serve as a valuable resource to Aceto customers, enabling them to procure vital chemical based products necessary for their diverse and complex applications. A strong global technical network differentiates Aceto from commodity distribution companies. With regional managers in the United States, Europe and Asia, we provide regulatory support and quality assurance for customers and suppliers worldwide. Our regulatory network ensures that all products we distribute are produced to applicable required standards and conform to customer specifications for their intended end use.
 
Our presence in China, Germany, France, The Netherlands, Singapore, India, Hong Kong, Philippines, the United Kingdom and the United States, along with strategically located warehouses worldwide, enable us to respond quickly to demands from customers worldwide, assuring that a consistent, high-quality supply of pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products are readily accessible. We are able to offer our customers competitive pricing, continuity of supply, and quality control. Highly experienced staff, approximately one-third of whom are technically trained, enable Aceto to meet individual customer needs. Our marketing, sales, regulatory and technical professionals possess an intimate knowledge of worldwide sources of supply and product applications, as well as statutory and technical requirements. Many of our professionals are respected leaders in their industry, bringing 25 or more years of experience to customer applications. This longevity has fostered confidence and loyalty among customers and suppliers.

Aceto partners with customers during the product development process, creating new applications for existing products, as well as new product sourcing opportunities. We offer solutions for product and production challenges, while assisting with quality assurance, government approvals and compliance. All of these value-added services allow Aceto’s customers to be more responsive to their end use customers and more competitive in the global marketplace. We believe our 70 years of experience, our reputation for reliability and stability, and our long-term relationships with suppliers have fostered loyalty among our customers.
 
Other than product rights and license agreements for certain of our finished dosage form generic products which are part of our Human Health business and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) registrations for our Performance Chemicals, we hold no patents, franchises or concessions that we consider material to our operations.
 
Information concerning revenue and gross profit attributable to each of our reportable segments and geographic information is found in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, and in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
 
Developments
 
As previously disclosed:
 

· | During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s Rising Pharmaceuticals reporting unit had a decline in actual and forecasted revenue and earnings due to the persistent adverse conditions in the generics market, including continued pricing pressure, intense competition, related consolidation of customers and softer than expected contributions from new product launches. In addition, in February 2018, the Company was notified by the U.S. government that 11 generic drug products it acquired in its December 2016 purchase of assets from Citron Pharma LLC and Lucid Pharma LLC were not in compliance with the federal Trade Agreement Act country-of-origin provisions of a clause contained in government supply contracts acquired as part of that transaction. While the government’s determination was subsequently reversed on appeal, in order to avoid certain financial penalties, the Company entered into agreements with the government that provided for a no-cost termination of 11 supply contracts. Based on the afore-mentioned indicators, the Company determined that it was necessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis at March 31, 2018 for its Rising reporting unit. Accordingly, during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company recognized pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $256,266 consisting of $235,110 of a goodwill impairment charge and a $21,156 write-down of other identifiable intangible assets.

· | As of March 31, 2018, the Company was not in compliance with two of its financial covenants under its credit facility, the maximum total net leverage ratio and the minimum debt service coverage ratio. On May 3, 2018, the Company entered into a Second Amendment and Waiver to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “May 2018 Amendment”). The May 2018 Amendment, among other things, contained a waiver of any event of default under the Company’s credit agreement arising as a result of the non-compliance by the Company with the total net leverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio financial covenants, in each case, solely for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2018. The May 2018 Amendment also contained several amendments to the Company’s credit agreement including, among other things, (a) reducing the available revolving commitment thereunder, (b) restricting the payment of dividends and (c) restricting the incurrence of certain indebtedness, limiting acquisitions and other investments and imposing certain other restrictions.

· | The Company has incurred substantial expenses to address the issues that led to the impairment charges taken as of March 31, 2018. The Company has retained financial and legal advisors to assist it in dealing with the various challenges that the Company is currently facing, including legal advisors retained in connection with various ongoing legal proceedings. The Company is also paying a flat monthly fee of $250 for the services of its interim chief financial officer, Rebecca Roof.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | As referenced in the Company’s press release issued April 18, 2018, the Board of Directors has initiated a process to identify and evaluate a range of strategic alternatives. Strategic alternatives that have been or are being considered include the sale of a key business segment(s), a merger or other business combination with another party, continuing as a standalone entity or other potential alternatives. That process is ongoing. However, there can be no assurance that the strategic review process will result in any transaction.

While the Company has taken substantial steps to address the challenges confronting its business, the persistent adverse conditions in the generics market have continued. As a result, as of June 30, 2018, the Company was not in compliance with the total net leverage ratio, senior secured net leverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio financial covenants in its credit facility. With the assistance of its financial and legal advisors and through active negotiations with its secured lenders, the Company has entered into a Third Amendment and Limited Waiver, dated as of September 11, 2018 (the “September 2018 Amendment”), to the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “A&R Credit Agreement”). The September 2018 Amendment provides for a waiver of any event of default under the A&R Credit Agreement arising as a result of the non-compliance by the Company with the total net leverage ratio, senior secured net leverage ratio and debt service coverage ratio financial covenants, in each case, solely for the fiscal quarters ended or ending June 30, 2018, September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019. The September 2018 Amendment also contains several amendments to the A&R Credit Agreement including, among other things, (a) a limitation on dividends for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2018, December 31, 2018, March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, to an amount not to exceed $325 for any fiscal quarter, (b) increasing the applicable margin with respect to the interest rates on all loans under the A&R Credit Agreement by 450 basis points and fixing (during the September 2018 Amendment Limitation Period (as hereinafter defined)) the applicable margin with respect to the interest rate on all loans under the A&R Credit Agreement to the highest level provided under the A&R Credit Agreement, which is currently 6.00% in the case of ABR Loans (as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement) and 7.00% in the case of Eurodollar Loans (as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement), (c) during the period commencing on the closing of the September 2018 Amendment and ending on the date the Company demonstrates compliance with each financial covenant set forth in the A&R Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019 (the “September 2018 Amendment Limitation Period”; provided that if the Company is not in compliance with any of the financial covenants set forth in the A&R Credit Agreement for the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2019, then the September 2018 Amendment Limitation Period shall continue indefinitely), requiring the Company to maintain the sum of Domestic Liquidity (as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement) plus Foreign Liquidity (as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement) and the undrawn portion of the Revolving Commitment (as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement) (“Covenant Liquidity”) to an amount of at least $55,000 (the “Covenant Liquidity Amount”) as of the last business day of each week following the effectiveness of the September 2018 Amendment; provided that the Company shall not be in breach of the minimum liquidity covenant unless the Covenant Liquidity is less than the Covenant Liquidity Amount as of the last business day of two consecutive weeks, (d) requiring the prior written consent of the Required Lenders (as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement) as a condition precedent to the lenders extending any Loans (as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement) or the issuing banks issuing, amending, renewing or extending any Letter of Credit (as defined in the A&R Credit Agreement), (e) permitting the purchase, during fiscal year 2019, of assets for an aggregate consideration not to exceed $12,300, consisting of intangible assets relating to strategic product acquisitions and certain capital expenditures, and (f) restricting the incurrence of certain indebtedness, limiting acquisitions and other investments and imposing certain other restrictions.
 
As more fully described in Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies – Taxes and in Notes 12 and 20 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company (i) has recorded in its year-end financial statements a $76,500 valuation allowance against its U.S. net deferred tax assets for the year ended June 30, 2018, (ii) has determined that $71,350 of this non-cash charge should have been recognized in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, rather than in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 and (iii) accordingly will amend its most recently filed Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q to restate its third quarter and nine month consolidated financial statements to reflect this charge as a third quarter event.
 
We remain confident in our underlying businesses. Our business units are positioned for organic growth through the introduction of new products for finished dosage form generic drugs, the further globalization of our nutraceutical business, the continued globalization of our Performance Chemicals business, the expansion of our agricultural protection products, the continued enhancement of our sourcing operations in China and India, our demonstrated ability to form alliances with product development partners and the continuing improvement of our quality assurance and regulatory capabilities. Our business has been impacted by the extent of our debt load relative to our operating results. If we are able to reduce the extent of the leverage meaningfully, our overall performance could improve. If we are not able to reduce that leverage meaningfully, there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the financial covenants under our credit facility for quarters (beginning with the quarter ending September 30, 2019) after the quarters covered by the covenant waiver included in the September 2018 Amendment.
 
Human Health
 
Products that fall within the Human Health segment include finished dosage form generic drugs and nutraceutical products. Aceto sells generic prescription products and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products to leading wholesalers, chain drug stores, distributors and mass merchandisers. On December 21, 2016, wholly owned subsidiaries of Rising Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Rising”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Aceto, completed the acquisition of certain generic products and related assets of entities formerly known as Citron Pharma LLC (“Citron”) and its affiliate Lucid Pharma LLC (“Lucid”). Citron was a privately-held New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company focused on developing and marketing generic pharmaceutical products in partnership with leading generic pharmaceutical manufacturers based in India and the United States. Lucid was a privately-held New Jersey-based generic pharmaceutical distributor specializing in providing cost-effective products to various agencies of the U.S. Federal Government including the Veterans Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency. Lucid serviced 18 national contracts with the Federal Government.
 
Rising formed two subsidiaries to consummate the product acquisition – Rising Health, LLC (which acquired certain products and related assets of Citron) and Acetris Health, LLC (which acquired certain products and related assets of Lucid).

The assets acquired in the product purchase transaction expanded, complemented, and strengthened our existing and future product offerings. In what has become a competitive generic drug business environment, one key for long-term success is having an ever-growing commercial portfolio of generic products, a strong internal drug development pipeline and capable, reliable manufacturing partners. We believe that this transaction added significantly to the Rising business platform in all three crucial areas. We further believe that, consistent with our strategy of expanding our portfolio of finished dosage form generic products through product development partnerships and acquisitions of late stage assets, abbreviated new drug applications (“ANDAs”) and complementary generic drug businesses, this product acquisition significantly expanded our roster of commercialized products and pipeline of products under development.
 
Based on a report issued by IQVIA Institute on April 19, 2018, “Spending on medicines grew by 0.6% in 2017 after off-invoice discounts and rebates. This spending includes all types of medicines, including institutional use for inpatients and outpatients. Focusing only on retail and mail-order pharmacy distribution, net spending declined by 2.1%.”
 
As noted above, during the third quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company’s Rising Pharmaceuticals reporting unit had a decline in actual and forecasted revenue and earnings due to the persistent adverse conditions in the generics market. As a result of this decline and the actions taken by the government resulting in the no-cost termination of 11 government supply contracts, the Company determined that it was necessary to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis at March 31, 2018 for its Rising reporting unit. Accordingly, the Company recognized pre-tax non-cash impairment charges of $256,266 consisting of $235,110 of a goodwill impairment charge and a $21,156 write-down of other identifiable intangible assets.
 
Aceto supplies the raw materials used in the production of nutritional and packaged dietary supplements, including vitamins, amino acids, iron compounds and biochemicals used in pharmaceutical and nutritional preparations.
 
Pharmaceutical Ingredients
 
The Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment has two product groups: Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Pharmaceutical Intermediates.
 
We supply APIs to many of the major generic drug companies, who we believe view Aceto as a valued partner in their effort to develop and market generic drugs. The process of introducing a new API from pipeline to market spans a number of years and begins with Aceto partnering with a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer and jointly selecting an API, several years before the expiration of a composition of matter patent, for future genericizing. We then identify the appropriate supplier, and concurrently utilizing our global technical network, work to ensure they meet standards of quality to comply with regulations. Our client, the generic pharmaceutical company, will submit the ANDA for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) approval or European-equivalent approval. The introduction of the API to market occurs after all the development testing has been completed and the ANDA or European-equivalent is approved and the patent expires or is deemed invalid. Aceto, at all times, has a pipeline of APIs at various stages of development both in the United States and Europe. Additionally, as the pressure to lower the overall cost of healthcare increases, Aceto has focused on, and works very closely with our customers to develop new API opportunities to provide alternative, more economical, second-source options for existing generic drugs. By leveraging our worldwide sourcing, regulatory and quality assurance capabilities, we provide to generic drug manufacturers an alternative, economical source for existing API products.
 
Aceto has long been a supplier of pharmaceutical intermediates, the complex chemical compounds that are the building blocks used in producing APIs. These are the critical components of all drugs, whether they are already on the market or currently undergoing clinical trials. Faced with significant economic pressures as well as ever-increasing regulatory barriers, the innovative drug companies look to Aceto as a source for high quality intermediates.
 
Aceto employs, on occasion, the same second source strategy for our pharmaceutical intermediates business that we use in our API business. Historically, pharmaceutical manufacturers have had one source for the intermediates needed to produce their products. Utilizing our global sourcing, regulatory support and quality assurance network, Aceto works with the large, global pharmaceutical companies, sourcing lower cost, quality pharmaceutical intermediates that will meet the same high level standards that their current commercial products adhere to.
 
Based on a report issued by IQVIA Institute on March 13, 2018, “real net per capita spending on medicines in the United States will decline in 2018 and continue almost unchanged at almost $800 per person through 2022.”

Performance Chemicals
 
The Performance Chemicals segment includes specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products.
 
Aceto is a major supplier to many different industrial segments providing chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics, surface coatings, cosmetics and personal care, textiles, fuels and lubricants. The paint and coatings industry produces products that bring color, texture, and protection to houses, furniture, packaging, paper, and durable goods. Many of today's coatings are eco-friendly, by allowing inks and coatings to be cured by ultraviolet light instead of solvents, or allowing power coatings to be cured without solvents. These growing technologies are critical in protecting and enhancing the world's ecology and Aceto is focused on supplying the specialty additives that make modern coating techniques possible.
 
The chemistry that makes much of the modern world possible is often done by building up simple molecules to sophisticated compounds in step-by-step chemical processes. The products that are incorporated in each step are known as intermediates and they can be as varied as the end uses they serve, such as crop protection products, dyes and pigments, textiles, fuel additives, electronics - essentially all things chemical.
 
Aceto provides various specialty chemicals for the food, flavor, fragrance, paper and film industries. Aceto’s raw materials are also used in sophisticated technology products, such as high-end electronic parts used for photo tooling, circuit boards, production of computer chips, and in the production of many of today's modern gadgets.
 
According to a July 17, 2018 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, in the second quarter of calendar year 2018, the index for consumer durables, which impacts the Specialty Chemicals business of the Performance Chemicals segment, is expected to decrease at an annual rate of 4.0%.
 
Aceto’s agricultural protection products include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides used on various crops including sugarcane and nuts, which control weed growth as well as the spread of insects and microorganisms that can severely damage plant growth. One of Aceto's most widely used agricultural protection products is a sprout inhibitor that extends the storage life of potatoes. Utilizing our global sourcing and regulatory capabilities, we identify and qualify manufacturers either producing the product or with knowledge of the chemistry necessary to produce the product, and then file an application with the U.S. EPA for a product registration. Aceto has an ongoing working relationship with manufacturers in China and India to determine which of the non-patented or generic, agricultural protection products they produce can be effectively marketed in the Western world. We have successfully brought numerous products to market. We have a strong pipeline, which includes future additions to our product portfolio. The combination of our global sourcing and regulatory capabilities makes the generic agricultural market a niche for us and we will continue to offer new product additions in this market. In the USDA, National Agricultural Statistics Service release dated June 29, 2018, the total crop acreage planted in the United States in 2018 increased by .9% to 322 million acres from 319 million acres in 2017. The number of peanut acres planted in 2018 decreased 19.7% from 2017 levels while sugarcane acreage harvested decreased 2.1% from 2017. In addition, the potato acreage harvested in 2018 decreased approximately 1.0% from the 2017 level.
 
Research and Development Expenses
 
Research and development expenses (R&D) represent investment in our generic finished dosage form product pipeline. R&D expenses during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $7,933, $7,898 and $7,937 respectively.
 
Long-lived Assets
 
Long-lived assets, excluding property held for sale, by geographic region as of June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were as follows:
 

 | Long-lived assets | 
--------------+-------------------+--------
 | 2018 | | 2017 | | | 2016
United States | $ | 246,073 | | $ | 528,359 | | $ | 152,701
Europe | | 3,192 | | | 2,538 | | | 2,504 
Asia-Pacific | | 1,400 | | | 1,582 | | | 1,781 
Total | $ | 250,665 | | $ | 532,479 | | $ | 156,986

Suppliers and Customers
 
We will only purchase products from specifically approved plants that meet strict guidelines for quality. We regularly visit our suppliers to evaluate them not only on the basis of ability to deliver satisfactory products on a timely and cost efficient basis, but also on quality system, facilities and equipment system, materials system, production system, packaging and labeling system, and laboratory control system. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2018 and 2017 approximately 61% and 62%, respectively, of our purchases were from Asia and approximately 15% and 17%, respectively, were from Europe.

Our customers are primarily located throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. We will continue our program of regular visits to our suppliers' plants, and will continue to educate them on the quality of product and service required by our customers. Aceto is uniquely able to do this, as many of our sales representatives are technically trained (chemists, chemical engineers, biologists, pharmacologists, etc.) most with in-plant or industrial laboratory experience that allows them to effectively communicate customer requirements to sourcing teams. Our customers include a wide range of companies in the industrial chemical, agricultural, and human health and pharmaceutical industries, and range from small trading companies to Fortune 500 companies. During fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016, sales made to customers in the United States totaled $512,800, $465,879 and $380,533, respectively. Sales made to customers outside the United States during fiscal years 2018, 2017 and 2016 totaled $198,559, $172,439 and $177,991, respectively, of which, approximately 59%, 56% and 56%, respectively, were to customers located in Europe. One customer (AmerisourceBergen Corporation) accounted for 16% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 12% of net sales in 2017 and 14% of net sales in fiscal 2016. Another customer (McKesson Corporation) accounted for 11% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 11% of net sales in 2017 and 7% of net sales in 2016. No single product accounted for as much as 10% of net sales in fiscal 2018, 2017 or 2016.
 
Competition
 
The Company operates in a highly competitive business environment. We compete by offering high-quality products produced around the world by both large and small manufacturers at attractive prices. Because of our long standing relationships with many suppliers as well as our sourcing operations in both China and India, we are able to ensure that any given product is manufactured at a facility that can meet the regulatory requirements for that product. For the most part, we store our inventory of chemical-based products in public warehouses strategically located throughout the United States, Europe, and Asia, and we can therefore fill our customer orders on a timely basis. We have developed ready access to key purchasing, research, and technical executives of our customers and suppliers. This allows us to ensure that when necessary, sourcing decisions can be made quickly. We will also continue to search for new products, as well as for new sources for products where we feel our existing sources have lapsed in either product or delivery quality, and/or have failed to meet the needs of our customers or markets.
Environmental and Regulatory
 
We are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and local agencies in the countries in which we do business. Of particular importance is the FDA in the U.S. It has jurisdiction over testing, safety, effectiveness, manufacturing, labeling, marketing, advertising and post-marketing surveillance of our Human Health products.
 
Certain of our products involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic and hazardous materials. The Company's operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We have designed safety procedures to comply with the standards prescribed by federal, state and local regulations. We promote the use of environmentally friendly recyclable packaging by our suppliers. We endeavor to meet our customers' packaging requirements. We only use warehouses and carriers approved to handle chemicals and that have appropriate permits and licenses. We will endeavor to ensure that each package of each shipment has correct labels and supplier lot numbers, and is in compliance with safety and environmental laws.
 
Our global quality assurance network, with regional managers in the U.S., Europe and Asia, seeks to ensure that the quality of a product meets both its specifications and intended use. Our technical network performs a service that allows Aceto to source and qualify APIs, pharmaceutical intermediates, finished dosage form generics, agricultural products, specialty chemicals, and nutraceutical products from around the world. It also provides substantial regulatory support and technical assistance to manufacturers worldwide, enabling them to meet the stringent regulatory guidelines that govern the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, specialty chemicals and agricultural protection industries.
 
In connection with our generics business, the Drug Quality and Security Act (DQSA), which was enacted by Congress on November 27, 2013, outlines steps to build an electronic, interoperable system to identify and trace certain prescription drugs as they are distributed in the United States. This will enhance the FDA’s ability to help protect consumers from exposure to drugs that may be counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful. The system will also improve the detection and removal of potentially dangerous drugs from the drug supply chain to protect U.S. consumers. The deadline for us to be compliant with this new system is November 27, 2018 and we expect to be compliant by then.
 
A subsidiary of the Company markets certain agricultural protection products which are subject to the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA). FIFRA requires that test data be provided to the EPA to register, obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products. The EPA requires that follow-on registrants of these products compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the FIFRA regulations. Follow-on registrants do not themselves generate or contract for the data. However, when FIFRA requirements mandate that new test data be generated to enable all registrants to continue marketing a pesticide product, often both the initial and follow-on registrants establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort. The Company is presently a member of several such task force groups, which requires payments for such memberships.

In connection with the 2016 acquisition of certain products and related assets by Aceto from Lucid, the government contracting business of Citron, Aceto acquired through the government’s novation process Lucid’s government contracts.
 
In February 2018, we were notified by the U.S. government that 11 generic drug products we acquired through our Acetris Health subsidiary in a product purchase agreement with Lucid are not in compliance with the federal Trade Agreement Act (“TAA”) country-of-origin provisions of a clause (referred to below as the “Trade Agreements Clause”) contained in the government supply contracts acquired from Lucid (the “TAA Notification”). The 11 finished dosage form products purchased by the U.S. government are manufactured by Aurolife Pharma LLC which is located in Dayton, New Jersey using APIs sourced from India. In conjunction with this finding, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) requested that the Company’s Acetris Health subsidiary supply new TAA-compliant sources for the referenced products by March 9, 2018 and supply new TAA-compliant drugs to the government purchasers under the contracts by March 26, 2018. Acetris knew that it would be unable to meet these short deadlines. To avoid the government’s imposition of penalties for failure to meet these deadlines while Acetris appealed the above-mentioned findings, Acetris requested that the government defer imposition of these deadlines pending resolution of Acetris’ appeal. The Government declined this request and thereafter Acetris and the government entered into agreements that provided for a no-cost termination of each of the 11 supply contracts.
 
On July 10, 2018, the Company was informed that Acetris received a favorable ruling from the United States Court of Federal Claims (the “Court”), in Acetris Health, LLC v. United States, invalidating the VA’s interpretation of the Trade Agreements Clause, which had resulted in the termination of the 11 Acetris contracts with the VA. Finding in favor of Acetris, the Court granted a declaratory judgment establishing that under the federal Buy America Act, the agencies are permitted to buy domestic end products, including commercial off-the-shelf products like generic drugs, that are manufactured in the United States when the Trade Agreements Clause is incorporated in government supply contracts, even if their components are not all manufactured in the United States. Although Department of Defense (the “DoD”) contracts were not at issue in the case, the decision also impacts Acetris’ ability to supply the DoD with its products. The government has appealed the Court’s decision. Even if the Court’s ruling is affirmed on appeal, the Court’s ruling did not have the effect of reinstating the 11 terminated government supply agreements. While Acetris may seek new contracts with these agencies, no assurance can be given that any such contracts will be awarded.
 
Employees
 
At June 30, 2018, we had 315 employees, none of whom were covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
