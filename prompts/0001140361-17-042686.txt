U.S. Operations
 
Net income from U.S. operations nearly doubled to $1.8 million during fiscal year 2017, as lower revenues were more than offset by lower direct and indirect operating expenses. Competitive pricing pressure continued to have an impact on our ability to win new work in many of our domestic market sectors.  In addition, for the second straight year, we experienced a higher proportion of revenues from federal, state and local government projects, which are generally billed at lower rates than our commercial work.
 
Indirect operating expenses decreased 6% during fiscal year 2017.  We continue to improve operating efficiency within our domestic operations and operate under an expense management strategy that has resulted in significant reductions in indirect operating expenses over the past three fiscal years.
 
South American Operations
 
An economic downturn that adversely affected our Brazilian operations during previous fiscal years appeared to stabilize during fiscal year 2017, resulting in additional business development opportunities and higher revenues in Brazil.  Although improving, economic conditions continue to be challenging for certain of our clients in Brazil, resulting in continued high levels of collection risk and receivable reserves.
 
Global economic trends in oil, gas and commodity prices continued to have a severe negative impact on revenues and net income in Peru during fiscal year 2017.  Significant energy sector project work completed in Peru during fiscal years 2016 and 2017 has not been replaced.
 
Reduced volumes of work on power generation and transmission projects resulted in lower revenues and net income in Chile during fiscal year 2017.  Government and private investments in mining projects in Chile have steadily decreased since 2013.
 
Environmental Consulting Services Offered
 
We offer consulting services to commercial and government clients in a variety of service sectors, which include the following:
 
Government START Contract
 
We provide support services to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) for response and site assessment activities related to the release and threat of release of oil, petroleum products, hazardous substances, weapons of mass destruction or pollutants or contaminants that pose an actual or potential threat to human health or welfare, or to the environment.  We have supported the EPA under more than 40 contracts with a total award value exceeding $1 billion spanning nearly 40 years.
 
In July 2013, the EPA awarded us with renewal of a contract known as START IV to provide continuing support to EPA Region 10, which covers the four state territory of Alaska, Idaho, Washington and Oregon.  This is a combination time and materials/cost plus contract with a base term of three years and two two-year option periods, for a total potential contract term of seven years.  During fiscal year 2016, the EPA awarded the first of the option periods to EEI.  This contract contains termination provisions under which the EPA may, without penalty, terminate the contract during the contract term upon written notice to us.  In the event of termination, we would be paid only termination costs in accordance with the contract.  We have never had a contract terminated during the contract term by the EPA.
 
 5
 

Government Task Order Contracts
 
We have numerous task order contracts with state and federal governmental agencies which contain indefinite order quantities and/or option periods ranging from one to seven years.  Services provided under these contracts include numerous environmental assessment projects with the U.S. Navy, engineering and oversight of pollution remediation, and other hazardous waste remediation activities for various state entities.  We also prepare environmental impact assessment documents for federal land management agencies such as the Bureau of Land Management.
Energy
 
New technology and increasing demand for less carbon intensive and more sustainable use of resources presents complex challenges to energy developers and providers.  To keep pace with growing energy needs worldwide, we provide services to all phases of energy development by conducting critical feature/fatal flaw analyses, social and health impact assessments, feasibility and siting studies, field surveys, permitting, construction inspection and compliance monitoring.  As public participation has become increasingly important, EEI has developed specialized tools and techniques for successful stakeholder engagement.

· | Electric Transmission
--+----------------------



Our comprehensive approach to transmission project siting and permitting has developed from experience on over 16,000 miles of transmission line, including underwater and underground DC lines, urban rebuilds, and renewable generation interconnections.  We prepare feasibility studies, evaluate alternative routes, analyze environmental impacts, and acquire needed certificates, approvals, and permits for electric transmission facilities worldwide to bring renewable energy from its source to regional population centers as well as to upgrade aging infrastructure.  Recognizing the increasing need for proactive public involvement, we work closely with our clients to effectively engage stakeholders and identify environmental constraints, community concerns, and permitting requirements early.
 
 
· | Pipelines
--+----------



To date, we have worked on more than 250 projects in the pipeline industry involving more than 50,000 miles of pipeline systems.  Our extensive experience includes route selection, evaluation of alternatives, field surveys, regulatory compliance and permit support, preparation of environmental monitoring and restoration plans, and environmental inspection, including development of quality assurance specifications.
 
 
· | Offshore Energy
--+----------------



Global demand for renewable energy has stimulated the development of new technologies for generating energy from ocean currents, tides, waves, and thermal resources.  The rising demand for fossil fuels, particularly natural gas, has expanded the exploration and production of offshore oil and gas reserves and global trade of liquefied natural gas (“LNG”).
 
The LNG industry in the United States has seen dramatic changes in the last few years. The rapid development of shale gas resources has advanced the U.S. from having to import natural gas to now producing natural gas in excess of domestic needs. This has transformed the U.S. LNG marketplace from one where LNG import terminals were being permitted and constructed to one where LNG export terminals are now being permitted and constructed. E & E has worked with clients to develop offshore and onshore LNG import and export terminals and associated pipelines.
 
We have extensive experience conducting siting, environmental analyses, and permitting for offshore energy projects worldwide, including wind farms, wave energy converters, deep water ports, floating production storage and offloading facilities (“FPSOs”), and subsea pipeline and electrical transmission cables.  We guide clients in developing successful permitting strategies and provide comprehensive environmental and regulatory support for offshore energy projects.
 
We prepare third-party Environmental Impact Statements (“EISs”) and Environmental Impact Assessments (“EIAs”), Deepwater Port Applications, and Federal Energy Regulation Commission (“FERC”) Environmental Reports (“ERs”).  We also perform siting/feasibility studies, plankton surveys, marine mammal acoustic impact modeling, dredging impact studies, coastal zone consistency evaluations, risk assessments, and marine vessel traffic studies, and develop and implement comprehensive plans for stakeholder engagement/outreach.

· | Wind Energy
--+------------



We have extensive experience providing strategic environmental consulting services to wind energy developers and are a consulting member of the American Wind Energy Association (“AWEA”).  Our nationwide team has collectively worked on more than 475 wind energy projects in 38 states, helping clients successfully develop wind projects capable of producing more than 7,000 megawatts (“MWs”) of environmentally safe, renewable electricity.  Our direct experience with wind energy development, from initial siting studies through construction and mitigation monitoring of completed wind energy projects, allows us to anticipate potential project delays and resolve issues to keep client projects on schedule.
 
We provide strategic consulting in all facets of environmental permitting and compliance, environmental evaluation, threatened and endangered species, avian and bat surveys, and land use studies.  Our civil engineering support services include design of structure foundations and roadways and coordination for gathering line placement, substation, and transmission line requirements.  In addition, we recognize that public outreach efforts are an important component of any wind power project and, therefore, maintain in-house public relations experts and graphic artists, who work as an integrated team to design outreach programs geared toward landowners and officials.
 
 
· | Solar Energy
--+-------------



We have assisted solar developers to permit and build projects powering more than 6,540 MWs of clean, renewable energy in 31 states.  We have worked on more than 150 solar assignments, supporting all phases of solar energy development, including critical issues analyses, feasibility and siting studies, permitting and due diligence audits, environmental impact assessments, project permitting and construction monitoring and operational compliance. 
 
Natural Resource Management and Restoration
 
Our approach to restoration design focuses on mimicking natural systems in form, function, and process—developing practical strategies for sustainable design and uplift.  We conceive and design environmental restoration projects that restore affected habitat through the efficient and innovative integration of biological and engineering solutions.  We assist our clients in meeting their goals by applying restoration measures to mine reclamation, contaminated sediment remediation, land development strategies, recreational planning, comprehensive watershed planning, and threatened and endangered species protection.  Current work also includes helping clients such as the US Army Corps of Engineers address invasive species such as hydrilla and algal blooms in the Great Lakes watershed.  Through our work with The Nature Conservancy, we are also helping to restore areas on the Gulf Coast.
Sustainability, Resiliency, and Climate Adaptation
 
E & E planning teams are working with communities around the world to develop and implement sustainable approaches for projects as varied as neighborhood-scale urban redevelopment, large-scale green city planning and design, and regional sustainability plans.   We help organizations and government agencies to become more resilient by assisting them to plan for, respond to, and recover from extreme disruptive events that can result in a wide range of cascading emergencies, with emphasis on building more resilient communities.  We are a founding corporate sponsor of the International Sea Level Institute, and are working with clients to understand the short- and long-term effects of sea level rise on their businesses and communities.

Water Resources
 
Water supply, water quality and watershed management issues are becoming increasingly intertwined as communities face mounting difficulties securing future resources.  Water resource planning and management projects present diverse challenges ranging from understanding complex hydrologic systems to highly charged political issues and solutions must address stakeholder concerns, water rights, permitting requirements, ecosystem sustainability, public health, water supply, water quality, and economic feasibility. EEI’s water resource management practice includes work in water resources engineering, water studies and planning, and environmental restoration.  We have experience working in the world’s most important water systems, including the Florida Everglades, Louisiana Coastline, Sacramento-San Francisco Bay Delta, Great Lakes, Hudson River, Chesapeake Bay, Puget Sound, Amazon River Basin, Yangtze River Basin, and many others.
Planning
 
 
· | Environmental Planning and Assessment
--+--------------------------------------



Environmental impact assessment is at the core of our business.  Since EEI’s inception, this work has included numerous major EIS and ER projects, initial studies and EAs, and has mitigated negative declarations in accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”) and various state requirements.  We also prepare similar documents under state laws, such as the California Environmental Quality Act.
 
 
· | Military Master Planning and Land Use Compatibility Studies
--+------------------------------------------------------------



In response to the advances seen in military master planning under taken by the Department of Defense (“DOD”) over the past few years, we have developed a team of experienced professionals in the areas of real property master planning, military programming, geospatial data and systems support, database management, and water resources planning.  Through our experience with modern military facility planning, we develop technologically advanced military master planning tools by leveraging the latest in Geographic Information System (“GIS”) and information technology.  We assist DOD installations to incorporate renewable energy and reduce their environmental footprint while sustaining mission requirements and maintaining positive relationships with the surrounding communities. 
 
Emergency Planning and Management
 
Events around the world involving terrorism, bioterrorism, and natural disasters continue to raise concerns for public health and safety as well as environmental protection.  We provide logistical support, emergency response/management services, and comprehensive planning to businesses and state, county, and municipal governments in all phases of incident management, including preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery.  In providing these multifaceted services, we determine local vulnerabilities and hazards and the in-place resources/assets to address those hazards in the context of applicable state and federal laws and regulations and community desires to become more resilient.
Hazardous and Radioactive Material Services
 
We have conducted thousands of hazardous waste site evaluations throughout the United States, providing site investigation, engineering design, and operation and maintenance for a wide range of industrial and governmental clients.  We inventory and collect sample materials on site and then evaluate waste management practices, potential off-site impacts, and liability concerns.  We then design, implement, and monitor associated cleanup programs. Our field investigation services primarily involve the development of work plans, health and safety plans, and quality assurance/quality control plans to govern and conduct field investigations to define the nature and extent of contaminants at a site.  After field investigation services have been completed and the necessary approvals obtained, our engineering specialists develop plans and specifications for remedial cleanup activities.  This work includes development of methods and standard operating procedures to assess contamination problems; and to identify, develop, and design appropriate pollution-control schemes.  Alternative cleanup strategies are evaluated and conceptual engineering approaches are formulated.  We also supervise actual cleanup or remedial construction work performed by other contractors.

International
 
Since EEI’s incorporation in 1970, we have completed more than 50,000 environmental assignments in more than 120 countries worldwide.  Many of the services provided for our global clients are similar to the services we provide in the U.S. and help our clients to meet local expectations and regulatory requirements.  With an understanding of cultural, political, economic, operational, and legal factors that influence the solution to a given environmental problem, we aid international governments and lending institutions in their efforts to advance institutional systems for environmental management.  We have completed assignments involving environmental assessment; management and financial planning; institutional strengthening and standards development; water supply and development; wastewater treatment; and solid waste project construction supervision.  More recently, issues of public health, sustainability, and social and economic development have been added to that portfolio.
 
As modernizing economies continue to develop, demand for global environmental services has also grown.  Most countries now have environmental laws to protect and regulate development of natural resources.  Many countries are also investing in infrastructure-related projects like bridges, roads, hydroelectric dams, mines, water supply, power generation and transmission, communications networks, and ports, all of which present opportunities for us to provide environmental services. Our international offices are also providing services for the development of renewable energy.  Frequent and dramatic natural disasters in recent years have spurred many governments around the world to address disaster response and prevention strategies and the impacts of climate change, such as sea-level rise and storm intensity and frequency. Through our U.S. and South American operations, we believe that we are well-positioned to benefit from these growth opportunities.
 
Regulatory Compliance
 
The federal governments of the U.S. and other countries where we operate have enacted numerous environmental laws governing a wide range of topics. Similarly, most U.S. state legislatures have enacted laws to prevent and correct environmental problems.  Our operations are also influenced by international laws, treaties, conventions, and regulations designed to protect the environment.  These laws and regulations help to create the demand for the multidisciplinary consulting services we offer.  The principal U.S. federal legislation that affects our business include:

· | National Environmental Policy Act
--+----------------------------------


· | Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, As Amended

Corporate Governance and Security Exchange Rules
 
Our shares of Class A Common Stock are listed on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) Stock Market.  NASDAQ requires all of its listing companies to be in compliance with NASDAQ’s standards of corporate governance set forth in the NASDAQ Marketplace Rules (NASDAQ CG Rules).  We have certified to the NASDAQ that we are in compliance with the NASDAQ CG Rules except for those NASDAQ CG Rules relating to the Director Nominations Process, the Compensation of Officers and Board Compensation.   For these items, we relied upon the “controlled company” exception found in the NASDAQ CG Rules.  A “controlled company” is a listing company where more than 50 percent of the voting power of the listing company is in the control of a group.  As of July 31, 2017, a group that holds more than 50 percent of the voting power of our Common Stock, consisting of Messrs. Frank B. Silvestro, Ronald L. Frank, Gerald A. Strobel, Gerard A. Gallagher Jr. and Michael C. Gross and members of their families, does exist.  Therefore, we are a “controlled company” for purposes of the NASDAQ CG Rules.
