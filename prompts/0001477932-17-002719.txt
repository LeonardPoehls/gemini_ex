General
 
Xfuels, Inc. (formerly Amazonica, Inc.). (hereinunder "we," "the Company" or "the Registrant") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 2, 2010. 
 
On September 22, 2015, the Company, entered into an Agreement with Converde, Inc., an Ontario corporation ("Converde Canada") whereby the Corporation agreed to purchase from Converde Canada exactly 215,498,745 shares of Series A Preferred Stock (the "Converde Preferred Stock") of Converde Energy USA, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("Converde USA") whose common stock is traded on OTC Markets "Pink Sheets" under the symbol "XFUL", in exchange for 1 share of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company par value $0.0001 (the "AMZZ Preferred Stock"). AMZZ Preferred Stock holds voting rights equal to 4 times the total issued and outstanding common. As a result, the Company became the controlling holder of Converde USA as the Converde Preferred Stock votes and converts to common stock at a rate of 20:1 and Converde Canada become the controlling party of the Company. The AMZZ Preferred Stock was created by shareholder vote.Additional consideration for purchasing the controlling interest in Converde USA, the Company further agreed to assume certain debts of Converde USA totaling approximately $1.5 million.
 
Simultaneously to the closing of the transaction, our current CEO and sole director resigned from the Company and appointed Michael McLaren, Pierre Besuchet and Sigmund Friburg as Directors of the Company. The new Board of Directors promptly appointed Michael McLaren as CEO and Isaac Voss as President and COO.
 
The AMZZ Preferred Stock was created by shareholder vote on May 6, 2015 whereby holders of 51% of the issued and outstanding voted to create a series of preferred shares with voting rights equal to 4 times the issued and outstanding common stock in anticipation of a potential partnership that would complement the current hydrogen production technology.
 
Management of the Company has combined the resources of Converde Canada with the technology of the Company as Converde Canada has established operations and projects that can integrate the Company's technologies into existing lines of business. Although the Company was successful in continuing development of hydrogen production products, it did not have the resources to commercialize or market the products.
 
Amazonical’s system for producing 99.999% pure hydrogen—wherever and whenever it is needed—is a technological breakthrough. This low cost, environmentally friendly fuel source could transform the industrial economies and the developing world.
 
Amazonica's production method solves the problems currently associated with the hydrogen production: cost, distribution and purity. This breakthrough will enable high quality hydrogen to be produced cheaply, on demand and using low heat combustion. Because the production method is scalable, Amazonica technology could enable centralized production on industrial scale.

Additionally, Converde Energy USA has 4 major products under development with an eye to eventually market or license the technologies being developed., as follows:
 
 
· | Syngas Production: The NT Plasmatron converts any hydrocarbon feedstock into syngas, which is a combination of hydrogen (H2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO). Viable feedstocks include municipal solid waste (MSW), coal, natural gas, tires, sewage, animal waste and agricultural waste. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Electricity Production: The SteamRay high-efficiency rotary engine converts either steam or syngas into electricity. The W2 Hydrokinetics Propeller (WHP) converts river or offshore water flows into hydraulic pressure. The W2 Small Energy Generating System (SEGS) converts that hydraulic pressure into electricity.


· | Liquid Fuel Production: The MultiFuel Gas-to-Liquid Reactor converts syngas into either Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) or an approximate 40/35/25 blend of ULSD, gasoline, and JP8 jet fuel. The W2 Butanol Reactor (WBR) converts syngas into an approximate 60/30/10 blend of Butanol, acetone and ethanol. Butanol can be used as a gasoline substitute. Acetone and ethanol are commercial products with substantial worldwide demand.

On March 26, 2014, the Company filed patent application number 61970600 for our "Ultra Pure Hydrogen Generating Device". A copy of the patent application can be found as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3 to the Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 2, 2014. On March 28, 2014, the Company filed application number 61972088 for our "Ultra-Pure Hydrogen Generating Device Using Combustion Of A Mixture Of Ethanol And Gasoline". A copy of the patent application can be found as Exhibits 10.2 and 10.3 to the Form 8-K filed by the Company on April 8, 2014. Both patents are currently pending. The patent applications were based on ongoing research and development work from the Company's team of scientists, led by Dr. Gennadiy Petrovich Glazunov, a world renowned scientist at the Institute of Plasma Physics of the National Science Center of the National Academy of Science, located within the Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology.
 
The main objective of the invention is to improve the method of generating ultra-pure hydrogen while both enhancing its productivity and reducing environmental impact associated with the ultra-pure hydrogen production. This particular methodology is capable of producing ultra-pure hydrogen at productivity level previously unachievable. It is a known fact that environmental impact is lower if in the combustion the mixture of gasoline and ethanol is used instead of gasoline alone. However, it was not previously known the incorporation of ethanol in gasoline yields improvements in pure hydrogen production. According to experimental results disclosed in the filed patent application, the present use of ethanol/gasoline mixture offers not only reduced environmental impact, but also enhances productivity of hydrogen generation by 25-50%. On April 29, 2015, the Company also applied for a provisional patent for "Pure Hydrogen Accumulating and Compressing Device" as they work on the Project had shown to be fruitful in other regards, not yet contemplated.
 
The abstract of our filing for the Ultra Pure Hydrogen Generating Device describes the patent as follows:
 
A device for generating ultra-pure hydrogen comprising a substantially cylindrical palladium tube having a first end and a second end, wherein the first end is hermetically sealed with a jointing technique; a collection end; a valve disposed within a hydrogen 5 conductor having two ends, wherein the second end of the palladium tube is hermetically sealed to one end of the hydrogen conductor and the collecting end is connected to the other end of the hydrogen conductor; and a screen opposingly disposed from the flame source and about the substantially cylindrical diffusion-catalytic membrane, the central axis of the screen is disposed substantially parallelly with the 10 central axis of the substantially cylindrical diffusion-catalytic membrane at a distance of about 4 cm.
