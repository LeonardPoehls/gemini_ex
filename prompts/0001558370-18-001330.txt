 Overview
 ILG, Inc. is a leading provider of professionally delivered vacation experiences and the exclusive global licensee for the Hyatt, Sheraton and Westin brands in vacation ownership. As of December 31, 2017, we have a total of 43 resorts within Vistana Signature Experiences (Vistana) and Hyatt Vacation Ownership (HVO) businesses, manage approximately 250 resorts overall, while serving more than 2 million members through our various membership and exchange programs. We operate in the following two segments: Vacation Ownership (VO) and Exchange and Rental.
 VO engages in sales, marketing, financing, and development of vacation ownership interests (VOIs); the management of vacation ownership resorts; and related services to owners and homeowners’ associations (HOAs). The sales, marketing, development, and financing services are provided through Vistana and HVO. We provide management services to more than 200 vacation ownership properties and/or their associations through Vistana, HVO, Vacation Resorts International (VRI), Trading Places International (TPI), and VRI Europe. The VO segment represented approximately 65% of ILG’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and approximately 58%

of ILG’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting the May 2016 acquisition of Vistana. 
 Exchange and Rental offers access to vacation accommodations and other travel‑related transactions and services to leisure travelers, by providing vacation exchange services and vacation rental, working with resort developers and HOAs as well as operating vacation rental properties. Vacation exchange services provide owners of vacation interests with flexibility and choice by delivering access to alternate accommodations through exchange networks encompassing a variety of resorts. Our principal exchange network administered by Interval International (referred to as Interval) is the Interval Network, in which nearly 3,200 resorts located in over 80 nations participated as of December 31, 2017. We also operate additional exchange programs including the Vistana Signature Network with 21 resorts and Hyatt Residence Club with 16 resorts, in each case as of the end of 2017, as well as exchanges through TPI. This segment provides vacation rental through the Aqua‑Aston business as part of a comprehensive package of marketing, management and rental services offered to vacation property owners including hotel and condo hotel owners, primarily of Hawaiian properties, as well as through the Interval Network and branded clubs. The Exchange and Rental segment represented approximately 35% of ILG’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2017, and approximately 42% of ILG’s consolidated revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, reflecting the May 2016 Vistana acquisition. For information regarding the results of operations of ILG and its segments on a historical basis, see Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements of ILG and the disclosure set forth under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
 History
 ILG was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in May 2008 under the name Interval Leisure Group, Inc. in connection with the spin‑off of IAC/InterActiveCorp, or IAC, into five separate publicly traded companies. ILG commenced trading on The NASDAQ Stock Market in August 2008 under the symbol “IILG” and since October 2016 trades under the symbol “ILG.”
 The businesses operated by ILG’s subsidiaries have extensive operating histories. Our Interval International business was founded in 1976, the Aqua-Aston business traces its roots in lodging back over 65 years, Trading Places International was founded in 1973, Vacation Resorts International in 1981; the Hyatt Vacation Ownership business began in 1994 and Vistana was established in 1980.
 On May 11, 2016, we acquired the vacation ownership business of Starwood, now known as Vistana. At closing, Starwood spun-off Vistana to its stockholders immediately prior to the merger of Vistana with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of ILG. In the merger, ILG issued approximately 72.4 million shares of ILG common stock to the holders who received Vistana common stock in the spin-off. Additionally, ILG directly purchased certain Mexican entities and a note receivable for total consideration of $128 million. In connection with the acquisition, Vistana entered into an exclusive, 80-year global license agreement with Starwood for the use of the Westin and Sheraton brands in vacation ownership. The global license agreement may also be extended for two 30-year terms, subject to meeting certain sales performance tests. Also, Vistana has the non-exclusive license for the existing St. Regis and The Luxury Collection vacation ownership properties and an affiliation with the Starwood Preferred Guest program.
 Industry Overview and Trends
 The hospitality industry, which includes vacation ownership and vacation rental, is a major component of the leisure travel industry.
 Vacation Ownership
 Vacation ownership generally offers a long-term or perpetual usage right in a resort-style villa or hotel style accommodation and encompasses traditional timeshare regimes, fractional products, private residence clubs, condo hotels and other forms of shared ownership, and vacation home ownership. Vacation ownership products offer many alternatives that allow vacationers to choose the product that best suits their lifestyle and travel preferences, including location, size of accommodation and time of year. Relative to hotel rooms, vacation ownership units often offer more 

 
  3

 
spacious floor plans and residential features including a living room, fully equipped kitchen, dining area and other residential features. 
 According to the American Resort Developer Association, referred to as ARDA, vacation ownership sales (excluding sales of fractional, private residence club, destination club and whole ownership products) in the U.S. for 2016, the last year for which data is available, were approximately $9.2 billion, representing an 8% compounded annual growth rate from 2014 sales of $7.9 billion. Notably, ARDA reports that U.S. timeshare resorts had an average occupancy of nearly 79% in 2016 significantly higher than average occupancy of approximately 66% at U.S. hotels for the same period. 
 As of December 31, 2016, the U.S. traditional timeshare industry was comprised of 1,558 resorts, representing approximately 206,080 units and an estimated 9.5 million vacation ownership week equivalents, according to ARDA. The most recent ARDA study on vacation owners describes the average timeshare owner as having a median household income over $81,000. Most owners are married and nearly half have children under the age of 18 in their home.
 In addition to sales, the vacation ownership industry provides financing or facilitates access to third‑party financing for customers. Customers that choose to finance their purchase generally make a down payment of 10% to 20% of the purchase price for a five to fifteen year loan. Larger timeshare companies will access the securitization markets to obtain long‑term capital and liquidity. Upon a loan default, the vacation ownership company may recover on the ownership interest securing the loan and remarket the interest for sale. 
 Vacation ownership resorts in the United States typically form not-for-profit homeowners’ associations, or HOAs, which serve at the direction of elected boards of directors. The HOA is responsible for administering the property on behalf of the owners which includes overall asset maintenance, long-term planning and, in many cases, monitoring that capital needs are met. In most resorts, the HOA hires a management company to operate the resort on a day-to-day basis. To fund the ongoing operational costs of the vacation ownership resort, each owner is required to pay a maintenance fee equal to his or her pro rata share of operating and capital expenses. In addition to operating costs, these costs often include management fees and expenses, taxes, insurance, reserves and other allocable costs. If an owner fails to pay the maintenance fee, a default occurs that may result in the loss of the owner’s interest. Upon a payment default, an HOA will endeavor to find a new owner that will pay its share of the resort costs. As such, HOAs may seek the services of a management company or other provider that has marketing and distribution capabilities to re-sell recovered ownership interests.
 Management companies may provide a range of services to HOAs, including the following:

· | administrative services for reservations, front desk, board and owner meetings,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | fiscal services for budgeting, maintaining books and records, billing and collection of assessments, and reporting,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | quality assurance inspections, maintenance, capital planning, and on-site resort operations services,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | risk management, and
--+---------------------


· | sales and marketing of HOA defaulted inventory.
--+------------------------------------------------

  Exchange and Rental Services
 Vacation exchange and rental businesses offer leisure travelers vacation accommodations at villas, condo hotels, hotels, vacation ownership units, vacation homes, and condominiums, as well as other travel‑related products and benefits. In addition, this fee‑for‑service business provides services to owners of vacation properties and developers.
 Vacation ownership users have the opportunity to enjoy the flexibility to exchange their usage rights in a given year for stays in other resorts within the developer network or with a third-party exchange company. Many vacation ownership resort developers and managers provide internal exchange services to owners within their resort systems, such as Vistana Signature Network and Hyatt Residence Club. There are two principal providers of external vacation ownership exchange services, Interval International, an ILG business, and RCI, LLC, a subsidiary of Wyndham 

 
  4

 
Worldwide Corp. TPI and several third parties also operate in this industry segment with a significantly more limited scope of available accommodations. 
 The fragmented vacation rental market includes both managed properties and those offered by owners. In general, the managed properties are better able to engage in market‑based pricing and offer hotel‑like services. Vacation rental accommodations offer value to travelers seeking more than a nightly stay by often providing greater space and convenience than traditional hotel rooms and offering separate living, sleeping and eating quarters. Rental companies also facilitate the rental process by handling most, if not all, aspects of interaction with vacationers. In addition, alternative lodging marketplaces, such as Airbnb and HomeAway, operate websites that market available furnished, privately‑owned residential properties for nightly, weekly or monthly rental.
 DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS
 Vacation Ownership
 Our VO segment engages in sales, marketing, financing, and development of VOIs; the management of vacation ownership resorts; as well as related services to owners and associations. Our businesses include the exclusive global licensees of the Hyatt, Sheraton and Westin brands in vacation ownership pursuant to long-term license agreements with Hyatt and Starwood. Revenue
 Revenue from the VO segment is derived principally from:

· | sales of VOIs by Vistana and HVO,
--+----------------------------------


· | interest income earned for financing these sales,
--+--------------------------------------------------


· | fees for resort operations and HOA management services, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | rental and ancillary revenues, including from hotels owned by Vistana and HVO.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Sales and Marketing of VOIs
 Vistana and HVO sell, market, finance, and develop vacation ownership resorts currently located in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean. Our resorts are located in attractive destinations and offer upscale accommodations with studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom options. They generally include spacious living and dining areas, master bedrooms with upgraded master bathrooms, in-unit kitchens and laundry facilities, combined with resort amenities that vary by property and may include swimming pools, a lazy river, restaurants and bars, marketplaces, fitness facilities and spas, as well as sports and recreation facilities and activity programming appropriate for a variety of vacation lifestyles. Our purchase prices vary depending on the product: number and type of points; or resort, season and unit type. The branded vacation ownership business model provides for the collection of annual maintenance fees and the establishment of capital reserves that allow our high-quality standards to be maintained.
 Vistana and HVO sell VOIs that convey direct or indirect legal ownership interests in the underlying real property either as deeded ownership interests or certificated ownership interests. These ownership interests provide a mandatory membership in an HOA along with ownership points or a traditional weekly interval that offer usage for a one‑week or other time period at a specific resort or group of resorts. One of these multi-site points programs, Sheraton Flex, was launched by Vistana in January 2015 and allows owners to have preferred access to a group of resorts that currently includes resorts in Orlando, Florida; Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; Scottsdale, Arizona; Steamboat Springs, Colorado; and Jensen Beach, Florida. HVO launched a similar multi-site program, the Hyatt Residence Club Portfolio Program, in June 2017 that currently includes inventory from resorts in Key West, Florida; Bonita Springs, Florida; San Antonio, Texas; Carmel, California; Aspen, Colorado; Lake Tahoe, Nevada; and Sedona, Arizona. Also in June 2017, Vistana launched the Westin Aventuras program which currently includes The Westin Los Cabos Resort Villas & Spa and The Westin Lagunamar Ocean Resort Villas & Spa.  Each purchaser from HVO is automatically enrolled in the Hyatt Residence Club and purchasers from Vistana generally are automatically enrolled in the Vistana Signature

Network, both of which allow owners to trade some or all of their usage rights as described below in “Description of Business Segments–Exchange and Rental.”
 In addition, we receive fees for sales and marketing, brand licensing and other services provided to properties where the developer is not controlled by us. We have global master license agreements with Hyatt and Starwood which provide us with an exclusive license for the use of the Hyatt, Sheraton and Westin brands, respectively, in vacation ownership, as described below. The Vistana Signature Network and Hyatt Residence Club resorts are able to use their respective brands through agreements with us. In the event a master license agreement terminates or following a transition period after its expiration, the applicable resorts will no longer be able to use the brand name, and any of the resorts may also lose the rights to the name in the event it does not maintain certain standards or otherwise breaches its agreements with us. 
 Marketing and Sales Activities
 Generally, we sell VOIs to prospective purchasers who attend a resort tour and sales presentation at one of our sales preview centers and learn about the benefits of ownership of our VOIs from one of our sales associates. As of December 31, 2017, we operate 25 active sales preview centers with an additional sales gallery at The Westin St. John that is currently closed. 
 Our marketing to attract potential purchasers focuses primarily on guests of our resorts and nearby same-brand hotels, existing owners and potential customers targeted through our marketing programs. We utilize a number of marketing channels to attract qualified customers to our resorts, including preview packages, trial programs, local marketing desks, partner marketing and online channels. 
 An important component of our direct marketing activities is focused on offering members of the loyalty programs associated with the Sheraton, Westin and Hyatt brands (currently the Starwood Preferred Guest Program (“SPG Program” or “SPG”) and the World of Hyatt program, as applicable) and other databases of prospective owners a subsidized branded vacation preview package to one of our resorts or a nearby hotel, to introduce these guests to the benefits of vacation ownership. Sales guests who do not purchase VOIs during their initial tour are offered a special package for another stay at one of our resorts through a trial package whereby they will participate in a subsequent sales tour. These return guests are typically twice as likely to purchase a VOI as a first-time visitor. This program provides the opportunity to experience some of the features of ownership and returning trial program guests can typically apply the package price to their ownership down payment. We also market selectively via off-premises contacts, local marketing centers in high-traffic locations near our resorts. In addition, we use a variety of partner marketing approaches and business alliances with travel, retail and financial companies. Finally, we leverage digital and social channels to connect with our customers throughout the year. We deliver valuable vacation information and create an ongoing stream of new customers while building an affinity for our vacation networks and our brands.
 We take great care in ensuring we deliver informative and branded sales presentations. Consumers place their trust in the Hyatt, Sheraton and Westin brands and preserving that trust and building on the strength of those brands will continue to attract qualified customers to our products in the future. Our premium sales gallery environments are designed to showcase our brand affiliations, travel options and destinations to allow our sales guests to explore the world through a visual presentation.
 Whether presenting to existing owners or prospective owners, we deliver a personalized presentation in a sophisticated and comfortable environment where the customers’ level of interest drives the process. These activities are delivered with care and accuracy across our sales gallery system and we survey customers who have attended a tour to capture their feedback through our quality assurance process.
 We strive to attract, train and retain a superior sales force. We extensively train our sales representatives through strong on-boarding processes and periodic recurring training programs. Our sales executives are regularly evaluated for presentation consistency, professionalism and performance.

 Inventory and Development

One way we plan to grow our revenue and operations is through increased VOI sales volume. Our pipeline of VOI inventory includes completed VOIs currently owned by us or our joint ventures, reacquired VOIs and additional VOIs that we currently plan to develop at existing locations, which represents approximately $6.5 billion of projected remaining inventory sales volume available as of December 31, 2017, including estimated returns and price increases. 

We reacquire existing VOIs in several ways including loan defaults, HOA payment defaults, exercise of certain rights of first refusal and open market purchases. In the event of a loan default, we are able to recover and return to inventory the underlying VOI. In the event of a maintenance fee default, the HOA will recover the owner’s VOI. We have entered into inventory recovery agreements with certain of our HOAs that provide us the right to purchase those VOIs. Terms of those agreements vary, including the purchase price.

Recovered VOI inventory may be sold by us to new customers or existing owners at full retail value. Once we reacquire a VOI, we are generally responsible for paying that VOI’s share of maintenance dues beginning in the year after we take title until the product is sold. Although the volume of VOIs that we recover could fluctuate in the future for various reasons, in each of 2017, 2016 and 2015, we have recovered in the ordinary course of business through these sources less than 5% of the total VOIs cumulatively sold to and owned by our owners at the beginning of each respective year.
 During 2017 we opened nearly 700 units, The Westin Los Cabos Resort Villas & Spa (179 units), The Westin Nanea Ocean Villas (390 units), as well as additional phases at The Westin Desert Willow Villas, Palm Desert (16 units), and Sheraton Steamboat Resort (112 units). We had also completed additional units at The Westin St. John Resort Villas, however, due to Hurricane Irma, the entire resort remains closed. Additional units completed at Hyatt Wild Oak Ranch (24 units) and The Westin Desert Willow, Palm Desert (26 units) opened in early 2018.

Additionally, we began conversion of the The Westin Cancun Resort & Spa and the Sheraton Kauai Resort, that had previously been operated as hotels. We also began development of additional phases at Hyatt Residence Club Coconut Plantation and are planning to develop additional phases at several resorts over the next three to five years.

Costs incurred to date and expended in the future to complete the development of these properties is recorded in either inventory or property and equipment, net on our consolidated balance sheets. The costs recorded to property and equipment, net are related to the developer retained assets within the projects. See “Risk Factors” for further discussion of risks associated with real estate development activities.

In the future, we may pursue growth opportunities targeting the acquisition or development of inventory in new locations. We may pursue these opportunities independently, with third-party developers or outside capital sources.

  Consumer Financing
 In connection with the sales of VOIs, we provide financing to eligible purchasers collateralized by the VOIs. These loans generally bear interest at a fixed rate and have a term of five to fifteen years. As of December 31, 2017, our consolidated loan portfolio consisted of approximately 57,000 loans with an outstanding balance of $722 million, net of allowance for loan losses on originated loans, and a weighted average interest rate of 13.4%. During the last two years 

 
  9

 
(including Vistana’s experience prior to the acquisition), approximately 70% of our consolidated sales were financed, while typically about 32% of loans we issue are repaid in full within 180 days based on average historical experience. 
 As loan payments are made, the nature of these generally fully-amortizing loans establishes an increasing level of owner financial commitment in their purchase which reduces the likelihood of default. When a customer defaults, we ultimately return their VOI to inventory for resale, and that customer no longer participates in the applicable network. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our loan portfolio had an actual default rate of 4.5%. 
 For those customers seeking financing, we apply the credit evaluation score methodology developed by the Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) to credit files compiled and maintained by a credit reporting bureau. Higher credit scores equate to lower credit risk and lower credit scores equate to higher credit risk. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average FICO score of our vacation ownership notes receivable at the time of origination for the past twelve months was 737.
 In underwriting each loan, we obtain a credit application and review the application for completeness. We generally require a minimum down payment of 10% of the purchase price on all sales of VOIs. Our down payment requirements from borrowers are influenced by their length of credit history, country of residence and credit profile.
 Our underwriting standards are influenced by the changing economic and financial market conditions. We have the ability to modify our down payment requirements and credit thresholds in the face of stronger or weaker market conditions. Our underwriting standards have resulted in a strong, well-seasoned consumer loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2017, our serviced VOI customer loan portfolio exhibited the following characteristics:

· | Weighted Average Original Length of Loan: 11 years
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | Weighted Average Remaining Length of Loan: 9 years
--+---------------------------------------------------


· | Delinquency Rate on Originated Loans (31-120 days past due): 3.5%
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

  We have a skilled consumer finance team. This team is responsible for loan customer servicing, which includes billing, collections and credit reporting, reacquisition of inventory collateralizing defaulted loans, and monitoring portfolio performance. Our in-house training program includes product and sales information, purchase documents, consumer privacy, system security, state and Federal legislation and department procedures related to loan servicing and collection. Accounts more than 30 days past due are reported as delinquent. A loan that is more than 120 days past due is charged off for financial accounting purposes (for originated loans) and may then be recovered through foreclosure or a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. In the deed-in-lieu of foreclosure process, the customer deeds (or assigns, in the case of any certificated membership interests) the VOI back to us. For domestic owners, this process takes approximately 60 to 90 days. At the end of the recovery process, we return the VOI into inventory.
 Management and Ancillary Services
 We provide management services to over 200 vacation ownership properties and/or their associations through Vistana, HVO, TPI, VRI and VRI Europe. As of December 31, 2017:

· | Vistana provides management services to 24 vacation ownership resorts in the United States, Mexico and the Caribbean; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HVO provides management services for 16 vacation ownership resorts throughout the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | VRI Europe manages 26 vacation ownership resorts in Spain and the Canary Islands, the United Kingdom, France and Portugal, including resorts developed by our joint venture partner, CLC World Resorts,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | TPI and VRI provide property management, HOA management and related services to nearly 150 vacation ownership resorts in the United States, Canada and Mexico.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  All of these businesses provide resort management services for vacation ownership resorts, which, in the United States are governed by a board of directors comprised of owner or developer representatives that are charged with ensuring the resorts are well-maintained and financially stable. Our services may include day-to-day operations of the 

 
  10

 
resorts, maintenance of the resorts, preparation of reports, budgets, HOA administration, risk management, quality assurance and employee training. 
 Our management services are provided pursuant to agreements with terms generally ranging from one to ten years (with several indefinite-lived contracts in Europe) many of which are automatically renewable. For the Vistana and HVO resorts, retaining us as the manager provides the properties with continued use of the Hyatt, Sheraton or Westin trademarks and the owners with continued access to the Vistana Signature Network and SPG Program or the Hyatt Residence Club and World of Hyatt program, in accordance with our agreements with Starwood and Hyatt and subject to compliance with brand standards. Management fees are negotiated amounts for management and other specified services, and at times (including for most of the Vistana and HVO properties) are based on a cost plus arrangement. Generally, our management fees are paid by the HOA and funded from the annual maintenance fees paid by the individual owners to the association. These maintenance fees represent each owner’s allocable share of the costs of operating and maintaining the resorts, which generally includes personnel, property taxes, insurance, a capital asset reserve to fund refurbishment and other related costs. The management fees we earn are highly predictable due to the relatively fixed nature of resort operating expenses. We are reimbursed for the costs incurred to perform our services, principally related to personnel providing on-site services. 
 In addition, if a property owner defaults on payment of its maintenance or management fees, the HOA has the right to recover the defaulting owner’s VOI. As a service to the HOA, we may assume the defaulted owner’s obligations in exchange for an agreed purchase price or assist the HOA in contracting with a third party to resell this inventory.
 Most of VRI Europe’s revenue is based on a different model. Typically, VRI Europe charges vacation owners directly an annual fee intended to cover property management, all resort operating expenses and a management profit. Consequently, VRI Europe’s business model normally operates at a lower gross margin than the other management businesses, when excluding pass‑through revenue.
 Vistana, HVO, TPI and VRI also offer vacation rental services to HOAs and, in some cases, individual VOI owners as well as renting owned inventory in vacation ownership resorts and hotels. Rentals of branded units are made through Hyatt or Starwood distribution channels, third party online travel agencies and our marketing channels, while VRI and TPI inventory is rented online directly to consumers through our websites, www.vriresorts.com, and www.tradingplaces.com, and third party online travel agencies as well as through Interval for use as Getaways. Rental expenses include maintenance fees on owned inventory, subsidy payments to property owner associations at resorts that are in the early phases of construction or sales where maintenance fees collected from the owners are not sufficient to support operating costs of the resort and marketing costs and direct operating and related expenses in connection with the rental business (e.g., housekeeping, credit card expenses and reservation services). We provide food and beverage, retail, golf, spa and other services to our owners, guests and customers and earn fees and other revenues typically associated with these activities and experiences.
 Master License Agreements
 We have license agreements with each of Starwood and Hyatt that provide:

· | Vistana the exclusive global use of the Westin and Sheraton brands in vacation ownership and use of the St. Regis and Luxury Collection brands for specific fractional resorts; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | HVO the exclusive global use of the Hyatt brand in vacation ownership.

  Pursuant to the terms of these license agreements, the relevant business may continue to develop, market, sell and operate existing vacation ownership projects as well as new Hyatt, Sheraton or Westin branded vacation ownership projects agreed to by us and either Starwood or Hyatt, as applicable. HVO must comply with designated Hyatt brand standards and Vistana must comply with designated Westin and Sheraton brand standards, with respect to the operation of the applicable licensed business. The Vistana license has an initial term through 2095 with two 30-year renewals and the HVO license has an initial term through 2093 with three 20-year renewals. In each case the renewals are subject to meeting sales performance tests. In consideration for the licenses, we have agreed to pay Starwood a base royalty fee of $30 million per year plus a variable royalty fee of 2% of the gross sales price of applicable inventory, while we agreed to 

 
  11

 
pay Hyatt certain recurring royalty fees based on revenues generated from vacation ownership sales, management, rental and club dues collected by us related to the branded business.
 Our agreements with Starwood and Hyatt provide access to the SPG and World of Hyatt programs for sales incentives, exchange as well as marketing channels to source prospective customers.
 Both licenses contain restrictions on transfers by us without Starwood’s or Hyatt’s written consent of (1) the license agreement, (2) all or substantially all of the relevant licensed business or (3) a transaction or series of transactions that result in a “change of control” of ILG or Vistana or HVO. 
 Written consent is not required for a “change of control” of ILG if on the date of the transaction that results in a “change of control” (1) ILG is publicly traded, or (2) ILG is not publicly traded but earnings from the licensed business do not comprise substantially all (90% for Hyatt license) of ILG’s EBITDA at such time; provided that the following conditions are satisfied as of the date of the transaction that resulted in a “change of control” of ILG (a) there are no uncured agreement level defaults, (b) all royalty fees have been paid, and (c) the transferee is not a competitor of the licensor in the hotel, vacation ownership or, for the Starwood license, certain similar transient stay distribution businesses. Vistana’s license also contains a maximum leverage ratio for an acquirer.
 Starwood and Hyatt may terminate their respective license agreement upon the occurrence of certain uncured, material defaults by us. Such defaults include, but are not limited to, a sizable payment default, bankruptcy, a transfer in breach of the specified transfer restrictions or a material failure to comply with brand standards on a systemic level.
 Exchange and Rental
 Our Exchange and Rental segment offers access to vacation accommodations and other travel‑related transactions and services to leisure travelers, by providing vacation exchange services and vacation rental, working with resort developers and HOAs as well as operating vacation rental properties. Vacation Exchange
 Exchange Services
 We offer leisure and travel‑related products and services to owners of VOIs and others primarily through various membership programs, as well as related services to resort developer clients and HOAs. Vacation exchange allows owners of VOIs to exchange their occupancy rights (whether denominated in weeks or points) for comparable, alternative accommodations at another resort and/or occupancy period or for other vacation experiences.
· | Interval Network. Our primary exchange offering is the Interval Network, a membership‑based exchange program which also provides a comprehensive package of value‑added products and services. As of December 31, 2017, the Interval Network consisted of nearly 3,200 resorts located in over 80 nations and approximately 1.8 million member families. Generally, individuals are enrolled by resort developers in connection with their purchase of VOIs from such resort developers, with initial membership fees being paid on behalf of members by the resort developers. Members may also enroll directly, for instance, when they purchase a VOI through resale or HOA affiliation at a resort that participates in the Interval Network. The Interval Network has established multi‑year relationships with resort developers, including leading independent and brand name developers, under exclusive affiliation agreements. The resorts participating in the Interval Network primarily include those with which Interval has an affiliation or inventory agreement in place, as well as resorts at which Interval continues to provide exchange services following the affiliation agreement’s term. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      After their initial membership period, certain Interval Network members have the option of renewing their memberships for terms ranging from one to five years and paying their own membership fees directly to us. We sometimes refer to these as traditional members. Alternatively, some resort developers incorporate the Interval Network membership fee into certain annual fees they charge to 

 
  12

 
owners of VOIs at their resorts or vacation ownership clubs, which results in these owners having their membership in the Interval Network and, where applicable, the Interval Gold or Interval Platinum program (as described below), automatically renewed through the period of their resort’s or club’s participation in the Interval Network. We sometimes refer to these as corporate members.
     All vacation ownership accommodations relinquished to the Interval Network exchange programs are assigned a trading value based on multiple factors, including location, quality, seasonality, unit attributes and time of relinquishment prior to occupancy to determine the relinquished accommodations’ relative exchange value to the exchange network. Members are offered an exchange to accommodations which are generally of comparable trading value to those relinquished.
     The Interval Network’s resort recognition program recognizes certain of its eligible Interval Network resorts as either a “Select Resort,” a “Select Boutique Resort,” a “Premier Resort,” a “Premier Boutique Resort,” an “Elite Resort” or an “Elite Boutique Resort” based upon the satisfaction of qualifying criteria, inspection, member feedback, and other resort‑specific factors. Over 40% of Interval Network resorts were recognized as a Select, Select Boutique, Premier, Premier Boutique, Elite or Elite Boutique Resort as of December 31, 2017.
    
· | Vistana Signature Network. As of December 31, 2017, Vistana’s internal points-based exchange program, the Vistana Signature Network, or VSN, provides its more than 175,000 members with access to its 21 affiliated resorts as well as the opportunity to exchange through the SPG program to Starwood resorts, through the Interval Network or for a cruise. Based on the point value of the home resort unit owned, customers can choose other VSN resorts, the type of villa, the date of travel and the length of stay. VSN members have a four-month period where they have exclusive rights to occupancy at the related resort or points program without competition from other network members. During this home resort period, they can reserve vacation time based on the season and unit type purchased.

· | Hyatt Residence Club. As of December 31, 2017, this points‑based membership exchange system serves nearly 33,000 owners at 16 properties, providing them with access to the 16 Hyatt Residence Club resorts as well as the opportunity to trade their club points for World of Hyatt points which may be redeemed at participating Hyatt branded properties and exchange through the Interval Network. Owners will receive Hyatt Residence Club points if they have not reserved at their home resort or points program during their allotted preference period or if they elect to convert to points earlier. The use of the Hyatt name in connection with the Hyatt Residence Club is governed by the Master License Agreement with Hyatt described above.

· | Trading Places International. Trading Places Classic provides exchange services to owners at certain of our managed timeshare properties as well as other direct‑to‑consumer exchanges that do not require a membership fee.

· | Sales and Marketing Support for Interval Network resorts. Resort developers promote membership in our exchange programs and related value‑added services as an important benefit of owning a VOI. We offer developers a selection of sales and marketing materials. These materials, many of which are available in multiple languages, include brochures, publications, sales‑office displays, resort directories and Interval HD, an online video channel featuring resort and destination overviews. In addition, we offer programs, including our Leisure Time Passport program, that resort developers use as a trial membership program for potential purchasers of VOIs.

· | Operational Support for Interval Network resorts. Our Interval business also makes available a comprehensive array of back‑office servicing solutions to resort developers and resorts. For example, for an additional fee, we provide reservation services and billing and collection of maintenance fees and other amounts due to developers or HOAs. In addition, through consulting arrangements, we assist resort developers in the design of tailored vacation programs for owners of VOIs.

  Revenue
 Our Exchange and Rental segment earns most of its vacation exchange revenue from (i) fees paid for membership in the Interval Network, the Vistana Signature Network and the Hyatt Residence Club and (ii) Interval Network, Vistana Signature Network and Hyatt Residence Club transactional and service fees paid primarily for exchanges, Getaways, reservation servicing, and related transactions collectively referred to as “transaction revenue.” Revenue is also derived from club rentals, fees for ancillary products and services provided to members, fees from other exchange and rental programs and other products and services sold to developers. Marketing 
 Our exchange businesses maintain corporate and consumer marketing departments that are responsible for implementing marketing strategies and developing printed and digital materials that are necessary to promote membership participation, exchange opportunities and other value‑added services to existing members as well as for the Interval International business to secure new relationships with resort developers, HOAs and resorts to obtain and retain members.
 Our consumer marketing efforts revolve around the deepening of new and existing customer relationships and increasing engagement and loyalty of members through a number of channels including direct mail, email, telemarketing, and online distribution. In addition to resort directories, magazines and newsletters, ILG’s exchange companies engage with their members through a number of online resources to encourage sharing of experiences and communication with one another about vacation ownership, travel and ways to maximize their memberships. Interval International hosts the members‑only Interval Community at intervalworld.com, and each of Interval, Vistana Signature Network and Hyatt Residence Club are utilizing social media channels like Facebook and Instagram to inspire vacations, share stories and promote the vacation ownership lifestyle.
 Interval also markets products and services to resort developers and other parties in the vacation ownership industry through a series of business development initiatives. Our sales and services personnel proactively seek to establish strong relationships with developers and HOAs, providing input on consumer preferences and industry trends 

 
  14

 
based upon years of experience. We believe that we have established a strong reputation within the vacation ownership industry as being highly responsive to the needs of resort developers, HOAs, management companies and owners of VOIs. In addition, we sponsor, participate in and attend numerous industry conferences around the world, including our co‑sponsored proprietary, multi‑day informational seminar, known as the International Shared Ownership Investment Conference. For the last 17 years, this event allows real estate developers, hospitality companies, investors and others contemplating entry into the vacation ownership industry to meet and network with industry leaders, as well as participate in educational panels on various vacation ownership issues, such as property and program planning, sales and marketing, financing and regulatory requirements. We have also maintained leadership roles in various industry trade organizations throughout the world since their inception, through which we have been a driving force in the promotion of growth of the industry and constructive legislation, both in the U.S. and abroad, principally aimed at creating or enhancing consumer protection in the vacation ownership industry. 
 Vacation Rental
 We provide vacation rental as the key part of a comprehensive package of marketing, management and rental services offered to vacation property owners, through Aqua‑Aston. As of December 31, 2017, Aqua‑Aston provided vacation rental and/or management services to over 40 hotels and resorts primarily in Hawaii, as well as Orlando, Florida, and South Lake Tahoe, California.
 This business provides vacation property rental services for condominium owners, hotel owners, and HOAs. The condominium rental properties are generally investment properties, and, to a lesser extent, second homes, owned by individuals who contract with Aqua‑Aston directly to manage, market and rent their properties, generally pursuant to short‑term agreements. We also offer such owners a comprehensive package of marketing, management and rental services designed to enhance rental income and profitability. Generally, property and HOA management services, including administrative, fiscal and quality assurance services, are provided pursuant to exclusive agreements with terms typically ranging from one to ten years or more, many of which are automatically renewable. As of December 31, 2017, average tenure of these contracts was more than 15 years.
 Revenue is derived principally from fees for rental services and related management of hotel, condominium resort, and HOA management. Management fees consist of a base management fee and, in some instances for hotels or condominium resorts, an incentive management fee which is generally a percentage of operating profits or improvement in operating profits. Service fee revenue is based on the services provided to owners including reservations, sales and marketing, property accounting and information technology services either internally or through third party providers.
 Important to the success and continued growth of the vacation rental business is our ability to source vacationers interested in booking vacation properties made available through our rental services. Our sales and marketing team in Honolulu, Hawaii, utilizes a variety of sales, marketing, revenue management and digital marketing initiatives to attract consumers and additional properties to Aqua‑Aston. The team in Hawaii utilizes many channels of distribution including traditional wholesale through tour operators and travel partners, online travel agencies and the Global Distribution System. In addition, Aqua‑Aston focuses on driving direct business through channels such as brand websites and our central reservations office. The sales team covers several market segments from corporate and government/military to travel agents and groups with a focus on the US, Canada, Australia, Europe, Japan, China and Korea. In many of these markets we have field sales personnel. We offer a variety of leisure accommodations to visitors from around the world through consumer websites such as, www.astonhotels.com, www.aquaresorts.com, www.aquahospitality.com, and www.mauicondo.com. As an additional distribution channel, Aqua‑Aston provides units to Interval for use as Getaways.
 Technology
 Our success also depends on our ability to provide prompt, accurate and complete service to our members through voice and data networks and proprietary and third party information systems. The technology platform for the Interval Network is a proprietary, custom developed enterprise application and database that manages all aspects of membership, exchange and Getaway transaction processing and inventory management. TPI uses a separate proprietary application for its exchange program. Both VSE and HVO use customized third-party applications to service their 

 
  15

 
owners, manage their properties and market and sell vacation ownership interests. We also use advanced telecommunications systems and technologies to intelligently and efficiently route member calls, monitor calls, manage our service-center workforce and provide voice self-service capabilities to our customers. In addition, we operate consumer websites for our members and participants, such as www.intervalworld.com, www.vistana.com, www.hyattresidenceclub.com, www.ltp.com and www.tradingplaces.com. Interval provides services to their members using a mobile app for Getaway transactions. We are also in the process of expanding consumer-facing mobile capabilities for Interval, VSE, HVO and other subsidiaries.
 ILG has implemented robust administrative, physical, and technical security controls and training that are designed to reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of network, system infrastructure, and electronic data, by having deployed sensitive data unauthorized access management and monitoring; data loss prevention; system file integrity monitoring; 24/7 incident handling; security vulnerability management; intrusion detection; sensitive data encryption and tokenization; network and application protection; and, digital forensics and breach investigation solutions and processes.  Furthermore, we believe we are compliant with PCI Data Security Standards at December 31, 2017.
 Our Competitive Strengths
 We expect to further our leadership role in the industry by leveraging our strengths, which include:
 Meaningful contribution from contractual and recurring revenue streams

· | We receive annual membership dues and recurring transaction fees from approximately 1.8 million members of Interval International as of December 31, 2017. We also receive club dues and transaction fees from over 200,000 members of Hyatt Residence Club and Vistana Signature Network at year end 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | We provide vacation ownership management services through cost-plus or fee-for-service agreements to HOAs at over 200 resorts in North America and Europe as of December 31, 2017.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our consumer finance business drives stable and recurring revenues from interest income earned on our $722 million vacation ownership notes receivables portfolio at year end 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Our Aqua-Aston business provides fee-for-service rental management services at more than 40 properties primarily located in Hawaii as of December 31, 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Compelling growth profile fueled by existing inventory and identified growth projects 
 We have significant available existing inventory as well as identified growth opportunities including additional phases at existing resorts and hotel conversions. Our current vacation ownership properties and this development pipeline provides us with approximately $6.5 billion in expected sales value of inventory in highly desirable resort locations to be realized over time. The estimated over 1,900 additional units in our pipeline are planned either as conversions of hotels in our portfolio or on land we own.   
 Development expertise
 Our development team has a long and successful record of strategically sourcing, evaluating and developing resorts in the most sought-after vacation destinations. Vistana and HVO have developed approximately 7,000 VOI units across the United States, the Caribbean and Mexico. 
 Exclusive global master licenses to the Hyatt, Sheraton and Westin brands in vacation ownership
 We have global rights in vacation ownership to three of the leading upper upscale hospitality brands. Our long-term license agreements give us the exclusive right to market, sell and lease VOI inventory and manage vacation ownership resorts under the Hyatt, Sheraton and Westin brands. Our affiliation agreements with their loyalty programs, SPG and World of Hyatt provide us with customer acquisition and product use benefits. SPG has more than 1,500 affiliated locations in nearly 100 countries. World of Hyatt has over 700 affiliated hotels and over 10 million members. We believe that the unique position of being partnered with three distinct brands, owned by two different hotel companies, results in greater and more diversified growth opportunities.   

 
  16

 

 Diversified and complementary businesses 

We have a well-diversified and balanced portfolio which includes contractual and recurring revenue streams from our exchange and club, management and financing businesses, as well as organic high growth opportunities embedded in our vacation ownership sales and marketing platform. This diverse portfolio benefits from significant synergies across the businesses, proven stability through business cycles in the exchange and management businesses’, as well as an identified growth pipeline. 
 World-class resorts in key locations across different brands
 We have an unparalleled collection of resorts across the Vistana and HVO portfolios, located in exciting beach, mountain and desert destinations across North America and the Caribbean. Our resorts range from boutique properties in exclusive locations, such as the 15-unit Residences at Park Hyatt in Beaver Creek, to Sheraton Vistana Villages’ more than 1,500-unit family-focused campus. This uniquely positions us to address customers with distinct demographics, brand affiliations and vacation interests. The resorts, which provide world-class branded experiences to our owners and guests, will be complemented by new beachfront properties in Cancun, Puerto Vallarta and Kauai, as well as additional units in existing destinations. 
 Experienced management team 
 Our experienced management team is headed by Craig M. Nash, our Chairman, President and CEO, who has led ILG since its inception in 2008, and its predecessor company, Interval International since 1989.  Beginning in 2007, Mr. Nash has spearheaded our successful diversification from an independent exchange company to a leading provider of professionally delivered vacation experiences.  Our executive officers, including Sergio D. Rivera and Jeanette E. Marbert, the leaders of our Vacation Ownership and Exchange and Rental segments, have decades of experience in the vacation ownership and hospitality industries, overseeing complex international sales, marketing, financial, resort operation and exchange infrastructure.
 Business and Growth Strategies
 Grow VOI sales and associated club, management, rental and consumer financing revenue

We plan to grow our VOI sales and related club, rental, management and consumer financing revenue by leveraging our globally-recognized brands, marketing to our existing ownership bases of more than 220,000 and nearly 33,000 owner-families in our Vistana and HVO properties, respectively, for additional sales, and enhancing our sales distribution to new buyers. We expect revenue growth will primarily originate from the development and sale of VOIs in existing markets, as well as VOI sales from converted hotels in new markets, supported by additional distribution through new sales centers. We also believe we can improve the overall effectiveness of our sales process as we are able to offer an increasing variety of new resorts and other product enhancements we may introduce over time. In addition, we may collaborate with third parties to add properties to the Vistana Signature Network or Hyatt Residence Club, including through asset and capital‑light structures. 
 Continue to successfully leverage synergies across our portfolio
 As we continue to grow, we have notable opportunities to leverage scale, resources, expertise and best practices across our businesses. Through shared services for a number of administrative functions, we are able to focus our resources on core activities leading to efficiencies and synergies across business lines. In particular, we have made progress in harmonizing the processes and competencies for the Vacation Ownership segment. We believe there are additional opportunities for further integration.
 Selectively pursue compelling new business opportunities 
 We intend to selectively pursue potential joint ventures, acquisitions, and other business arrangements that focus on vacation ownership and complementary businesses. Acquisitions have been an important part of our business strategy over the past 10 years. Going forward, these activities may be used to expand Vistana Signature Network, Hyatt Residence Club or other vacation ownership, exchange and rental businesses, provide cross‑selling opportunities, or otherwise enhance or complement existing operations and strategy. Potential areas of focus include adding vacation ownership resorts in urban and other large markets where we can obtain enhanced marketing distribution and opportunities to diversify the membership and exchange business offerings outside the traditional shared ownership space.

 
  17

 

 Continue to expand internationally

We intend to leverage our global operations to continue to grow in international markets. We have significant experience operating internationally through Interval International which today has offices in 15 countries and member resorts in more than 80 nations, and our VRI Europe vacation ownership management joint venture which manages resorts across four European countries.  We also manage resorts in Mexico and the Caribbean. Our international operations enable us to have a more diversified portfolio, broader expertise and global business relationships to foster future growth, including further expansion of the Hyatt, Sheraton and Westin brands in vacation ownership. 
 Maintain an efficient balance sheet

We expect to maintain a prudent level of debt to help ensure access to capital commensurate with our operating needs and growth profile. We intend to meet our liquidity needs through operating cash flow, credit facilities and continued access to the asset-backed financing market. We believe that as a result of our balance sheet strength, and the significant contribution from recurring revenues, we are well-positioned to fund our growth plans and take advantage of strategic acquisition opportunities. Further, we intend to regularly review capital efficient opportunities, balancing our capital structure strategy with stockholder returns. 
 International Operations
 We conduct operations through offices in the U.S. and 14 other countries. For the year ended December 31, 2017, revenue is sourced from over 100 countries worldwide. Other than the United States, no revenue sourced from any individual country or geographic region exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
 Geographic information on revenue, based on sourcing, and long‑lived assets, based on physical location, is presented in the table below (in millions).

  Competition
 Vacation Ownership
 Our vacation ownership business competes with other branded and independent vacation ownership developers for sales of VOIs based principally on location, quality of accommodations, price, financing terms, quality of service, terms of property use, opportunity for vacation ownership owners to exchange into time at other vacation ownership properties or other program benefits as well as brand name recognition and reputation. We also compete for talent, marketing channels and new projects. Principal competitors of Vistana and HVO in the sale of vacation ownership products include Diamond Resorts, Disney Vacation Club, Hilton Grand Vacations Club, Marriott Vacation Club 

 
  18

 
Worldwide, and Wyndham Vacation Ownership. A number of the competitors in this business are larger with greater resources, distribution platforms, sales capabilities and access to capital for new projects than our business. Our ability to attract and retain purchasers of VOIs depends on our success in distinguishing the quality and value of our vacation ownership offerings from those offered by others. 
 The vacation ownership management businesses face competition from other management companies, developers and clubs. The principal competitive factors in VRI and TPI attracting HOAs and vacation property owners are the ability to provide comprehensive management services at competitive prices and increasingly the ability to assist in the sale of defaulted inventory. In addition, there are low barriers to entry for new competitors.
 Exchange and Rental
 Our main vacation exchange business, Interval International, principally competes for developer and consumer market share with RCI. TPI and several third parties operate in this industry with a significantly more limited scope of available accommodations. This business also faces increasing competition from points‑based vacation clubs and large resort developers, which operate their own internal exchange systems to facilitate exchanges for owners of VOIs at their resorts as they increase in size and scope. Increased consolidation in the industry enhances this competition. In addition, vacation clubs and resort developers may have direct exchange relationships with other developers.
 We believe that developers and HOAs generally choose to affiliate with an exchange network based on:
 •the quality of resorts participating in the network;
 •the level of service provided to members;
 •the range and level of support services;
 •the flexibility of the exchange program;
 •the demographics of the membership base;
 •the costs for annual membership and exchanges; and
 •the continuity of management and its strategic relationships within the industry.
 Based on the most recent disclosure statements filed by RCI and Interval for the year ended December 31, 2016, RCI had approximately 3.8 million vacation exchange members and its network for vacation ownership included a total of approximately 4,300 resorts while the Interval Network, at that date, had approximately 1.8 million members and included approximately 3,000 resorts.
 While overall, RCI has a greater number of resorts in its exchange network and reports a larger number of owners of VOIs participating in its vacation ownership membership programs, we believe that the Interval Network has distinguished itself as the membership and exchange provider for developers of high quality vacation ownership properties and their owners. This belief is based primarily on the quality of the resorts in the Interval Network and related services provided by these resorts, coupled with favorable membership demographics and a continued commitment to attract distinctive resorts to the network and foster memorable vacation experiences for its members.
 We also compete with hotels and other leisure accommodations providers for vacationers on the basis of our range of available accommodations, price, locations, and amenities. In addition, we compete with alternative lodging marketplaces such as Airbnb and HomeAway, which operate websites that market available furnished, privately‑owned 

 
  19

 
residential properties, including homes and condominiums, in locations throughout the world, which can be rented on a nightly, weekly or monthly basis.
 Seasonality
 Revenue at ILG is influenced by the seasonal nature of travel. Within our Vacation Ownership segment, our sales and financing business experiences a modest impact from seasonality, with higher sales volumes during the traditional vacation periods. Our vacation ownership management businesses by and large do not experience significant seasonality, with the exception of our resort operations revenue which tends to be higher in the first quarter.
 Within our Exchange and Rental segment, our vacation exchange businesses generally recognize exchange and Getaway revenue based on confirmation of the vacation, with the first quarter generally experiencing higher revenue and the fourth quarter generally experiencing lower revenue. Remaining rental revenue is based on occupancy. For the vacation rental business, the first and third quarters generally generate higher revenue as a result of increased leisure travel to our Hawaii‑based managed properties during these periods, and the second and fourth quarters generally generate lower revenue. 
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, ILG had approximately 11,600 employees worldwide. With the exception of employees at one property in Hawaii, one property in California, one property in Puerto Rico and employees in Argentina, Brazil, Italy, Mexico and Spain, employees are not represented by unions or collective bargaining agreements. ILG believes that relationships with its employees are generally good. Intellectual Property
 In addition to the license agreements with Starwood and Hyatt described above, we have a broad intellectual property portfolio, including service marks, trademarks and domain names, copyrights, trade secrets and similar intellectual property (as applicable), which we view as critical to our success. Our businesses also rely heavily upon proprietary software, informational databases and other components that make up their products and services. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use trade secret or copyrighted intellectual property without authorization which, if discovered, might require legal action to correct. In addition, third parties may independently and lawfully develop substantially similar intellectual properties.
 We have generally registered and continue to apply to register, or secure by contract when appropriate, our trademarks and service marks as they are developed and used, and reserve and register domain names as we deem appropriate. We generally consider the protection of our trademarks to be important for purposes of brand maintenance and reputation. While we protect our trademarks, service marks and domain names, effective trademark protection may not be available or may not be sought in every country in which products and services are made available, and contractual disputes may affect the use of marks governed by private contract. 
 Government Regulation
 Our businesses are subject to and affected by international, federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies, which are subject to change. The descriptions of the laws, regulations and policies that follow are summaries of those which we believe to be most relevant to our business and do not purport to cover all of the laws, regulations and 

 
  20

 
policies that affect our businesses. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws, regulations and policies.
 Regulations Generally Applicable to Our Business
 Anti-corruption.  Our business is subject to anti-discrimination, anti-fraud, and anti-corruption and bribery laws and regulations or government economic sanctions, including applicable regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”). The FCPA and similar anti-corruption and bribery laws in other jurisdictions, such as the U.K. Bribery Act, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and others for the purpose of obtaining or generating business.
 Privacy and Data Collection. The collection and use of personal data of our customers, as well as the sharing of our customer data with affiliates and third parties, are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted in the United States, Europe, Mexico and in other jurisdictions around the world. For instance, a number of jurisdictions require compliance with standards for data collection and protection of privacy as well as requirements regarding the disclosure of data policies and restrictions of use of data without the prescribed manner of consent. In some instances, penalties apply for failure to notify customers when the security of a company’s electronic/computer systems designed to protect such standards are breached. In the EU, the 2016 General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) introduces new rights and enhances rights provided to consumers, employees and vendors under prior privacy laws, including information, data access, processing restrictions, breach notification and data portability rights. The GDPR also places greater emphasis on the documentation that businesses must keep. Our businesses are currently reviewing policies and procedures to demonstrate compliance by the May 25, 2018 deadline.
 Marketing Operations. The products and services offered by our various businesses are marketed through a number of distribution channels, each of which is regulated at the federal and state level. Such regulations may limit our ability to solicit new customers or to market additional products or services to existing customers. For example, to comply with state and federal regulations on telemarketing, our affected businesses have adopted processes to routinely identify and remove phone numbers listed on the various “do not call” registries from our calling lists and have instituted procedures for preventing unsolicited or otherwise unauthorized telemarketing calls. In addition, where appropriate, our business has registered as a telemarketer and has adopted calling practices compliant with requirements of the applicable jurisdiction, such as restrictions on the methods and timing of telemarketing calls and limitations on the percentage of abandoned calls generated through the use of automated telephone‑dialing equipment or software. Our business has taken steps to identify cellular telephone numbers to prevent them from being called through the use of automated dialers without consent.
 Similarly, state and federal regulations may place limitations on our ability to engage our consumers in electronic mail marketing campaigns. Most notably, the CAN‑SPAM Act imposes various requirements on the transmission of e‑mail messages whose primary purpose is to advertise or promote a commercial product or service. Some foreign jurisdictions in which we operate have similar regulations. Our affected businesses have adopted e‑mail messaging practices responsive to the requirements of such regulations.
 Travel regulations. Certain travel products and services that we provide are subject to various federal, state and local regulations. We must comply with laws and regulations that relate to our marketing and sales of such products and services, including laws and regulations that prohibit unfair and deceptive advertising or practices, prize, gift and sweepstakes laws, and laws that require us to register as a “seller of travel” to comply with disclosure requirements. In addition, we are directly or indirectly affected by the regulation of our travel suppliers, many of which are heavily regulated by the United States and other jurisdictions.
 Regulations Applicable to Vacation Ownership Sales and the Exchange Business
 Our vacation ownership business is subject to laws and regulations that govern the development of vacation ownership properties and the sale of VOIs. Developers are generally required to register in the state where the vacation property is located as well as each state in which sales or certain types of marketing programs will be offered. The laws 

 
  21

 
of most states require resort developers to file a detailed offering statement describing their business and all material aspects of the project and sale of VOIs with a designated state authority. Laws in many jurisdictions where VOIs are sold grant the purchaser of a VOI the right to cancel a contract of purchase at any time within a specified rescission period following the earlier of the date the contract was signed or the date the purchaser has received the last of the documents required to be provided. Our sales and marketing practices are subject to regulations implementing the USA PATRIOT Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act as well as various federal and state fair housing laws, while our financing operations are subject to the requirements of the Truth‑in‑Lending Act as well as the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”).
 Certain jurisdictions regulate exchange services, generally requiring us to annually prepare and file disclosure guides in such jurisdictions. In the European Union, a Timeshare Directive has been implemented by member states. This directive imposes requirements on businesses offering timeshare exchange relating to disclosures, rescission and timing of acceptance of initial membership payment to the exchange provider. We have implemented compliance measures as national laws have been adopted by member states pursuant to this directive.
 In addition, several jurisdictions in the future may enact regulations that would impose or increase taxes on members that complete exchanges, similar to local transient occupancy taxes.
 Real Estate Development. Our real estate development activities are regulated under a number of different timeshare, condominium and land sales disclosure statutes in many jurisdictions. We are generally subject to laws and regulations typically applicable to real estate development, subdivision, and construction activities. These include laws relating to zoning, land use restrictions, environmental regulation, accessibility, title transfers, title insurance and taxation. In the United States, these include the Fair Housing Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. In addition, we are subject to laws in some jurisdictions that impose liability on property developers for construction defects discovered or repairs made by future owners of property developed by the developer.

Lending Regulation. Our lending activities are subject to a number of laws and regulations. In the U.S., these include the Dodd‑Frank Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Truth‑in‑Lending Act and Regulation Z promulgated thereunder, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and Regulation X promulgated thereunder, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C promulgated thereunder, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B promulgated thereunder, the Interstate Land Sales Full Disclosure Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, the Gramm‑Leach‑Bliley Act, the Deceptive Mail Prevention and Enforcement Act, Section 501 of the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 and the Civil Rights Acts of 1964, 1968 and 1991. Our lending activities are also subject to the laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, including, among others, laws and regulations related to consumer loans, retail installment contracts, mortgage lending, fair debt collection practices, consumer collection practices, mortgage disclosure, lender licenses and money laundering.
 Regulations Applicable to Resort Operations
 A number of our businesses that manage operations of resorts are subject to, among others, laws and regulations that relate to health, safety and sanitation, the sale of alcoholic beverages, facility operation, access by disabled persons and fire safety. Applicable tourism regulations in Spain and the Canary Islands require that resorts managed by VRI Europe and its subsidiaries in those regions be registered in the Registry of Tourism. We believe that we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations as such are relevant to our business. These requirements are summarized below.
 Health, Safety and Sanitation. Lodging and restaurant businesses often require licensing by applicable authorities, and sometimes these licenses are obtainable only after the business passes health inspections to assure compliance with health and sanitation codes. Health inspections are performed on a recurring basis. Health‑related laws affect the food and beverage establishments. They also govern swimming pool use and operation and require the posting of notices, availability of certain rescue and other equipment and limitations on the number of persons allowed to use the 

 
  22

 
pool at any time. These regulations typically impose civil fines or penalties for violations, which may lead to operating restrictions if uncorrected or in extreme cases of violations.
 Sale of Alcoholic Beverages. Alcoholic beverage service is subject to licensing and extensive regulations that govern virtually all aspects of service. Compliance with these regulations at managed locations may impose obligations on the owners of managed resorts, the property manager or both. Resort operations may be adversely affected by delays in transfers or issuances of alcoholic beverage licenses necessary for food and beverage services.
 Facility Operation. The operation of lodging facilities is subject to various innkeepers’ laws and laws regarding accessibility and use of public accommodations by disabled persons. Federal and state laws applicable to places of public accommodation prohibit discrimination in lodging services on the basis of the race, sex, color, religion, ancestry or disability of the guest and impose ongoing obligations with respect to accessibility. Hawaiian state law prohibits smoking in guest rooms and all enclosed areas.
 Other. Our businesses are subject to state and local regulation, including fire safety and applicable real estate brokerage and community association management licensing statutes.
 Environmental Matters
 The resorts that we manage and the assets at vacation ownership resorts and hotels that we own are all subject to certain requirements and potential liabilities under environmental laws. The costs of complying with these requirements are generally covered by the HOAs that operate the affected resort property and are our responsibility for assets owned by us. Generally, our properties currently maintain insurance which may respond to first-party remediation and emergency response costs, and third-party defense and indemnity costs associated with such potential environmental liabilities. To the extent that we own VOIs in a particular resort, we would be responsible for our pro rata share of losses sustained by such resort as a result of a violation of any such laws and regulations. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that we will maintain such insurance in the future.
 Under such laws in the U.S. and certain other jurisdictions, the owners of the resorts could be held liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances at, on, under, or in our currently or formerly owned or operated properties. Such laws may impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances. The presence of hazardous or toxic substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to sell or rent such real property or to borrow using such real property as collateral. Persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic wastes may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such wastes at the treatment, storage or disposal facility, regardless of whether such facility is owned or operated by such person. We may use certain substances and generate certain wastes that may be deemed hazardous or toxic under applicable environmental laws, and we may in the future incur costs related to cleaning up contamination resulting from historical uses of certain of our current or former properties or our treatment, storage or disposal of wastes at facilities owned by others. 
 Certain jurisdictions are considering or have undertaken actions to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or other natural resources. New or revised laws and regulations or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, such as those related to climate change, supply chain and water risk, could affect the operation of our properties and/or result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions. The cost impact of such legislation, regulation, or new interpretations would depend upon the specific requirements enacted and cannot be determined at this time.
 Environmental laws are not the only source of environmental liability. Under common law, owners and operators of real property may face liability for personal injury or property damage because of various environmental conditions such as alleged exposure to hazardous or toxic substances, poor indoor air quality, radon or poor drinking water quality. Although we may incur remediation liability and various environmental-related costs during the ordinary course of operations, management does not anticipate that such costs will have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.
