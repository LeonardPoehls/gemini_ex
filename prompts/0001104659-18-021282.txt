Item 1.  Business
Introduction
 
We were originally formed in November 2016 as a special purpose acquisition company under the name Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II for the purpose of effecting an initial business combination. On March 29, 2017, we consummated our IPO generating net proceeds of approximately $1.0 billion. Simultaneously with the closing of our IPO, we completed the private sale of 15,133,333 warrants (the Private Placement Warrants) to Silver Run Sponsor II, LLC (the Sponsor) generating gross proceeds to us of $22,700,000. A total of $1.035 billion (including approximately $36.2 million in deferred underwriting commissions to the underwriters of the IPO), which represents $1.0143 billion of the proceeds from the IPO after deducting upfront underwriting commissions of $20.7 million, and the proceeds of the sale of the Private Placement Warrants were placed in the Trust Account (the Trust Account) to be used to fund an initial business combination. Until the consummation of the Business Combination, our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class A Common Stock), warrants and units, consisting of one share of Class A Common Stock and one-third of one warrant (units), were traded on The NASDAQ Capital Market (NASDAQ) under the ticker symbols SRUN, SRUNW and SRUNU, respectively.
 
At December 31, 2017, we had not yet completed a business combination and, except for fund raising transactions, searching for an appropriate business combination and entering into agreements necessary to consummate a business combination, we had no business operations during 2017. On February 9, 2018 (the Closing Date), we consummated the acquisition of Alta Mesa Holdings, LP (Alta Mesa) and Kingfisher Midstream, LLC (Kingfisher) (such acquisition, the Business Combination). In connection with the Business Combination, Alta Mesa became our accounting predecessor. However, since this report is as of December 31, 2017, the businesses of Alta Mesa and Kingfisher are not described herein in detail. The Business Combination (including the businesses of Alta Mesa and Kingfisher) is described in detail in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) on February 9, 2018, and in our Definitive Proxy Statement on Schedule 14A filed with the SEC on January 19, 2018.
 
On the Closing Date, we consummated the acquisition of (i) all of the limited partnership interests in Alta Mesa, (ii) 100% of the economic interests and 90% of the voting interests in Alta Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, the sole general partner of Alta Mesa (Alta Mesa GP), and (iii) all of the membership interests in Kingfisher, pursuant to:
 
·                 the Contribution Agreement, dated as of August 16, 2017 (the Alta Mesa Contribution Agreement), among High Mesa Holdings, LP (the Alta Mesa Contributor), High Mesa Holdings GP, LLC, the sole general partner of the Alta Mesa Contributor, Alta Mesa, Alta Mesa GP, LLC, us and the equity owners of the Alta Mesa Contributor;
 
·                  the Contribution Agreement, dated as of August 16, 2017 (the Kingfisher Contribution Agreement), among KFM Holdco, LLC (the Kingfisher Contributor), Kingfisher, us and the equity owners of the Kingfisher Contributor; and
 
·                  the Contribution Agreement, dated as of August 16, 2017 (the Riverstone Contribution Agreement and, together with the Alta Mesa Contribution Agreement and the Kingfisher Contribution Agreement, the Contribution Agreements), between Riverstone VI Alta Mesa Holdings, L.P. (the Riverstone Contributor and, together with the Alta Mesa Contributor and the Kingfisher Contributor, the Contributors) and us.
 
At the closing of the Business Combination (the Closing),
 
·                  we issued 40,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock and warrants to purchase 13,333,333 shares of Class A Common Stock to Riverstone VI SR II Holdings, L.P. (Fund VI Holdings) pursuant to the terms of that certain Forward Purchase Agreement, dated as of March 17, 2017 (the Forward Purchase Agreement) for cash proceeds of $400 million to us;

·                  we contributed $1,406 million in cash (the proceeds of the Forward Purchase Agreement and the net proceeds (after redemptions) of the Trust Account) to SRII Opco, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (SRII Opco), in exchange for (i) 169,371,730 of the common units (approximately 44.2%) representing limited partner interests (the SRII Opco Common Units) in SRII Opco issued to us and (ii) 62,966,666 warrants to purchase SRII Opco Common Units (SRII Opco Warrants) issued to us;
 
·                  we caused SRII Opco to issue 213,402,398 SRII Opco Common Units (approximately 55.8%) to the Contributors in exchange for the ownership interests in Alta Mesa, Alta Mesa GP and Kingfisher contributed to SRII Opco by the Contributors;
 
·                  we agreed to cause SRII Opco to issue up to 59,871,031 SRII Opco Common Units to the Alta Mesa Contributor and the Kingfisher Contributor if the earn-out consideration provided for in the Contribution Agreements is earned by the Alta Mesa Contributor or the Kingfisher Contributor pursuant to the terms of the Contribution Agreements;
 
·                  we issued to each of the Contributors a number of shares of Class C common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the Class C Common Stock), equal to the number of the SRII Opco Common Units received by such Contributor at the Closing;
 
·                  SRII Opco distributed to the Kingfisher Contributor cash in the amount of approximately $814.8 million in partial payment for the ownership interests in Kingfisher contributed by the Kingfisher Contributor; and
 
·                  SRII Opco entered into a voting agreement with the owners of the remaining 10% voting interests in Alta Mesa GP whereby such other owners agreed to vote their interests in Alta Mesa GP as directed by SRII Opco.
 
Holders of Class C Common Stock, together with holders of Class A Common Stock, voting as a single class, have the right to vote on all matters properly submitted to a vote of the stockholders, but holders of Class C Common Stock are not entitled to any dividends or liquidating distributions from us. After a specified period of time after Closing, the Contributors will generally have the right to cause SRII Opco to redeem all or a portion of their SRII Opco Common Units in exchange for shares of our Class A Common Stock or, at SRII Opcos option, an equivalent amount of cash. However, we may, at our option, effect a direct exchange of cash or Class A Common Stock for such SRII Opco Common Units in lieu of such a redemption by SRII Opco. Upon the future redemption or exchange of SRII Opco Common Units held by a Contributor, a corresponding number of shares of Class C Common Stock will be cancelled.
 
In connection with the Closing, we also issued (i) one share of Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (Series A Preferred Stock), to each of Bayou City Energy Management, LLC (Bayou City), HPS Investment Partners, LLC (HPS), and AM Equity Holdings, LP (AM Management), and (ii) one share of Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (Series B Preferred Stock), to the Riverstone Contributor. None of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to any dividends from us related to such Preferred Stock, but such holders are entitled to preferred distributions in liquidation in the amount of $0.0001 per share of Preferred Stock, and have limited voting rights as described below. Shares of the Preferred Stock are redeemable for the par value thereof by us upon the earlier to occur of (1) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date, (2) the optional redemption of such Preferred Stock at the election of the holder thereof or (3) upon a breach by the holder of the transfer restrictions applicable to such Preferred Stock. For so long as the Series A Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock remains outstanding, as applicable, the holders thereof will be entitled to nominate and elect directors to our board of directors for a period of up to five years following the Closing based on their and their affiliates beneficial ownership of Class A Common Stock.
 
On February 6, 2018, our stockholders voted to approve the Business Combination. In connection with that vote, the holders of shares of Class A Common Stock originally sold as part of the units issued in our IPO (such holders, the public stockholders), were provided with the opportunity to redeem shares of Class A Common Stock then held by them for cash equal to approximately $10.00 per share. Public holders of 3,270 shares of Class A Common Stock elected to redeem those shares and, at the Closing, $32,944 held in the Trust Account was paid to such redeeming shareholders and the remaining $1,042.7 million held in the Trust Account was disbursed to us to fund our obligations under the Contribution Agreements and to pay the underwriters deferred discount arising out of the IPO.

Following the Business Combination, we changed our name from Silver Run Acquisition Corporation II to Alta Mesa Resources, Inc. and continued the listing of our Class A Common Stock and Public Warrants on NASDAQ under the symbols AMR and AMRWW, respectively. Following the completion of the Business Combination, the size of our board of directors was expanded from four directors to 11, including one director appointed by Bayou City and its affiliates, one director appointed by HPS and its affiliates and two directors appointed by AM Management and its affiliates, as the holders of our Series A Preferred Stock, and three directors appointed by the Riverstone Contributor and its affiliates, as the holder of our Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, in connection with the Business Combination, we appointed the management team of Alta Mesa to hold most of our executive officer positions.
 
Following the Closing, Alta Mesa is considered our accounting predecessor. Alta Mesa and Kingfisher continue to exist as separate subsidiaries of SRII Opco and those entities are separately financed, with each having debt obligations that are not obligations of the other. Consequently, references herein to Alta Mesa and to Kingfisher are to those entities and not to the Company as a whole.
 
Business Overview
 
As a result of the Business Combination, our only significant asset is our ownership of an approximate 44.2% partnership interest in SRII Opco. SRII Opco owns all of the economic interests in each of Alta Mesa and Kingfisher. Founded in 1987, Alta Mesa, the predecessor to our E&P Business, was an independent exploration and production company focused on the development and acquisition of unconventional oil and natural gas reserves in the eastern portion of the Anadarko Basin referred to as the STACK. The STACK is an acronym describing both its locationSooner Trend Anadarko Basin Canadian and Kingfisher Countyand the multiple, stacked productive formations present in the area. The STACK is a prolific hydrocarbon system with high oil and liquids-rich natural gas content, multiple horizontal target horizons, extensive production history and historically high drilling success rates. As of December 31, 2017, we had assembled a highly contiguous position of approximately 130,000 net acres largely in the up-dip, naturally-fractured oil portion of the STACK in eastern Kingfisher County, Oklahoma. Our drilling locations are in our primary target formations comprised of the Osage, Meramec and Oswego. We continue to opportunistically acquire acreage in our non-operated locations with the goal of operating wells in these locations. We are currently operating seven horizontal drilling rigs in the STACK with plans to increase that number of rigs to eight at the end of 2018.
 
Our Midstream Business was started by Kingfisher on January 30, 2015 for the purpose of acquiring, developing and operating midstream oil and gas assets. We primarily focus on providing crude oil gathering, gas gathering and processing and marketing to producers of natural gas, NGLs, crude oil and condensate in the STACK play. Our midstream energy asset network includes approximately 308 miles of existing low and high pressure pipelines, a 60 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant, 10 MMcf/d in offtake processing, compression facilities, crude storage, NGL storage and purchasing and marketing capabilities.
 
Our goal is to build a premier development and acquisition company focused on horizontal drilling and gas gathering in the STACK.

Our Emerging Growth Company Status
 
As a company with less than $1.07 billion in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in the JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may, for up to five years, take advantage of specified exemptions from reporting and other regulatory requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These exemptions include:
 
·                  the presentation of only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations;
 
·                  deferral of the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on the effectiveness of our system of internal control over financial reporting;
 
·                  exemption from the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards until they would apply to private companies;
 
·                  exemption from compliance with any new requirements adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the independent registered public accounting firms report in which the independent registered public accounting firm would be required to provide additional information about the audit and the financial statements of the Company; and
 
·                  reduced disclosure about executive compensation arrangements.
 
We may take advantage of these provisions until we are no longer an emerging growth company, which will occur on the earliest of (i) the last day of the fiscal year following March 29, 2022, the fifth anniversary of our IPO, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue, (iii) the date on which we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period and (iv) the date on which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, as defined in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). We have elected to take advantage of each of the exemptions for emerging growth companies.
 
Accordingly, the information that we provide you may be different than what you may receive from other public companies in which you hold equity interests.
