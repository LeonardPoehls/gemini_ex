Item 1. Business
General
We are a leading provider of onshore seismic data to the oil and gas industry in North America. We own an extensive library of onshore and offshore geological data that we have accumulated since our inception in 1982. We believe our data library is one of the largest onshore three-dimensional (“3D”) databases available for licensing in North America and includes leading positions in oil, liquids-rich and natural gas unconventional plays as well as conventional areas. 
As of February 2017, we own approximately 44,300 square miles of onshore 3D data, consisting of 30,350 square miles in the United States (69%) and 13,950 square miles in Canada (31%). We have a leading market position in key geographies in the North American unconventional onshore oil and gas plays where exploration and production (“E&P”) companies have been focusing their efforts in recent years. Approximately 55% of our onshore 3D library is comprised of data located in unconventional plays. In 2015, we began to expand our data library coverage into Mexico through the reprocessing of existing two-dimensional (“2D”) data which can be licensed to E&P companies. 
Our business model is to acquire data selectively in geological formations that we believe will support drilling from a variety of oil and gas producers over an extended period of time. We design and manage new surveys and license them to initial clients which typically fund a significant portion (55% to 75%) of the total cost of each survey (referred to as “client underwriting”). Seitel typically owns 100% of the acquired data and licenses the data to additional parties on a non-exclusive basis (referred to as “resales”). Such resales are unlimited in both time and amount and require minimal incremental cash costs. Since embarking on our investment in unconventional data in 2008, we have achieved, on a historical basis, a payback period on these investments of about three to four years on average despite some slowdown in returns in the recent industry downturn. Our long-lived, diverse data library built over three decades continues to provide value to our customers, with 59% of our 2016 3D onshore resale revenue coming from data over five years old.

We believe that we have low fixed costs and a highly flexible operating model, as we do not own any seismic survey equipment or directly employ field personnel. Instead, we outsource those functions by contracting with third-party specialists, as required, in various facets of the data acquisition process in order to complete surveys to expand our data library. We also use sales commissions to create incentives for our sales force while matching our costs to our achieved sales. We believe this business model provides enhanced flexibility, allowing us to optimize our level of investment for the market environment and resulting in substantially lower cash flow volatility by enabling us to respond quickly to changes in demand and shifts in client geographic focus.
We serve a market which includes over 1,500 companies in the oil and gas industry. Our customers include large independent and major integrated oil and gas companies as well as small and mid-cap E&P companies. The importance of geological data in the exploration and development process drives demand for data in our library. Specifically, our customers use seismic data to identify geographical areas where subsurface conditions are favorable for oil and gas exploration and to optimize development and production of oil and gas reserves. Seismic data provides valuable insight for operators including a target zone's thickness, as well as faulting pattern complexity, helping with the design of horizontal drilling programs and minimizing the potential for uneconomic wells.
To support our seismic data licensing business and our clients, we maintain warehouse and electronic storage facilities at our Houston, Texas headquarters and our Calgary, Alberta locations. Through our Seitel Solutions business unit (“Solutions”), we offer the ability to access and interact with the seismic data we own and market via a standard web browser and the Internet.
From 2014 through 2016, approximately 98% of our revenues were generated from customers underwriting data acquisitions and revenue from licensing of seismic data. Other revenues during these years were primarily derived from Solutions for reproduction and delivery of seismic data licensed by our clients. See Note L to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about our revenue by geographical area.
We are a private company controlled by ValueAct Capital Master Fund, L.P. (“ValueAct”) and funds managed by affiliates of Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (“Centerbridge”). We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are in Houston, Texas.
Description of Operations
Seismic Data
E&P companies consider seismic data an important tool in finding and exploiting hydrocarbons. E&P companies use seismic data in oil and gas exploration and development efforts to increase the probability of drilling success, to better delineate existing oil and gas fields and to augment their reservoir completion and management techniques. In unconventional plays, E&P companies use seismic data as a development tool to better identify efficient drilling plans and maximize production by identifying and understanding a series of critical characteristics of the targeted resource. The cost of seismic data represents a small portion of the total cost of most projects, but provides substantial benefits to operators. 3D seismic data provides a graphic depiction of the earth’s subsurface from two horizontal dimensions and one vertical dimension, rendering a more detailed picture than 2D data, which presents a cross-sectional view from one vertical and one horizontal dimension. The more comprehensive geophysical information provided by 3D surveys significantly enhances an interpreter’s ability to evaluate the probability of the existence and location of oil and gas deposits as well as the target zone’s thickness and faulting pattern complexity. However, the cost to create 3D seismic data is significantly more than the cost to create 2D seismic data. As a result, 2D data continues to be used by clients for preliminary, broad-scale exploration evaluation, as well as in determining the location and design of 3D surveys. 3D surveys can then be used for more detailed analysis to maximize actual drilling potential and success.
Although we amortize our seismic data library investment over a maximum period of four years, much of our seismic data has continued to generate licensing revenue past the amortization period. Assuming the data is sampled and gathered adequately in the field recording phase, it is amenable to re-evaluation and re-presentation multiple times, using new or alternate processing techniques or updated knowledge of the Earth model.
Management believes the level of resales from various vintages of our seismic data is useful in assessing the resiliency and value of our seismic data library. Management considers estimated longevity of and foreseeable demand for data in determining

whether to undertake new data acquisition projects. For the year ended December 31, 2016, resale revenue from 3D onshore data was recognized from net historical investments made in the indicated periods (in thousands):

(1) | Net investment, a non-GAAP measure, reflects total data cost less client underwriting before fair value adjustments resulting from the 2007 merger between Seitel Acquisition Corp. with and into Seitel, Inc. (the “Merger”). The GAAP measure to which historical net investment is most directly comparable is net book value. We believe that the presentation of historical net investment is important as it reflects our capital investment in our seismic data library net of the portion underwritten by our customers. For a reconciliation of historical net investment to net book value, see “Reconciliation of Historical Net Investment to Net Book Value” below.

Data Library Overview
We believe our data library is one of the largest onshore 3D databases available for licensing in North America. We have built our onshore 3D library over more than 20 years with approximately $1.8 billion in gross investments and we view our library as an asset that would be time- and cost-prohibitive for others to replicate. Approximately 55% of our onshore 3D library is comprised of data located in unconventional plays. We believe we are well positioned due to the geographic diversity of our data library, including data in oil-focused and liquids-rich plays such as the Eagle Ford/Woodbine, Permian Basin, Niobrara/Bakken, Utica/Marcellus, Anadarko Basin, Montney and Duvernay and in natural gas-focused plays such as the Haynesville, Louisiana Cotton Valley and Horn River, with over 24,000 miles of data in unconventional areas. 
Our library also consists of data targeted at conventional plays in both the U.S. and Canada. We also own a library of 3D offshore data covering parts of the shelf and certain deep water areas in the Western and Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico. In addition, we own or manage approximately 1.1 million linear miles of 2D data concentrated primarily in North America, both onshore and offshore. 
5

In 2015, we began to expand our data library coverage into Mexico. We are reprocessing existing onshore 2D data owned by the Mexican government and have the rights to license the reprocessed data to E&P companies.
The following table describes our 3D seismic data library as of February 13, 2017:

Our data library is a highly valuable asset that has historically generated strong returns on capital. The technical and informational usefulness of our data has generally not declined over time. Demand for data is driven by the level and location of customer exploration and development activity and not the age of the data. Because of our positioning in favorable geographies and the long life of the data, we believe there is significant built-in potential for repeat licensing of data at little or no marginal cost. The existing library is highly defensible as the customer’s cost of licensing data is typically much lower than the cost of creating a new survey. We believe there is little incentive for competitors to survey areas where we already have data.
Onshore U.S. and Canada: Since 2008, our capital investment in both the U.S. and Canada has been focused on unconventional plays, initially in the shale gas areas and, since 2011, shifting towards oil-focused and liquids-rich objectives. These changes in focus are made in accordance with the activity of our clients and our ability to shift with them is an important component of our growth strategy.
The U.S. onshore 3D conventional sector of our seismic data library is mainly comprised of our Gulf Coast Texas and southern Louisiana/Mississippi components, which we began accumulating in 1993. We also have relatively small amounts of 3D seismic data in other areas, such as Alabama, California, Michigan and Northern Louisiana as well as an extensive 2D data library that continues to contribute to our licensing sales.
6

The Canadian onshore 3D conventional sector of our seismic data library is mainly comprised of data within the Western Canadian Basin, which we began accumulating in 1998. We also have an extensive 2D data library that continues to contribute to our licensing sales.
Offshore U.S. Gulf of Mexico: Our library of offshore data covers parts of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico shelf and certain deep water areas in the Western and Central U.S. Gulf of Mexico. We have accumulated our U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore 3D data since 1993. 
Mexico: We are reprocessing existing onshore 2D data owned by the Mexican government and have the rights to license the reprocessed data to E&P companies. As of February 13, 2017, we have been granted approvals for and have already begun licensing three areas totaling approximately 8,300 linear miles.
Data Library Growth
We regularly add to our library of seismic data by: (1) recording new data, (2) buying ownership of existing data for cash, (3) obtaining ownership of existing data through non-monetary exchanges and (4) creating new value-added products from data existing within our library.
Underwritten Data Acquisitions: We design and manage new seismic surveys that are specifically suited to the geology and environmental conditions of the area using the most appropriate technology available. Typically, one or more customers will underwrite or fund a significant portion of the direct cost in exchange for a license or licenses to use the resulting data. Under the terms of these licenses, the customers may occasionally have a limited exclusivity period. We consider the contracts executed up to the time we make a firm commitment to create the new seismic survey as underwriting or pre-funding. Any subsequent licensing of the data while the survey is in progress or once it is completed is considered a resale license. Almost all of our new data acquisition activity during 2016 occurred in the U.S., with a focus in the Louisiana Cotton Valley and the Permian. All field work on these projects is outsourced to subcontractors. A significant percentage of the data processing for our U.S. and Canadian projects is processed by our internal data processing group located in Houston. We employ experienced geoscientists who design seismic programs and oversee field acquisition and data processing to ensure the quality and longevity of the data created.
Cash Purchases: We purchase data for cash from oil and gas companies, other seismic companies or financial investors in seismic data when opportunities arise and that meet our investment criteria.
Non-Monetary Exchanges: We grant our customers a non-exclusive license to selected data from our library, provide reproduction services or provide data processing services (or some combination of those items) in exchange for ownership of seismic data from the customer. The data that we receive is distinct from the data that is licensed to our customer. These transactions will tend to be for individual surveys or groups of surveys, rather than whole libraries. Occasionally, we also use non-monetary exchanges in conjunction with data acquisitions and cash purchases. In addition, we may receive advanced data processing services on certain existing data in exchange for a nonexclusive license to selected data from our library.
Value-Added Products: We create new products from existing seismic surveys in our library by extracting a variety of additional information from these surveys that was not readily apparent in the initial products. Opportunities to extract such additional information and create such additional products may result from information from secondary sources, alternative conclusions regarding the initial products and applying alternate or more complex processes to the initial products, or some combination of these factors. Additional products may include 5D Interpolation, Pre-Stack Depth Migration volumes, Amplitude Versus Offset volumes, Complex Attribute volumes and Rock Property volumes. The cost of these products may be underwritten by one or more customers in exchange for a license or licenses to use the resulting data or we may determine to fund the cost of certain of these products based on anticipated demand by our clients. These data products are licensed to the industry on a non-exclusive basis. Work on these projects may be performed by our internal data processing groups, outsourced to specific specialists in the arena or conducted under an alliance with a particular specialist. We employ experienced geoscientists who design these value-added products and oversee the processing to ensure the quality and longevity of the data created.
Competitive Strengths
We believe we have the following competitive strengths: 
Large and Diverse Data Library with Leading Market Position in Key Oil and Gas Producing Regions: We believe we have one of the largest onshore 3D seismic data libraries available for licensing in North America. Our data covers a diverse range of oil and gas producing regions in the United States and Canada and we believe it provides us with leading positions in oil, liquids-rich and natural gas unconventional plays as well as conventional areas. As of February 2017, we have over 24,000 
7

square miles of unconventional 3D data. As industry activity dictates, we will focus on further development of existing plays where our clients are active. Our competitive advantage is driven by our ability to: 

• | successfully bid for new seismic surveys that are in our areas of focus as a result of our knowledge of data return characteristics for similar data in our existing library;


• | creatively market our data library with an innovative strategy, which includes tailoring licenses to meet our clients’ needs;


• | generate client trust by delivering surveys on time that meet oil and gas client requirements particularly those clients that are early participants; and


• | retain and grow valuable client relationships.

With one of the largest onshore seismic data libraries in the active North American oil and natural gas basins, we have an established competitive position. Since 1994, we have invested approximately $2.1 billion to build our data library, with a gross investment of approximately $1.8 billion, $0.8 billion net of underwriting, in onshore 3D data. We believe that the current replacement cost of our seismic library significantly exceeds our original investment, and that our broad geographic coverage and strong presence in the active North American onshore oil and gas basins coupled with our domain expertise creates significant barriers to replication and a defensible market position. We believe competitors will generally not shoot over areas already in our library because it is not economically viable to do so. 
Multiple Revenue Opportunities Lead to Strong Returns on New and Existing Data: We derive revenue from the non-exclusive licensing of our data. Importantly, data within our library can be licensed on a non-exclusive basis multiple times over a span of many years with minimal incremental costs, if any. Several factors lead to multiple licensing of our data which drives high returns on our investments over time. An area captured by a 3D survey may have multiple mineral holders within a particular stratigraphic layer as well as vertically across layers. Also, new oil and gas field discoveries, new drilling technologies and pipeline and oil and gas infrastructure expansion can cause renewed activity in a previously assessed surrounding area. Due to the capital intensive nature of developing unconventional plays, many oil and gas companies seek partners to share in the cost of development and these partners will often need to purchase licenses for their own use. In addition, merger and acquisition activity often requires re-licensing of data following a change in field ownership. Moreover, prospective developers and investors without mineral rights may seek our data. 
We have proven our ability to license onshore data for extended periods after its creation. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 59% of total resale revenue for 3D onshore data came from data acquired before 2012. 
Ability to Adjust Quickly to Oil and Gas Industry Cycles: Our variable operating structure allows us to curtail overhead costs quickly during cyclical downturns in the oil and gas industry because we have no fixed overhead costs related to maintaining seismic equipment or crews and our employee compensation structure is commission-based and bonus-centric. As distinct from our business model, the majority of seismic companies own and operate seismic equipment and crews, creating fixed operating expenses and less flexible cost structures. In addition, most of our capital expenditures are discretionary additions to our seismic data library with significant underwriting commitments from customers, allowing us to reduce capital expenditures when necessary. 
We operate with a low cost structure by maintaining an efficient base of assets and employees. We do not own seismic acquisition equipment or employ seismic acquisition crews, but engage, as required, third-party contractors with qualified equipment to shoot new data. We believe this, in addition to the majority of our capital expenditures being discretionary, minimizes our ongoing capital requirements and results in substantially less volatility in cash flows by enabling us to respond quickly to changes in demand. In addition, the creation of new surveys provides cost-effective growth opportunities because we impose strict capital investment thresholds with targeted underwriting levels averaging 60% to 70% and typically do not start work on new acquisition programs without an underwriting commitment. Additionally, we may seek higher levels of underwriting in order to minimize our cash investment while still adding new data to our library. In 2016, underwriting revenue exceeded new seismic acquisition costs, resulting in an overall underwriting level of 113%. Average underwriting levels in 2015 and 2014 were 63% and 69%, respectively. 
Seismic Data Has an Attractive Value Proposition Among Our Blue Chip Customer Base: Our data is key to oil and gas exploration and development activity. Understanding geological structure maximizes production and returns on client investments; however, seismic data purchases represent a small fraction of total drilling and completion costs. We serve a market that includes over 1,500 companies in the oil and gas industry. Our customer base ranges from some of the largest independent oil companies in the world to small, single-basin E&P companies and also includes global oil and gas companies, typically with very little customer concentration. 
8

We believe that the quality of our data, the breadth of its coverage in the major active onshore basins in North America and our longstanding commitment to client service enables us to attract top-tier clients and maintain and grow existing client relationships. These relationships also create access to additional data surveys and sales opportunities.
Experienced Management Team: Our executive management team is comprised of individuals with an average of over 25 years of relevant experience. Robert Monson, our CEO and President, has more than 30 years of industry experience, while Marcia Kendrick, our CFO, joined us in 1993 and has over 25 years of industry experience. Richard Kelvin, our CTO and President of Seitel Canada Ltd. and Randy Sides, our President of Seitel Data, Ltd., both also have over 25 years of industry experience. Our expertise is in the selection, design and management of seismic surveys. We also believe we maintain the largest sales and marketing group in the industry.
Corporate Strategy
Underwritten Data Acquisitions: We add data to our library primarily by contracting with third-party specialist service providers to create new subsurface geological data, which we design and own. Typically, one or more customers will underwrite or fund a significant portion of the direct cost of a seismic survey in exchange for a license or licenses to use the resulting data. The relatively high level of underwritten acquisition costs, typically 55% to 75% of the cost of the survey, lowers our initial capital requirements and enhances our return on investment. We maintain a disciplined return on investment approach to capital expenditures. We only intend to pursue new acquisition projects if we believe that conditions exist for repeated licensing of the same data over an extended period of time. We typically seek significant underwriting commitments before undertaking new acquisition projects as underwriting levels are generally a predictor of long-term demand for seismic data. We target an average of 60% to 70% underwriting level for all new seismic acquisition projects on an aggregate basis and may target higher underwriting levels in periods of industry downturn. We achieved 113% average underwriting levels for 2016 and achieved 63% and 69% average underwriting for new seismic acquisition projects in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Additionally, when acquiring 3D surveys, we consider the proximity to 3D surveys already in the library. We believe that there is greater value in contiguous data, or reasonably close concentrations of surveys in a single area. We typically own 100% of the acquired data and license the data to additional parties on a non-exclusive basis. Such resales are unlimited in both time and amount and require no to minimal incremental cash costs. Our long-lived, diverse data library built over three decades continues to provide value to our customers, with 59% of our 2016 3D onshore resale revenue coming from data over five years old.
Provide Value to Customers through Deep Industry Knowledge and Technical Expertise: As a provider of multi-client data services, we deliver value to our clients through several aspects of our business. Our extensive expertise and local intelligence in designing and managing surveys is not generally available to our client base. We also create value-added products from the data in our library, primarily by applying complex imaging technology, such as complex depth imaging. These value-added products enhance the useful information that can be extracted from a given data set. As a large onshore data library owner, we have an existing data “footprint,” often providing further cost efficiencies and higher-quality data for new surveys. Clients are disposed to underwrite our surveys as the cost to license multi-client data is significantly less than the cost to commission a proprietary survey. Finally, our clients maintain anonymity both within the local community and amongst competitors through contracting with Seitel.
Expand Library in a Disciplined and Cost-effective Manner: The substantial majority of our library additions come from new seismic data creation. We also grow our data library through cash purchases of existing seismic data, non-monetary data exchanges and new value-added products created from existing data. We focus our data acquisition efforts on oil and natural gas producing areas that we believe are well suited to benefit from current and emerging trends in the E&P industry. The decision to make capital investments is weighed against the estimated length of the payback period and projected return on capital. We believe ample opportunities exist to grow our library in existing plays and, as oil and gas industry activity dictates, to expand into emerging areas. We use proprietary information tools and apply our management expertise to select among our pipeline of new survey opportunities. We typically pursue a new acquisition project only if it has a significant underwriting commitment from our customers and if we believe that conditions exist for repeated licensing of the data over an extended period of time. We are thorough in our evaluation of survey opportunities and are selective in adding prospective surveys to our pipeline and therefore not all surveys will meet our return requirements.
Leverage Internal Geophysical and Operations Management Expertise while Outsourcing Lower Margin Services: Our strong geophysical, technical and field operating management expertise is essential in maintaining our leadership through our ability to design surveys with attractive return potential and to manage their creation. We will continue to outsource the non-core, fixed-cost intensive services, including surveying, permitting and data capture involving field equipment and crews. This strategy enables us to select vendors that we believe offer the best price, equipment and skill sets for a particular environment, geographical location or geophysical objective and provides us with access to state-of-the-art equipment and emerging 
9

technologies. We believe this operating model also gives us the flexibility to control costs to respond appropriately to changing market conditions.
Maintain a Strong Balance Sheet and Ample Liquidity: We believe a strong balance sheet and ample liquidity are critical elements to managing the business through industry cycles. We intend to fund data acquisitions with the cash flow generated from operations.
Industry Overview
Overview of Seismic Data: E&P companies consider seismic data an important tool in finding and exploiting hydrocarbons. E&P companies use seismic data in oil and gas exploration and development efforts to increase the probability of drilling success, to better delineate existing oil and gas fields and to augment their reservoir completion and management techniques. Historically, seismic data was tied to exploration capital expenditures, which are significantly more volatile, as E&P companies used seismic data to increase the success rate of discovering hydrocarbon deposits. With the shift to unconventional plays, E&P companies use seismic data in those plays as a development tool to better identify efficient drilling plans and maximize production by identifying and understanding a series of critical characteristics of the targeted resource. The cost of seismic data represents a small portion of the total cost of drilling and completion for most projects, but provides substantial benefits to operators, including minimizing potential for uneconomic wells.
Drivers of Ongoing Demand for Seismic Data: There are many drivers that cause seismic data to be licensed repeatedly by different customers over a long time period, including fractured mineral positions, stratified mineral interests, partnerships, lease and option turnover, correlation to well analogs, commodity pricing, improvements in data processing techniques and developments in drilling and production technology. 
Increased merger and acquisition activity, including joint ventures, may also generate increased licensing fees for seismic data providers. Licenses to seismic data are generally structured such that they do not transfer in the case of a change of control and they are not accessible to partners. Both circumstances require additional payments for new licenses.
North American Oil and Gas Markets: The emergence of shale and other unconventional plays has led to significant increases in production of oil and natural gas in North America. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014 and continuing throughout 2015 and into early 2016, oil prices declined significantly because of continued high production and high global inventories. As a result of these price declines, E&P companies reduced their capital expenditure budgets in 2015 and further in 2016 in an effort to protect cash flows, resulting in reduced drilling. U.S. E&P operators cut cost structures, generated drilling efficiencies and obtained service cost concessions to lower their cost of drilling. In the fourth quarter of 2016, OPEC and non-OPEC producers agreed to cut oil production beginning in early 2017 which led to rising and stabilizing oil prices. This improvement in oil prices has resulted in increased rig counts and seems to indicate the bottom of the cycle has been reached. Current E&P spending surveys indicate capital spending in North America by E&P companies is expected to increase approximately 30% to 45% in 2017.
The Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) expects U.S. crude oil production to increase in 2017 after experiencing declines in 2016. Based on the EIA’s Short-Term Energy Outlook dated January 10, 2017, the EIA expects U.S crude oil production to average 9.0 million barrels per day in 2017 and 9.3 million barrels per day in 2018 compared to 8.9 million barrels per day in 2016. Global consumption is expected to grow by 1.6 million barrels per day in 2017 and 1.5 million barrels per day in 2018. In its January 2017 report, the EIA predicts the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil to average $52.50 per barrel in 2017 and $55.18 per barrel in 2018, as compared to the average of $43.33 in 2016.
In this same report, the EIA projects that total U.S. natural gas production will average 73.8 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) in 2017 and 76.6 Bcf/d in 2018 compared to 72.4 Bcf/d in 2016. U.S. natural gas consumption is expected to grow slightly, averaging 75.4 Bcf/d in 2017 and 76.9 Bcf/d in 2018 compared to 75.1 Bcf/d in 2016. The EIA expects natural gas working inventories to be 3% to 5% below its most recent 5-year average. The EIA predicts that natural gas spot prices will show significant improvement in 2017 and 2018, with an average of $3.55 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in 2017 and $3.73 per MMBtu in 2018 as compared to the average of $2.51 per MMBtu in 2016.
We are anticipating 2017 to be the first year of recovery in upstream capital spending due to improved commodity prices. However, uncertainty remains as to the effectiveness and duration of the concurrent OPEC and non-OPEC production cuts, which could influence oil prices in either direction. Also, the potential for efficiency gains and cost reductions from non-OPEC producers in the higher price environment could result in additional volumes of supply that could put downward pressure on oil prices. We remain cautiously optimistic that we will see improvements in seismic spending from our E&P clients in 2017.

Importance of Seismic Data: We believe the use of 3D seismic data will continue to be an important part of oil and gas companies’ exploration and development projects as they are continually looking to reduce drilling risk, decrease oil and natural gas finding costs and increase the efficiencies of reservoir location, delineation, completion and management. In addition, we believe that seismic data is a key component of oil and gas production activity in the unconventional plays. Seismic data can provide a wealth of insight into the targeted resource, including areal extent, depth, thickness, faulting patterns and a number of complex rock properties. Such insights enhance our customers’ ability to design efficient and productive horizontal drilling and fracking programs. Understanding these unique features is critical for our customers as they develop their horizontal drilling plans, which can result in lateral drilling that reaches over one mile in each direction.
Licenses and Marketing
We actively market data from our library to customers under non-exclusive license agreements using a well-developed marketing strategy combined with strong geophysical expertise. Our licenses are generally non-assignable and typically provide that in the event of a change of control of a customer-licensee, the surviving entity must pay a fee to maintain a license for any data it seeks to continue to use and for which such entity previously did not have a license. We employ an experienced sales force and it is our operating philosophy to actively market our seismic library. Our team of dedicated marketing specialists seeks to maximize license sale opportunities and create innovative methods of contracting opportunities by monitoring petroleum industry exploration and development activities through close interaction with E&P companies on a daily basis.
Licenses generally are granted for cash, payable within 30 days of invoice, although we occasionally permit a customer to make an initial payment upon inception of the license followed by periodic payments over time, usually not more than 12 months. Some licenses provide for additional payments to us if the licensee acquires additional mineral leases, drills wells or achieves oil or gas production in the areas covered by the licensed data.
Fundamental to our business model is the concept that once seismic data is created it is owned by us and added to our library for licensing to customers in the oil and gas industry on a non-exclusive basis. Since the data is a long-lived asset, such data can be licensed repeatedly and over an extended period of time to different customers at the same time.
Backlog
At February 13, 2017, we had gross capital expenditure commitments related to data creation projects of approximately $17.4 million. We anticipate that the majority of this backlog will be recognized over the next 12 months. This is compared to gross capital expenditure commitments at February 16, 2016 of $16.5 million.
Seitel Solutions
To support our seismic data licensing business and our clients, we maintain warehouse and electronic storage facilities at our Houston, Texas headquarters and our Calgary, Alberta locations. Through our Solutions business unit, we offer the ability to access and interact with the seismic data we own and market via a standard web browser and the Internet. Using proprietary technology, we store, manage, access and deliver data, tapes and graphic cross-sections to our licensees. In addition, Solutions offers use of its proprietary quality control software to the seismic brokerage community principally in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. We also offer data management services to select clients.
Customers
We market our seismic data to a varied customer base. Our customers include independent oil and gas companies, major integrated oil and gas companies and national oil companies, as well as small and mid-cap E&P companies and private prospect generating individuals. One customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue during the year ended December 31, 2016, totaling approximately $15.4 million (16.3%). During the year ended December 31, 2015, two customers accounted for more than 10% of our revenue, totaling approximately $14.5 million (14.5%) and $12.5 million (12.5%) of our revenues each. One customer accounted for approximately $25.7 million (13.0%) of our revenue during the year ended December 31, 2014. We believe that the quality of our data, the breadth of its coverage in the major active North American basins and our longstanding commitment to client service enables us to attract top-tier clients. Because we do not acquire data speculatively, strategic relationships with our customers have been and will continue to be critical to our growth. We do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows or results of operations.
Competition
The creation and licensing of seismic data is competitive. Customers consider several factors, including location of data, price, technological expertise and reputation for quality and dependability, when choosing a service provider. There are a number of geophysical companies that create, market and license seismic data and maintain seismic data libraries. Rather than outsourcing 
11

their seismic data activities, some oil and gas companies create their own seismic data libraries, which they license to others. Our largest competitors, many of whom are engaged in acquiring seismic data, as well as maintaining a data library, are CGG; Geokinetics, Inc.; Geophysical Pursuit, Inc.; FairfieldNodal; Pulse Seismic Inc.; Seismic Exchange, Inc.; TGS Nopec; Vector Seismic Data Processing, Inc., a subsidiary of Schlumberger Limited,; and WesternGeco. Many of our competitors have substantially larger revenues and resources than we do.
Regulations
Our business operations and the demand for our products and services are subject to a variety of federal, provincial, state, foreign and local laws and regulations in the United States, Canada and Mexico, including requirements relating to environmental protection and worker health and safety laws. These regulations impose numerous obligations applicable to our operations including permitting before commencing regulated activities and the limitation or prohibition of seismic activities in environmentally sensitive or protected areas. Further, these laws, regulations and government policies may change as a result of political, economic or social climate. Stringent new and future laws, regulations and policies concerning hydraulic fracturing, greenhouse gas emissions and the use of renewable energy sources could negatively impact the operations of our customers. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for example issued regulations in 2012 and 2015 which govern performance standards for the oil and natural gas industry and in 2014 issued a notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. The federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) published a final rule in March 2015 which establishes new or more stringent standards for performing hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. An injunction was issued in September, however, by the U.S. District Court of Wyoming, which bars implementation of this rule. On October 9, 2015, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed the Clean Water Rule nationwide pending further action of the court. The court acknowledged that clarification of the Clean Water Act is needed and that “agencies conscientiously endeavored, within their technical expertise and experience, and based on reliable peer-reviewed science, to promulgate new standards to protect water quality that conform to the Supreme Court’s guidance.”
In response to this decision, the EPA and the Department of Army resumed nationwide use of the agencies’ prior regulations defining the term “waters of the United States.” Those regulations will be implemented as they were prior to August 27, 2015, by applying relevant case law, applicable policy, and the best science and technical data on a case-by-case basis in determining which waters are protected by the Clean Water Act. In another example, several legal initiatives and regulations have emerged seeking to reduce greenhouse gas emissions which the EPA has found to present a danger to public health and the environment. This includes regulations under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases and require annual monitoring and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain production sources in the United States. The adoption of these types of regulations, legislation or other regulatory initiatives and restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities and greenhouse gas emissions could burden operators and adversely affect the production of crude oil and natural gas, which would, in turn, adversely affect our revenues and results of operations by decreasing demand for our seismic data and related services. For more information on hydraulic fracturing, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” beginning on page 14. We invest financial and managerial resources to comply with these laws, regulations and related permit requirements. Various governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance and penalize non-compliance with these laws and regulations as well as the permits issued under them. The inability to timely obtain required permits may result in delays in acquiring new data for our data library or may cause operating losses. As laws and regulations and our business change over time, the future cost of compliance is uncertain and could be material. Regulations which limit exploration or production activities by oil and gas companies could adversely affect us by reducing the demand for our seismic data. For example, in response to increased public concerns that hydraulic fracturing may adversely affect drinking water supplies, increase emissions of perceived greenhouse gases and/or adversely affect local community infrastructure, including, for example, through increased truck traffic, hydraulic fracturing has become the subject of controversy and increased opposition by certain environmental groups. It has been the subject of numerous private and governmental studies, and has triggered increased governmental regulation. While the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions, several federal agencies including the EPA and BLM, have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. Congress has from time to time considered the adoption of legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and regional or state agencies with control over the withdrawal of water used in hydraulic fracturing activities may impose stringent conditions on, or delay or prohibit, such water withdrawals. At the state level, a growing number of states have adopted legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. In addition, local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Furthermore, several federal governmental agencies including the EPA are working with states and other key stakeholders to assess adverse impacts that hydraulic fracturing may have on drinking water or groundwater sources or otherwise to help ensure that natural gas extraction does not come at the expense of public health and the environment. The EPA’s final report, “Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas: Impacts from the Hydraulic Fracturing Water Cycle on Drinking Water Resources in the United States,” (EPA-600-R-16-236ES) was issued December 13, 2016. In the report, the EPA concluded that activities throughout the hydraulic fracturing water cycle - from water withdrawal through 
12

disposal of produced water - “can impact [and have impacted], drinking water resources under some circumstances.” In addition to finding that spills of hydraulic fracturing chemicals had sometimes reached drinking water resources, the EPA also identified incidents of the well injection process itself contaminating drinking water resources. EPA researchers concluded that six hydraulic fracturing activities are “more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts” to drinking water: water withdrawals; chemical spills; injection of fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fluids directly into groundwater; inappropriate discharge of fracturing wastewater into streams and lakes; and storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. 
With the new administration, new federal requirements on hydraulic fracturing are unlikely and regulations of fracking activities will likely fall to the states. This final report, as well as its enforcement and other agency studies, depending on any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing, which events could delay or curtail production of oil and natural gas by E&P operators, some of which are our customers, and thus reduce demand for our seismic data and related services. Additionally, any such decrease in the demand for our seismic data and related services could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. Because of more stringent existing or any new federal, state or local legal restrictions related to the hydraulic fracturing process in areas where our E&P customers operate, those customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, which could reduce demand for our seismic data and related services.
Seasonality and Timing Factors
Our results of operations fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors. Our results are influenced by oil and gas industry capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns. These budgets are not necessarily spent in equal or progressive increments during the year, with spending patterns affected by individual oil and gas company requirements as well as industry-wide conditions. In addition, under our revenue recognition policy, revenue recognition from data licensing contracts is dependent upon, among other things, when the customer selects the data or when the data becomes available for delivery. As a result, our seismic data revenue does not necessarily flow evenly or progressively during a year or from year to year. Although the majority of our data licensing transactions provide for fees to us of under $750,000 per transaction, occasionally a single data license transaction from our library, including those resulting from the merger and acquisition or property sales activity of our oil and gas customers, may be substantially larger. Such large license transactions, the completion and delivery of data or an unusually large number of, or reduction in, data selections by customers can materially impact our results during a quarter, creating an impression of a revenue trend that may not be repeated in subsequent periods. In our data creation activities, weather-related or other events outside our control may impact or delay surveys during any given quarter.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we and our subsidiaries had 82 full-time employees, including five executive officers, 16 marketing staff and 27 technical staff. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
