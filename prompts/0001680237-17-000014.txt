Description of business 
  
Jasmin Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada as a for-profit company on October 7, 2014 and established a fiscal year end of June 30. We are a development-stage company formed to produce and distribute our unique design products made from cork material in France. We have developed our business plan, registered a webpage www.jasmincorp.com, purchased equipment for our process and signed agreements with Un Rien De Vous, Ladivor Leu and Boutet Co. Ltd. We have purchased equipment, raw materials and additional production items from Jinan Donglian CNC Technology Co., Ltd. and started our production process in the design industry. 
 
Product 
 
The following are examples of our various cork products:
 
Wine Cork Monogram 
 Cork Craft Projects
 Monogram Wine Cork Tray 
 Drink Coaster
 Food Coaster and others 
 
We have a signed sales agreement with our customers Un Rien De Vous, Ladivor Leu and Boutet Co. Ltd. These agreements do not bind the parties who signed the agreements and they do not serve as a contract obligating the customers to purchase our products. We are currently negotiating new sales contracts with potential new customers, Du Mondere Mais and Decora. 
 
Our specific goal is to produce unique products that could serve as decorative, interior design items, and kitchen facilities and can be used in any area. At the current stage of our operation, we concentrate on contacting decoration and design companies and offer our unique products for their needs. We believe that our environment friendly materials and uniqueness of the design will attract customers and our business will be successful. We also will provide our customers with one-year warranty for our items. We plan on expanding our product selection in the future. The table sets, carpets, frames and unique design elements are very popular in outdoor restaurants, resorts, and residences or simply as stand-alone products. 
 
We have our Chinese vendor Jinan Donglian CNC Technology Co., Ltd, with whom we are working on verbal ordering basis for supplying raw materials to the Company. Jasmin Corp. also has a few more vendors in Shanghai Rui Ind. l Co., Ltd. and Zhuoma Dong Co., Ltd. to work with on sourcing our raw materials, if needed in the future. The manufacturing of the products does not have specific sequence of actions, as each of our products is unique and designed personally for our customers. As an example, as decoration for the kitchen we can produce coasters for glasses and dishes with names or pictures on them, using our cork material and features of our laser wood engraving machine. 
 
Our main production process 
 In accordance to customer needs and preferences, our production process consists gathering together different materials into something unique and original. For example, the production of original “heart” gifts for Valentine’s Day in the form of wall panels  or tubes consist of putting together the cork with specific lengths and shapes. The corks can also be colored and could contain printed pictures, to make items look more personal and attractive to the customer. Such original “heart” shapes can be used as a reminder-board or a place for your favorite photos as memorable gifts for the proper vocation.

 The Company can also print different images on its decoration items, or print on the materials and then compose them into the final decoration. The same process can be applied to wood engraving methods. The words or images can be engraved on cork materials as a single decoration or composed together into one stylish decoration item. 
 The Company has paid for the production equipment and additional raw materials as of the date of this filing. 
 
Target Market 
  
It is our belief, based on management’s observations and information gleaned from major French magazines (Home magazines) that contemporary table sets, carpets, frames and unique design elements have increased in popularity over time, and they have caused significant impact upon popular culture and have spawned many fads. New technology has stock continuously changing with popularity. The simple and easy to use design items are set to provide the customers with the product they seek with no bells and whistles. This helps to keep the cost of such design solutions low. This contemporary market is our target market.
  
The Company also has an agreement with Un Rien De Vous, a designing company, for a one year term with an option to extend for future sales of our unique design items made from cork material. The Company currently has an additional sales contract with Ladivor Leu and Boutet Co. Ltd. Also the Company is in negotiations with Du Mondere Mais and Decora, designing companies for future sales to them as well. There can be no assurance that the Company will negotiate acceptable terms and reach an actual agreement with Du Mondere Mais and Decora. 
 
Industry analysis
  
We believe that this area of design is very competitive nowadays. The Company has identified several main competitors, such as Oeneo Bouchage, Sas Bouchons Abel, Sarl Arc Bois, which produce similar products to us. Jasmin Corp. is planning to develop the Company’s structure based on uniqueness and ecological factors. In addition to the established competitors in this industry, there are many smaller designing companies that can be reached via industry magazine advertising and direct contact. However, there is no assurance that we will be successful in finding any additional potential customers. 
 
Marketing 
  
Our industry has various ways of marketing. The Company is going to start from trade exhibitions, which we believe is the best for us at the moment. With such events we can attract additional customers, show our items and meet our competitors.
  
Industry advertising 
  
When we raise sufficient fund, we intend to advertise online and place ads in industry-related magazines. The Company will create accounts on social networks, such as Facebook and Instagram, also in relation to the industry websites to make our name better known. We anticipate that our customers will increase after doing so.
