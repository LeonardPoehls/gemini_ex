Overview
 
Cobalt International Energy, Inc. (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is an independent exploration and production company with operations in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola and Gabon in West Africa. 
Chapter 11 Proceedings
 
On December 14, 2017 (the “Petition Date”), we and certain of our subsidiaries (collectively, the “Debtors”) filed voluntary petitions for relief (collectively, the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”).  The Chapter 11 Cases have been consolidated for procedural purposes only and are being jointly administered under the caption “In re Cobalt International Energy, Inc., et al.”  Bankruptcy Court filings and other information related to the Chapter 11 Cases are available at a website administered by the notice and claims agent at www.kccllc.net/cobalt.  
 
On December 21, 2017, an official committee of unsecured creditors was appointed in the Chapter 11 Cases.  No trustee has been appointed.  We are currently operating our business and properties as debtors and debtors–in–possession subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the orders of the Bankruptcy Court.  To ensure continued ordinary course operations, the Company received approval from the Bankruptcy Court on a variety of “first day” motions, including motions that authorize the Company to pay employee wages and benefits, pay taxes and certain governmental fees and charges, maintain its existing cash management system and other customary relief.

Subject to certain exceptions provided for in Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code, all judicial and administrative proceedings against the Debtors or its property were automatically enjoined, or stayed, as of the Petition Date. In addition, the filing of new judicial or administrative actions against the Debtors or its property for claims arising prior to the Petition Date was automatically enjoined.  This prohibits, for example, the Debtors’ lenders or noteholders from pursuing claims for defaults under the Debtors’ debt agreements and the Debtors’ contract counterparties from pursuing claims for defaults under their contracts.  Accordingly, unless the Bankruptcy Court agrees to lift the automatic stay, all of the Debtors’ prepetition liabilities and obligations will be settled or compromised under the Bankruptcy Code as part of our Chapter 11 Cases.
 
We intend to consummate a sale of all or substantially all of the Debtors’ assets in the Chapter 11 Cases.  On the Petition Date, the Debtors filed a motion seeking Bankruptcy Court approval of certain bidding procedures and a timeline for the sale process.  On January 25, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered the Order (I) Approving Bidding Procedures for the Sale of the Debtors’ Assets, (II) Scheduling an Auction, (III) Approving the Form and Manner of Notice Thereof, (IV) Scheduling Hearing and Objection Deadlines with Respect to the Debtors’ Disclosure Statement and Plan Confirmation, and (V) Granting Related Relief [Docket No. 299] that, among other things, established (i) 5:00 p.m. (prevailing Central Time) on February 22, 2018 for the final bid deadline for all sale transactions, and (ii) 10:00 a.m. (prevailing Central Time) on March 6, 2018 for an auction, if needed.  The Debtors are seeking authority, on and after the confirmation date of their chapter 11 plan, to consummate the sale transactions pursuant to the terms of the sale transaction documentation, the chapter 11 plan, and the order confirming the chapter 11 plan.
 
U.S. Gulf of Mexico
 
Our U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations target oil–focused prospects in the subsalt Miocene and Inboard Lower Tertiary horizons in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico.  These horizons are characterized by well–defined hydrocarbon systems, comprised primarily of high quality source rock and oil, and contain several of the most significant hydrocarbon discoveries in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico in recent years.
 
5


Our operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico consist of four discoveries: Heidelberg, North Platte, Shenandoah and Anchor.  As of December 31, 2017, we also owned interests in 121 blocks within the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, representing approximately 679,680 gross (361,152 net) acres.  
 
Heidelberg
 
The Heidelberg field is located approximately 140 miles south of Port Fourchon off the Louisiana coast in 5,300 feet of water in the Green Canyon area.  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation (“Anadarko”) is the operator, and we own a 9.375% working interest.  The Heidelberg field was discovered in 2009, appraised in 2012, formally sanctioned in 2013 and began initial production in early 2016.  
 
Heidelberg is currently producing approximately 35,500 BOE per day gross from five wells.  As of December 31, 2017, our share of the Heidelberg field had estimated net proved reserves of 1.1 MMBbls of oil, 0.4 Bcf of natural gas and 0.05 MMBbls of natural gas liquids, or 1.3 MMBOE, and a standardized measure of $17.3 million.  This oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve information is derived from our reserve report prepared by Netherland, Sewell and Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our independent reserve engineering firm.  
 
North Platte
 
The North Platte field is located approximately 190 miles south of Port Fourchon off the Louisiana coast in 4,500 feet of water in the Garden Banks area. We are the operator, and we own a 60% working interest.
 
In 2017, we completed our appraisal program at North Platte.  In December 2017, we filed for a suspension of production (“SOP”) with the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”).  If BSEE does not grant an SOP, or if operations at North Platte are not resumed, the unit and the leases will terminate in June 2018.  As a contingency to the SOP process, we are also currently in the planning stages for an additional well. 
 
Shenandoah  
 
The Shenandoah field, in which we currently own a 20% working interest, is located approximately 170 miles south of Port Fourchon off the Louisiana coast in 5,800 feet of water in the Walker Ridge area.  In December 2017, we received notices from Anadarko Petroleum Corporation and Conoco Phillips Company, our partners in the Shenandoah field, of their intent to withdraw from the project.  Their withdrawals became effective in February 2018.  We are currently working with our partners to determine the impact of these withdrawals on operatorship and the allocation of interests.  Absent obtaining an SOP or commencing well operations at Shenandoah, the unit and lease will terminate in April 2018.
 
In 2017, Anadarko expensed all of its capitalized costs associated with Shenandoah and disclosed that it had “currently suspended further appraisal activities.”  As a result of this disclosure, we determined that Shenandoah was not making sufficient progress and we expensed $236.7 million of suspended exploratory well costs related to Shenandoah.  
 
Anchor  
 
The Anchor field is located approximately 150 miles south of Port Fourchon off the Louisiana coast in 5,183 feet of water. Chevron U.S.A. Inc. (“Chevron”) is the operator, and we own a 20% working interest.
 
In August 2017, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) approved the assignment of 80% of record title interest in leases we owned immediately south of the existing Anchor unit to our co–owners, and in February 2018, BSEE approved the expansion of the Anchor unit to include portions of these two south Anchor leases which will serve to preserve these leases.
 
The appraisal drilling program for the Anchor field concluded in 2017 with the completion of the Anchor #4 well.  In January 2018, Chevron filed an SOP with BSEE.  Approval of the SOP would preserve the leases and the Anchor unit.

Alliance with Total
 
In 2009, we and Total E&P USA, INC. (“Total”) entered into a long–term alliance through a series of transactions in which we and Total combined certain U.S. Gulf of Mexico exploratory lease inventory through the exchange of a 40% interest in our leases for a 60% interest in Total’s leases. Pursuant to the agreement, we formed a reciprocal area of mutual interest with Total that covered substantially all of the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, subject to certain exclusions. Total’s obligations under the agreement consisted principally of paying its share of certain general and administrative costs relating to our operations in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
 In June 2017, Total exercised its option to terminate the alliance in accordance with its rights pursuant to the agreement.  
 
West Africa
 
Offshore Angola and Gabon are characterized by the presence of salt formations and oil bearing sediments located in pre–salt and above salt horizons.  Pre–salt refers to oil accumulations trapped in formations that are beneath and older than the original in–place salt layer.  In pre–salt areas, exploration is focused on potential reservoirs that were deposited prior to salt formation.  We believe the geology offshore Angola (Kwanza Basin) and Gabon (South Gabon Coastal Basin) is an analog to the geology offshore Brazil where several pre–salt discoveries and producing fields are located. The basis for this hypothesis is that 150 million years ago, current day South America and Africa were part of a larger continent that broke apart. As these land masses slowly drifted away from each other, rift basins formed that were filled with organic rich material and sediments, which in time became hydrocarbon source rocks and reservoirs. A thick salt layer was subsequently deposited, forming a seal over the reservoirs. Finally the continents continued to drift apart, forming two symmetric geologic areas separated by the Atlantic Ocean. This symmetry in geology is particularly notable in the deepwater areas offshore Gabon, Angola and the Campos Basin offshore Brazil. 
 
Our operations in West Africa consist of Block 20 and Block 21, both offshore Angola, and the Diaba Block offshore Gabon.  
 
Settlement Agreement with Sonangol
 
In August 2015, we executed a Purchase and Sale Agreement (the “Sale Agreement”) with Sociedade Nacional de Combustiveis de Angola–Empresa Publica (“Sonangol”) for the sale by us to Sonangol of the entire issued and outstanding share capital of our indirect wholly–owned subsidiaries, CIE Angola Block 20 Ltd. and CIE Angola Block 21 Ltd., which respectively hold our 40% working interest in each of Block 20 and Block 21 offshore Angola.  The requisite Angolan government approvals were not received within one year from the execution date and the Sale Agreement terminated by its terms in August 2016. 
 
In 2016, we recorded an impairment of $1,629.8 million related to our Angolan assets in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 932, Extractive Activities – Oil and Gas (“ASC 932”), which requires, among other things, that “sufficient progress” be made with respect to oil and natural gas projects in order to avoid the requirement to expense previously capitalized exploratory or appraisal well costs.  Given Sonangol’s delays and failure to grant the extensions as well as the general investment climate in the Angolan oil and natural gas industry, the procedures of ASC 932 required us to record a full impairment of our Angolan assets.  
 
In March 2017, we submitted a Notice of Dispute to Sonangol pursuant to the Sale Agreement.  Subsequently, we filed a Request for Arbitration (“RFA”) with the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”) against Sonangol for breach of the Sale Agreement.  Through this arbitration proceeding, we are requesting an award against Sonangol in excess of $2.0 billion, plus applicable interest and costs.  In July 2017, Sonangol filed an Answer to our RFA and Counterclaim, asking for repayment of the $250.0 million initial payment that Sonangol made to us under the Sale Agreement.  
 
We also filed a separate RFA with the ICC against Sonangol Pesquisa e Produção, S.A. (“Sonangol P&P”) seeking recovery of approximately $162.0 million in unpaid cash calls, plus applicable interest and costs, representing the joint interest receivable owed to us for operations on Block 21 offshore Angola.

On December 19, 2017, certain of our subsidiaries executed a settlement agreement (the “Agreement”) with Sonangol and Sonangol P&P to resolve all disputes and transition our interests in Blocks 20 and 21 offshore Angola to Sonangol for $500.0 million. Pursuant to the Agreement, Sonangol is required to pay an initial non–refundable payment of $150.0 million on or before February 23, 2018 (the “Initial Payment”) and the final payment of $350.0 million on or before July 1, 2018 (the “Final Payment”).  On January 25, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered an Order Approving Debtors’ Motion for Entry of an Order (I) Authorizing Performance Under Settlement Agreement, (II) Approving Settlement Agreement, and (III) Granting Related Relief [Docket No. 127] authorizing the Debtors’ entry into the Agreement subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein.  The Agreement remains subject to the review of the Bankruptcy Court. 
 
On February 21, 2018, we received the Initial Payment from Sonangol and, in accordance with the Agreement, we (i) notified the relevant ICC arbitral tribunal of the agreement between Sonangol P&P and us to terminate the proceedings related to the joint interest receivable owed to us for operations on Block 21 offshore Angola and (ii) notified the relevant ICC arbitral tribunal of the agreement between Sonangol and us to extend the procedural timetable by an additional four months for the proceedings related to the Sale Agreement (the “PSA Arbitration”).
 
In accordance with the Agreement, we and Sonangol are finalizing definitive documentation to implement our exit from Angola and to extinguish all debts and obligations of us and Sonangol to each other that have not already been extinguished pursuant to the Agreement.  Our claims in the PSA Arbitration will be extinguished upon our receipt of the Final Payment, which is due by July 1, 2018.  Within 48 hours of receipt of the Final Payment, we are required under the Agreement to notify the ICC arbitral tribunal in the PSA Arbitration of our agreement to terminate the proceedings related to the dispute arising from the Sale Agreement.   
 
Block 20 
 
Block 20 is approximately 1.2 million acres in size, or approximately 200 U.S. Gulf of Mexico blocks, and is centered approximately 75 miles west of Luanda in the deepwater Kwanza Basin.  It is immediately to the north of Block 21.  We are the operator of and hold a 40% working interest in Block 20.  Our partners on Block 20 include BP Exploration Angola (Kwanza Benguela) Limited and Sonangol P&P, with each partner holding a 30% working interest.  We have made four discoveries on Block 20: Orca, Zalophus, Golfhino and Lontra.  
 
We acquired our license to explore for, develop and produce oil from Block 20 by executing a Production Sharing Contract (“PSC”) with Sonangol.  The PSC governs our 40% working interest in and operatorship of Block 20 and forms the basis of our exploration, development and production operations on Block 20.  The PSC provides for an initial exploration period of five years, which expired on January 1, 2017.  Without an extension we believe we are entitled to pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the exploration period for Block 20 has ended.  
 
Block 21 
 
Block 21 is approximately 1.2 million acres in size and is 30 to 90 miles offshore Angola in water depths of 1,300 to 5,900 feet in the central portion of the Kwanza Basin.  We are the operator of and hold a 40% working interest in Block 21.  Our partner on Block 21 is Sonangol P&P with a 60% working interest.  We have made three discoveries on Block 21: Cameia, Bicuar and Mavinga.    
 
We acquired our license to explore for, develop and produce oil from Block 21 by executing a Risk Sharing Agreement (“RSA”) with Sonangol.  The RSA governs our 40% working interest in and operatorship of Block 21 and forms the basis of our exploration, development and production operations on this block.  The RSA provides for an initial exploration period of five years.  Pursuant to Executive Decree No. 259/15, this five year period was extended by two years to March 2017.  Without an extension we believe we are entitled to pursuant to the Sale Agreement, the exploration period for Block 21 has ended.  
 
Diaba Block 
 
The Diaba Block is approximately 2.2 million acres in size or approximately 370 U.S. Gulf of Mexico blocks. The block is 40 to 120 miles offshore in water depths of 300 to 10,500 feet in the central portion of the offshore

South Gabon Coastal basin.  Total Gabon, S.A. (“Total Gabon”) is the operator and we own a 21.25% working interest.    
 
We acquired our working interest in the Diaba Block offshore Gabon by entering into an assignment agreement with Total Gabon. Through the assignment we became a party to the Production Sharing Agreement (“PSA”) between Total Gabon and the Republic of Gabon. The PSA gives us the right to recover costs incurred and receive a share of the remaining profit from any commercial discoveries made on the block. Under the terms of the PSA and certain approved extensions, acreage not defined by an approved development area expired in January 2018, subject to certain additional extensions.  Total Gabon is currently working with the Gabonese government on the various extension options, but there can be no assurance that the extensions will be granted.  In 2017, we recorded a $45.3 million impairment charge related to our Gabonese assets in accordance with ASC 932.  
 
Oil, Natural Gas and Natural Gas Liquids Data
 
Reserves
 
Our reserve information is derived from our reserve report prepared by NSAI, our independent reserve engineering firm.  Our estimates of proved reserves are based on the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible – from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods, and government regulations – prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimate.  
 
In order to establish reasonable certainty with respect to our estimated proved reserves, NSAI used technical and economic data including, but not limited to, well logs, geologic maps, seismic data, historical price and cost information, and property ownership interests. The reserves in this report have been estimated using a combination of deterministic and probabilistic methods; these estimates have been prepared in accordance with the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating of and Auditing of Oil & Gas Reserves information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE Standards). NSAI used standard engineering and geoscience methods, or a combination of methods, including volumetric analysis, analogy and reservoir modeling that are considered to be appropriate and necessary to categorize and estimate reserves in accordance with SEC definitions and regulations. 
 
The data in the table below represents estimates only. Oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids reserve engineering is inherently a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured exactly. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and engineering and geological interpretation and judgment. Accordingly, reserve estimates may vary from the quantities of oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids that are ultimately recovered. 
 
The following table presents our estimated net proved reserves at December 31, 2017:
 
 
 | Oil (MMBbls) | | Natural Gas (Bcf) | | Natural Gas Liquids (MMBbls) | MMBOE
-----------------+--------------+-----+-------------------+-----+------------------------------+------
Proved reserves: | | | | | | | 
Developed | | 1.1 | | 0.4 | | --- | 1.3
Undeveloped | | --- | | --- | | — | ---
Total | | 1.1 | | 0.4 | | --- | 1.3

 
Proved developed reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves (“PUDs”) are proved reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. We do not have any reserves that would be classified as synthetic oil or synthetic natural gas.  As of December 31, 2017, we did not have any reserves that would be classified as PUDs.

Internal Controls Applicable to our Reserve Estimates
 
Our policies and procedures regarding internal controls over the recording of our reserves is structured to objectively and accurately estimate our reserves quantities and present values in compliance with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and the SEC’s regulations.  
 
Our Reserve Evaluation Policy outlines the process and standards by which reserves are estimated, classified and reported for all our proved reserves, whether they are operated by us or operated by others.  Rod Skaufel, our President, Operations is accountable for the Reserve Evaluation Policy and the completion of the annual and any in–year reserves estimates.  Mr. Skaufel has over 30 years of experience leading oil and natural gas exploration and production operations activities globally.  He has a Bachelor of Science in Petroleum Engineering from the Colorado School of Mines.  
 
For each reserve estimation, a qualified technical team is established to provide data to NSAI to enable NSAI to prepare its estimate of the extent and value of the proved reserves of certain of our oil and natural gas properties. Our qualified technical team works with NSAI to ensure the integrity, accuracy and timeliness of data we furnish to NSAI for purposes of their reserve estimation process. Our qualified technical team has significant combined years of industry experience among them with positions of increasing responsibility in engineering and evaluations. Each member of our team at a minimum holds a Bachelor of Science degree in petroleum engineering, geology or other relevant degree.
 
The geotechnical, engineering and commercial inputs and interpretations required to calculate the reserves for our portfolio are compiled by our staff, and NSAI is provided full access to information pertaining to the assets and to all applicable personnel. Any differences between reserve estimates internally generated by us and NSAI that exceed established threshold limits are reviewed to ensure the accuracy of the quantifiable data being used in the assessment; available data has been shared and discussed; and that methodologies and assumptions used in the estimations are clearly understood.
 
The principal engineers and geoscientists at NSAI primarily responsible for preparing our reserve estimates are Mr. Joseph J. Spellman and Mr. Ruurdjan (Rudi) de Zoeten.  Mr. Spellman is a Licensed Professional Engineer in the State of Texas (No. 73709) and has over 30 years of practical experience in petroleum engineering.  Mr. de Zoeten is a Licensed Professional Geoscientist in the State of Texas, Geology (No. 3179) and has over 25 years of practical experience in petroleum geosciences.  Both technical principals meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements as defined by the standards of the Society of Petroleum Engineers; both are proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
 
The audit committee of our board of directors reviews the processes utilized in the development of our Reserve Evaluation Policy and our reserve report prepared by NSAI annually.

The royalties on our lease blocks in the Gulf of Mexico range from 12.5% to 18.75% with an average of 18.26%.
 
Most of our U.S. Gulf of Mexico blocks have a 10 year primary term, expiring between 2018 and 2026. Assuming we are able to commence exploration and production activities or successfully exploit our properties during the primary lease term, our leases would extend beyond the primary term, generally for the life of production. 
 
The table below summarizes our undeveloped acreage scheduled to expire in the next five years:

Drilling Activity
 
The following table summarizes our approximate gross and net interest in wells completed by us during 2017, 2016 and 2015, regardless of when drilling was initiated.  The information should not be considered indicative of future performance, nor should it be assumed that there is necessarily any correlation between the numbers of wells drilled, quantities of reserves found or economic value.

As of December 31, 2017, we were not participating in the drilling of any wells in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (including wells that are temporarily suspended).  
 
Productive Wells
 
As of December 31, 2017, we had five gross (0.5 net) productive oil wells in our Heidelberg field.  
 
Drilling Rig Commitments
 
In June 2017, we completed operations at North Platte and released the drilling rig we had previously contracted with Rowan (UK) Reliance Companies plc.  
 
Competition
 
The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.  We encounter strong competition from other independent operators and from major and national oil and natural gas companies in acquiring properties, contracting for drilling 
 
12


equipment and securing trained personnel.  Many of these competitors have financial and technical resources and staffs substantially larger than ours.  As a result, our competitors may be better able to withstand the financial pressures of significant declines in oil and natural gas prices, unsuccessful drill attempts, delays, sustained periods of volatility in financial markets and generally adverse global and industry–wide economic conditions, and may be better able to absorb unsuccessful drill attempts and the burdens resulting from changes in relevant laws and regulations, which would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position.
 
Title to Property
 
We believe that we have satisfactory title to our leasehold and license interests in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry.  Our prospect interests are subject to applicable customary royalty and other interests, liens under operating agreements and secured notes, liens for current taxes, and other burdens, easements, restrictions and encumbrances customary in the oil and natural gas industry that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of or affect our carrying value of the prospect interests.  Our 10.75% first lien notes and 7.75% second lien notes are secured by mortgages over substantially all of our oil and natural gas properties in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. 
Containment Resources
 
We are a member of several industry groups that provide general and specific oil spill and well containment resources in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, including HWCG, LLC, formerly Helix Well Containment Group, Clean Gulf Associates, the Marine Preservation Association, and National Response Corporation.  In addition to these memberships, we also have existing contracts with a number of contractors which have equipment that could assist in well containment efforts as well as with the surface effects of a subsea blowout or in addressing a concurrent surface spill. Examples of such equipment include, but are not limited to, anchor and supply vessels, subsea transponders and communication equipment, subsea cutting equipment, debris removal equipment, air and water monitoring and scientific support vessels, remote-operated vehicles, storage and shuttle vessels, and subsea dispersant equipment.
 
Furthermore, we also have contracts in place with Witt–O’Brien’s and The Response Group for the provision of additional emergency response management services to help us address an incident in either the U.S. Gulf of Mexico or West Africa.
 
We are also members of the Oil Spill Response, Ltd. Global Dispersant Stockpile. This membership provides us access to a supply of over one million gallons of dispersant for use in a subsea well control event. This stockpile is stored in six locations around the world in portable containers ready for air freight transport.
 
Insurance Coverage
 
In accordance with industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of the operating risks to which our business is exposed.  In general, our current insurance policies cover physical damage to our oil and natural gas assets. The coverage is designed to repair or replace assets damaged by insurable events. Certain of our stated insurance limits scale down to our working interest in the prospect being drilled, including certain operator’s extra expense and third party liability coverage. All insurance recovery is subject to various deductibles or retentions as well as specific terms, conditions and exclusions associated with each individual policy. 
 
For our U.S. Gulf of Mexico operations, we purchase (i) operator’s extra expense insurance with limits per well of $650 million, which covers costs to regain control of a well, to redrill the well and for pollution cleanup expenses associated with a loss of well control incident, (ii) third party liability insurance with limits of $200 million including coverage for third party bodily injury or death, property damage and cleanup of pollution on a sudden and accidental basis, and (iii) property insurance for our interest in the Anadarko operated Heidelberg field with limits of full replacement cost value.  We believe that our coverage limits are sufficient and are consistent with our exposure; however, there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability and loss from all potential consequences and damages associated with losses, should they occur. 
 
We also purchase director and officer liability insurance. Recoveries under such insurance policies are subject to various deductibles or retentions as well as specific terms, conditions and exclusions. Certain of our insurance providers are disputing coverage for certain expenses and potential liabilities, including with respect to, our current 
 
13


shareholder litigation matters. We are enforcing our rights to coverage pursuant to our insurance agreements with these insurance providers and believe such expenses and potential liabilities are covered by such insurance, within certain thresholds.  Additional information about this matter is set forth in “Item 3. Legal Proceedings” contained herein.
 
We re–evaluate the purchase of insurance, coverage limits and deductibles annually. Future insurance coverage for the oil and natural gas industry could increase in cost and may include higher deductibles or retentions. In addition, some forms of insurance may become unavailable in the future or unavailable on terms that are economically acceptable. No assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable and we may maintain only catastrophic coverage for certain risks in the future.
 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters and Regulation
 
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex international, foreign, federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern the protection of the environment as well as the discharge of materials into the environment.  These laws and regulations may, among other things:

• | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require the installation of pollution control equipment in connection with operations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | place restrictions or regulations upon the use or disposal of the material utilized in our operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas exploration, drilling, production and transportation activities;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limit or prohibit drilling activities in certain locations lying within protected or otherwise sensitive areas;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | govern gathering, transportation and marketing of oil and natural gas pipeline and facilities construction;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require remedial measures to mitigate or address pollution from our operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | impose bonding or other financial requirements with respect to future decommissioning obligations; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require the expenditure of significant amounts in connection with worker health and safety.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible.  The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability.  Additionally, Congress and federal, state and local agencies frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and such changes could result in increased costs for environmental compliance, such as waste handling, permitting, or cleanup for the oil and natural gas industry and could have a significant impact on our operating costs.  In general, the oil and natural gas industry continues to be the subject of increased legislation and regulatory attention with respect to environmental matters. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) has renewed environmental compliance by the energy extraction sector as one of its enforcement initiatives through 2019.  
 
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which our business operations are subject.
 
Oil Exploration
 
Public interest in the protection of the environment and human health has increased, particularly in light of the Deepwater Horizon incident in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in 2010.  The U.S. government and its regulatory agencies with jurisdiction over oil and natural gas exploration, including the U.S. Department of the Interior (“DOI”) and two of its agencies, the BOEM and the BSEE, which together formerly comprised the Bureau of Ocean Energy 
 
14


Management, Regulation and Enforcement (“BOEMRE”), responded to this incident by imposing moratoria on drilling operations.  These agencies adopted numerous new regulations and new interpretations of existing regulations regarding operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico that are applicable to us and with which our new applications for exploration plans and drilling permits must prove compliant.  
 
Examples of relevant regulations include (i) the Increased Safety Measures for Energy Development on the Outer Continental Shelf—Final Rule, which sets forth increased safety measures for offshore energy development and requires, among other things, that all offshore operators submit written certifications as to compliance with the rules and regulations for operations occurring in the Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) including the submission of independent third party written certifications as to the capabilities of certain safety devices, such as blowout preventers and their components, and (ii) the Workplace Safety Rule (including its subsequent revisions), which includes requirements such as the development and implementation of a comprehensive Safety and Environmental Management System (“SEMS”) for oil and natural gas operations.  In December 2017, BSEE published a proposed rule, i.e., the Oil and Gas and Sulphur Operations on the Outer Continental Shelf–Oil and Gas Production Safety Systems-Revisions, which proposes to amend certain provisions of the aforementioned regulations; however, it appears the regulations are currently in effect.
 
In April 2016, BSEE finalized new well control regulations, which include more stringent design requirements and operational procedures for critical well control equipment.  These requirements include those aimed at improving equipment reliability, regulating drilling margin and preventing blowouts, as well as reforms in well design, well control, casing, cementing, real–time well monitoring and subsea containment.  The majority of the requirements became effective in 2016; however, several requirements have more extended timeframes for implementation and compliance.  In December 2017, BSEE submitted a proposed rule to revise these standards, and it is currently under review by the Office of Management and Budget. The regulations required to be implemented in the future could result in some delays of our drilling or production operations.
 
In June 2013, the so–called SEMS II Rule amended the Work Place Safety rule to include additional safety requirements.  Operators, including us, were required to comply with the SEMS II Rule, and have an independent audit completed by June 2015, which we completed in advance of the deadline.  In addition, BSEE proposed revisions in 2013 to 30 CFR 250, subpart H on Oil and Gas Production Safety Systems to address recent technological advances in production safety systems and equipment used to collect and treat oil and natural gas from OCS leases. In September 2016, BSEE published the final rule which includes certain standards concerning the use of best available and safest technology, more rigorous design and testing requirements for boarding shut down valves, and an increase in approved leakage rates for certain safety valves.  These new regulations may result in delays in the permitting process.  As discussed above, these regulations are currently being reconsidered by BSEE.
 
Additionally, the BOEM issues Notices to Lessees (“NTL”) which regulate our operations.  NTL 2015–N01 sets forth requirements for exploration plans, development and production plans and development operations coordination documents and NTL No. 2010–N10 adds certain additional requirements such as reporting, spill containment, and certification. 
 
In July 2016, BOEM issued NTL No. 2016-N01 detailing procedures to determine, on an annual basis, a lessee’s ability to carry out its lease obligations – primarily the decommissioning of OCS facilities – and whether to require lessees to furnish additional financial assurance.  In January 2017, BOEM announced its decision to extend the implementation timeline for the NTL by an additional six months as to leases, rights–of–way and rights–of–use and easement for which there are co-lessees and/or predecessors in interest, in order to continue its interactive process to gather additional input from all interested parties, including industry stakeholders.  BOEM is currently reviewing NTL No. 2016–N01 and, during the review period, has extended the implementation timeline beyond the initial June 30, 2017 timeline, except in circumstances where there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s decommissioning liabilities.   
 
Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
 
The U.S. Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non–hazardous wastes.  Although drilling fluids, produced waters, and most of the other wastes associated with the exploration, 
 
15


development and production of oil or natural gas are currently exempt from regulations as hazardous waste under RCRA, we generate waste as a routine part of our operations that may be subject to RCRA.  Although a substantial amount of the waste generated in our operations is regulated as non–hazardous solid waste rather than hazardous waste, there is no guarantee that the EPA or individual states will not adopt more stringent requirements for the handling of non–hazardous or exempt waste or categorize some non–hazardous or exempt waste as hazardous in the future. Any such change could result in an increase in our costs to manage and dispose of waste, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.
 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”) imposes joint and several liability for costs of investigation and remediation and for natural resource damages without regard to fault or legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons with respect to the release into the environment of substances designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances. These classes of persons, or so–called potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) include the current and past owners or operators of a site where the release occurred and anyone who disposed or arranged for the disposal of a hazardous substance found at the site. CERCLA also authorizes the EPA and, in some instances, third parties to take actions in response to threats to public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the PRPs the costs of such action. Many states have adopted comparable or more stringent statutes.  As a result, we could be held liable under CERCLA or analogous state laws for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites where such wastes have been disposed. 
Clean Water Act
 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, or Clean Water Act, as amended (“CWA”), and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls on the discharge of pollutants, produced waters and other oil and natural gas wastes into waters of the United States.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, or an analogous state agency. In addition, spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements under federal law require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak.  Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
Oil Pollution Act 
 
The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”), which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the CWA and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters or adjoining shorelines.  OPA assigns joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages.  A liable “responsible party” includes the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located. The OPA also requires the lessee or permittee of the offshore area in which a covered offshore facility is located to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover potential liabilities related to an oil spill for which such person would be statutorily responsible.  The amount depends on the risk represented by the quantity or quality of oil handled by such facility. BSEE has promulgated regulations that implement the financial responsibility requirements of the OPA. A failure to comply with the OPA’s requirements or inadequate cooperation during a spill response action may subject a responsible party to civil, administrative and/or criminal enforcement actions. 
Clean Air Act
 
Our operations are subject to the federal Clean Air Act, (“CAA”), and analogous state laws and local ordinances governing the control of emissions from sources of air pollution.  Our operations utilize equipment that emits air pollutants subject to the CAA and other pollution control laws. These laws require utilization of air emissions abatement equipment to achieve prescribed emissions limitations and ambient air quality standards, as well as operating permits for existing equipment and construction permits for new and modified equipment. Regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other 
 
16


requirements of the CAA or other air pollution laws and regulations, including the suspension or termination of permits and monetary fines. The EPA has also issued final source performance standards and permitting requirements aimed to limit emissions of methane, certain volatile organic compounds and toxic air pollutants, such as benzene from new, reconstructed and modified oil and natural gas sources.  The EPA announced in April 2017 its intention to reconsider certain aspects of the Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources for the oil and natural gas sector and stay certain requirements; however, the rule is still in effect.  These regulations could require us to incur additional expenses to control air emissions by installing emissions control technologies and adhering to a variety of work practice and other requirements.
 
Climate Change Legislation
 
Our operations and the combustion of petroleum and natural gas based products results in the emission of greenhouse gases (“GHG”) that could contribute to global climate change. Climate change regulation has gained momentum in recent years internationally and domestically at the federal, regional, state and local levels. Some states, regions and localities have adopted or have considered programs to address GHG emissions.  In addition, the U.S. Congress has at times considered the passage of laws to limit GHG emissions. Additionally, it is possible that federal legislation related to GHG emissions will be considered by Congress in the future. More stringent laws and regulations relating to climate change and GHGs may be adopted in the future and could cause us to incur material expenses in complying with them. 
 
In the absence of comprehensive U.S. federal legislation on GHG emission control, the EPA has issued final and proposed regulations pursuant to the CAA to limit carbon dioxide and other GHG emissions. Pursuant to the EPA’s “Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gases” final rule (the “GHG Reporting Rule”), operators of stationary sources emitting more than established annual thresholds of carbon dioxide equivalent GHGs, as well as onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage and distribution facilities, must monitor, inventory and report the GHG emissions annually. Significant financial expenditures could be required to comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements under the EPA's GHG reporting program.  We have submitted annual reports for emissions starting with our 2012 GHG emissions. Under EPA regulations finalized in May 2010 (formerly referred to as the “Tailoring Rule”), the EPA began regulating GHG emissions from certain stationary sources in January 2011. The EPA attempted to require the permitting of GHG emissions; although the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the permitting requirements, it upheld the EPA’s authority to control GHG emissions when a permit is required due to emissions of other pollutants. 
 
In August 2015 the EPA proposed new regulations to reduce methane emissions from oil and natural gas operations in an effort to reduce methane emissions from the oil and natural gas sector by up to 45 percent by 2025. The EPA issued updated and final new source performance standards regulations in 2016 for reducing methane from new and modified oil and natural gas production sources and natural gas processing and transmission sources. In April 2017, EPA indicated that they intend to reconsider certain aspects of the 2016 new source performance standards for the oil and natural gas sector. In June 2017, EPA issued two proposals to stay certain of these requirements and reconsider the entirety of the 2016 rules; however, the rules currently remain in effect.
 
On the international level, in April 2016, 195 nations signed and officially entered into an international climate change accord (the “Paris Agreement”), which calls for member countries to set their own GHG emissions targets, make these emissions targets more stringent over time and be transparent about the GHG emissions reporting and the measures each country will use to achieve its GHG emissions targets. A long–term goal of the Paris Agreement is to limit global temperature increase to well below two degrees Celsius from temperatures in the pre–industrial era. In June 2017, the United States announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, although the earliest possible effective date of withdrawal is November 2020.  Despite the planned withdrawal, certain U.S. city and state governments have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the Paris Agreement. Additionally, under the Kyoto Protocol various nations, including Angola and Gabon, have committed to reducing their GHG emissions. The Kyoto Protocol has been extended until 2020.
 
Because of the lack of any comprehensive legislative program addressing GHGs, there is a great deal of uncertainty as to how and when federal regulation of GHGs might take place. Moreover, the federal, regional, state and local regulatory initiatives also could have a material adverse effect on the marketability of the oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids we produce. 
 
17


Protected Species and Habitats
 
The Endangered Species Act was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to that act, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities that would harm the species or that would adversely affect that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.  Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities could be prohibited or delayed in areas where protected species or habitats may be located, or expensive mitigation may be required to accommodate such activities.
 
Executive Order 13158, issued in 2000, directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas (“MPAs”) in the United States and establish new MPAs. The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable. It also directs the EPA to propose regulations under the CWA to ensure appropriate levels of protection for the marine environment. This order and related CWA regulations have the potential to have a material adverse effect on our operations by restricting areas in which we may carry out future development and exploration projects and/or causing us to incur increased operating expenses.
 
Environmental Issues in Connection with Governmental Approvals
 
Our operations frequently require licenses, permits and other governmental approvals. Several federal statutes, including the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”), the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), and the Coastal Zone Management Act (“CZMA”) require federal agencies to evaluate environmental issues in connection with granting such approvals or taking other major agency actions.  OCSLA, for instance, requires the DOI to evaluate whether certain proposed activities would cause serious harm or damage to the marine, coastal or human environment, and gives the DOI authority to refuse to issue, suspend or revoke permits and licenses allowing such activities in certain circumstances, including when there is a threat of serious harm or damage to the marine, coastal or human environment.  Similarly, NEPA requires DOI and other federal agencies to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. In the course of such evaluations, an agency must prepare an environmental assessment and, potentially, an environmental impact statement.  If such NEPA documents are required, the preparation of such could significantly delay the permitting process and involve increased costs.  CZMA, on the other hand, aids states in developing a coastal management program to protect the coastal environment from growing demands associated with various uses, including offshore oil and natural gas development.  In obtaining various approvals from the DOI, we will have to certify that we will conduct our activities in a manner consistent with any applicable CZMA program.  Violation of these foregoing requirements may result in civil, administrative or criminal penalties.
Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials
 
Wastes containing naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) may also be generated in connection with our operations. Certain oil and natural gas exploration and production activities may enhance the radioactivity, or the concentration, of NORM. In the United States, NORM is subject to regulation primarily under individual state radiation control regulations.  In addition, NORM handling and management activities are governed by regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”). These regulations impose certain requirements concerning worker protection; the treatment, storage and disposal of NORM waste; the management of waste piles, containers and tanks containing NORM; and restrictions on the uses of land with NORM contamination.
 
OSHA and Other Laws and Regulations
 
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes, where applicable. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right–to–know regulations under the Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes, where applicable, require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations.  Such laws and regulations also require us to ensure our workplaces meet minimum safety standards and provide for compensation to employees injured as a result of our failure to meet these standards as well as civil and/or criminal penalties in certain circumstances.  We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all such existing laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance 
 
18


with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
 Other Regulation of the Oil and Natural Gas Industry
 
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state and local authorities.  Rules and regulations affecting the oil and natural gas industry are under constant review for amendment or expansion, which could increase the regulatory burden and the potential sanctions for noncompliance. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for failure to comply. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry may increase our cost of doing business, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
Homeland Security Regulations
 
The Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007 requires the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”) to issue regulations establishing risk–based performance standards for the security of chemical and industrial facilities, including oil and natural gas facilities that are deemed to present “high levels of security risk.” The DHS is currently in the process of adopting regulations that will determine whether our operations may in the future be subject to DHS mandated security requirements. Presently, it is not possible to accurately estimate the costs we could incur, directly or indirectly, to comply with any such facility security laws or regulations, but such expenditures could be substantial.
Exploration and Production
 
Statutes, rules and regulations affecting exploration and production undergo constant review and often are amended, expanded and reinterpreted, making difficult the prediction of future costs or the impact of regulatory compliance attributable to new laws and statutes. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business and, consequently, affects its profitability. Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most jurisdictions in which we operate also regulate one or more of the following:

• | the location of wells;
--+-----------------------


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells and decommissioning of related equipment; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | produced water and disposal of waste water, drilling fluids and other liquids and solids utilized or produced in the drilling and extraction process.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Regulation of Transportation of Natural Gas
 
The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of natural gas. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to natural gas pipeline transportation. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, or FERC. The FERC’s regulations for interstate natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas. 
 
Although natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on the operations of the underlying properties. Sales of condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.
 

19


U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Customs Service
 
The transportation of drilling rigs to the sites of our prospects in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and our operation of such drilling rigs is subject to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S. Customs Service. Such regulation sets safety standards, authorizes investigations into vessel operations and accidents and governs the passage of vessels into U.S. territory. We are required by these agencies to obtain various permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations.
 
Laws and Regulations of Angola and Gabon
 
Our exploration and production activities offshore Angola and Gabon are subject to Angolan and Gabonese regulations, respectively.  Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties.  Moreover, these laws and regulations could change in ways that could substantially increase our costs or affect our operations.  The following are summaries of certain applicable regulatory frameworks in Angola and Gabon.
 
Angola
 
The petroleum agreements entered with Sonangol set forth the main provisions for exploration and production activities, including fiscal terms, mandatory State participation, obligations to meet domestic supply requirements, local training and spending obligations, and ownership of assets used in petroleum operations.  Angolan law and these agreements also contain important limitations on assignment of interests in such licenses, including in most cases the need to obtain the consent of Angolan authorities.
 
Certain industry specific and general application statutes and regulations govern health, safety and environmental matters under Angolan law.  Prior to commencing petroleum operations in Angola, contractors must, among other things, prepare an environmental impact assessment and establish and implement a health and safety plan.  Such environmental laws govern the disposal of byproducts from petroleum operations and required oil spill preparedness capabilities.  Failure to comply with these laws may result in civil and criminal liability, including, without limitation, fines or penalties.
 
In Angola, petroleum exploration and development activities are governed by the Petroleum Activities Law (the “Angola PAL”). Pursuant to the Angola PAL, all hydrocarbons located underground are property of the State of Angola, and exploitation rights can only be granted by the President of the Republic to Sonangol, as the national concessionaire.  Foreign companies may only engage in petroleum activities in Angola in association with Sonangol through a commercial company or consortium, and generally upon entering a production sharing contract or a risk services agreement.
 
The Angolan PAL and the regulations thereunder extensively regulate the activities of oil and natural gas companies operating in Angola, including financial and insurance requirements, local content and involvement requirements, exploration and development processes, and operational matters.  Local content regulations stipulate which goods or services relating to the oil and natural gas industry must be provided by Angolan companies (being companies which are beneficially owned in their majority by Angolan citizens), whether on a sole basis or in association with foreign contractors, and which goods or services may be provided by foreign companies.  Goods or services which may be provided by foreign companies are generally subject to a local preference rule, whereby Angolan companies are granted preference in tendering for such activities or services, provided that the price difference in such tender does not exceed 10% of the total tendered amount.  The power to make many of the day–to–day decisions concerning petroleum activities, including the granting of certain consents and authorizations, is vested with Sonangol.  New legislation reorganizing the Petroleum Sector currently being proposed could change these powers but, to date, Sonangol’s powers in this respect have not changed.
 
The Foreign Exchange Law for the Petroleum Sector requires, among other things, that all foreign exchange operations be carried out through Angolan banks and that oil and natural gas companies open local bank accounts in foreign currencies in order to pay local taxes, to pay for local petroleum operations related expenses, and to pay for goods and services supplied by both resident and non–resident suppliers and service providers.  As a consequence, foreign currency proceeds obtained by oil and natural gas companies from the sale of their share of production 
 
20


cannot be retained in full outside Angola, as a portion of the proceeds required to settle tax liabilities and pay for local petroleum operations related expenses must be deposited in and paid through Angolan banks.  
 
The Foreign Exchange Law for the Petroleum Sector was further supplemented by the Banco Nacional de Angola’s (the “BNA”) Order 20/2012.  Under this statute, oil and natural gas companies (including operators) are required to make all payments for goods and services related to Angolan operations provided by non–residents out of bank accounts domiciled in Angola.  In addition, the BNA issued Order 7/14 which determines that oil and natural gas companies shall sell the foreign currency required to pay taxes and other tax dues before the State to the BNA.  The operators shall also sell to BNA the foreign currency necessary to pay foreign exchange residents.
 
Executive Decree 333/13 (“ED 333/13”) had required companies that provide taxable services to oil and natural gas companies to assess the applicable consumption tax, and oil and natural gas companies, as beneficiary of those services, must pay the net value of the service to the service provider and remit the consumption tax to the Angolan government.  ED 333/13 was repealed by Presidential Legislative Decree 3–A/14 which provides that there will be no consumption tax applicable to the oil and natural gas companies which are in the exploration and development phases until first oil, subject to certain exceptions.  Subject to the approval of the Ministry of Finance and Sonangol, oil and natural gas companies may also benefit from the consumption tax exemption during the production phase should those companies demonstrate that the consumption tax causes imbalances which render the petroleum projects not economically viable.
 
Executive Decree 224/12 approved the Operational Discharge Management Regulations which applies to all operational discharges generated during petroleum operations, both onshore and offshore.  It sets the zero discharge prohibition establishing that all operational discharges resulting from onshore activities into the ground, inland waters and coastal waters are prohibited, except where duly justified for safety reasons.  Discharges of (i) drill cuttings contaminated with non–water based drilling muds; (ii) non–water based drilling fluids; and (iii) sands produced resulting from operations in the maritime zone are prohibited and must be brought to shore and be treated as hazardous waste.  This statute requires operators such as ourselves to prepare an Operational Discharge Management Plan for all facilities or groups of facilities under its responsibility.  The statute also establishes that the direct discharge of chemical products into the sea and the use of compounds where the content in aromatics is greater than 1% as a base for the manufacture of drilling fluids are prohibited.  In 2014, Executive Decree 97/14 approved a moratorium on the implementation of the above mentioned regulations. 
 
Gabon
 
In 2014, a new Hydrocarbons Law entered into force to regulate oil and natural gas activities in Gabon.  Pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Law, petroleum resources in Gabon are the property of the State of Gabon and petroleum companies undertake operations on behalf of the Government of Gabon. In order to conduct petroleum operations, oil and natural gas companies must enter into a hydrocarbons agreement, typically an exploration and production sharing contract (“EPSC”), with the Minister of Hydrocarbons and the Minister of Economy.  Such agreement is subject to enactment by Presidential Decree, and its provisions must conform to the Hydrocarbons Law, subject to being null and void.
 
All oil and natural gas companies, even those carrying out operations under the previous legal framework, must make payment of two financial contributions set forth in the new Hydrocarbons Law, namely the Investment Diversification Fund (payment of 1% of the Contractor’s turnover during the production phase), and the Hydrocarbons Investment Fund (payment of 2% of the Contractor’s turnover during the production phase), within two years of the entry into force thereof.  Oil and natural gas companies must also, within a maximum of one year from publication of the Hydrocarbons Law, set up and domicile site rehabilitation funds for the Hydrocarbon activities at a Gabonese banking or financial institution.
 
The Hydrocarbons Law provides for a detailed legal framework in terms of organization of the sector, contents and terms and conditions of hydrocarbons agreements, liability, local content, safety and environment, domestic supply requirements, fiscal terms such as production sharing, royalty, bonuses and other charges, corporate income tax, customs, and local training obligations.

The powers to make many of the day to day decisions concerning petroleum activities, including the granting of certain consents and authorizations, remain vested with the Hydrocarbons General Directorate, a government authority. In addition, Gabon’s national oil company currently holds, manages and takes participations in petroleum activities on behalf of the State.  Pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Law, the State may acquire an equity stake of up to 20%, at market value, within any companies applying for or already holding an exclusive production authorization.  The contractor must carry the State in its 20% participating interest in the hydrocarbons agreements during the exploration phase.  The parties are free to agree on a higher stake at market value.  Further, the national oil company may also acquire participating interests of up to 15%, at market value.
 
In addition to general local content regulations which require a 90/10  ratio of Gabon national to foreign expatriate workers involved in petroleum activities, pursuant to the Hydrocarbons Law, subcontracting activities are awarded in priority to Gabonese companies in which more than 80% of the workforce consists of Gabonese nationals.  In this respect, only technically qualified license holders may be hired as subcontractors.
 Assignment of interests is subject to the Ministry of Hydrocarbons’ consent and to the State’s preemption rights.  Foreign companies carrying out production activities under the form of a local branch must incorporate a local company within two years from the incorporation of the local branch.
 
With respect to natural gas, the State shall enjoy exclusive marketing rights for non–associated natural gas while any non–commercial share of associated natural gas remains the property of the State.
 
Hydrocarbons agreements entered into prior to the Hydrocarbons Law’s publication remain in force until their expiration and should continue to be governed by their own provisions. Our understanding is that the Hydrocarbons Law applies to any issues not expressly dealt with in these contracts’ provisions.
 
Our EPSC governing our license to the Diaba block offshore Gabon was entered into before the publication of the Hydrocarbons Law.  The Diaba EPSC contains a stabilization clause, which provides for the stability of the legal, tax, economic and financial conditions in force at the signing of the EPSC.  Pursuant to the Diaba EPSC, these conditions may not be adversely altered during the term of the agreement; however, we can make no assurance that the Hydrocarbons Law will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or assets in Gabon.
