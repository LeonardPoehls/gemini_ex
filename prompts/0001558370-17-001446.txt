 General Development of Business
 Trans World Corporation (hereinafter referred to as “we,” “us,” the “Company,” or “TWC” or terms of similar import) was organized as a Nevada corporation in October 1993 for the acquisition, development and management of gambling establishments, to the extent permitted by applicable local laws, featuring live and mechanized gaming, including video gaming devices such as video poker machines, primarily in Louisiana.
 In 1998, we revised our operating strategy by shifting our focus to the casino market in Europe.  Furthermore, as a means of diversification of our business, we have also expanded our growth strategy to develop and/or acquire small-to-mid-size hotels of 80-250 rooms located in or near key metropolitan and resort areas in Europe, which may also include gambling operations.
 Today, we own and operate three full-service casinos and four hotels, three of which are four-star rated and one is three-star rated, as per the ratings from the German Hotel and Restaurant Association for our German-based hotels and the Czech Association of Hotels and Restaurants for our Czech-based hotel.  Our European operating units are organized under two reportable segments: a casino segment and a hotel segment.   
 Our casinos are all in the Czech Republic (also “CZ” or “Czechia”) and are part of the casino segment, located in Ceska Kubice (“Ceska”), Hate (“Route 59”), and Dolni Dvoriste (“Route 55”). The Czech casinos, which conduct business under our registered brand name, American Chance Casinos (“ACC”), are situated at border locations and draw the majority of their customers from Germany and Austria.
 ACC’s operating strategy centers on differentiating its products and services from its direct competitors.  We operate our establishments with an emphasis on high customer service and attention to details.  We strive to create gambling environments with casual and exciting atmospheres, highlighting entertainment, state-of-the-art equipment, and professionalism.
 Our hotels include the Hotel Savannah and Spa, a 77-room, four-star deluxe hotel, located in Hate, Czechia, and is part of our casino segment as it is physically attached to our Route 59 casino; the Hotel Columbus, a 117-room, four-star property located in Seligenstadt, Germany; the Hotel Freizeit Auefeld, a 93-room four-star hotel located in Hannoversch Münden (“Hann. Münden”), Germany; and the recently acquired Hotel Kranichhöhe, a 107-room three-star hotel located in Much, Germany (see below for more details). All three German hotels comprised our hotel segment.
 Two of our units, the Hotel Savannah and Spa and the Route 59 casino, operate as complementary businesses and are referred to jointly herein as the “Route 59 Complex.”  In addition to the gaming area, guest rooms, and the spa, which is operated by an independent contractor, the Complex features eight banquet halls for meetings and special events as well as two full-service restaurants and two bars.

 On December 21, 2016, TWHG acquired the Lindner Sport & Aktivhotel Kranichhöhe, and subsequently rebranded the hotel as the Hotel Kranichhöhe, a 107-room hotel with extensive meeting space and recreational amenities located in Much, Germany, for a purchase price of €4.9 million, or $5.3 million at the acquisition date.  The assets acquired by TWHG include: the hotel building and its contents; three food and beverage outlets; 18 meeting rooms; a wellness center and spa; a fitness center with an indoor swimming pool; an adjoining tennis complex with two indoor courts and two outdoor courts; and a beach volleyball court.  The new hotel is located approximately two hours driving time from the Company’s Hotel Columbus in Seligenstadt, near Frankfurt, and three hours driving time from its Hotel Freizeit Auefeld in Hann. Münden.  We intend to invest approximately $1.6 million in 2017 to update and partially renovate the hotel, with the objective of upgrading it to a four-star hotel. 
     TWC’s hotel operating strategy centers on offering both business and leisure travelers attractive facilities, professional service, comfortable accommodations, and a wide range of amenities, including food and beverage services, conference, and recreational facilities.   The Company uses multiple channels to actively market its hotels to both business and leisure travelers.  Further, management strives to foster strong relationships with local businesses and communities, which primarily support the hotels’ food and beverage, conference and banquet, and recreation facilities.
 While our principal executive offices are located in New York City, we have no operating presence in the United States.  
 Corporate Information
 Our corporate offices are located at 545 Fifth Avenue, Suite 940, New York, New York 10017, our telephone number is (212) 983-3355, our website is www.transwc.com and the ACC website is www.acc.cz.  Neither website is a part of this Form 10-K. Description of Business
 TWC is engaged in the acquisition, development and management of niche casino operations in Europe, which feature gaming tables and mechanized gaming devices, such as video slot machines, as well as the acquisition, development and management of small-to-mid-size, four-star hotels, which may include casino facilities.  Our expansion into the hotel industry is founded on management’s belief that hotels in the small-to-mid-size class are complementary to our casino brand, that opportunities in one of these two industries often lead to, or are tied to, opportunities in the other industry, and that a more diversified portfolio of assets gives us greater stability and makes TWC more attractive to potential investors.  TWC’s top management executives include individuals with extensive experience in both the casino and hotel industries. Market Overview and Competition
 Historically, casinos in Germany and Austria have been characterized by formal atmospheres and a sense of exclusivity.  While this dynamic has changed across Europe over time, ACC was at the forefront of the movement towards more relaxed casino atmospheres.  This, coupled with our emphasis on integrating live entertainment into the gambling experience and creating strong customer loyalty programs, allowed us to become a preferred alternative for many of our patrons.  Further, we have established ACC as a reputable casino company in Czechia through our more than fifteen years of high service standards, consistent professionalism and strict adherence to all local gaming regulations.
 As of December 31, 2016, five casinos operate in direct competition with our Ceska casino.  Each of our Route 59 and Route 55 casinos currently has two direct competitors.  Some of these competitors are larger and have financial and/or other resources that are greater than ours.
 While we do not consider our gambling business to be seasonal, it is occasionally impacted by extreme weather conditions and major sporting events, such as the FIFA World Cup (“World Cup”) and the UEFA Euro Cup (“Euro Cup,”), which have and can negatively impact attendance at our casinos.  See also Item 1A “Risk Factors — Climate impact.”
 We compete for guests based primarily on brand name recognition and reputation, location, customer satisfaction, quality of service, amenities, quality of the gaming experience, quality of our accommodations,  room rates,

security and the ability to earn and redeem loyalty program points.  We believe that increased gambling in other locations in or near the markets areas in which we operate, and the increase in popularity of internet gambling, could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our casino operations and development plans.  Further, the gaming industry in Eastern Europe faces competition from a variety of sources for discretionary consumer spending, including spectator sports and other entertainment and gaming options. Competitive gambling activities include traditional casinos, video lottery terminals, state-sponsored lotteries and other forms of legalized gaming. We anticipate competition in this area will become more intense as the industry consolidates and new web-based ventures enter the industry.
 With respect to our hotel segment, in Germany, our Hotel Columbus has six hotel competitors in the Seligenstadt area and surrounding region that it serves, four of which are privately-owned and two of which are part of German hotel chains.  Our Hotel Freizeit Auefeld is the largest hotel in Hann. Münden and no hotel chains are represented in that market.  However, Hotel Freizeit Auefeld does compete with eight smaller, privately-owned, hotel competitors in the Hann. Münden area. Our recently acquired Hotel Kranichhöhe has no direct major competitors in the city of Much or in the surrounding areas.
 Owing to our quality product, adherence to high standards of hospitality and customer service, professionalism and strict compliance with all local hotel regulations and governances, we believe that we can compete effectively with these hoteliers.
 Costs and Effects of Environmental Compliance
 We incurred no material costs or effects due to environmental compliance for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.
 Research and Development
 The Company does not engage in research and development other than internal market research for general business development, does not account for research expenditures separately under generally accepted accounting principles, and did not incur any separate research and development expense for 2016 or 2015. Available Information - Internet Access

 Our Facilities

 Ceska — The Ceska casino, which is located approximately one hour’s driving time from Regensburg, Germany, was acquired through a lease in March 1998 in conjunction with the Company’s entry into the casino market in Europe.  On November 23, 2011, TWC purchased the Ceska casino building, associated land and an adjacent outbuilding and related plot from the town of Ceska Kubice, from which TWC had been renting the facilities.  The acquisition allowed us to undertake much needed capital improvements to the building, as competition in the Ceska area has increased dramatically in recent years.  As of February 28, 2017, the two-story Ceska casino offered 14 gaming tables, including seven card tables, six roulette tables, and a 10-position, Slingshot, multi-win roulette table.  The casino also features 110 video slot machines and a dedicated stage area for live performances.  Amenities also include a separate dining facility and five luxurious hotel guest rooms. The address of our Ceska casino is Ceska Kubice 64, Ceska Kubice 345 32, Czech Republic.
 Route 59 — Located approximately one hour’s driving time from Vienna, Austria, and opened in December 1999, Route 59 was constructed by the Company on land that had been acquired by TWC in conjunction with our entry into the European casino market in 1998.  On February 22, 2016, we completed the expansion and reconfiguration of the casino’s existing slot area and introduced 32 additional video slot machines.  As of February 28, 2017, our Route 59 casino operated 25 gaming tables, consisting of 12 card tables, 12 roulette tables, and a 16-position, Slingshot multi-win roulette table, as well as 190 video slot machines.  Route 59 is located at 199 American Way, Hate-Chvalovice, Znojmo 669 02, Czech Republic.
 Route 55 — Located approximately 45 minutes driving time from Linz, Austria, and opened in December 2004, Route 55 was constructed by the Company on a parcel of land that had been purchased by TWC in April 2002.  As of February 28, 2017, the two-story Route 55 offered 21 tables, including 12 card tables, 8 roulette tables, a 16-position, Slingshot multi-win roulette table, as well as 150 video slot machines.  On the mezzanine level, the casino features an Italian restaurant, an open buffet area, and three luxurious hotel guest rooms.  Similar to the five guest rooms at Ceska, these rooms, when not used as free courtesy accommodations for our VIP players and guests, can be rented to other customers.  Route 55 is located at Grenzubergang Wullowitz, Dolni Dvoriste 382 72, Czech Republic.
 Hotel Savannah — As a complement to our Route 59 gaming operations, in January 2009, we built and opened Hotel Savannah, a 77-room, four-star deluxe hotel, attached to Route 59 by the hotel’s restaurant, on land that had been acquired by TWC in conjunction with our entry into the European casino market in 1998.  In conjunction with opening the hotel, we also launched a full-service spa, the Spa at Hotel Savannah, which is attached to the hotel and is sub-contracted to a local operator who pays TWC a percentage of its gross revenues.  The Spa features a large, 22 x 8 meter, indoor pool and Ayurvedic therapy facility.  Hotel Savannah also features eight banquet halls for meetings and events.  The creation of the Route 59 Complex has attracted additional business to the casino, contributing incremental cash, and enhancing the Company’s overall results.

 Hotel Columbus — We acquired the Hotel Columbus, a four-star 117-room hotel, located in Seligenstadt, a town that is approximately 25 minutes equidistant from Frankfurt city center and the Frankfurt International Airport in September 2014.  Hotel Columbus features five meeting rooms; a restaurant and separate breakfast room, each with its own kitchen; two bars; a 37-space parking garage; and 43 surface lot parking places, including a satellite parking area located across the street from the Hotel.  With the coming withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the city of Frankfurt is aggressively soliciting British financial institutions to relocate their European operations in the city.  Hotel Columbus is located at Am Reitpfad 4, 63500 Seligenstadt-Froschhausen, Germany.
 Hotel Freizeit Auefeld — The Hotel Freizeit Auefeld, a 93-room, four-star hotel with extensive meeting space and recreational amenities located in Hann. Münden, Germany was acquired in June 2015.  The hotel features three food and beverage outlets; ten meeting rooms; an adjoining 13,000 square foot event hall; an adjoining tennis complex with four indoor courts; and several additional recreation areas.  An independent townhouse comprised of one four-room and one six-room apartment was also included in the assets associated with the deal.  Hotel Freizeit Auefeld is located at Hallenbadstrasse 33, 34346 Hann. Münden, Germany.
 Hotel Kranichhöhe — The Hotel Kranichhöhe, a 107-room, three-star hotel includes extensive meeting space and recreational amenities located in Much, Germany.  It features three food and beverage outlets; 18 meeting rooms; a wellness center and spa; a fitness center with an indoor swimming pool; an adjoining tennis complex with two indoor courts and two outdoor courts; and a “beach” volleyball court. The Company intends to invest approximately $1.6 million in 2017 to update and partially renovate the hotel, with the objective of upgrading it to a four-star hotel.  Hotel Kranichhöhe is located at Boevingen 129, 53804 Much, Germany.
 Our casinos each offer free parking, restaurant and lounge areas, and multiple bars while our Hotel Columbus and Hotel Freizeit Auefeld each offer free outdoor parking, and our Hotel Kranichhöhe offers outdoor parking at a nominal cost, available garage parking, restaurant and lounge areas, bars, and meeting rooms. Our Hotel Savannah, Hotel Freizeit Auefeld and Hotel Kranichhöhe also offer extensive recreational facilities.  With the exception of the long-term ground lease for the land on which Hotel Freizeit Auefeld stands, we own the land and buildings that comprise our casino and hotel assets.
 Intellectual Property
 In the highly competitive gaming and hospitality industries in which we operate, our trade names and logos are important to the success of our business. All of our casinos operate under the trademarked trade name “American Chance Casinos,” which we believe has become synonymous in our markets with our reputation for excellence in service, casual fun, international presence and state-of-the-art gaming equipment. In addition, the Hotel Savannah’s flowering tree logo has come to represent luxury and convenience for our overnight guests at our Route 59 Complex. The Company also maintains separate websites for our casinos and four hotels that provide users with updated information about news and events, and for the hotels, the ability to make room reservations online. Long Range Objectives
 With the acquisitions of Hotel Columbus, Hotel Freizeit Auefeld and Hotel Kranichhöhe in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, our current operations consist of three casinos and four hotels, with four units located in Czechia and three units located in Germany.  Our recent geographic and industry diversification is consistent with our long-range objective of positioning TWC as an international hotel and casino company.
 TWC, the senior management of which is composed of individuals who have extensive experience in both the hotel and casino industries, continues to explore ways to expand the Company’s operations through the acquisition and/or development of complementary gaming and hotel business units, while continuing to maximize the potential of the Company’s existing operations.  Future additions may include stand-alone operations, or complexes with integrated hotel and casino operations, such as our Route 59 Complex.
 Marketing and Sales
 During the year ended December 31, 2016, we maintained and enhanced our marketing and promotional programs for our casinos, focusing primarily on internal and customer-oriented loyalty reward programs and greater use 

 
  5

 

of social media and digital communication methods.  In 2016, we strove to offer higher-value amenities and more giveaways and also to provide live entertainment, in an ongoing effort to secure and enhance our competitive position in the markets that we serve.  The casinos’ event calendars concentrated on key, player-tested, popular events and holidays, while simultaneously focusing on higher player-incentive games designed to reward existing players with redeemable points via our Player’s Loyalty Program, and thereby promote customer loyalty.  In addition, we continued to be a benefactor in a number of community and social programs during the year as a way to further promote our image and make a positive contribution to the communities in which we operate.  We also continued our popular, cultural-themed and holiday-related parties, which feature live entertainment, raffles and complimentary grand buffets.  Further, we aggressively targeted key cities in our media campaigns, most notably Vienna, Linz and Regensburg and the areas surrounding these cities for our casinos and Hotel Savannah.  With respect to our three German hotels, we focused our sales efforts on targeting corporate business and other market segments from the surrounding areas and neighboring countries, and worked to cultivate existing and new local and regional business relationships.
 Regulations and Licensing
 We are subject to numerous foreign international, national and local government laws and regulations, including those relating to the operation of a casino business, the operation of our hotel business, the preparation and sale of food and beverages, building and zoning requirements, data privacy and general business license and permit requirements, in the various jurisdictions in which we own and operate our properties.  Our ability to acquire and/or develop new casino and/or hotel properties and to remodel, refurbish or add to existing properties is also dependent on obtaining permits from local authorities.  We are also subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, working conditions, hiring and firing, non-discrimination for disabilities and other individual characteristics, work permits and benefit offerings.  Compliance with these various laws and regulations can affect the revenues and profits of the properties we own and could adversely affect our operations.  We believe that our businesses are conducted in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.
 On June 7, 2016, the President of Czechia signed the 2017 Gambling Act (186/2016 Coll.) (the “Gambling Act”) and the 2017 Gambling Tax Act (187/2016 Coll.) (the “2017 Gambling Tax Act”) (collectively referred to as the “Gambling Acts”).  The Gambling Acts became law on June 15, 2016, when they were published in the official Collection of Laws, maintained by the Czech Ministry of the Interior.  The 2017 Gambling Tax Act became effective on January 1, 2017, and raised the gaming tax rate on technical game (i.e. slot machine or electromechanical roulette or dice) revenues to a “minimum tax,” and raises the tax rate from 28% to 35%, and eliminates the per diem fixed fee of 
 Kč 80 (approximately $3.12) on each slot machine.  
     The 2017 Gambling Act introduces many new changes, requirements and conditions, that take effect at various times, some taking effect on the date of enactment, some on January 1, 2017 and certain provisions taking effect upon the renewal of the casino operator’s gambling licenses.  Although TWC’s 10-year gambling license expires in September 2018, and its slot operating one-year license expires at the end of 2017, the Company has begun to take steps to conform to these requirements for when it applies for its slot and other technical game license renewals, which is due to expire at the end of 2017.  The Company is also awaiting the Ministry of Finance of the Czech Republic’s (the “MOF”) final interpretation of these new measures, some of which were clarified in August 2016 and others are awaiting further clarifications from the MOF.  The notable changes and requirements are as follow:
    
· | Upon the effective date of the Gambling Act, any gambling operator may apply for a gambling license if it meets all of the following conditions, having: (i) an office in Czechia, in another European Union Member state or in a state that is a party to the Agreement on the European Economic Area; (ii) an organizational chart that sets clear and comprehensive definitions of jurisdictions and decision-making powers; (iii) an established board of directors or similar control body; (iv) equity of at least of €2,000,000 ($2.1 million); (v) a transparent and unobjectionable origin of its financial resources; and (vi) transparent ownership structure. During the licensing process, confirmation of corporate ownership of the Czech entity and required documents (e.g. criminal and tax records, etc.) from all members of the board of directors and representatives from all levels of the company structure must be furnished to the MOF. TWC is currently preparing a list of the required documentation to submit for its slot and technical game license renewal at the end of 2017.

· | A basic, general gambling license from the MOF will be issued for a maximum of six (6) years and a gambling
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

license for each location at which live game and technical game operations will be conducted (will be issued from local municipality councils) for a maximum of three (3) years. (Previously, the MOF general gambling licenses for live games had been issued for ten (10) years and for one (1) year for technical games). Licenses can be issued and/or renewed if the Company meets the following pre-existing conditions: (i) maintains a clean criminal record and all necessary certifications; (ii) pays its taxes on time; (iii) stays in good standing; and, (iv) confirms its ability to comply with all technical and supervisory standards required by the new law. As of December 31, 2016 and the date hereof, TWC was and is in compliance with these conditions. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Individual municipalities and their local councils will be entitled to issue decrees to prohibit or restrict gambling operations, to set permissible hours of gambling operations and designate locations of operations within their respective jurisdictions. Previously, municipalities, by decree, have been allowed to ban gambling operations or set the locations of gambling operations within their respective jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2016 and the date hereof, TWC was and is in good standing with all of the municipalities in which it operates. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operations will not be permitted in certain premises such as schools, children’s leisure facilities, health and social care facilities, churches or religious societies. As of December 31, 2016 and the date hereof, TWC’s existing casinos were and are in compliance with this requirement. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operators will be required to follow certain self-restricting measures put in place by individual players. For instance, an operator must create an individual account for each player, which the player can use to manage his/her gaming expenditures and frequency of play, including a maximum number of casino visits per month. These accounts must also allow players to set individual limits on gambling activities, including setting maximum bets per day or per calendar month or a maximum amount of net loss per day or per calendar month. Each customer’s identity must be checked against the MOF’s central database of individuals excluded from the participation of gambling (i.e. black-listed). For expats, the individual account would be valid for only 90 days, following which a reapplication would be required to setup the account. Some of these provisions will not become effective until one year after the MOF has set up their central database, but the self-restriction provisions will become effective immediately after new licenses are obtained. In order to meet these self-restricting measures, the Company will implement a new casino management system, that is currently being evaluated and tested by local management and will be implemented prior to September 2017. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operators will also be required to bar from entry individuals flagged by the MOF and registered in its central database as black-listed or noted as being “destitute” and on public assistance, bankrupt, are subject to an order banning them from gambling under Czech criminal law or are a compulsive gambler. No one under age 18 will be allowed on the casino floor. As of December 31, 2016 and the date hereof, TWC was and is in compliance with this requirement. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operators will not be able to provide for free, or at a reduced price, any benefits to a player, including food, beverages, tobacco products or “stimulating substances.” TWC anticipates that it will be in compliance with this requirement when its slot and technical license renewal application is being reviewed during autumn 2017. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Gambling operators will be required to post a sign on each technical game warning that gambling is “harmful,” advising of the amount of the player’s net losses and how long the player has been playing, with a requirement that there be a 15 minute break every 2 hours of play. TWC anticipates that it will be in compliance with this requirement when its slot and technical license renewal application is being reviewed during autumn 2017. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | All customer transactions, such as exchanging money for gambling chips, must be logged and such records be kept for 10 years, up from five years under the previous law. TWC will extend its record archiving to 10 years to comply with this requirement. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The required retention period of all required real time color audio/visual surveillance recordings will increase from three months to 24 months. The Company is currently evaluating new surveillance systems that will meet this requirement. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Maximum bets for technical games will be increased to Kč 1,000 (about $41) from the current amount of
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Kč 675 (about $28) and maximum win (or jackpot) per slot machine will be decreased to Kč 500,000 (approximately $20,500) from the current amount of Kč 675,000 (approximately $27,700).  Slot and electromechanical machine vendors/suppliers will be required to incorporate these limit changes to all slots and technical games that they sell/service to the casinos.  Further, a new anti-money laundering regulation imposes a maximum daily transaction of €10,000 (or $10,500) on purchases and/or cash transactions.  Any slot jackpot payouts exceeding this limit on any given day, can only be paid either directly to the player’s bank account or 

 
  7

 

in two per diem payments where the player can pick up the remainder amount on the following day.  TWC anticipates that it will be in compliance with this requirement when its slot and technical license renewal application is being reviewed in autumn 2017.

· | Casinos must have a minimum of three live games tables and 30 technical games available during operating hours. For each live game table, a casino may operate an additional 10 slot or technical game machines. If a casino has more than 10 live game tables, there is no limit on number of slot or technical game machines permitted. All of TWC’s existing casinos each have more than 10 live game tables in operation, thereby are already in compliance with this requirement. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | A gaming bond equal to Kč 10 million (approximately $410,000) will be required to be paid by a casino operator to the MOF for each of its casino units. For operators owning multiple casinos, a minimum bond of Kč 20 million (approximately $820,000) is required, up to a maximum of Kč 50 million ($2.0 million) for any licensee, regardless of the number of casinos owned and operated beyond five casino units. Previously, only one gaming bond of Kč 22 million ($900,000) was required, which is used for the existing licenses. When TWC renews its gaming license, it will have to provide a new gaming bond of Kč 30 million ($1.2 million), to meet the new bond requirements for its three casinos, resulting in a net increase of Kč 8 million (approximately $330,000) from its existing bond. However, a casino operator cannot access the funds underlying the old bond until the expiration of one year after the termination of the old bond. Therefore, the casino operator must initially pledge additional funds to secure the new bond requirement, which for TWC, will amount to Kč 30 million ($1.2 million). TWC will make the additional bond payment upon its license renewal application. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Any marketing advertisements, beginning January 1, 2017, must have a written warning label in the Czech language about the damage gambling can do to participants and that participants must be older than 18 years of age.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Failure to comply with the new Gambling Act could result in a misdemeanor punishable by fines up to
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Kč 1,000,000 (approximately $41,000) or an administrative offense punishable by an injunction against the violative practice, fines up to Kč 50,000,000 ($2.0 million) and/or asset forfeiture to, or confiscation by, the government. 
     We have been, and are currently, in compliance with all such conditions that are currently in effect. See also “Taxation,” below.
     There can be no assurance that such licenses, approvals or findings of suitability will be obtained or will not be revoked, suspended or conditioned, or that we will be able to obtain the necessary approvals for our future activities.
 Iran Sanctions Disclosure
 Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act, if during 2016, TWC or any of its affiliates have engaged in certain transactions with Iran or with persons or entities designated under certain executive orders, we would be required to disclose information regarding such transactions in our Annual Report as required under Section 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, or ITRA.  Certain of the Iran sanctions were lifted on January 16, 2016.  During 2016, the Company did not engage in any of the law’s enumerated transactions with Iran or with persons or entities related to Iran.   Taxation

 As noted above, we are subject to legislative changes that, at times, result in material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.  
 On June 7, 2016, the President of Czechia signed the Gambling Acts.  The 2017 Gambling Tax Act became effective on January 1, 2017.  The new law raised the gaming tax rate on technical game (i.e. slot machine or electromechanical roulette or dice) revenues to the greater of a “minimum tax,” or 35%, and eliminated the per diem fixed fee of Kč 80 (approximately $3.12) on each slot machine.

 This new “minimum tax” on technical games is equal to the product of: (x) the sum of all gambling positions of individual approved terminal devices (such as slot machines, electromechanical roulette and dice machines) permitted for the location of the gambling premises, times (y) Kč 9,200 (approximately $359).  Therefore, if the aggregate tax amount collected from the 35% gaming tax on technical game revenues is lower than the computed “minimum tax,” then the casino operator must pay the “minimum tax” and not the aggregate tax amount collected from the 35% gaming tax.  Otherwise, if the aggregate tax amount collected from the 35% gaming tax on technical game revenues is greater than the computed “minimum tax,” then the casino operator need only pay the aggregate tax amount collected from the 35% gaming tax and not the “minimum tax.”  The gaming tax rate on live game (i.e. cards, roulette or dice) revenues remains unchanged at 23%.  Further, the 2017 Gambling Tax Act modified the tax revenue allocation between the federal government and local municipalities.  A summary table of the 2017 Gambling Tax Act is shown below: 

 | 2017 Gambling Tax Act 
(in actual amounts) | (Effective from January 1, 2017) 
Live Games | 23% gaming tax from revenue earned from live games (70% of tax allocated to the federal government; 30% of tax allocated to the local municipality). 
Slot and other technical games | The greater of either: (a) the aggregate amount collected from 35% gaming tax from revenue earned from slot and other technical games (35% of tax allocated to the federal government; 65% of tax allocated to the local municipality), or (b) a "minimum tax," calculated as the product of the sum of all gambling positions of individual approved terminal devices referred to in the permit for the location of the gambling premises times Kč 9,200 (approximately $359).
Net Income | No change from the 19% corporate income tax noted below. 

      The Company currently estimates that if the 2017 Gambling Tax Act were in effect for the full year ended December 31, 2016, it would have resulted in an annual reduction of approximately $1.3 million to the Company’s consolidated earnings before income taxes, assuming all other factors remained constant.  The total impact of the 2017 Gambling Act cannot be quantified or estimated pending the interpretation and enforcement of these measures by the MOF and their eventual implementation into the Company’s gambling operations.  See also, Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors — Potential changes in legislation and regulation of our operations.”
     On December 15, 2015, the President of Czechia signed an amendment to the Gaming Law that increased gaming tax rates payable by all gaming operators, including TWC, effective January 1, 2016 (the “2016 Gaming Tax Amendment”).  (See TWC’s Form 8-K, dated December 21, 2015).  As a result of this amendment, gaming taxes on live game revenues increased from 20% to 23% and gaming taxes on slot revenues increased from 20% to 28%.  In addition, the amendment increased the fee per slot machine per day to CZK 80 (approximately $3.12) from CZK 55 (approximately $2.25). The amendment became law on December 28, 2015, when it was published as Act No. 380/2015 Coll. in the official Collection of Laws, maintained by the Czech Ministry of the Interior.

      In December 2011, the Czech parliament passed sweeping gaming tax legislation (“2012 Gaming Tax Law”), which took effect on January 1, 2012.  Our Czech gaming operations were subject to the 2012 Gaming Tax Law through the year ended December 31, 2015.  Thereafter, those operations will be subject to the 2016 Gaming Tax Amendment (see below) and thereafter until the law is further revised.  The changes in the gaming tax law are summarized below:

 | 2012 Gaming Tax Law 
(in actual amounts) | (Effective from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2015) 
Live Games | 20% gaming tax from revenue earned from live games (70% of tax allocated to the federal government; 30% of tax allocated to the local municipality). 
Slots | 20% gaming tax from revenue earned from slot games (20% of tax allocated to the federal government; 80% of tax allocated to the local municipality); and a per diem fixed fee of Kč 55 (approximately $2.15) per slot machine (allocated to the federal government).
Net Income | 19% corporate income tax on adjusted net income earned in Czechia, net of exemptions (allocated to the federal government). 

  TWC’s gaming-related taxes and fees for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are summarized in the following table:

 | For the Year Ended | 
(amounts in thousands) | 2016 | | 2015 | 
Gaming revenues (excl. ancillary revenues) | $ | 44,967 | | $ | 35,682 | 
Gaming taxes | $ | 12,398 | | $ | 7,441 | 
Gaming taxes as % of gaming revenues (above) | | 27.6 | % | | 20.9 | %

  Gaming taxes are payable by the 25th day following the end of each calendar quarter, while corporate income tax is paid by June 30th of the subsequent year.  Estimated quarterly income tax payments are also required since the third quarter of 2013.  TWC was current on all of its Czech tax payments at December 31, 2016 and through the date of this report.

 Corporate Income Taxes
 Effective January 1, 2012, in conjunction with other changes to gaming tax rates, the Czech government instituted an effective corporate income tax, currently 19.0%, on all income, including gaming income. Prior to the law change, our Czech casino operations were subject only to gaming taxes.  The income tax rate in Germany is approximately 30.0%.  We have no gambling operations in Germany as of the date of the Annual Report.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred an net income tax expense of approximately $2.7 million, inclusive of a deferred income tax benefit of $130,000.  The prior year income tax expense of approximately $1.4 million included a deferred income tax benefit of $266,000.   We did not incur any corporate income taxes in Germany from our hotel operations for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015, due to the consolidated losses associated with acquisition-related closing costs incurred in these two years. Value Added Taxes
 In conformity with the European Union (“EU”) taxation legislation, Czechia’s value added tax (“VAT”) has gradually increased from 5%, when that country joined the EU in 2004, to 21%, the effective rate since 2013.  Unlike in other industries, VATs are not recoverable for gaming operations.  The recoverable VAT under the Hotel Savannah, Hotel Columbus and Hotel Freizeit Auefeld operations was not material for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Employees
 As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 605 employees, of which 90 work in Ceska; 174 in Route 59; 144 in Route 55; 44 in Hotel Savannah; 33 in Hotel Columbus; 44 in Hotel Freizeit Auefeld; 51 in Hotel Kranichhöhe; 20 in our shared services offices, located at our Ceska Casino; and five in the Company’s headquarters in New York.  None of our employees are represented by a union nor are we a party to any labor contract.
