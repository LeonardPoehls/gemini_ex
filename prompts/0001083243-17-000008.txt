Item 1. Business
General
The Company was incorporated in Nevada in 1999 for the purpose of creating and operating a global network of independently owned websites. During Fiscal 2016, the Company sold its domain names, including the zap.com domain name.
HRG, our Principal Stockholder, owns approximately 99.5% of our outstanding common stock. Currently, we have no business operations, other than complying with our reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). While its possible that we may search for assets or businesses to acquire so that we may in the future become an operating company, we expect, although there can be no assurance, that we will wind down our business, liquidate our operations and/or dissolve the Company.
We have broad discretion in selecting a business strategy for the Company and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing such a strategy. If we elect to pursue a business combination, we have broad discretion in identifying and selecting both the industries and the possible acquisition or business combination opportunities. We have not identified a specific industry to focus on and have no present plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with respect to a business combination or acquisition. See “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this report for further discussion.
Available Information
We file annual, quarterly and current reports and other information with the SEC. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports filed under the Exchange Act, as well as Section 16 filings by our officers and directors, are available free of charge at www.sec.gov. We will provide a copy of these documents to stockholders upon request. We do not maintain a website.
In addition, the public may read and copy any materials filed by the Company with the SEC at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
We have adopted a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct that applies to all of our directors and key employees, including our principal executive officer, principal financial officer, principal accounting officer and persons performing similar functions. We will provide without charge, upon request, a copy of the Code of Ethics and Business Conduct. Anyone wishing to obtain a copy should write to NZCH Corporation, Investor Relations, 450 Park Avenue, 29th Floor, New York, New York 10022.
Financial Information about Industry Segments
We follow the accounting guidance which establishes standards for the way companies report information about operating segments in annual financial statements and for related disclosures about products and services, geographic areas and major customers. We have determined that we do not have any separately reportable operating segments.
Employees
At December 31, 2016, we employed three executive personnel. These employees are also employees of our Principal Stockholder and do not receive a salary or bonus from the Company. In the normal course of business, we may, from time to time, contract personnel to supplement our employee base to meet our business needs. We believe that our employee relations are generally satisfactory.
