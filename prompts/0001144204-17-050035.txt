EnSync Energy develops and commercializes product and service solutions for the distributed energy generation market, including energy management systems, energy storage systems, applications and internet of energy platforms that link distributed energy resources with the grid network. These solutions are critical to the transition from a “coal-centric economy” to one reliant on renewable energy sources. EnSync Energy synchronizes conventional utility, distributed generation and storage assets to seamlessly ensure the least expensive and most reliable electricity available, thus enabling the future of energy networks.
 
EnSync Energy delivers fully integrated systems utilizing proprietary direct current power control hardware, energy management software and extensive experience with energy storage technologies. Our internet of energy control platform adapts to ever-changing generation and load variables, as well as changes in utility prices and programs, aiming to ensure the means to make and/or save money behind-the-meter while concurrently providing utilities the opportunity to use distributed energy resource systems for various grid enhancing services.
 
EnSync Energy’s systems can easily integrate distributed energy resources with the grid, island from the grid and serve as a microgrid, and be deployed as self-contained microgrids, delivering electricity to sites for which no grid exists. EnSync Energy brings vital power control and energy storage solutions to problems caused by the incorporation of increasingly pervasive renewable energy generating assets that are part of the grid power transmission and distribution network used in commercial, industrial and multi-tenant buildings. In addition to ensuring resilient and high-value electricity to off-takers, utilities can benefit from EnSync Energy’s systems by relying on such assets for visibility, aggregation and control as they begin to use distributed energy resources to ensure a more fortified grid via grid services. The Company also develops and commercializes energy management systems for off-grid applications such as island or remote power.
 
Today there are generally three sources of electricity, particularly for behind-the-meter applications: conventional generation, generation from renewables and energy storage, the latter two of which are often referred to as distributed energy resources (“DERs”).
 
On their own, each of these sources has limitations due to various factors such as cost, availability, resiliency and environmental impact. In a model environment, these disparate sources work in a synchronized manner, all three continually prioritized and optimized to always deliver the least expensive and most reliable electricity.
 
However, the conventional approach of power electronics provides limited capability in terms of optimization, efficiency, scalability and the ability to accommodate ever-changing and evolving applications and policies. Further complicating the realization of the model environment is that a “one size fits all” approach to energy storage has been the norm, relying on single-storage technology for disparate applications, some of which need high power and some of which need high energy. The perfect battery to perform the approximately 15 different applications does not exist, and forcing one type of storage technology to attempt a variety of both power and energy applications is limiting, unreliable and costly.
 
EnSync Energy’s energy management systems enable comprehensive functionality and provide for numerous applications that do away with limitations of conventional power electronics. EnSync Energy’s energy management systems are being developed to provide:
 

· | active energy synchronization for any or all direct current (“DC”) and alternating current (“AC”) inputs and outputs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | prioritization and optimization of all generating assets without system controllers and complex algorithms;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | management of every power and energy storage application and asset in simultaneous operation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | modular, scalable, efficient and “future proof” energy management as a 20-year asset; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | aggregation and monetization of distributed energy resource assets to provide grid services.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our energy storage system expertise enables us to design and deploy customized systems using whatever storage technology is most effective and economical for the specific needs of the customer and application, including applications where the optimum solution utilizes multiple storage technologies in a hybrid configuration. EnSync Energy has commercialized the Matrix™ Energy Management System, a system that makes it very easy to create hybrid energy storage systems by effectively “auto-segregating” power and energy applications, and pulling from the optimal battery technology to do the job. By utilizing the proprietary EnSync Energy “Auto-Sync” DC-Bus architecture, the Matrix™ accomplishes this without the complexity of a central control system; a highly complicated task accomplished simply and cost-effectively.
 
EnSync Energy’s portfolio of energy storage products includes a variety of technologies, including ZnBr flow batteries, numerous lithium ion chemistries, lead acid and aqueous batteries. EnSync Energy continually evaluates storage technologies for safety, operational and price performance, as our expertise in designing systems comprised of the optimal storage technologies with application specific objectives differentiates us in the marketplace.
 
Hybrid power and energy storage is the best way to optimize both power and energy applications, and an enabling energy management system distills all of the complexity to a simple means of generating or saving money behind the meter through a variant of applications, including supply response, time-of-use, frequency regulation and back-up power.

We believe our energy management solutions are a significant improvement over conventional, stick-built assets that cannot accommodate the dynamic evolution of rate structures, programs and capabilities. We believe our solution will allow our customers to future-proof a building with an energy management system that is flexible and scalable by simply adding drawers to a cabinet, with each drawer designated as photovoltaics (“PV”), DC lighting, a diesel generator or storage, to list a few options. “Hot swappable,” drawer-based architecture similar to that of a rack mount server, should allow optimal uptime and reliability.
 
In some environments, such as remote micro grids, diesel generators could play the role of conventional generation. All of the aforementioned synchronization capabilities apply in such a scenario as well, and allow the diesel generators to operate at their optimal efficiency by eliminating inefficient load following. The system will operate the generators at optimal efficiency to charge the batteries, and then shut down the generators until possibly required again at some future point by simply running the generators only at optimal efficiency to charge the batteries.
 
EnSync Energy is excited about the industry shift to comprehensive energy management for behind-the-meter applications. We believe firmly that synchronization of disparate generating assets for the purpose of power and energy through state-of-the-art energy management systems is opening up numerous possibilities, as well as markets, for owners and operators of buildings, utilities and micro grids.
 
Our goal at EnSync Energy is to deliver the ability to lower the cost of electricity, create a more resilient grid infrastructure, prompt economic markets to leverage distributed assets and bring power to remote locales not served by traditional grid power.
 
Power Purchase Agreements
 
In addition to customer-direct systems sales, we recently began addressing our target markets as a developer and a financial packager through the use of power purchase agreements (“PPAs”). Navigant Research forecasts the annual market for solar plus energy storage distributed energy systems to grow to nearly $50 billion by 2026, with a 2017 to 2026 compound annual growth rate of more than 40 percent. Under this PPA structure, we agree to develop and supply a system that uses our and other companies’ products and the offtaker agrees to purchase electricity from the completed system at a fixed rate for typically a 20-year period. Through these arrangements, the offtaker receives the benefit of a low and fixed price for electricity without incurring the capital expenditures required to develop and build the system.
 
Because building these PPA projects requires significant long-term capital outlays, we do not intend to own the PPA systems and seek to sell them to third parties once we have completed the site development process. Site development activities include: (i) finalizing the engineering design of the system, (ii) applying for and receiving the necessary permits for construction of the system and (iii) negotiation of an interconnection agreement with the local utility. This site development process typically takes three to four months.
 
We typically do not begin construction of a specific project until it has been sold to a third party. Accordingly, during the site development process, we engage in a sale process and provide interested purchasers with information related to the system. The purchase price for a particular system is determined through a formula that we believe is customary in the solar industry that takes into account the revenue stream to be received from the offtaker discounted to present value based on customary internal rates of return for similar projects, the costs of completing, maintaining and administering the system and certain other factors.
 
Once the system has been sold, we begin construction which includes procurement of the necessary equipment, physical construction and commissioning of the system. The construction period varies based on many internal and external factors, but is typically completed within six to nine months.
 
Our sales agreement with the buyer of the system typically provides for us to receive an upfront payment and additional progress payments to be made based upon achievement of certain key construction and commissioning milestones.
 
We recognize revenue from these PPA arrangements on a percentage of completion basis as we build out and commission the system. Any excess cash received from the system purchaser in excess of recognized revenue is recorded as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings and carried as a liability on our consolidated financial statements. Based on our experience to date, we expect to recognize all revenue from a particular PPA system typically within 12 months of the signing of the related PPA agreement.
 
We may also enter into a service agreement with the owner of a PPA system pursuant to which we provide ongoing administrative, operating and maintenance services. These agreements usually have a term which matches the PPA term. We recognize revenue from a service agreement ratably over the life of the related agreement.

Target Markets
 
EnSync Energy’s energy management systems, storage technologies and “internet of energy” products target a variety of applications in three primary markets: (1) C&I Buildings, Multi-tenant Structures and Communities; (2) Utility Grid Power Distribution; and (3) Microgrids. We believe our solutions will enable utilities to reduce construction of under-utilized “peak” power generating plants and incorporate more renewable energy generating assets into the grid. EnSync Energy’s ability to provide modular and configurable power control and storage solutions can be tailored to meet a variety of needs, whether it be shifting energy from low rate to high rate periods, or enabling complete grid independence.
Commercial & Industrial Buildings, Multi-Tenant Structures and Communities
 
EnSync Energy offers a revolutionary energy synchronization system that we believe enables a dramatic reduction in the cost of electricity and increases the financial returns of distributed generation systems in the C&I and multi-tenant structures and communities markets. Commercial and industrial buildings as well as multi-tenant structures have become a major opportunity for distributed generation assets to create "net zero" buildings, and provide utilities with sources of energy in critical peak or critical load situations. We believe we are the only company today that can provide complete C&I and multi-tenant building energy storage and energy management systems that unlock opportunities to generate income today, as well as "future proof" the building for any additional applications and requirements that are realized throughout the life of the asset. This includes energy management and hybrid energy storage systems.
 
For the C&I market, EnSync Energy has introduced Matrix™ and Agile Hybrid systems engineered to:
 

· | enable distributed intelligence and active control of inputs and outputs inside buildings;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | allow a building to be connected to others in a micro grid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


· | provide seamless connectivity to the utility for smart export on demand and “internet of energy” capability; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | create a net-zero building and deliver cash generation opportunities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

Utility Grid Power Distribution
 
Utilities are faced with providing cheaper, cleaner and more reliable power as consumers transition away from a coal-centric economy which requires increased use of renewables. EnSync Energy utility-scale energy storage systems are designed to improve power quality, smooth output from intermittent generating assets, help reduce emissions, defer transmission, distribution and substation upgrades, and reduce costs associated with traditional generating plants.
 
An integrated system that features zinc bromide flow battery technology can be partnered with Matrix™ power controls to provide for longer energy discharge applications prevalent in utility scale applications. EnSync Energy’s lithium ion battery systems can be deployed in utility applications requiring very high power for shorter discharge durations.
 
EnSync Energy’s utility-scale flow batteries offer high energy density, are environmentally friendly, and are manufactured as 20-year assets.  Multiple container units can be modularly interconnected and configured with EnSync Energy’s inverter technology to deliver an end-to-end system for quick and simple installation. EnSync Energy’s designs are easily transferable and portable with simple site permitting in places that can be constructed not always accessible by traditional generating sources.
 
Microgrids
 
Microgrids are localized grids that can disconnect from the traditional grid to operate autonomously and help mitigate grid disturbances to strengthen grid resilience, and can play an important role in transforming the nation’s electric grid.
 
Remote microgrids, in locations where utility power is not available, often use a combination of renewables, diesel generators and storage for their electricity requirements.
 
Resiliency, independence, environmentally friendly and cost-effective operation are key requirements for today’s microgrid environments, and we believe that EnSync Energy is well-positioned to become the “go-to” microgrid enabling technology to deliver on these objectives. 
 
Our Products
 
These are disruptive times for the power industry, and the industry must adapt to meet the challenges of a grid built on old technology and inefficient transmission and distribution. With an abundance of renewable energy generation being realized in various domestic and international locations, problems utilizing power from renewables persist because the grid network cannot effectively utilize the additional and inherently variable generation propensity of renewables. The grid today simply is not designed to accommodate such influxes and its intrinsic variability. Additionally, peak demand is often not realized during periods of maximum wind or sun, leading to a condition where overbuilding of heavily under-utilized generation capacity is required to meet the load during the highest usage periods of the day. Energy storage systems that are capable of long discharge can shift significant amounts of energy from relatively lower demand to higher demand periods, reducing the need for build-out of low utilization “peak power” generation.

Strategic partners offer numerous benefits, such as market entry and penetration, low-cost manufacturing, financial consideration, technical complement, government relationships and integration as well as support services.
Competition
 
As discussed elsewhere in this Business section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe our technologies and products provide us with certain competitive advantages in the markets we serve. However, even with these advantages, the market for renewable energy products and services is intensely competitive and continually impacted by evolving industry standards, rapid price changes and product obsolescence. Our competitors include many domestic and foreign companies, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. Although we believe that the advantages described above and elsewhere in this Business section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K position us well to be competitive in our industry, as a small company, we are and will continue to be at a competitive disadvantage to most of our competitors, particularly for large utility contracts.
Intellectual Property
 
Our market position, in part, depends on our intellectual property (“IP”) portfolio and our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our products, processes, technology and know-how. We seek to protect our IP by, among other methods, filing United States and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and conduct of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to evolve and secure our proprietary position. When it is determined that a trade secret is the most prudent approach to IP protection, we employ confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, prospective customers, consultants, advisors, contractors or any other person or entity requiring knowledge of our IP for technology development or business development reasons.
 
We continue to have domestic and international patents issued on our power and energy control architecture known as the “Auto-Sync” modular DC-Bus, which is utilized in our Matrix™ Energy Management System and our new high power version of Matrix™ Energy Management System. As an extension of the auto-sync DC-Bus IP, we have further developed and filed IP for hybridization of multiple types of energy storage in a single system. Other system level IP has been developed and patents filed utilizing these concepts to retrofit existing PV systems with energy storage without impacting the existing equipment and/or operation, allowing a conversion from an uncontrollable to controllable PV power generation system. Additionally, we continue to have multiple patents allowed and pending on power conversion control concepts domestically and internationally related to renewable energy optimization.
 
EnSync Energy continues to view the “internet of energy” as a key developing market. We have completed the design and development of the critical building blocks that can enable efficient and economic deployment and control of distributed generation and storage assets throughout the grid network, delivering high value to both utility as well as distributed generation asset owners. EnSync Energy’s control expertise and ability to leverage third-party data will be an enabling capability for a future where spot market buying and selling of electricity between asset owners and the utility is realized by an individual site or an aggregation of multiple sites. IP for this unique approach has been developed and patents have been filed. This advancement now allows EnSync Energy to be the “hub” through which electricity and communication between the generating assets and the utility passes.
 
Our battery technology team has made significant progress and continues to advance our research and development of flow battery technology in the area of cell design, advanced cell materials and advanced electrolyte chemistries. This research has generated new IP resulting in several patent filings. This is an area where know-how, in addition to IP, is critical.

EnSync Energy’s advanced modeling factors load profiles and operating requirements, as well as all sources of electricity, including DERs such as solar, batteries (single technology and power + energy hybrid) and diesel generators, in conjunction with available utility resources.
 
We have filed for multiple patents in areas of energy storage technology and applications and control technologies, both domestically and internationally. Our filings are intended to further our differentiation, as our ability to control complex functions in simple and economical ways is unique. Through the advanced development of our IP, our product and system solutions portfolio continues to expand. Areas such as hybridization of multiple storage technologies, concurrent control of multiple applications without the requirement for complicated control schemes, communications and control with utility power and energy management by site and by aggregation of sites and modular energy storage upgrades “seamlessly” into existing PV systems are all breakthroughs for the commercial and industrial building market. Additionally, our ongoing research in flow battery technology provides the foundation for the next generation of our flow battery products.
 
To date EnSync Energy has more than 120 active patents allowed or pending domestically and internationally with more than 50 patent filings anticipated over the next year.

Public Policy and Regulation
 
Federal, state and local governmental authorities have provided economic incentives, such as system performance payments, renewable energy tax credits and feed-in tariffs, to support and accelerate the adoption of solar power solutions. In addition, many states have adopted renewable energy mandates, such as renewable portfolio standards which mandate that certain amounts of electricity delivered to customers must come from eligible renewable energy resources. Some states such as Hawaii and California, where we have focused business development efforts, have significantly expanded their renewable portfolio standards in recent years. Governmental support for the development and use of renewable energy resources, in particular solar power products and solutions, is critical to the success of our strategic initiatives, and the economic viability of solar power products and solutions as an alternative to traditional energy resources. However, some of these economic incentives and government mandates are scheduled to be reduced or to expire, and some could be eliminated altogether.
 
Alternatively, governmental bodies may also impose tariffs on imported solar equipment, which may increase our supply costs. In August 2017, the International Trade Commission (“ITC”) heard a petition from two financially distressed solar manufacturers, Suniva and SolarWorld, requesting the imposition of duties and floor prices on certain imported solar equipment. The imposition of these and other similar measures, particularly on supplies we import from China, would significantly increase our cost of sales and potentially cause substantial disruption to the economic model of the solar power industry as a whole.
 
We are closely monitoring developments in this matter and in public policy and regulatory matters as a whole and adjusting our business model, strategy and execution as appropriate to adapt to any such changes. However, these and other developments may adversely impact our corporate strategy, financial condition, results of operations and future prospects. For more information about the risks related to renewable energy and solar power public policies, see “Item 1A – Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Employees
 
As of September 12, 2017, EnSync Energy and its subsidiaries had a total of 66 full-time employees in the United States and China. We expect staffing numbers to increase on an as-needed basis as our business grows in accordance with our business expansion plans. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or are subject to collective-bargaining agreements. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good.
