Item 1. | Business

WPX ENERGY, INC.
Incorporated in 2011, we are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company engaged in the exploitation and development of long-life unconventional properties. We are focused on profitably exploiting, developing and growing our oil positions in the Delaware (a subset of the Permian Basin) and San Juan Basins in the southwestern United States and the Williston Basin in North Dakota.
We have built a geographically diverse portfolio of oil and natural gas reserves through organic development and strategic acquisitions. Our proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 346 MMboe. Our reserves reflect a mix of 51 percent crude oil, 35 percent natural gas and 14 percent NGLs. During 2016, we replaced our production for all commodities at a rate of 317 percent. 
Our principal areas of operation are the Delaware Basin in Texas and New Mexico, the Williston Basin in North Dakota, and the San Juan Basin in New Mexico and Colorado. Our principal executive office is located at 3500 One Williams Center, Tulsa, Oklahoma 74172. Our telephone number is 855-979-2012. We maintain an Internet site at www.wpxenergy.com.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW AND PROPERTIES
Our Business Strategy
Our business strategy is to increase shareholder value by increasing production over time of oil, natural gas and NGLs, expanding our margins, and finding and developing reserves.

• | Focused, Long-Term Portfolio Management. We are focused on long-term profitable growth. Our objective over time is to grow our production within our cash flow. With that in mind, we regularly evaluate the performance of our assets and, when appropriate, we consider divestitures of assets that are underperforming or which are no longer a part of our strategic focus. Since mid-2014, we have completed approximately $5.5 billion of asset acquisitions and divestitures, allowing us to focus on our core areas and strengthen our financial position. With regard to our core assets, we expect to allocate capital to the most profitable opportunities based on commodity price cycles and other market conditions, enabling us to grow our reserves and production in a manner that maximizes our returns on investments.


• | Build Asset Scale. We expect to opportunistically acquire acreage positions in areas where we feel we can establish significant scale and replicate cost-efficient development practices. We may also consider other “bolt-on” transactions that are directed at driving operational efficiencies through increased scale. We can manage costs by focusing on the establishment of large scale, contiguous acreage blocks where we can operate a majority of the properties. We believe this strategy allows us to better achieve economies of scale and apply continuous technological improvements in our operations. We have a history of acquiring undeveloped properties that meet our expected return requirements and other acquisition criteria to expand upon our existing positions as well as acquiring undeveloped acreage in new geographic areas that offer significant resource potential.


• | Margin Expansion thru Focus on Costs. We believe we can expand our margins by focusing on opportunities to reduce our cost structure through improved operating efficiencies and minimal increases in employee headcount as we grow. As we have rationalized our portfolio and reduced our areas of focus to core basins, we believe our cost structure and our organization size are in alignment with our margin growth objectives.


• | Continue Oil Development and Increase Optionality. We believe that efforts to develop our oil properties will yield a more balanced commodity mix in our production, providing us with the option of focusing on the commodity with the best returns under different market conditions. This optionality, we believe, will place us in a position where we can better protect and grow our cash flows. We have engaged in, and will continue to engage in, commodity derivative hedging activities to maintain a degree of cash flow stability. Typically, we target hedging approximately 50 percent of expected revenue from domestic production during a current calendar year in order to strike an appropriate balance of commodity price upside with cash flow protection, although we may vary from this level based on our perceptions of market risk. We have hedged 39,554 Bbls per day and 30,000 Bbls per day of our anticipated remaining 2017 and 2018 oil production, respectively, at a weighted average price of $50.93 per barrel and $54.61 per barrel, respectively. We also have natural gas derivatives totaling 170,000 MMBtu per day and 155,000 MMBtu per day for the remainder of 2017 and 2018, respectively, at a weighted average price of $3.02 per MMBtu and $2.98 per MMBtu, respectively.


• | Maintain Financial Flexibility. We believe that our continued focus on cost reductions, increased capital efficiency and long-term oil production growth will allow us to generate increased and sustainable annual cash flows from operations. This cash flow, combined with our capital structure and available sources of liquidity, will allow us to efficiently develop and grow our resource base and pursue reserve growth throughout a variety of commodity price environments.

Significant Properties
Our principal areas of operation are the Delaware Basin (a subset of the Permian Basin), Williston Basin and San Juan Basin. 
Delaware Basin
We entered the Delaware Basin in August 2015 upon the closing of our acquisition of RKI Exploration & Production, LLC (“RKI”) (the “Acquisition”). We operate 642 wells in the Delaware Basin and also own interests in 783 wells operated by others. We hold approximately 98,000 net acres in the Delaware Basin, with core operations located in Eddy, Lea and Chaves Counties in New Mexico and Loving, Pecos, Reeves, Ward and Winkler Counties in Texas. Approximately 90 percent of the leasehold is held by production. The Permian Basin is one of the most prolific hydrocarbon producing regions of the United States and spans an area approximately 250 miles wide by 300 miles long. The basin is characterized by numerous stacked reservoirs, high oil and natural gas content, extensive production history, long-lived reserves and high drilling success rates. 
During 2016, we have operated an average of 3 drilling rigs in the Delaware Basin and have had an average of 24.2 Mboe per day of net production. We expect to operate 5 rigs in the Delaware Basin in 2017. Capital expenditures in 2016, excluding 
4

land purchases, were approximately $222 million, which included completion of 37 gross (29 net) wells. As of December 31, 2016, another 9 gross operated wells were awaiting completion. 
Our activity in the Delaware Basin is primarily focused on the Wolfcamp Shale formation, the Bone Spring interval (which includes the Avalon sand and shales, and the Bone Springs sands, shales and carbonates), and the shallower Delaware sand interval. We have a multi-year inventory of stacked pays on approximately 98,000 net acres. 
The Permian Basin, of which the Delaware Basin is a substantial sub-basin, covers a significant portion of western Texas and eastern New Mexico and is considered one of the major producing basins in the United States. The Permian Basin formed as an area of rapid Mississippian-Pennsylvanian subsidence in the foreland of the Ouachita fold belt. It is one of the largest sedimentary basins in the United States, and has oil and gas production from several reservoirs from Permian through Ordovician in age. 
From the mid-Pennsylvanian period to the early Permian period, the Delaware Basin was a slowly subsiding area that was characterized by shallow marine shales and limestone. Influxes of clastic sands generally occurred as turbidite deposits formed during periodic sea-level changes. Records indicate a rapid deepening of the Delaware Basin relative to the emergent Central Basin Platform, during the early Permian period. Marine shale deposition continued to dominate the basin during this period. Episodic pulses of carbonate and clastic debris and density flows punctuated the shale deposition and eventually became significant reservoirs. Through the late Permian period, the basin became increasingly more clastic dominated as emergent shelf areas to the north shed sands into the basin.
The Wolfcamp formation within the Delaware Basin is a long-established reservoir, first found in the 1950s as wells aiming for deeper targets occasionally intersected slump blocks or debris flows with good reservoir properties. Wolfcamp reservoirs consist of debris-flow and grain-flow sediments, which were deposited in a submarine fan setting. The best carbonate reservoirs within the Wolfcamp are generally found in proximity to the Central Basin Platform, while the shale reservoirs thicken basinward away from the Central Basin Platform. The Wolfcamp contains organic-rich mudstone and shales which, when buried to sufficient depth for maturation, became the source of the hydrocarbons found both within the shales themselves and in the more conventional clastic and carbonate reservoirs between the shales.
We also have midstream and operational infrastructure in the Delaware Basin to support drilling activities and keep pace with production growth, including investing in low and high pressure gathering lines, compression systems, electrical power supply systems, fresh water supply systems and saltwater disposal systems. We believe these midstream assets provide a competitive advantage and reduce reliance on third parties for takeaway capacity. 
Some of our acreage in the Delaware Basin is leased to us by or with the approval of the federal government or its agencies, including the United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”). These particular leases are subject to federal authority, including the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”), and require governmental agencies to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project on government owned lands. These regulatory regimes impose obligations on the federal government and governmental agencies that may result in legal challenges and potentially lengthy delays in obtaining both permits to drill and rights of way.
Williston Basin
In December 2010, we acquired leasehold positions of approximately 85,800 net acres in the Williston Basin. All of these properties are on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota and we are the primary operator. Based on our geologic interpretation of the Bakken formation, the evolution of completion techniques, our own drilling results as well as the publicly available drilling results for other operators in the basin, we believe that a substantial portion of our Williston Basin acreage is prospective in the Bakken and Three Forks formations, the primary targets for all of the well locations in our current drilling inventory. We operate 229 wells in the Williston Basin and also own interest in 91 wells operated by others. We hold 84,579 net acres in the Williston Basin.
During 2016, we operated an average of 1.2 rigs on our Williston Basin properties and we had an average of 25.0 Mboe per day of net production from our Williston Basin wells. We expect to operate 2 rigs in the Williston Basin in 2017. Capital expenditures in 2016 were approximately $163 million which included the completion of 30 gross (23 net) wells in 2016. As of December 31, 2016, another 12 gross operated wells were awaiting completion.
We are developing oil reserves through horizontal drilling in the Middle Bakken and the Upper Three Forks Shale oil formations. Based on our subsurface geological analysis, we believe that our position lies in an area of the basin with substantial potential recovery for Bakken and Three Forks formation oil.
Williston Basin is spread across North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana and parts of southern Canada, covering approximately 202,000 square miles, of which 143,000 square miles are in the United States. The basin produces oil and natural gas from numerous producing horizons including the Bakken, Three Forks, Madison and Red River formations. 
5

The Devonian-age Bakken formation is found within the Williston Basin underlying portions of North Dakota and Montana and is comprised of three lithologic members referred to as the Upper, Middle and Lower Bakken Shales. The formation ranges up to 150 feet thick and is a continuous and structurally simple reservoir. The upper and lower shales are highly organic, thermally mature and over pressured and can act as both a source and reservoir for the oil. The Middle Bakken, which varies in composition from a silty dolomite to shaly limestone or sand, serves as the productive formation and is a critical reservoir for commercial production. Generally, the Bakken formation is found at vertical depths of 8,500 to 11,500 feet.
The Three Forks formation, generally found immediately under the Bakken formation, has also proven to contain productive reservoir rock. The Three Forks formation typically consists of interbedded dolomites and shale with local development of a discontinuous sandy member at the top, known as the Sanish Sand. The Three Forks formation is an unconventional carbonate play. Similar to the Bakken formation, the Three Forks formation is being exploited utilizing the same horizontal drilling and advanced completion techniques as the Bakken development. Drilling in the Three Forks formation began in mid-2008 and many operators are drilling wells targeting this formation. 
Our acreage in the Williston Basin is leased to us by or with the approval of the federal government or its agencies, and is subject to federal authority, the NEPA, the Bureau of Indian Affairs or other regulatory regimes that require governmental agencies to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project on government owned lands. These regulatory regimes impose obligations on the federal government and governmental agencies that may result in legal challenges and potentially lengthy delays in obtaining project permits or approvals and could result, in certain instances, in the cancellation of existing leases.
San Juan Basin
Our San Juan Basin operations include an oil position in the Mancos Gallup Sandstone that has the potential to significantly increase our oil production and reserves in future years. In 2014, we announced that we executed multiple transactions to own or control over 53,000 additional acres in the heart of the San Juan Basin’s Gallup oil window. At December 31, 2016, our leasehold position in the oil window of the San Juan Basin was approximately 105,000 net acres of which we own or control, and we are targeting additional acreage.
Our San Juan Basin properties also include holdings across the basin producing primarily from the Mesaverde, Fruitland Coal and Mancos Shale formations which are predominantly gas bearing. We operate four units in New Mexico (Rosa, Cox Canyon, Northwest Lybrook and South Chaco) and also operate the Northeast Chaco CA (Communitized Area), as well as a number of non-unit properties.  We operate in three major areas of Colorado (Northwest Cedar Hills, Ignacio and Bondad). We operate 1,017 wells in the San Juan Basin and also own interests in 2,347 wells operated by other operators in New Mexico and Colorado. We hold approximately 130,424 net acres in the gas window of the basin.
During 2016, we operated an average of 1.3 rigs in the San Juan Basin on our oil properties and we expect to operate 1 rig in the San Juan Basin in 2017. We had an average of 32.2 Mboe per day of net production from our San Juan Basin properties which included 7.6 Mbbls per day of oil. Capital expenditures in 2016 were approximately $86 million which included the completion of 16 gross (15 net) wells. As of December 31, 2016, no operated wells were awaiting completion.
The San Juan Basin is one of the oldest and most prolific coal bed methane plays in the world. The Fruitland coal bed extends to depths of approximately 4,200 feet with net thickness ranging from zero to 100 feet. The Mesaverde play is the top producing tight gas play in the basin with total thickness ranging from 500 to 2,500 feet. The Mesaverde is underlain by the upper Mancos Shale and overlain by the Lewis Shale. The Mancos Shale, locally referred to as the Gallup Sandstone, is found at a depth of approximately 5,400 feet and is fine-grained sandstone interval of approximately 150 feet thick. The Mancos Shale includes both oil and natural gas.
Some of our acreage in the San Juan Basin is leased to us by or with the approval of the federal government or its agencies, including the United States Forest Service, BLM, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Federal Indian Minerals Office. These particular leases are subject to federal authority, including the NEPA, and require governmental agencies to evaluate the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project on government owned lands. These regulatory regimes impose obligations on the federal government and governmental agencies that may result in legal challenges and potentially lengthy delays in obtaining both permits to drill and rights of way.

Acquisitions and Divestitures
On February 8, 2016, we signed an agreement with Terra Energy Partners LLC (“Terra”) to sell WPX Energy Rocky Mountain, LLC that held our Piceance Basin operations for $910 million. The agreement also required Terra to become financially responsible for approximately $104 million in transportation obligations held by our marketing company. Additionally, WPX Energy Rocky Mountain, LLC had natural gas derivatives with a fair value of $48 million as of the closing date. The parties closed this sale in April of 2016 and we received net proceeds of $862 million resulting in a gain of $52 million.
On January 12, 2017, we signed an agreement to acquire certain assets from Panther Energy Company II, LLC and Carrier Energy Partners, LLC for $775 million. The assets include approximately 6,500 Boe/d of existing production from 23 producing wells (17 horizontals), two drilled but uncompleted horizontal laterals, 18,100 net acres and 920 gross undeveloped locations in the Delaware Basin. We expect the incremental cash flow from the purchase to fund the existing two-rig program on the acquired acreage which will bring our rig count in the Delaware Basin to seven. We plan to close the transaction during the first quarter of 2017.
Title to Properties
Our title to properties is subject to royalty, overriding royalty, carried, net profits, working and other similar interests and contractual arrangements customary in the oil and natural gas industry, to liens for current taxes not yet due and to other encumbrances. In addition, leases on Native American reservations are subject to Bureau of Indian Affairs and other approvals unique to those locations. As is customary in the industry in the case of undeveloped properties, a limited investigation of record title is made at the time of acquisition. Drilling title opinions are usually prepared before commencement of drilling operations. We believe we have satisfactory title to substantially all of our active properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and natural gas industry. Nevertheless, we are involved in title disputes from time to time which can result in litigation and delay or loss of our ability to realize the benefits of our leases.

We prepare our own reserves estimates and approximately 98 percent of our reserves are audited by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”).
We have not filed on a recurring basis estimates of our total proved net oil, NGL, and gas reserves with any U.S. regulatory authority or agency other than with the U.S. Department of Energy and the SEC. The estimates furnished to the Department of Energy have been consistent with those furnished to the SEC.
Our 2016 year-end estimated proved reserves reflect an average oil price of $35.91 per barrel, an average natural gas price of $1.74 per Mcf and average NGL price of $10.57 per barrel. These prices were calculated from the 12-month trailing average, first-of-the-month price for the applicable indices for each basin as adjusted for respective location price differentials.

During 2016, we added 110 MMboe of extensions and discoveries to our proved reserves. During 2016, we incurred $471 million in development expenditures which included the drilling of 118 gross (64 net) wells. 
Proved reserves reconciliation 
Production of 40 MMboe includes approximately 9 MMboe related to the Piceance Basin through the completion of the sale. The 110 MMboe of extensions and discoveries reflects 26 MMboe added for drilled locations and 84 MMboe added for new proved undeveloped locations. Of the extensions and discoveries, 68 percent were in the Delaware Basin. The acquisitions of 3 MMboe were primarily in the Delaware Basin. The divestitures of 295 MMboe primarily related to the sale of our Piceance Basin operations. The overall net negative revisions of 15 MMboe reflect 2 MMboe of net positive revisions made to developed reserves and 17 MMboe of net negative revisions made to undeveloped reserves. In addition, the 15 MMboe of net negative revisions reflect 49 MMboe in negative revisions due to the decrease in the 12-month average prices partially offset by 34 MMboe of positive revisions due to decreased costs, improved well economics and increased drilling activity.
Reserves estimation process
Our reserves are estimated by deterministic methods using an appropriate combination of production performance analysis and volumetric techniques. The proved reserves for economic undrilled locations are estimated by analogy or volumetrically from offset developed locations. Reservoir continuity and lateral pervasiveness of our tight-sands, shale and coal bed methane reservoirs is established by combinations of subsurface analysis and analysis of 2D and 3D seismic data and pressure data. Understanding reservoir quality may be augmented by core samples analysis.
The engineering staff of each basin asset team provides the reserves modeling and forecasts for their respective areas. Various departments also participate in the preparation of the year-end reserves estimate by providing supporting information such as pricing, capital costs, expenses, ownership, gas gathering and gas quality. The departments and their roles in the year-end reserves process are coordinated by our corporate reserves department. The corporate reserves department’s responsibilities also include performing an internal review of reserves data for reasonableness and accuracy, working with NSAI and the asset teams to successfully complete the reserves audit, finalizing the year-end reserves report and reporting reserves data to accounting.

The preparation of our year-end reserves report is a formal process. Early in the year, we begin with a review of the existing internal processes and controls to identify where improvements can be made from the prior year’s reporting cycle. Later in the year, the reserves staffs from the asset teams submit their preliminary reserves data to the corporate reserves department. After review by the corporate reserves department, the data is submitted to NSAI to begin their audits. Reserves data analysis and further review are then conducted and iterated between the asset teams, corporate reserves department and NSAI. In early December, reserves are reviewed with senior management. The process concludes upon receipt of the audit letter from NSAI.
The reserves estimates resulting from our process are subjected to both internal and external controls to promote transparency and accuracy of the year-end reserves estimates. Our internal corporate reserves department is independent and does not work within an asset team or report directly to anyone on an asset team. The corporate reserves department provides detailed independent review and extensive documentation of the year-end process. Our internal processes and controls, as they relate to the year-end reserves, are reviewed and updated as appropriate. The compensation of our corporate reserves department is not directly linked to reserves additions or revisions.
Approximately 98 percent of our total year-end 2016 domestic proved reserves estimates were audited by NSAI. When compared on a well-by-well basis, some of our estimates are greater and some are less than the NSAI estimates. NSAI is satisfied with our methods and procedures used to prepare the December 31, 2016 reserves estimates and future revenue, and noted nothing of an unusual nature that would cause NSAI to take exception with the estimates, in the aggregate, prepared by us. NSAI was founded in 1961 and performs consulting petroleum engineering services under Texas Board of Professional Engineers Registration No. F-2699. Within NSAI, the technical persons primarily responsible for auditing the estimates meet or exceed the education, training, and experience requirements set forth in the Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information promulgated by the Society of Petroleum Engineers; both are proficient in judiciously applying industry standard practices to engineering and geoscience evaluations as well as applying SEC and other industry reserves definitions and guidelines.
The company’s internal technical person primarily responsible for overseeing preparation of the reserves estimates and the third party reserves audit has 34 years of reserves evaluation experience, a B.S. in geology from the University of Texas at Austin, an M.S. in Physical Sciences from the University of Houston and membership in the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and The Society of Petroleum Engineers.
Proved undeveloped reserves
The majority of our reserves is concentrated in unconventional tight-sands and shale oil and gas reservoirs. We use available geoscience and engineering data to establish drainage areas and reservoir continuity beyond one direct offset from a producing well, which may provide for additional proved undeveloped reserves. Inherent in the methodology is a requirement for significant well density of economically producing wells to establish reasonable certainty. In fields where producing wells are less concentrated, generally only direct offsets from proved producing wells were assigned the proved undeveloped reserves classification. No new technologies were used to assign proved undeveloped reserves.
At December 31, 2016, our proved undeveloped reserves were 165 MMboe, a decrease of 16 MMboe from our December 31, 2015 proved undeveloped reserves estimate of 181 MMboe. The 165 MMboe represents 48 percent of our total proved reserves at December 31, 2016 as compared with 181 MMboe which was 31 percent of our total proved reserves as of December 31, 2015. Below is a reconciliation of our proved undeveloped reserves for 2016: 

 | | | % of | | % of 
 | MMboe | | December 31, 2015 | | December 31, 2016
Proved Undeveloped Reserves at December 31, 2015 | 181 | | | | | 
Converted to Proved Developed Reserves | (18 | ) | | (10)% | | (11)%
Extensions and Discoveries | 85 | | | 47% | | 52%

Divestitures | (67 | ) | | (37)% | | (41)%
Proved Undeveloped Reserves at December 31, 2016 | 165 | | | | |

During 2016, 18 MMboe of our December 31, 2015 proved undeveloped reserves were converted to proved developed reserves at a cost of $143 million of which $64 million was incurred in prior years. This represents a proved undeveloped conversion rate of 10 percent. Of the converted proved undeveloped reserves, 47 percent were converted in the Piceance Basin before the divestiture, 42 percent were converted in the Williston Basin primarily in the Bakken and Three Forks formations, 8 percent were converted in the San Juan Basin mainly in the Gallup formation and approximately 3 percent were in the Delaware Basin in the Bone Springs and Wolfcamp formations.
Of the 85 MMboe of proved undeveloped extensions and discoveries, 72 percent are in the Delaware Basin, primarily in the Wolfcamp formation, 23 percent are in the San Juan Basin, mainly in the Gallup and Mancos dry gas formations, and 5 percent are in the Williston Basin in the Bakken and Three Forks formations. 
In 2016, net negative revisions for our proved undeveloped reserves were 17 MMboe and reflected downward revisions of 37 MMboe reduction of reserves based on the 12 month trailing prices including 21 MMboe associated with uneconomic locations based on the 12 month trailing prices, partially offset by 20 MMboe of net upward revisions primarily due to technical items including improved well economics and increased drilling activity. Of the 21 MMboe downward revisions associated with the removal of uneconomic locations, 15 MMboe are from gas well locations of which 77 percent are from Avalon formation locations in the Delaware Basin and 23 percent are from various formations in the San Juan Basin. Of the 20 MMboe net upward non-price related revisions, 76 percent relates primarily to improved economics and an increase in drilling activity in the Williston Basin and the other 24 percent relates to all other basins combined. 
The 1 MMboe of proved undeveloped acquisitions relates to the Delaware Basin. The 67 MMboe of proved undeveloped divestitures relate to the Piceance properties sold in April 2016. 
All proved undeveloped locations are scheduled to be drilled within the next five years. Development drilling schedules are subject to revision and reprioritization throughout the year resulting from unknown factors such as the relative success of individual developmental drilling prospects, rig availability, title issues or delays and the effect that acquisitions or dispositions may have on prioritizing developmental drilling plans for maximizing returns of capital spent.

__________

(a) | Primarily acreage in exploratory areas we no longer plan to develop.

Seasonality
Generally, the demand for natural gas decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the winter months and in some areas during the summer months. Seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or hot summers can lessen or intensify this fluctuation. Conversely, during extreme weather events such as blizzards, hurricanes, or heat waves, pipeline systems can become temporarily constrained thus amplifying localized price volatility. In addition, pipelines, utilities, local distribution companies and industrial users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements 
15

during the summer months. This can lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. World weather and resultant prices for liquefied natural gas can also affect deliveries of competing liquefied natural gas into this country from abroad, affecting the price of domestically produced natural gas. In addition, adverse weather conditions can also affect our production rates or otherwise disrupt our operations.
Hedging Activity
To manage the commodity price risk and volatility associated with owning producing crude oil, natural gas and NGL properties, we enter into derivative contracts for a portion of our expected future production. See further discussion in Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Customers
Oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold through our sales and marketing activities to a variety of purchasers under various length contracts ranging from one day to multi-year under various pricing structures. Our third-party customers include other producers, utility companies, power generators, banks, marketing and trading companies and midstream service providers. In 2016, we had three customers that accounted for 10 percent or more of our consolidated total revenues adjusted for net gain (loss) on derivatives. See further detail in Note 15 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We believe that the loss of one or more of our current oil, natural gas or NGLs purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our production, because any individual purchaser could be readily replaced by other purchasers, absent a broad market disruption.
REGULATORY MATTERS
The oil and natural gas industry is extensively regulated by numerous federal, state, local and foreign authorities, including Native American tribes in the United States. Legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing the regulatory burden. Also, numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, and Native American tribes are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members, some of which carry substantial penalties for noncompliance. Although the regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability, these burdens generally do not affect us any differently or to any greater or lesser extent than they affect other companies in the industry with similar types, quantities and locations of production.
The availability, terms and cost of transportation significantly affect sales of oil and natural gas. The interstate transportation and sale for resale of oil and natural gas is subject to federal regulation, including regulation of the terms, conditions and rates for interstate transportation, storage and various other matters, primarily by the FERC. Federal and state regulations govern the price and terms for access to oil and natural gas pipeline transportation. The FERC’s regulations for interstate oil and natural gas transmission in some circumstances may also affect the intrastate transportation of oil and natural gas.
Although oil and natural gas prices are currently unregulated, Congress historically has been active in the area of oil and natural gas regulation. We cannot predict whether new legislation to regulate oil and natural gas might be proposed, what proposals, if any, might actually be enacted by Congress or the various state legislatures, and what effect, if any, the proposals might have on our operations. Sales of oil, natural gas and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at market prices.
Drilling and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at federal, state, local and Native American tribal levels. These types of regulation include requiring permits for the drilling of wells, drilling bonds and reports concerning operations. Most states, and some counties, municipalities and Native American tribal areas where we operate also regulate one or more of the following activities:

• | the location of wells;


• | the method of drilling and casing wells;


• | the timing of construction or drilling activities including seasonal wildlife closures;


• | the employment of tribal members or use of tribal owned service businesses;


• | the rates of production or “allowables”;


• | the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled;


• | the plugging and abandoning of wells;

16


• | the notice to surface owners and other third parties; and


• | the use, maintenance and restoration of roads and bridges used during all phases of drilling and production.

State laws regulate the size and shape of drilling and spacing units or proration units governing the pooling of oil and natural gas properties. Some states allow forced pooling or integration of tracts to facilitate exploration while other states rely on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In some instances, forced pooling or unitization may be implemented by third parties and may reduce our interest in the unitized properties. In addition, state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose requirements regarding the ratability of production. These laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells or limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill. Moreover, each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil, natural gas and NGLs within its jurisdiction. States do not regulate wellhead prices or engage in other similar direct regulation, but there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future. The effect of such future regulations may be to limit the amounts of oil and natural gas that may be produced from our wells, negatively affect the economics of production from these wells, or to limit the number of locations we can drill.
Federal, state and local regulations provide detailed requirements in areas where we operate for the abandonment of wells, closure or decommissioning of production facilities and pipelines, and site restoration. Most states have an administrative agency that requires the posting of performance bonds to fulfill financial requirements for owners and operators on state land. The Army Corps of Engineers and many other state and local authorities also have regulations for plugging and abandonment, decommissioning and site restoration. Although the Army Corps of Engineers does not require bonds or other financial assurances, some state agencies and municipalities do have such requirements.
Natural Gas Sales and Transportation
Historically, federal legislation and regulatory controls have affected the price of the natural gas we produce and the manner in which we market our production. The FERC has jurisdiction over the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce by natural gas companies under the Natural Gas Act of 1938 and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Various federal laws enacted since 1978 have resulted in the complete removal of all price and non-price controls for sales of domestic natural gas sold in first sales, which include all of our own production. Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the FERC has substantial enforcement authority to prohibit the manipulation of natural gas markets and enforce its rules and orders, including the ability to assess substantial civil penalties.
The FERC also regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions and establishes the terms under which we may use interstate natural gas pipeline capacity, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas and release of our natural gas pipeline capacity. Commencing in 1985, the FERC promulgated a series of orders, regulations and rule makings that significantly fostered competition in the business of transporting and marketing natural gas. Today, interstate pipeline companies are required to provide nondiscriminatory transportation services to producers, marketers and other shippers, regardless of whether such shippers are affiliated with them. The FERC’s initiatives have led to the development of a competitive, open access market for natural gas purchases and sales that permits all purchasers of natural gas to buy directly from third-party sellers other than pipelines. However, the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated; therefore, we cannot guarantee that the less stringent regulatory approach currently pursued by the FERC and Congress will continue indefinitely into the future nor can we determine what effect, if any, future regulatory changes might have on our natural gas related activities.
Under the FERC’s current regulatory regime, transmission services must be provided on an open-access, nondiscriminatory basis at cost-based rates or at market-based rates if the transportation market at issue is sufficiently competitive. Gathering service, which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services, is regulated by the states. Although its policy is still in flux, the FERC has in the past reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non-jurisdictional gathering facilities, which has the tendency to increase our costs of transporting natural gas to point-of-sale locations.
Oil Sales and Transportation
Sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices. Nevertheless, Congress could reenact price controls in the future.
Our crude oil sales are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation. The transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate regulation. The FERC regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the Interstate Commerce Act and intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions. The basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation, and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to 
17

intrastate oil pipeline rates, varies from state to state. Insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers, we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors.
Further, interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. Under this open access standard, common carriers must offer service to all shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates. When oil pipelines operate at full capacity, access is governed by prorating provisions set forth in the pipelines’ published tariffs. Accordingly, we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our competitors.
Operations on Native American Reservations
A portion of our leases are, and some of our future leases may be, regulated by Native American tribes. In addition to regulation by various federal, state, and local agencies and authorities, an entirely separate and distinct set of laws and regulations applies to lessees, operators and other parties within the boundaries of Native American reservations in the United States. Various federal agencies within the U.S. Department of the Interior, particularly the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the Office of Natural Resources Revenue and BLM, and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), together with each Native American tribe, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American reservations. These regulations include lease provisions, royalty matters, drilling and production requirements, environmental standards, tribal employment contractor preferences and numerous other matters.
Native American tribes are subject to various federal statutes and oversight by the Bureau of Indian Affairs and BLM. However, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation and has the right to enact and enforce certain other laws and regulations entirely independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations, as long as they do not supersede or conflict with such federal statutes. These tribal laws and regulations include various fees, taxes, requirements to employ Native American tribal members or use tribal owned service businesses and numerous other conditions that apply to lessees, operators and contractors conducting operations within the boundaries of a Native American reservation. Further, lessees and operators operating within a Native American reservation are often subject to the Native American tribal court system, unless there is a specific waiver of sovereign immunity by the Native American tribe allowing resolution of disputes between the Native American tribe and those lessees or operators to occur in federal or state court.
Therefore, we are subject to various laws and regulations pertaining to Native American tribal surface ownership, Native American oil and gas leases, fees, taxes and other burdens, obligations and issues unique to oil and gas ownership and operations within Native American reservations. One or more of these requirements, or delays in obtaining necessary approvals or permits pursuant to these regulations, may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and have an impact on the economic viability of any well or project on those lands.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state, local, Native American tribal and foreign laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Applicable U.S. federal environmental laws include, but are not limited to, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and the Clean Air Act (“CAA”). These laws and regulations govern environmental cleanup standards, require permits for air, water, underground injection, solid and hazardous waste disposal and set environmental compliance criteria. In addition, state and local laws and regulations set forth specific standards for drilling wells, the maintenance of bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, the spacing and location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, the plugging and abandoning of wells, and the prevention and cleanup of pollutants and other matters. We maintain insurance against costs of clean-up operations, but we are not fully insured against all such risks. Additionally, Congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise the environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in delay or more stringent and costly permitting, waste handling, disposal and clean-up requirements for the oil and gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs. Although future environmental obligations are not expected to have a material impact on the results of our operations or financial condition, there can be no assurance that future developments, such as increasingly stringent environmental laws or enforcement thereof, will not cause us to incur material environmental liabilities or costs.
Public and regulatory scrutiny of the energy industry has resulted in increased environmental regulation and enforcement being either proposed or implemented. For example, EPA’s 2011 – 2013, 2014 – 2016, and 2016 – 2019 National Enforcement Initiatives include Energy Extraction and “Ensuring Energy Extraction Activities Comply with Environmental Laws.” According to the EPA’s website, “some techniques for natural gas extraction pose a significant risk to public health and the environment.” To address these concerns, the EPA has settled a number of high-impact cases under this initiative resulting in significant air emissions reductions, and will continue to identify the best ways to address pollution through greater use of 
18

advanced pollution monitoring and reporting techniques. The EPA has emphasized that this initiative will be focused on those areas of the country where energy extraction activities are concentrated, and the focus and nature of the enforcement activities will vary with the type of activity and the related pollution problem presented. This initiative could involve a large scale investigation of our facilities and processes, and could lead to potential enforcement actions, penalties or injunctive relief against us.
Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal fines and penalties and the imposition of injunctive relief. Accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third-party claims for damage to property, natural resources or persons. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us, there can be no assurance that this will continue in the future.
The environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry and our business are as follows:
Hazardous Substances and Wastes. CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund law,” imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment. These persons include the owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that transported or disposed of or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file corresponding common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment.
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) generally does not regulate wastes generated by the exploration and production of natural gas and oil. RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste “drilling fluids, produced waters and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy.” However, legislation has been proposed in Congress from time to time that would reclassify certain natural gas and oil exploration and production wastes as “hazardous wastes,” which would make the reclassified wastes subject to much more stringent handling, disposal and clean-up requirements. If such legislation were to be enacted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the natural gas and oil industry in general. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste oils, may be regulated as hazardous waste.
We own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, onshore properties that for many years have been used for or associated with the exploration and production of natural gas and oil. Although we have utilized operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us on or under other locations where such wastes have been taken for disposal. In addition, a portion of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of wastes was not under our control. These properties and the wastes disposed thereon may be subject to CERCLA, the CWA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes (including waste disposed of or released by prior owners or operators) or property contamination (including groundwater contamination by prior owners or operators), or to perform remedial plugging or closure operations to prevent future contamination.
Waste Discharges. The CWA and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. Spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations. On January 11, 2017, the EPA issued the final 2017 construction general permit (“CGP”) for stormwater discharges from construction activities involving more than one acre, which will provide coverage for a five-year period and will take effect on February 16, 2017. The 2017 CGP implements Effluent Limitations Guidelines and New Source Performance Standards for the Construction and Development Industry. The rule includes stringent restrictions on erosion and sediment control, pollution prevention and stabilization.

Air Emissions. The CAA and associated state laws and regulations restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including oil and gas operations. New facilities may be required to obtain permits before construction can begin, and existing facilities may be required to obtain additional permits and incur capital costs in order to remain in compliance. More stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants and greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) have been developed by the EPA and may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities. In 2012, the EPA issued federal regulations affecting our operations under the New Source Performance Standards provisions (new Subpart OOOO) and expanded regulations under national emission standards for hazardous air pollutants.
Oil Pollution Act. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, as amended (“OPA”), and regulations thereunder impose a variety of requirements on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills in United States waters. A “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, pipeline or vessel, or the lessee or permittee of the area in which an offshore facility is located. OPA assigns liability to each responsible party for oil cleanup costs and a variety of public and private damages. While liability limits apply in some circumstances, a party cannot take advantage of liability limits if the spill was caused by gross negligence or willful misconduct or resulted from violation of a federal safety, construction or operating regulation. If the party fails to report a spill or to cooperate fully in the cleanup, liability limits likewise do not apply. Few defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA. OPA imposes ongoing requirements on a responsible party, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with an oil spill.
National Environmental Policy Act. Oil and natural gas exploration and production activities on federal lands are subject to the National Environmental Policy Act (“NEPA”). NEPA requires federal agencies, including the Department of Interior, to evaluate major agency actions having the potential to significantly impact the environment. The process involves the preparation of either an environmental assessment or environmental impact statement depending on whether the specific circumstances surrounding the proposed federal action will have a significant impact on the human environment. The NEPA process involves public input through comments which can alter the nature of a proposed project either by limiting the scope of the project or requiring resource-specific mitigation. NEPA decisions can be appealed through the court system by process participants. This process may result in delaying the permitting and development of projects, increase the costs of permitting and developing some facilities and could result in certain instances in the cancellation of existing leases.
Endangered Species Act. The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. While some of our operations may be located in areas that are designated as habitats for endangered or threatened species, we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the ESA. However, the designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could cause us to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected states.
Worker Safety. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. The OSHA hazard communication standard requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of such information to employees. Other OSHA standards regulate specific worker safety aspects of our operations. Failure to comply with OSHA requirements can lead to the imposition of penalties.
Safe Drinking Water Act. The Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) and comparable state statutes restrict the disposal, treatment or release of water produced or used during oil and gas development. Subsurface emplacement of fluids (including disposal wells or enhanced oil recovery) is governed by federal or state regulatory authorities that, in some cases, includes the state oil and gas regulatory authority or the state’s environmental authority. These regulations may increase the costs of compliance for some facilities.
Hydraulic Fracturing. We ordinarily use hydraulic fracturing as a means to maximize the productivity of our oil and gas wells in all of the basins in which we operate. In particular, all of our wells that we drill and complete in our core assets such as Delaware, Williston and San Juan require hydraulic fracturing for production. Although average drilling and completion costs for each basin will vary, as will the cost of each well within a given basin, on average approximately one-third of the drilling and completion costs for each of our wells for which we use hydraulic fracturing is associated with hydraulic fracturing activities. These costs are treated in the same way that all other costs of drilling and completion of our wells are treated and are built into and funded through our normal capital expenditure budget.
The protection of groundwater quality is extremely important to us. We follow applicable standard industry practices and legal requirements for groundwater protection in our operations. These measures are subject to close supervision by state and federal regulators (including the BLM with respect to federal acreage), which conduct many inspections during operations that include hydraulic fracturing. Industry standards and legal requirements for groundwater protection focus on six principal areas: (i) pressure testing of well construction and integrity, (ii) lining of pits used to hold water and other fluids used in the drilling 
20

process isolated from surface water and groundwater, (iii) casing and cementing practices for wells to ensure separation of the production zone from groundwater, (iv) disclosure of the chemical content of fracturing liquids, (v) setback requirements as to the location of waste disposal areas, and (vi) pre- and post-drilling groundwater sampling. The legal requirements relating to the protection of surface water and groundwater vary from state to state and there are also federal regulations and guidance that apply to all domestic drilling. In addition, the American Petroleum Institute publishes industry standards and guidance for hydraulic fracturing and the protection of surface water and groundwater. Our policy and practice is to follow all applicable guidelines and regulations in the areas where we conduct hydraulic fracturing.
In addition to the required use of and specifications for casing and cement in well construction, we observe regulatory requirements and what we consider best practices to ensure wellbore integrity and full isolation of any underground aquifers and protection of surface waters. These include the following:

• | Prior to perforating the production casing and hydraulic fracturing operations, the casing is pressure tested.


• | Before the fracturing operation commences, all surface equipment is pressure tested, which includes the wellhead and all pressurized lines and connections leading from the pumping equipment to the wellhead. During the pumping phases of the hydraulic fracturing treatment, specialized equipment is utilized to monitor and record surface pressures, pumping rates, volumes and chemical concentrations to ensure the treatment is proceeding as designed and the wellbore integrity is sound. Should any problem be detected during the hydraulic fracturing treatment, the operation is shut down until the problem is evaluated, reported and remediated.


• | As a means to protect against the negative impacts of any potential surface release of fluids associated with the hydraulic fracturing operation, special precautions are taken to ensure proper containment and storage of fluids. For example, any earthen pits containing non-fresh water must be lined with a synthetic impervious liner. These pits are tested regularly, and in certain sensitive areas have additional leak detection systems in place. At least two feet of freeboard, or available capacity, must be present in the pit at all times. In addition, earthen berms are constructed around any storage tanks, any fluid handling equipment, and in some cases around the perimeter of the location to contain any fluid releases. These berms are considered to be a “secondary” form of containment and serve as an added measure for the protection of groundwater.


• | We conduct baseline water monitoring in some of the basins in which we use hydraulic fracturing.


• | In Colorado we perform baseline water monitoring required by the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission.


• | The BLM may require baseline water monitoring as a condition of approval for drilling permits.


• | There are currently no regulatory requirements to conduct baseline water monitoring in the Williston Basin, the Delaware Basin or the New Mexico portion of our San Juan Basin assets. The majority of our assets in the San Juan Basin are on federal lands, and there are few cases where water wells are within one to two miles of our wells, which is outside the range that we would typically sample.

Once a pipe is set in place, cement is pumped into the well where it hardens and creates a permanent, isolating barrier between the steel casing pipe and surrounding geological formations. This aspect of the well design essentially eliminates a “pathway” for the fracturing fluid to contact any aquifers during the hydraulic fracturing operations. Furthermore, in the basins in which we conduct hydraulic fracturing, the hydrocarbon bearing formations are separated from any usable underground aquifers by thousands of feet of impermeable rock layers. This wide separation serves as a protective barrier, preventing any migration of fracturing fluids or hydrocarbons upwards into any groundwater zones.
In addition, the vendors we employ to conduct hydraulic fracturing are required to monitor all pump rates and pressures during the fracturing treatments. This monitoring occurs on a real-time basis and data is recorded to ensure protection of groundwater.
The cement and steel casing used in well construction can have rare failures. Any failure in isolation is reported to the applicable oil and gas regulatory body. A remediation procedure is written and approved and then completed on the well before any further operations or production is commenced. Possible isolation failures may result from:

• | Improper cementing work. This can create conditions in which hydraulic fracturing fluids and other natural occurring substances can migrate into the surrounding geological formation. Production casing cementing tops and cement bond effectiveness are evaluated using either a temperature log or an acoustical cement bond log prior to any completion operations. If the cement bond or cement top is determined to be inadequate for zone isolation, remedial cementing operations are performed to fill any voids and re-establish integrity. As part of this remedial operation, the casing is again pressure tested before fracturing operations are initiated.


• | Initial casing integrity failure. The casing is pressure tested prior to commencing completion operations. If the test fails due to a compromise in the casing, the applicable oil and gas regulatory body will be notified and a remediation procedure will be written, approved and completed before any further operations are conducted. In addition, casing

21

pressures are monitored throughout the fracturing treatment and any indication of failure will result in an immediate shutdown of the operation.

• | Well failure or casing integrity failure during production. Loss of wellbore integrity can occur over time even if the well was correctly constructed due to downhole operating environments causing corrosion and stress. During production, the bradenhead, casing and tubing pressures are monitored and a casing failure can be identified and evaluated. Remediation could include placing additional cement behind casing, installing a casing patch, or plugging and abandoning the well, if necessary.


• | “Fluid leakoff” during the fracturing process. Fluid leakoff can occur during hydraulic fracturing operations whereby some of the hydraulic fracturing fluid flows through the artificially created fractures into the micropore or pore spaces within the formation, existing natural fractures in the formation, or small fractures opened into the formation by the pressure in the induced fracture. Fluid leakoff is accounted for in the volume design of nearly every fracturing job and “pump-in” tests are often conducted prior to fracturing jobs to estimate the extent of fluid leakoff. In certain situations, very fine grain sand is added in the initial part of the treatment to seal-off any small fractures of micropore spaces and mitigate fluid leak-off.

Approximately 99 percent of hydraulic fracturing fluids are made up of water and sand. We utilize major hydraulic fracturing service companies whose research departments conduct ongoing development of “greener” chemicals that are used in fracturing. We evaluate, test, and where appropriate adopt those products that are more environmentally friendly. We have also chosen to participate in a voluntary fracturing chemical registry that is a public website: www.fracfocus.org at which interested persons can find out information about fracturing fluids. This registry is a joint project of the Ground Water Protection Council and the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission and provides our industry with an avenue to voluntarily disclose chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. The Company registered with the FracFocus Chemical Disclosure Registry in April 2011 and began uploading data when the registry went live on April 11, 2011. Through December 31, 2016, we have loaded data on more than 1,693 wells, including data relating to wells fractured since January 1, 2011, to the site. Consistent with other industry participants, we are not planning to add data on wells drilled prior to 2011. The information included on this website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Any water that is recovered in our operations that is not used for our hydraulic fracturing operations is safely disposed in accordance with the state and federal rules and regulations in a manner that does not impact underground aquifers and surface waters.
Despite our efforts to minimize impacts on the environment from hydraulic fracturing activities, in light of the volume of our hydraulic fracturing activities, we have occasionally been engaged in litigation and received requests for information, notices of alleged violation, and citations related to the activities of our hydraulic fracturing vendors, none of which has resulted in any material costs or penalties.
Recently, there has been a heightened debate over whether the fluids used in hydraulic fracturing may contaminate drinking water supply and proposals have been made to revisit the environmental exemption for hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA or to enact separate federal legislation or legislation at the state and local government levels that would regulate hydraulic fracturing. Both the United States House of Representatives and Senate have considered Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of Chemicals Act (“FRAC Act”) and a number of states, including states in which we have operations, are looking to more closely regulate hydraulic fracturing due to concerns about water supply. The recent congressional legislative efforts seek to regulate hydraulic fracturing to Underground Injection Control program requirements, which would significantly increase well capital costs. If the exemption for hydraulic fracturing is removed from the SDWA, or if other legislation is enacted at the federal, state or local level, any restrictions on the use of hydraulic fracturing contained in any such legislation could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations.
Federal agencies are also considering regulation of hydraulic fracturing. The EPA recently asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the SDWA’s Underground Injection Control Program, and on May 10, 2012, the EPA published its proposed guidance on the issue. The public comment period for the proposed permitting guidance closed in 2012, and the EPA issued its final guidance in February 2014. In August 2015, the EPA published its Final 2014 Effluent Guidelines Program Plans under the CWA confirming its intention to regulate wastewater discharges from on-shore Unconventional Oil and Gas Extraction and to specifically investigate centralized water treatment facilities that accept oil and gas extraction wastewaters. The EPA has also collected information as part of a multi-year study into the effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. The EPA published its Final “Assessment of Potential Impacts of Hydraulic Fracturing for Oil and Gas on Drinking Water Resources” on December 13, 2016. The Final Assessment concluded that “EPA found scientific evidence that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances.” The final report could result in additional regulations, which could lead to operational burdens similar to those described above. In connection with the EPA study, we received and responded to a request for information from the EPA for 52 of our wells 
22

located in various basins that have been hydraulically fractured. The requested information covers well design, construction and completion practices, among other things. We understand that similar requests were sent to eight other companies that own or operate wells that utilized hydraulic fracturing.
In addition to the EPA study, the Shale Gas Subcommittee of the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board issued a final report on hydraulic fracturing in November 2011. The report concludes that the risk of fracturing fluids contaminating drinking water sources through fractures in the shale formations “is remote.” It also states that development of the nation’s shale resources has produced major economic benefits. The report includes recommendations to address concerns related to hydraulic fracturing and shale gas production, including but not limited to conducting additional field studies on possible methane leakage from shale gas wells to water reservoirs and adopting new rules and enforcement practices to protect drinking and surface waters. The Government Accountability Office is also examining the environmental impacts of produced water and the Counsel for Environmental Quality has been petitioned by environmental groups to develop a programmatic environmental impact statement under NEPA for hydraulic fracturing. On November 18, 2016, the Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) issued its final rule related to the reduction of waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and natural gas production activities on federal and Indian lands, to take effect on January 17, 2017. The rule, which will be phased in over time, requires oil and gas producers to use currently available technologies and processes to cut flaring in half at oil wells on public and tribal lands, periodically inspect their operations for leaks, replace outdated equipment, limit venting from storage tanks and to use best practices to limit gas losses when removing liquids from wells.
Several states, including Colorado, North Dakota and New Mexico, have adopted or are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict or impose additional requirements related to hydraulic fracturing. Since June 2009, Colorado has required all operators to maintain a chemical inventory by well site for each chemical product used downhole or stored for use downhole during drilling, completion and workover operations, including fracture stimulation in an amount exceeding 500 pounds during any quarterly reporting period. Colorado adopted its final hydraulic fracturing chemical disclosure rules on December 13, 2011. New Mexico and Texas require public disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. Disclosure of chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process could make it easier for third parties opposing the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect groundwater. A number of states have also adopted regulations increasing the setback requirements, or are in the process of rulemaking to address the issue, including Colorado, New Mexico and Texas.
In addition, a number of local governments in Colorado have imposed temporary moratoria on drilling permits within city limits so that local ordinances may be reviewed to assess their adequacy to address such activities, while some state and local governments in the Appalachian Basin and San Juan Basin in New Mexico have considered or imposed temporary moratoria on drilling operations using hydraulic fracturing until further study of the potential environmental and human health impacts by the EPA or the relative state agencies are completed. Certain organizations have promoted ballot initiatives at the local level that are aimed at imposing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, and may attempt to do the same on a wider basis in one or more states where we operate. At this time, it is not possible to estimate the potential impact on our business of these state and local actions or the enactment of additional federal or state legislation or regulations affecting hydraulic fracturing.
Global Warming and Climate Change. Recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of GHGs, including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the earth’s atmosphere. Both houses of Congress have previously considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and almost one-half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through the planned development of GHG emission inventories and/or regional GHG cap and trade programs. The EPA has begun to regulate GHG emissions. On December 7, 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present an endangerment to public health and the environment. These findings allow the EPA to adopt and implement regulations that would restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the CAA. The EPA issued a final rule that went into effect in 2011 that makes certain stationary sources and newer modification projects subject to permitting requirements for GHG emissions. On November 30, 2010, the EPA published its final rule expanding the existing GHG monitoring and reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities and onshore oil and natural gas processing, transmission, storage, and distribution facilities. Reporting of GHG emissions from such facilities will be required on an annual basis, and our reporting began in 2012 for emissions occurring in 2011. We are required to report our GHG emissions under this rule but are not subject to GHG permitting requirements. Several of the EPA’s GHG rules are being challenged in court proceedings and depending on the outcome of such proceedings, such rules may be modified or rescinded or the EPA could develop new rules.
Because regulation of GHG emissions is relatively new, further regulatory, legislative and judicial developments are likely to occur. In March 2014, the White House published the President’s Climate Action Plan Strategy to Reduce Methane Emissions. In August 2015, EPA proposed its new NSPS OOOOa requirements, which add additional methane reduction requirements applicable to the oil and gas sector for both new and modified sources. Such developments may affect how these GHG initiatives will impact our operations. In addition to these regulatory developments, recent judicial decisions have 
23

allowed certain tort claims alleging property damage to proceed against GHG emissions sources and may increase our litigation risk for such claims. New legislation or regulatory programs that restrict emissions of or require inventory of GHGs in areas where we operate have adversely affected or will adversely affect our operations by increasing costs. The cost increases so far have resulted from costs associated with inventorying our GHG emissions, and further costs may result from the potential new requirements to obtain GHG emissions permits, install additional emission control equipment and an increased monitoring and record-keeping burden.
Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy. To the extent that our products are competing with higher GHG emitting energy sources such as coal, our products would become more desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. To the extent that our products are competing with lower GHG emitting energy sources such as solar and wind, our products would become less desirable in the market with more stringent limitations on GHG emissions. We cannot predict with any certainty at this time how these possibilities may affect our operations.
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could adversely affect or delay demand for the oil or natural gas or otherwise cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects.
COMPETITION
We compete with other oil and gas concerns, including major and independent oil and gas companies in the development, production and marketing of oil and natural gas. We compete in areas such as acquisition of oil and gas properties and obtaining necessary equipment, supplies and services. We also compete in recruiting and retaining skilled employees.
