Competition
Given the importance of technological leadership, vehicle life-cycle expertise, reputation for quality and reliability, and the growing joint collaboration between OEMs and suppliers to drive new product development, the space in which we mostly operate has not historically had a large number of competitors. Our principal competitors are Knorr-Bremse (Knorr's U.S. subsidiary is Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems) and, in certain categories, Haldex. In the advanced electronics categories, automotive players such as Bosch (automotive) and Continental have recently been present in some commercial vehicle applications. In the mechanical product categories, several Asian competitors are emerging, primarily in China, who are focused on such products. In each of our product categories, we compete on the basis of product design, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, product quality and reliability, price, delivery and service. 
Manufacturing and Operations 
Most of our manufacturing sites and distribution centers produce and/or house a broad range of products and serve different types of customers. Currently, approximately 72% of our manufacturing workforce is located in best cost countries such as China, India, Brazil and Poland up from approximately 45% in 2007. Facilities in best cost countries have historically helped to reduce costs on more labor-intensive products, while our facilities in Western Europe are generally producing more technologically advanced products. However, the increasing need for more advanced products and systems in emerging markets leads us to expand local supply chain capabilities to progressively cover more complex manufacturing. 
All facilities worldwide are deploying Six Sigma Lean initiatives and global standards to continuously generate productivity and improve service levels. By applying Six Sigma policy, methodologies and tools, we seek to improve quality and predictability of our processes on a continual basis. Lean is geared toward eliminating waste in our supply chain, manufacturing and administrative processes. Methodologies are customer driven and data based. In addition, our global supply chain team is tightly connected throughout regions and at each site. They make decisions on where to manufacture which products taking into account such factors as local and export demand, customer approvals, cost, key supplier locations and factory capabilities. WABCO's global manufacturing and logistics also support our customers in the aftermarket as we continue to perform at industry-leading levels for on-time delivery and inventory fulfillment, among other drivers of customer satisfaction.
As announced in 2015 within the framework of preserving WABCO competitiveness in conventional mechanical products, 2016 saw the end of manufacturing activities and shutdown of operations in Meppel (Netherlands). Following the completion of the formal regulatory approval process in France, production at our Claye-Souilly (France) plant will cease in the second half of 2017, with production also being transferred to other facilities within WABCO’s globally integrated supply chain.
WABCO also invested $17 million to build a new state-of-the-art factory in Charleston, South Carolina where we will continue local manufacturing of air compressors and braking system components in response to increased demand for our advanced Air Disc Brakes by major original equipment manufacturers and fleets in North America.
Our global sourcing organization purchases a wide variety of components, including electrical, electro-mechanical and cast aluminum products, as well as parts containing materials such as steel, copper, rubber and plastic. These items represent a substantial portion of manufacturing costs. We source products on a global basis from three key regions: Western Europe, Central and Eastern 
 12

Europe, and Asia. To support WABCO's continuing shift of manufacturing to best cost countries, we also continue to migrate more of our sourcing to best cost regions. Under the leadership of the global sourcing organization, which is organized around commodity and product groups, we identify and develop key suppliers and seek to integrate them as partners within our extended enterprise. Many of our Western European suppliers are accompanying us toward best cost countries. Since 2007, the share of our sourcing from best cost regions has increased from 36% to approximately 46%. 
We have developed a strong position in the engineering, design, development and testing of products, components and systems. We are generally regarded within our global industry as a systems expert. This recognition reflects our in-depth technical knowledge and capabilities to support the development of advanced technology applications that are appropriately and optimally integrated with all of the vehicle's other systems and controls. Key customers depend on us and will typically involve us very early in the development process as they begin designing next generation platforms. We have approximately 2,382 employees - of which approximately 54% is located in best cost countries - dedicated to engineering and developing new products, components and systems as well as supporting and enhancing technology applications and manufacturing processes. These include 228 software engineers in India who support the local design of new products and systems for emerging markets and contributes to the global development of advanced technologies for commercial vehicles. They are dedicated to continuously improving the cost effectiveness and efficiency of WABCO's business processes and operations worldwide through services that are optimally leveraged and shared within our own organization and connected with suppliers, customers and others. 
Our global sales organization hosts application engineers that are based near customers in different regions around the world and are partially resident at some customer locations. We also have significant resources in best cost countries where we perform functions such as drawings, testing and software component development. We operate test tracks in Germany and India as well as in Finland for extreme weather-proving conditions.
Joint Ventures
We use joint ventures globally to expand and enhance our access to customers. Our important joint ventures are: 

• | A majority-owned joint venture (90%) in Japan with Sanwa-Seiki (WABCO Japan, Inc.) that distributes WABCO's products in the local market.


• | A majority-owned (70%) manufacturing partnership in the United States with Cummins Engine Co. (WABCO Compressor Manufacturing Co.) formed to produce air compressors designed by WABCO.


• | A majority-owned joint venture (70%) with Guangdong FUWA Heavy Industry Co., Ltd., (FUWA) formed to produce air disc brakes for commercial trailers in China. FUWA is the largest manufacturer of commercial trailer axles in China and in the world.


• | A 50% owned joint venture in Germany with Wurth Group (WABCOWURTH Workshop Services GmbH) that supplies commercial vehicle workshops, fleet owners and operators and end users internationally with multi-brand technology diagnostic systems.


• | A 50% owned partnership in North America with Meritor, Inc. (Meritor WABCO) that markets ABS and other vehicle control products.


• | A 49% owned partnership in South Africa with Sturrock & Robson Ltd (WABCO Automotive South Africa), a distributor of braking systems products.

Employees 
We have 12,860 employees. Approximately 46% of our employees are salaried and 54% are hourly. Approximately 49% of our workforce is in Europe, 44% is in Asia, and the remaining 7% is in the Americas. As discussed above in "Manufacturing and Operations", in 2015, we announced restructuring proposals to cease manufacturing at two of our production facilities, which would result in a total reduction in workforce of approximately 320 employees.
Employees located in our sites in Europe, Asia and South America are subject to collective bargaining, with internal company agreements or external agreements or laws at the region or country level. Currently approximately 50% of our workforce is covered by collective bargaining agreements. The employees' right to strike is typically protected by law and union membership is confidential information which does not have to be provided to the employer. The collective bargaining agreements are typically renegotiated on an annual basis. Our U.S. facilities are non-union. We have maintained good relationships with our employees around the world and historically have experienced very few work stoppages.

Intellectual Property
Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations, and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities, and monitor the intellectual property claims of others. 
We own a large portfolio of patents that principally relate to our products and technologies, and we have, from time to time, licensed some of our patents. Patents for individual products and processes extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. 
We protect our brands by trademark registrations in key markets in which our products are sold. Such trademark protections apply to our generic brands like the WABCO brand as well as many of our product names.
While we consider our patents and trademarks to be valuable assets, we do not believe that our competitive position is materially dependent upon any single patent or group of related patents. At the same time, we recognize that technical leadership is an ongoing pillar of success and our intellectual property portfolio will continue to grow in importance for the company as a whole as a result. We continue to focus on successful patent prosecution and defense, trademark protection and the exploitation and protection of other intellectual property rights.
Environmental Regulation
Our operations are subject to local, state, federal and foreign environmental laws and regulations that govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects and which impose liability for clean-up costs resulting from past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous wastes and environmental compliance. Generally, the international requirements that impact the majority of our operations tend to be no more restrictive than those in effect in the U.S.
Throughout the world, we have been dedicated to being an environmentally responsible manufacturer, neighbor and employer. We have a number of proactive programs in place to minimize our impact on the environment and believe that we are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Manufacturing facilities are audited on a regular basis. Twenty of our manufacturing sites have Environmental Management Systems (EMS), which have been certified as ISO 14001 compliant. In addition, both our test tracks as well as our largest distribution center (DC) have also been certified as ISO 14001 compliant. These sites are those located in:

Campinas, Brazil | Gronau, Germany | Pantnagar, India 
Jinan, China (2 plants) | Mannheim, Germany | Stanowice, Poland 
Qingdao, China | Jeverson, Germany (test track) | Wroclaw, Poland (2 plants) 
Taishan, China | Ambattur, India | Charleston, United States 
Claye-Souilly, France | Jamshedpur, India | Rochester Hills, United States
Meppel, Netherlands | Mahindra World City, India | North Mankato, United States 
Hanover, Germany | Lucknow, India | Pyungtaek, Korea 
Langehagen, Germany (DC) | Chennai, India (test track) | 

A number of our facilities are undertaking responsive actions to address groundwater and soil issues. Expenditures in 2016 to evaluate and remediate these sites were not material, and are also not expected to be material in 2017. Additional sites may be identified for environmental remediation in the future, including properties previously transferred and with respect to which the Company may have contractual indemnification obligations.

The Separation of WABCO from Trane
The spin-off by Trane of its Vehicle Control Systems business became effective on July 31, 2007, through a distribution of 100% of the common stock of WABCO to Trane's shareholders (the Distribution). The Distribution was effected through a separation and distribution agreement pursuant to which Trane distributed all of the shares of WABCO common stock as a dividend on Trane common stock, in the amount of one share of WABCO common stock for every three shares of outstanding Trane common stock to each shareholder on the record date. Trane received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and an opinion from tax counsel indicating that the spin-off was tax free to the shareholders of Trane and WABCO.
