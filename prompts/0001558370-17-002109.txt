 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 General
 We are a leading authority on helping men dress for work, special occasions and everyday life. We serve our customers through an expansive omni-channel network that includes over 1,600 locations in the U.S. and Canada as well as our branded e-commerce websites.    Our Brands and Products
 Our U.S. retail stores are operated under the Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank, Joseph Abboud and K&G brand names and are operated in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our Canadian stores are operated under the Moores brand name and operate in 10 Canadian provinces. As of January 28, 2017, the Company operated 1,667 stores including tuxedo shops within Macy’s stores throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada.  In addition, at January 28, 2017, we operated 39 retail dry cleaning, laundry and heirlooming facilities through MW Cleaners in Texas. These operations comprise our retail segment.
 On June 18, 2014, the Company acquired Jos. A. Bank Clothiers, Inc. (“Jos. A. Bank”), a men’s specialty apparel retailer for approximately $1.8 billion. For additional information, see Note 2, “Acquisition”, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
 We also own and operate a factory located in New Bedford, Massachusetts that manufactures quality U.S. made tailored clothing under the Joseph Abboud and Reserve labels including designer suits, tuxedos, sport coats and slacks that we sell in our Men’s Wearhouse or Jos. A. Bank stores as well as our Joseph Abboud flagship store and via our e-commerce websites.  We also sell Joseph Abboud branded tailored clothing in our Moores stores, which is produced by a third party in Canada.
 Additionally, we operate an international corporate apparel business.  Our UK‑based business is the largest provider of corporate apparel in the United Kingdom (“UK”) under the Dimensions, Alexandra and Yaffy brands.  In the U.S., our corporate apparel business operates under the Twin Hill brand name. Our corporate apparel business provides corporate clothing uniforms and workwear to workforces through multiple channels including managed corporate accounts, catalogs and the internet at www.dimensions.co.uk, www.alexandra.co.uk, and www.twinhill.com.

 Retail Segment
 Overview
 In our retail segment, we offer our products and services primarily through our retail brands—Men’s Wearhouse/Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Joseph Abboud, Jos. A. Bank, Moores and K&G—and the internet at www.menswearhouse.com, www.josbank.com, and www.josephabboud.com. Men’s Wearhouse, Moores and K&G each operate as a house of brands carrying a wide selection of exclusive and non‑exclusive merchandise brands. Jos. A. Bank is a branded house where substantially all merchandise is sold under the exclusive Jos. A. Bank label. MW Cleaners is also included in the retail segment as these operations have not had a significant effect on our revenues or expenses. 
 In June 2015, we entered into an agreement with Macy’s, Inc. to operate men’s tuxedo rental shops inside 300 Macy’s department stores. In addition, we agreed to collaborate with Macy’s to develop an online tuxedo rental shop. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 170 tuxedo shops within Macy’s stores under the name “The Tuxedo Shop @ Macy’s.” We are actively engaged in discussions with Macy’s to restructure our agreement.  In the meantime, we have agreed with Macy’s to put the opening of the additional 130 contracted stores on hold while we explore a potentially new model.  Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10‑K, the term “shops within Macy’s stores” is used to describe our business operations with Macy’s.
     During fiscal 2016, we closed 233 stores as part of our store rationalization strategy, which we believe is important to our long‑term profitability as it eliminated underperforming stores and re‑balanced the store fleet and cost structure. In the future, we will continue to monitor our store fleet for opportunities to optimize our cost structure.
 Men’s Wearhouse/Men’s Wearhouse and Tux and Moores
 The Men’s Wearhouse and Moores target the male consumer (25 to 55 years old) by providing a superior level of customer service and offering a broad selection of exclusive and non‑exclusive merchandise brands at regular and sale prices that we believe are competitive with specialty and traditional department stores. Our merchandise includes suits, suit separates, sport coats, slacks, formalwear, business casual, denim, sportswear, outerwear, dress shirts, shoes and accessories in classic, modern and slim fits and in a wide range of sizes including a selection of “Big and Tall” product.
 Although basic styles are emphasized, each season’s merchandise reflects current fit, fabric and color trends. The inventory mix at our Men’s Wearhouse and Moores stores includes business, business casual, casual and formal merchandise designed to meet the demand of our customers. The broad merchandise selection creates increased sales opportunities by permitting a customer to purchase substantially all of his wardrobe and accessory requirements, including shoes, at our retail apparel stores. During fiscal 2016, we also introduced a new collection of custom apparel consisting of suits, sport coats, slacks, shirts, tuxedos and vests, which are personalized to each customer’s specifications. Based on our experience, we believe that the depth of selection of our merchandise offerings provides us with an advantage over most of our competitors.
 We also offer a full selection of tuxedo and suit rental product (collectively, “rental product”) at Men’s Wearhouse and Moores. We believe our rental product broadens our customer base by drawing first‑time and younger customers into our stores and accordingly, our offering includes an expanded merchandise assortment including dress and casual apparel targeted toward the younger customer.
 At January 28, 2017, we operated 715 Men’s Wearhouse retail apparel stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. These stores are referred to as “Men’s Wearhouse stores” or “full line stores” that offer a full selection of retail merchandise and rental product. Men’s Wearhouse stores are primarily located in regional strip and specialty retail shopping centers or in freestanding buildings as we believe that men prefer direct and easy store access that enables our customers to park near the entrance of the store.
 At January 28, 2017, we also operated another 58 stores in 24 states branded as Men’s Wearhouse and Tux. These stores are referred to as “rental stores” and offer a full selection of rental product and a limited selection of retail merchandise, and are located primarily in regional malls and lifestyle centers. During fiscal 2016, we closed 102 Men’s Wearhouse and Tux stores, consistent with our strategy to shift rental revenues to our full line stores located in close proximity to the rental stores. 
 At January 28, 2017, we operated 126 Moores retail apparel stores in 10 Canadian provinces. Moores stores are primarily located in regional strip and specialty retail shopping centers.
 Jos. A. Bank
 Jos. A. Bank targets the male consumer (25 to 55 years old) emphasizing high quality tailored, business casual, casual, and formal clothing and accessories, substantially all of which is sold under our exclusive Jos. A. Bank label. Jos. A. Bank merchandise consists of suits, suit

separates, sport coats, slacks, formalwear, business casual, denim, sportswear, outerwear, dress shirts, shoes and accessories in primarily classic styles and in a wide range of sizes including a selection of “Big and Tall” product. Although the target gender and age are similar to Men’s Wearhouse, based on information from our loyalty programs, we believe that there is minimal overlap between the Jos. A. Bank customer and the Men’s Wearhouse customer.  
 Our merchandising strategy is focused on classic styling with attention to detail in quality materials and workmanship. During fiscal 2016, we also introduced custom apparel consisting of suits, sport coats, slacks, shirts, tuxedos and vests, which are personalized to each customer’s specifications. Based on our experience, we believe that the depth of selection of our merchandise offerings provides us with an advantage over most of our competitors.
 We also offer rental product at Jos. A. Bank. We believe our rental product provides the opportunity to broaden our customer base by drawing first‑time and younger customers into our stores.
 The underlying rationale of our acquisition of Jos. A. Bank was our desire to increase our market share and capture operational efficiencies. As our understanding of the Jos. A. Bank business grew, we concluded that the historical promotional model at Jos. A. Bank had been delivering diminishing returns over time, and we realized that attaining satisfactory profitable revenue synergies was going to require eliminating the most excessive promotional offers.  As a result, during the latter half of fiscal 2015, we transitioned away from Jos. A. Bank’s historical promotional cadence by removing the most excessive offers (the Buy‑One‑Get‑Three or more Free events), and began seeking sustainable volume and margin growth.
 While we expected some top‑line volatility as we changed the promotional model, we did not anticipate that the impact on top‑line sales from the traffic decline would occur to the degree it did. As a result of the steep decline in Jos. A. Bank’s sales and the significant decline in our market capitalization, we recorded $1.24 billion of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges related to Jos. A. Bank in fiscal 2015. We remain confident that Jos. A. Bank offers a longer‑term opportunity to profitably grow market share in the menswear business and the Jos. A. Bank brand is a key part of our overall business strategy.
 At January 28, 2017, we operated 506 Jos. A. Bank retail apparel stores in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Jos. A. Bank stores are primarily located in fashion‑oriented, specialty retail centers. In addition, as of January 28, 2017, there are 14 franchise stores. During fiscal 2016, we closed 75 Jos. A. Bank full line and 47 Jos. A. Bank factory stores as part of our strategy to reengineer the Jos. A. Bank brand to a long-term, sustainable profit model. See “Business Strategy” for additional information on the performance of our Jos. A. Bank brand in 2016 and strategic initiatives for 2017 and beyond.
 K&G
 K&G stores offer a more value‑oriented superstore approach that we believe appeals to the more price‑sensitive customer in the apparel market. K&G offers first‑quality, current‑season apparel and accessories comparable in quality to that of traditional department stores, at prices we believe are typically up to 60% below the regular prices charged by such stores. K&G’s merchandising strategy emphasizes broad assortments across all major categories of both men’s and women’s career and casual apparel in a wide range of sizes including “Big and Tall” and “Women’s plus sizes” as well as tailored clothing, dress furnishings, sportswear, accessories and shoes and children’s apparel. This merchandise selection, which includes exclusive and non‑exclusive merchandise brands, positions K&G to attract a wide range of customers in each of its markets.
 At January 28, 2017, we operated 91 K&G stores in 27 states, 86 of which offer women’s career apparel, sportswear, accessories and shoes and children’s apparel. K&G stores are “destination” stores located primarily in second generation strip shopping centers that are easily accessible from major highways and thoroughfares.

 Business Strategy
 Our near‑term business strategy includes:

· | accelerating our turnaround efforts at Jos. A. Bank and reinvigorating Men’s Wearhouse;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | enhancing our omni‑channel capabilities; and
--+---------------------------------------------


· | expanding our portfolio of exclusive offerings.
--+------------------------------------------------

  Accelerating Our Turnaround Efforts at Jos. A. Bank and Reinvigorating Men’s Wearhouse
 During fiscal 2016, our turnaround efforts at Jos. A. Bank began to gain traction. Our 1905 collection, launched in late 2015, which features updated stylings and fits that target a younger customer has been well received and is a potential driver of future growth.  During fiscal 2016, we also launched a Jos. A. Bank collection called Reserve that features classic styles, luxury fabrics and updated fits targeting the premium customer, which has also been well received.  Additionally, we recently expanded the Reserve offering to include a custom tailored clothing and dress shirt offering with extensive fabric and styling options.  Along with the changes to our promotional and merchandising strategies, we have new selling techniques and a new store compensation program that align incentives with the improved selling behaviors and we are encouraged by the customer’s response to these initiatives.  
 During fiscal 2016, the challenging retail environment resulted in soft traffic at all of our retail brands but our consolidated results were more significantly impacted by the comparable sales decrease at our Men’s Wearhouse brand.  Accelerating our turnaround efforts at Jos. A. Bank and reinvigorating the Men’s Wearhouse brands involve similar strategies. Our primary strategy for both brands is to engage more customers across all channels and to drive customer traffic.  For example, we are shifting our marketing strategies to emphasize reasons why men should shop with us.  We will also be dedicating a greater share of our marketing mix to digital channels to target the millennial generation.  In addition, we are focused on improving our omni-channel strategies, as described in more detail below, to provide our customers with more options to make their shopping experience easy.  We also plan to promote our loyalty programs to encourage new members and entice existing members to shop with us more frequently. Through our loyalty programs, we reward our loyal customers and are able to leverage the data our customers share with us to deliver a relevant and engaging experience that considers their lifestyles and preferences.  Finally, we will continue to focus on our in-store experience to promote a more engaged, personalized shopping experience by leveraging our wardrobe consultants to help men create their personal style and become the authority on helping men dress for work, special occasions and everyday life.  
 Enhancing Our Omni‑channel Capabilities
 Our future growth plans continue to include the integration of digital technologies to provide a sales experience that combines the advantages of our physical store with an information-rich online shopping experience through our website and mobile applications. For example, at Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank stores, if a customer wants to purchase an item that is not available at the store, our clothing consultants can order it through our websites to fulfill the customer’s purchasing needs. In addition, during fiscal 2015, we launched our ship from store initiative, which further enhanced our customer’s online shopping experience. During fiscal 2016, we relaunched our Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank websites to provide improved functionality, particularly for customers using mobile devices, and expanded our distribution center in Houston, Texas, facilitating our ability to achieve same-day-shipping for most Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank orders.  Lastly, through our websites we are able to offer international shipping to over 100 countries. Our customers expect to shop wherever and however they like across all channels in a seamless, connected way.  In 2017, we plan to accelerate our efforts to translate our high-service in-store experience online and to drive additional traffic to our stores to further enhance our omni-channel capabilities.  We plan to continue to make investments in technologies, business processes and personnel intended to deepen our customer relationships and increase our share of their closet. Expanding Our Portfolio of Exclusive Offerings
 We believe that expanding the number of exclusive offerings that we carry will increase our margins and profitability. We own and operate a factory that manufactures quality U.S. made tailored clothing under the Joseph Abboud and Reserve labels including designer suits, tuxedos, sport coats and slacks that we sell in our Men’s Wearhouse or Jos. A. Bank stores as well as our Joseph Abboud flagship store.  In addition, we have a consulting agreement with Joseph Abboud pursuant to which he was named our Chief Creative Director and engaged to create exclusive brands and products for our customers. 
 In fiscal 2015, we launched an exclusive designer men’s clothing line through a partnership with Kenneth Cole, under the “Awearness Kenneth Cole” label at Men’s Wearhouse. The collection includes ties, dress shirts, suits, sport coats, dress pants and watches.  A contribution 

 
  6

 
from all "Awearness Kenneth Cole" products sold goes toward helping veterans transition back into the workforce. In fiscal 2016, we expanded our partnership with Kenneth Cole to introduce products with innovative performance features under the Kenneth Cole AWEAR-TECH brand.  
 In fiscal 2016, we expanded our custom clothing offerings by introducing a new line of custom suits and shirts at Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores with affordable price points as well as introducing a premium custom offering at our Jos. A. Bank brand.  Our custom clothing offering is designed to personalize the shopping experience and to foster a long-term relationship with our customers.  In 2017, we plan to accelerate the growth of the custom clothing business by building awareness through marketing strategies.
 Customer Service and Marketing
 Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores sales personnel are trained as consultants to provide customers with assistance and advice on their apparel needs, including product style, color coordination, fabric choice and garment fit. Wardrobe consultants are encouraged to offer guidance to the customer at each stage of the decision‑making process, making every effort to earn the customer’s confidence and to create a professional relationship that will continue beyond the initial visit.
 K&G stores are designed to allow customers to select and purchase apparel by themselves. For example, each merchandise category is clearly marked and organized by size, and suits are specifically tagged as a means of further assisting customers to easily select their styles and sizes. K&G employees are also available to assist customers with merchandise selection, including correct sizing.
 Substantially all of our retail apparel stores offer tailoring services to facilitate timely alterations at a reasonable cost to customers. Tailored clothing purchased at a Men’s Wearhouse store will be pressed and re‑altered free of charge for the life of the garment (if the alterations were performed at a Men’s Wearhouse store). In addition, we utilize Company‑owned regional tailor shops, which receive merchandise from stores to perform tailoring services and return the merchandise to the selling store for customer pickup.
 We offer our “Perfect Fit” loyalty program to our Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux and Moores customers. In October 2015, we launched the “Bank Account” loyalty program for Jos. A. Bank customers, which offers the same benefits and operates in the same manner as the “Perfect Fit” loyalty program. Under the loyalty programs, customers receive points for purchases. Points are equivalent to dollars spent on a one‑for‑one basis, excluding any sales tax dollars. Upon reaching 500 points, customers are issued a $50 rewards certificate that they may use to make purchases at our stores or online. All customers who register for our loyalty programs are eligible to participate and earn points for purchases. A majority of the sales transactions in fiscal 2016 at our Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux and Moores stores were to customers who participated in our loyalty program. We believe that the loyalty programs facilitate our ability to cultivate long‑term relationships with our customers.
 Our advertising strategy primarily consists of television, email, online (including social media), mobile, direct mail, telemarketing and bridal shows. We consider our integrated efforts across these channels to be the most effective means of both attracting and reaching potential new customers, as well as reinforcing the positive attributes of our various brands with our existing customer base. In addition, for Jos. A. Bank, we periodically distribute a catalog to communicate the Jos. A. Bank image, to provide customers with fashion guidance in coordinating outfits and to generate traffic in all of Jos. A. Bank’s sales channels.
 Purchasing and Distribution
 For the Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores brands and, to a lesser extent, our K&G brand, our vertical direct sourcing model with third‑party suppliers covers design, product development, manufacturing, testing, quality control, and all necessary logistics required to get merchandise from the factory to the sales floor. We purchase merchandise and rental product from a broad supplier base and do not believe that the loss of any supplier would cause a significant negative impact to us. We have no material long‑term merchandise supply contracts and typically transact business on a purchase order‑by‑purchase order basis either directly with manufacturers and fabric mills or with trading companies. We have developed long‑term and reliable relationships with most of our direct manufacturers and fabric mills, which we believe provides stability, quality and price leverage. We also have a subsidiary in Hong Kong to facilitate our sourcing efforts for our products. Furthermore, we work with trading companies that support our relationships with suppliers for our direct sourced merchandise and contract agent offices that provide administrative functions on our behalf. The agent offices provide all quality control inspections and ensure that our operating procedures manuals are adhered to by our suppliers.        In fiscal 2016, our retail brands sourced approximately 69% of direct sourced merchandise from Asia (41% from China) while 11% was sourced in Mexico, 10% in the U.S. (primarily from our U.S. factory), and 10% was sourced in other regions. Substantially all of our foreign purchases are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. All direct sourcing suppliers are expected to adhere to our Supplier Code of Conduct and anti-corruption policy. To oversee compliance, we have a direct sourcing compliance department and we also use the services of an outside audit company to conduct regular supplier audits.

 In 2016, to optimize our shipping and freight costs for our Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank brands, we began the process of transitioning to a regional distribution center approach that will leverage the geographic locations of our main distribution centers in Texas and Maryland as well as the hub facilities described below.  In early 2017, we commenced with our regional distribution center strategy.  Merchandise received into these regional distribution centers is either placed in back‑stock or allocated to a store for shipping. In the majority of our larger markets, we also have separate hub distribution facilities or space within certain stores used as redistribution facilities for their respective areas. Merchandise for Moores is distributed to the stores from our distribution center in Montreal, Quebec. The majority of merchandise for our K&G stores is direct shipped by suppliers to the stores with the remainder of K&G merchandise being managed via a third‑party logistics firm. 
 Our rental product is located in our Houston, Texas distribution center and in six additional distribution facilities located in the U.S. (five) and Canada (one). The six additional distribution facilities also receive limited quantities of retail product, primarily formalwear accessories, that is sold in our Men’s Wearhouse/Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Moores and Jos. A. Bank stores.
 All retail merchandise and new rental product transported from suppliers to our distribution facilities is done so via common carrier or on a dedicated fleet of long‑haul vehicles. This dedicated fleet is also used to transport product from our distribution centers to the hub facilities and a fleet of leased or owned smaller vehicles is used to transport product from the hub facilities to our stores within a given geographic region.
 Competition
 We compete against a broad spectrum of other men’s clothing stores. Our primary competitors include traditional department stores, other specialty men’s clothing stores, online retailers, online tuxedo rental providers, off‑price retailers, manufacturer‑owned and independently‑owned outlet stores and their e‑commerce channels, and independently owned tuxedo rental stores. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the menswear market are merchandise assortment, quality, value, garment fit, merchandise presentation, store location and customer service, including on‑site tailoring.
 We believe that our merchandise offerings, including exclusive brands and custom clothing, and emphasis on customer service distinguish us from other retailers. Certain of our competitors (principally department stores) may be larger and may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have and therefore may have certain competitive advantages.
 Corporate Apparel 
 Overview
 Our international corporate apparel business operating under the Dimensions, Alexandra and Yaffy brands primarily in the UK and Europe and Twin Hill in the U.S., which provides corporate clothing uniforms and workwear to workforces. We offer our corporate apparel clothing products through multiple channels including managed corporate accounts, catalogs and the internet at www.dimensions.co.uk, www.alexandra.co.uk, and www.twinhill.com. We offer a wide variety of customer branded apparel such as shirts, blouses, trousers, skirts and suits as well as a wide range of other products from aprons to safety vests to high visibility police outerwear. With respect to our managed contracts, we generally provide complete management of our customers’ corporate clothing programs from design, fabric buying, manufacturing, product roll‑outs and ongoing stock replacement and replenishment. Customer Service and Marketing
 Our customer base includes companies and organizations in the airline, retail grocery, retail, banking, distribution, travel and leisure, postal, security, healthcare and public sectors. Sector characteristics and economics tend to impact the corporate wear requirements of our individual customers. For example, retail customers typically have high staff turnover levels resulting in large replenishment volumes and significant seasonal demand, while banking customers generally have lower turnover and replenishment requirements but refresh or rebrand uniforms more frequently. The UK public service sector has historically consisted of fragmented regional authorities although there seems to be a move toward more consolidated sourcing units.
 Our managed contract customers are generally organizations with larger numbers of uniform-wearing employees or those that use uniforms as a form of brand identity. We have long established relationships with many of the UK’s top employers and we currently maintain approximately 30 managed accounts with an average account size greater than 15,000 wearers. In addition, during 2016, we completed the rollout of a large uniform program for approximately 70,000 wearers.  
 Under our managed contracts, we take responsibility for dressing our customers’ employees and are the exclusive supplier of corporate wear to many of our customers. Because of the nature of the managed contract model, we ensure that we are fully involved in all of our customers’ uniform requirements, from daily replenishment requirements to longer term rebranding plans and wider corporate wear strategy. As a result, 

 
  8

 
our relationship and level of interaction with our customers is generally far deeper and more embedded than conventional customer‑supplier relationships.
 Managed contracts are generally awarded through a request for proposal or tender process for multi‑year contracts. Our teams continually monitor market opportunities to obtain access to such contracts. Regular contact with corporate wear buyers is supplemented with mail campaigns, attendance at trade fairs and trade magazine advertisements. From time to time, we provide each managed contract customer with a specific account manager who often works one or two days a week on‑site at our larger customers’ offices. In addition to maintaining customer requirements, the account manager is also responsible for suggesting and implementing ways of improving the customer’s corporate wear process.
 Our catalogs are distributed electronically, via mail and by sales representatives to current and potential customers. The catalogs offer a full range of our products and offer further branding or embellishment of most products ordered. Catalog orders can be placed via phone, mail, fax or direct contact with our sales representatives and, in the U.S., via client‑specific websites. Our UK e‑commerce platforms also allow online ordering via our websites and provide 24‑hour functionality, with a full list of our products and their details. Our typical catalog customers are small to medium sized organizations with a relatively smaller number of employees or organizations where brand differentiation is not imperative.  In addition, we regularly develop dedicated websites for our corporate clients for use by their employees in ordering their company specific corporate wear.
 During fiscal 2016, as a result of the rollout of a large uniform program, we had one customer which accounted for approximately 20% of our total corporate apparel net sales.  However, we do not believe that the loss of any customer would significantly impact us.
 Merchandising
 In our corporate apparel business, we work with our customers to create custom apparel programs designed to support and enhance their respective brands. Our comprehensive apparel collections, including basic apparel categories such as shirts, blouses, trousers, skirts and suits as well as a wide range of other products from aprons to safety vests to high visibility police outerwear, feature designs with sizes and fits that meet the performance needs of our customers’ employees and utilize the latest technology in long‑wearing fabrications. Career wear, casual wear and workwear make up an increasingly significant portion of the product mix as service industry customers continue to grow.
 Under our managed contracts, our customers receive a full range of services including design, fabric buying and manufacturing, measuring and sizing, employee database management and replenishment forecasting, supply chain management and distribution and logistics of finished products. Customers work with our in‑house design and technical teams to design and develop uniforms or other corporate wear that creates strong brand identity. We utilize our management information and garment tracking system to highlight trends, identify issues and provide benchmark data for the customer at all levels from individual wearer to enterprise‑wide. This system also allows us to identify potential cost savings and develop solutions on behalf of our customers and to respond quickly to trends or other changing needs.
 With respect to our UK catalog and internet operations, customers can design an off‑the‑rack program that provides custom alterations and embroidery on any of our standard, ready‑to‑wear clothing. We work with such customers to create a distinctive, branded program that may include the addition of a company logo or other custom trim.
 Purchasing and Distribution
 Most corporate apparel garment production is outsourced to third‑party manufacturers and fabric mills through our direct sourcing programs. We have developed long‑term relationships with most of our direct manufacturers and fabric mills, which we believe provides stability, quality and reliability. We do not have any material long‑term contracts with our suppliers and we do not believe that the loss of any supplier would significantly impact us. We also work with trading companies that support our relationships with our direct source suppliers and with contract agent offices that provide administrative functions on our behalf. In addition, the agent offices assist with quality control inspections and ensure that our operating procedures manuals are adhered to by our suppliers.
 During 2016, approximately 65% of our corporate wear product purchases was sourced in Asia (primarily China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam) while approximately 35% was sourced from Europe and other regions. Our foreign purchases from Asia are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, while our purchases from Europe and other regions are negotiated and paid for in British pounds or Euros.
 To oversee compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, we use internal resources as well as third party companies to audit the factories producing our garments. We strive to work collaboratively with our suppliers to positively influence them to embed compliance into their daily operations.

 Corporate apparel merchandise is received into our distribution facilities located in Long Eaton and Glasgow for the UK operations and Houston, Texas and Bakersfield, California for U.S. operations. Customer orders are dispatched to the customer or individual wearers employed by the customer via common carrier or pursuant to other arrangements specified by the customer.
 Competition
 Our UK corporate apparel group provides workwear and uniforms to more UK employees than any of our corporate apparel competitors, which consist mostly of smaller, niche providers or companies that focus more on catalog business. The U.S. corporate wear market is more fragmented with several U.S. competitors being larger and having more resources than Twin Hill. We believe that the competitive factors in the corporate wear market are merchandise assortment, quality, price, lead times, customer service and delivery capabilities. We believe that our proven capability in the provision of corporate apparel programs to businesses and organizations of all sizes alongside our catalog and internet operations position us well with our existing customers and should enable us to continue to gain new catalog accounts and managed contracts. Seasonality
 Our sales and net earnings are subject to seasonal fluctuations. Our rental revenues are heavily concentrated in the second and third quarters (prom and wedding season) while the fourth quarter is considered the seasonal low point. In addition, Jos. A. Bank has historically experienced increased customer traffic during the holiday season and its increased marketing efforts during the holiday season have historically resulted in sales and net earnings generated in the fourth quarter, which are significantly larger as compared to the other three quarters. This trend did not occur in the fourth quarter of 2015 as a result of our decision to change the brand’s promotional cadence.  However, the trend resumed in 2016 and we expect the trend to continue in the future. With respect to corporate apparel sales and operating results, seasonal fluctuations are not significant but the acquisition of new customers or existing customer decisions to rebrand or revise their corporate wear programs can cause significant variations in period results. Because of these fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year. Trademarks and Service Marks
 We are the owner in the U.S. and selected other countries of the numerous trademarks and service marks including, without limitation, MEN’S WEARHOUSE, MW MEN’S WEARHOUSE (and design), JOS. A. BANK, and JOSEPH ABBOUD and of U.S. and foreign registrations for such marks.  Our rights in the MEN’S WEARHOUSE, JOS. A. BANK, JOSEPH ABBOUD, and other marks and their respective variations are a significant part of our business, as the marks have become well known through our use of the marks in connection with our retail and formalwear rental services and products (both in store and online) and our advertising campaigns.  We are also the owner of various other trademarks and service marks, and corresponding trademark registrations in the U.S., Canada and abroad under which our stores and corporate apparel business operate or which are used to label the products we sell or rent. We intend to maintain and protect our marks and the related registrations.
 We also license the JOSEPH ABBOUD brand to certain third parties for limited products in the U.S. and Canada, and for a broader range of products in select countries abroad.
 We are the licensee for certain designer labels on various products such as men’s suits, men’s formalwear or men’s shirts. We generally pay a royalty for the use of the label, based on cost for the relevant product or a percentage of related sales.
