OVERVIEW

New Developments

On September 8, 2017, Genesis Financial, Inc. (the "Company") entered into a Capital Stock Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement) with EPOINT Payment Corp., a Delaware corporation ("EPOINT"). The anticipated target closing date is no later than February 15, 2018, or such earlier date as may be determined by the parties. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company will proceed to perform its obligations under the Exchange Agreement. For additional details please review the Exchange Agreement filed on our Current Report filed on September 11, 2017.

Following the acquisition of EPOINT and in accordance with the Exchange Agreement's provisions, the Company plans to immediately commence the disposal and discharge of its pre-acquisition assets and the majority of its liabilities. The combined companies will focus their business efforts on financial services delivering a range of products and services including but not limited to, micro credit advances, mobile phone device financing, money transfers, mobile wallet and prepaid debit cards, bill payments, mobile top up, check processing, insurance and travel.

On December 12, 2017, the Company implemented a twenty for one (20:1) reverse split. In this annual report unless otherwise noted, all references to share activity are retrospectively adjusted to post-split figures.

INTRODUCTION. Genesis Financial, Inc. ("GFI") was incorporated in the State of Washington on January 24, 2002 for the purpose of purchasing and reselling seller financed real estate loans (also referred to as "loans" or "real estate notes" or "portfolio"). On January 25, 2016, the Company moved its corporate domicile from Washington State to Wyoming State. All loans purchased or originated, are held for sale, and are carried on the financial statements at cost or fair value, whichever is less. We purchase seller financed real estate loans from sellers directly or from sellers who are introduced to GFI by brokers. When the owner of a real estate loan wishes to sell the loan, the owner may contact a broker or GFI directly. Seller financed real estate loans are originated by the selling owner of real property. This is an unconventional form of financing which does not involve banks or mortgage companies. When we commenced business, we initially focused on purchasing residential and commercial real estate loans and business notes from $25,000 to $250,000 in value, and the brokering of larger transactions. As the business grew, we expanded our services to include larger loans and other forms of cash flow investment instruments.

In 2007, the sub-prime real estate markets started to experience problems, and by mid-2008, the market was in a free-fall. The Company started to experience increased delinquencies, and the collapse of the financial markets eliminated any chance of our payors being able to refinance or sell their properties, which resulted in increased loan defaults and repossessions. Effective January 1, 2009, the Company out-sourced all its operations and servicing functions to reduce expenses during this downturn. Management tightened up the Company's underwriting parameters. Management focused its efforts on maintaining the performing portions of the portfolio, selling repossessed collateral properties, and reducing debt.

INDUSTRY BACKGROUND. Sellers have used real estate notes ever since men started claiming parcels of land as their own. Historically, no market existed for sale of real estate notes, so a holder of a note typically collected the payments from the borrower, and held the note to maturity. It is only in the last 25 years or so that an active market for selling real estate loans on a large scale has developed.

In the latter part of 2008, national economic conditions made any real estate lending very precarious, forcing the Company to againevaluate its business plan. Real estate loans again became our primary target. GFI has been forced to focus its business towards more commercial real estate lending.

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. In this competitive environment, GFI sought to distinguish its offering from those of our competitors through excellent service, rapid customer response, and consistent and fair underwriting evaluations and procedures. We believed that our market focus on superb service and our existing contacts in the industry would provide a sustainable competitive advantage. We also believed that our ability to diversify into other related markets, such as commercial real estate lending, would give us a competitive advantage. From January 1, 2009 through December 31, 2011, the Company out-sourced all its operations and servicing functions to reduce expenses, and further tightened underwriting parameters, while management focused on selling repossessed collateral properties and reducing company debt. We outsourced portfolio management to Genesis Finance Corporation, a company owned and controlled by Mike Kirk, a former executive officer and director of Genesis Financial, Inc.

Since January 1, 2011 the Company has operated with one part time paid employee and outsourcing the portfolio management in exchange for office expenses incurred by Genesis Finance Corporation.

INVESTMENT POLICIES. We purchase seller financed real estate loans, originate commercial real estate loans, and pursue other forms of cash flow instruments that make sense. The real estate loans that we purchase are primarily in the sub-prime market, and may be secured by residential property, commercial property, and/or unimproved land. We will look at each individual loan as a unique opportunity. The principal balance of loans or interests in loans that we purchase is generally discounted to provide us with a target return of 12  15% interest per annum or more and will be secured by real properties. We will evaluate the adequacy of the underlying real property value which will serve as collateral for our purchase on a case by case basis.

This evaluation may include reviewing a property's title report, the loan documentation including payment histories and credit information, when available. We may conduct a physical inspection and may obtain an appraisal of the property's value. The primary factor utilized in the purchase of a seller financed real estate loan is the ratio between the property value and the investment amount that we pay the seller. Based on these factors, we will purchase the loan at a discount to the principal balance. It is managements intent to hold loans for less than a year but due to the economic circumstances, loans many be held for longer periods.

In regard to our commercial lending, GFI focused on "hard money lending" which was typically a short term loan collateralized with non-conforming types of real property with a borrower who may have a compromised credit rating. GFI followed two general underwriting principles in its "hard money" lending, (1) only make a loan if you want to own the collateral and (2) never lend an amount of money which might exceed the price you would be willing to pay for the collateral as a purchaser. Hard money loans are normally equity based, not credit based. GFI originally targeted a 50% maximum loan-to-value ratio.

HISTORICAL INVESTMENT RETURNS. During the past four years our investment returns have been negative when factoring in the non-performing delinquent loans and real estate owned (REO: real estate acquired through a loan foreclosure). Until we are able to sell the REO's we will not be able to determine the actual rates of return. In some geographic regions real estate market values have flattened, or have begun to rise, but in most areas values continue to deflate and sales of REO's remains weak.

MARKETING. We will undertake to maintain our marketing presence through contacts, individual and corporate, made over the previous eleven years.

PRODUCTS. We invest in seller financed real estate loans, originate commercial real estate loans, and pursue other forms of cash flow instruments which we believe will support our investment guidelines.

We may purchase longer term loans (three to five year terms) with the intent to hold until maturity. We may also purchase long term loans or properties with the intent to hold for resale in the future. Should the secondary institutional markets open back up, we may also pursue sales into those markets.

BROKERED LOAN AND REFERRAL FEES. From time to time, we will be presented with residential and commercial financing requests that do not conform to our current investment policies. In these cases, we refer them to other financing sources which may fund the transaction. In such cases, we may earn referral or finders fees for simply referring the prospective transaction. In some cases, we may agree to prepare purchase documents and close the transaction in a "simultaneous closing" in which the funding source remits the purchase funds to the closing agent and pays us the referral fee that we earned on the transaction.

OTHER TYPES OF RESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE LOANS. In most instances, our purchases of seller financed real estate loans involve the purchase of the entire loan balance. In some instances, this method may be modified in various ways to increase our return and/or mitigate our risk.

NON-REAL ESTATE CASH FLOWS. There are a number of cash flow products available to purchase which are not secured by real estate but are paid by credit worthy payors (e.g. annual lottery payments paid by state governments, structured settlements payable by large companies, insurance company annuities paid over time, etc.). Lucrative yields can be earned by purchasing these types of products. The secondary market for these products has been very limited in past years. However, the exodus of investors from the real estate markets has caused these products to become highly desirable, but this elevated competitive interest has driven profitability margins to such a low level that GFI cannot be competitive as a funder. GFI may take advantage of opportunities to broker such products on a case-by-case basis.

INTEREST ONLY AND BALLOON PAYMENT LOANS. From time to time, GFI may purchase loans calling for interest only payments for a stated number of installment periods. Interest only loans may be subject to greater degrees of risk than loans requiring principal and interest payments because the borrower in an interest only contract is not demonstrating a present ability to repay the principal. Similar risks exist in loans with balloon payment obligations. While the risk associated with investment in these types of loans may be higher, GFI believes that it is in a position to control the risk through the underwriting process. When higher risk loans are proposed, our underwriter will adjust pricing or review the collateral position to assess the repayment and collateral value risks. GFI is primarily a collateral based lender, so this type of risk assessment on interest only or balloon payment loans is very similar to the risk assessment undertaken on other seller financed real estate loans and with commercial real estate loans. In many instances, GFI may not have access to borrower credit reports, payment histories or other forms of information available to traditional lenders.

These loans were created through the sale of real estate property between private parties, where the property seller provides the sale financing, rather than the buyer acquiring financing through conventional channels. At some point in time, after the property sale, the seller then decides to sell the loan. The differences in this type of loan from a conventional loan in the secondary markets are:

·
 there is no standardization of documentation; these loans could be secured by a Note and Deed of Trust, Note and Mortgage, or a Real Estate Contract prepared by the seller or his/her attorney.

·
 there is no buyer credit qualifying documentation, as the seller normally did not require any at the time of sale.

·
 there is no appraisal, or other property information that would substantiate the sales price, because the buyer normally would not have required that information at the time of sale.

·
 there is no payment history showing buyer performance, unless the seller has a third-party servicer collecting the payments.

By placing a higher degree of reliance on the collateral offered, the underwriters are able to match the pricing of the transaction and the targeted return with the risk of non-payment. In general, interest only loans will result in a lower loan to value percentage than comparable loans with principal and interest amortization schedules. In present market conditions, loans with balloon payments are viewed as very high risk if the balloon is due within a couple years, as the availability of refinancing is very limited, and many properties have mortgage debt exceeding the present value of the property securing the debt.

SUBMITTING BROKERS QUALIFICATIONS. GFI will be very selective in choosing the brokers from whom it will accept real estate loan submissions. Due to limited personnel resources, and the volatile real estate values, GFI will not accept submissions from unknown or inexperienced brokers. Loan packages must be complete and accurate, and take into account present market conditions and property values. In our opinion, only experienced brokers are capable and reliable for meeting our investment policies. We use brokers who specialize in our type of contract loan products.

COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE LENDING. GFI was a small scale commercial real estate lender prior to 2004, supplementing the Companys seller financed loan acquisitions business. In the latter part of 2004, due to the competitiveness of the seller financed loan market, management decided to expand the Companys efforts in the commercial lending market. Our broker network supplied us with potential borrowers. Since the management and staff of GFI had considerable previous experience with commercial lending, it was a natural and comfortable adjustment. As with any business venture, the Company looked throughout the commercial lending industry for a niche. We determined that GFI was best suited to do Hard Money commercial lending. Hard money lenders focus on those loans which are usually smaller in size, shorter terms (more of an interim financing), often collateralized by non-conforming property types, or the borrowers do not qualify for conventional financing due to credit history problems. Typically, hard money loans command a higher interest rate providing a smaller, high cost-of-funds lender like GFI with the opportunity to earn a favorable return on investment.

Although hard money loans carry a higher degree of risk due to the non-conforming nature of the loans, that risk is partially offset with the lower loan-to-value ratios, which seldom exceed 60%, providing a collateral cushion for the lender if the property were to be repossessed and resold. Throughout 2008, as real estate values throughout the nation continued to decline, it became apparent that loan to value ratios as low as even 50% - 60% were insufficient to provide that cushion for the lender, because values had dropped in some geographic areas as much as 50% - 70%. As of December 31, 2012 it appears that the market has stabilized.

COMPETITION. When GFI formally entered the hard money markets in the latter half of 2004, the market was very competitive and fragmented. Most hard money lenders operated on a local basis limiting their lending to borrowers and collateral properties located a short distance from their base of operations. They also marketed only to the retail market, ignoring brokers and dealing directly with the borrowers.

Beginning in late 2007, we noticed that some of the commercial lenders were cutting back and tightening their lending parameters. Some were even exiting the business, or closing operations due to high delinquencies and repossessions. By the end of 2010, a large percentage of the lenders had exited the business or suspended operations, and virtually every remaining commercial real estate lender had severely tightened their parameters. The Company expects this trend to continue.

MARKET ANALYSIS. The hard money market was quite strong in 2004, at the time of the Companys increased focus in making these loans, and continued that way throughout 2006. Frequent foreclosure litigation and collateral repossessions are an expected part of the hard money industry, in contrast to the conventional markets. With the exception of those few transactions with unusual circumstances affecting the outcome, most problem loans were eventual settled and the Company experienced a loss.

In 2007, the Company started to experience increased delinquencies, primarily due to a slow-down in the borrowers business, resulting in reduced cash flows. The prior workouts that resulted in a payoff before repossession declined dramatically. This appeared to be due to the fact that the borrowers could not refinance their collateral properties, nor could they sell their properties to pay off the loan. This resulted in more repossessions, and the Company learned that it could not sell those repossessed properties as easily or for their appraised values.

From December 31, 2007 through December 31, 2010 the real estate markets throughout the country were experiencing dramatic down-turns in values, and at the same time the lending markets were tightening up making refinancing very difficult, regardless of the property type. The Company was experiencing increasing delinquencies resulting in increased foreclosure litigation expense and eventual collateral repossession. In several cases, it was apparent that the value of the collateral had dropped below the principal loan balance which indicated the potential for significant future financial losses. The Company is currently concentrating on the collection and liquidation of prior loans and real estate and is making few new loans.

On January 1, 2009, management decided to make some major adjustments to the Companys business plans. These adjustments included: overhead expense reduction by outsourcing the day-to-day operations of the Company, focus on reducing the Companys debt through a restructuring of terms with our credit facilitators, to pursue the sale of Company assets, to continue acquisitions and originations only on pre-sold loans, focus on managing delinquent accounts through increased collection activity and workouts, increase the focus on maintenance and resale of REO assets, and diversify asset acquisitions into non-real estate assets. 

As of January 1, 2011, the Company had down-sized enough to manage a sizable portion of its own affairs and renegotiated its outsourcing agreement with Genesis Finance Corporation by lowering the monthly fee. As of January 1, 2012 the monthly fee was terminated and the outsourcing services were offset by general office expenses paid by the Company on behalf of Genesis Finance Corporation, a company owned by Michael A. Kirk, an affiliate of Genesis Financial, Inc. On January 1, 2011, GFI hired one employee, Virginia Walters, to manage its affairs going forward.

As a result of the poor economic conditions and declining real estate values, GFI was compelled to seek out additional avenues to build shareholder value. Management believed that investments in local startup companies could prove to be a good investment for the Company and provide an avenue of diversification. 

As part of the diversification plan the Company invested a portion of its assets in privately held companies as follows:

Flyback Energy, Inc.:

On November 23, 2010, the Company closed the purchase of an equity interest in Flyback Energy, Inc. (FEI), for $1,200,000. The purchase was for 2,666,667 shares of Series B Preferred Stock from Flyback Energy, Inc., a closely held Washington corporation payable on an installment basis. On April 25, 2011, the Company purchased 85,274 shares of Series C Preferred Stock for $50,000 which is convertible at $0.60 per share and bears a 5% dividend rate.

The Flyback Series "B" Preferred shares are convertible into Flyback common shares on a one for one (1:1) basis and the conversion pricing is subject to adjustments for certain diluting issues of common stock, subdivisions or combinations of common stock, reclassifications, exchanges and/or substitutions of stock. The Company is due 421,480 shares of common stock because of the dilution provision.

Flyback Energy, Inc. is a privately-held company that has developed a unique and proprietary electronic switch design that offers control over electrical power and magnetic fields.

The founders of Flyback Energy, Inc. have solved an electromagnetic energy loss problem. They focused their research on totally controlling the rise and collapse of magnetic fields present in inductive circuits, equipment and processes. After years of methodical experimentation, the Flyback team has created and patented practical breakthrough magnetic energy recovery (MER) technology.

With this patented technology, Flyback Energy is actively developing reliable products to capture and recover magnetic energy losses and then insert that otherwise wasted energy back into the power circuit. The Flyback technology also mitigates problematic harmonic resonance, electromagnetic interference (EMI), excessive heat and other induction issues.

This technology provides control of induction and resistive devices, and power conversion processes between AC and DC electrical systems. Flyback solutions result in lower energy cost, cooler operating temperatures and longer useful life for lighting system components, transformers, motors and controllers.

Flybacks Magnetic Energy Recovery technology creates value across a wide range of electromagnetic applications. Most electrical input supply can be cost effectively switched and controlled, including such traditional sources as AC grid power, fuel-fired and hydro-generated power, and DC sources such as solar cells, wind generation and battery arrays. Flyback is currently developing products to serve a special purpose  where energy savings and high electrical efficiency are valued.

Genesis Financial, Inc. reduced the carrying value of its Flyback Energy common shares to $0.067 per share, the last known arms length common share sale. Flyback Energy, Inc. is still a development stage company being financed by outside sources of capital. At this time, we believe the Flyback has some financing capital to develop certain defined products.

Digi Outdoor Media, Inc.

In 2014, the Company loaned Placer Creek Mining Company (Placer) $150,000. The loan interest rate was 5.0% and the Company has an option to convert any or all of the amount due into an equity private placement of Placer. The Placer transaction was a related party transaction. (see Note 11:Michael Lavigne)

On February, 24, 2015, the Company converted the note into 300,000 shares of common stock of Digi Outdoor Media, Inc. (Digi), the successor in interest to Placer. The Company determined that the fair value of the shares received on the conversion to be $150,000 based upon the note receivable balance of $150,000 because Digi is not publicly traded and has had no recent cash sale of its common stock. 

Digi Outdoor Media, Inc. is a startup company in the business of building and leasing outdoor advertising signs.

On December 31, 2017, the Company due to legal action concerning Digi Outdoor Media booked an impairment charge of $150,000 to reduce the carrying value to $-0-.

Ambient Water Corporation (Formerly AWG International Water Corp.):

The Ambient Water Corporation is located in Spokane, Washington. In 2010 and 2011, the Company purchased a total of 7,380,433 common shares of the Ambient Water Corporation common stock for $500,000, at that time the purchase represented approximately 10% of the total outstanding shares. 

On May 19, 2016, by board action, the Company sold its interest in Ambient Water Corporation to John R. Coghlan (see Note 11) for $0.0003 per share, the fair value of the stock on the day of sale, $2,213, resulting in a recognized loss of $497,787. 

Rental Properties: 

At the end of 2013, the Company foreclosed a $85,534 loan held for sale in Lebanon, Oregon through the bankruptcy courts, the property is currently being operated as Duffys Bar. The bar was subsequently leased on a three (3) year lease agreement for $1500 per month, with the tenant paying all utilities and insurance. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017, the company recognized $18,000 and $3,000 in rental income. This is a commercial building being depreciated over thirty-nine (39) years. Depreciation accrues at $179 per month. The company recorded depreciation of $2,143 and $-0- for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2017. On March 8, 2017, by board action, the Company sold this property to Coghlan Family Corporation for $77,585, resulting in a gain on sale of $342. 

In September 2016, the Company foreclosed on a loan previously held for sale in Lewiston, Idaho through the bankruptcy courts, the property is being operated as Emperor of Indian restaurant. The property was placed into real estate owned during the six month ended June 30, 2016. It was held at a net carrying value of $69,761. The restaurant was subsequently leased on a two year lease agreement for $1,200 per month with an option to purchase for $45,000. During the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2017 the company recognized $2,175 and $8,925 in rental income. Fair value of the property was determined to be $45,000 on the date of transfer based on appraisal and contract terms of the lease. This is a commercial building being depreciated over thirty-nine (39) years. The Company recorded depreciation of $692 and $577 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2017. On July 17, 2017, by board action, the Company sold this property to Coghlan Family Corporation for $30,000, resulting in a loss of ($17,670).

Real Estate Leasehold Interest:

Halliday, North Dakota: During 2013 the Company completed the acquisition of a real property leasehold interest that consists of approximately 63 acres in the city of Halliday, North Dakota. The lease term is fifteen (15) years and commenced on September 15, 2012. The Company has an option to renew the lease for an additional 15 year term. Presently, the property consists of fifty (50) residential type lots. The monthly rent on the lease is Fifty ($50.00) Dollars for each occupied and rented trailer, cabin or lot. The Company is obligated to pay any and all real and personal property taxes, general taxes, special assessments and other charges levied against the property and its improvements. During the lease term, the Company will own title to all of the improvements and personal property. At the expiration of the lease or termination, all improvements and personal property located on the premises will revert to the Lessors.
Limited Liability Corporations:

In 2013, the Company formed Hermiston 353, LLC to hold real property interests resulting from a loan foreclosure with multiple note interest holders of which Genesis holds a 13.1% interest valued at $54,691 as of December 31, 2017. In 2014, the Company formed North Edwards 435, LLC, another REO purposed entity to hold the real property interests resulting from a loan foreclosure with multiple note interest holders. The Company's interest in North Edwards is 31.95% valued at $48,894 as of December 31, 2017. The LLCs are passive investments which each hold a single real estate REO property for sale. 

DEFAULT PROCEDURES. Loans will be sold after short holding periods and defaults going forward are expected to be minimal. Some defaults will occur, however and we will take steps after we become aware of the default to protect our interests. GFI operates under the policy that any loan payment over 90 days delinquent is a loan default. In a default situation, we will pursue one or more of the following alternatives: discussion with the submitting broker, if any, concerning ways to remedy the default; an offer to re-write or modify the loan for the borrower/buyer as a means to cure the default, provided good evidence is available that the modification will be honored by the borrower/buyer; sale of the loan with the delinquency disclosed (possibly at a loss); acceptance of a property deed in lieu of foreclosure; and/or foreclosure and REO property sale. 

SECONDARY MARKET RESALES

OVERVIEW. Since inception, GFI has purchased loans and originated loans with the goal of resale to various secondary market and private investors. GFI attempts to resell the loans as soon as possible with a view toward optimizing gains on resale. With the elimination of the secondary market and the participating secondary market buyers, the primary buyers have been accredited private investors. The Company feels that these conditions will continue for the foreseeable future, but will continue to monitor the financial markets. We will continue to establish new relationships with any secondary market buyers as they become available.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Commercial real estate lending does not require special licensing and is not subject to governmental regulation. GFI does not originate residential loans and therefore is not subject to governmental regulation as a lender, bank, mortgage broker, or other regulated financial institution. Our business focuses on transactions that are not subject to governmental regulation and we intend to maintain this business focus for the foreseeable future.
EMPLOYEES

As of December 31, 2017 the Company had one part-time employee Virginia Walters.
