Organization
 Farmers Capital Bank Corporation (the “Registrant,” “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “Parent Company”) is a financial holding company which had one wholly-owned subsidiary bank, United Bank & Capital Trust Company (“United Bank” or the “Bank”) in Frankfort, KY, at year-end 2017. The Registrant was originally formed as a bank holding company under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, on October 28, 1982 under the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky (“Commonwealth”). During 2016, the Company elected financial holding company status. The Company’s bank subsidiary, United Bank, provides a wide range of banking and bank-related services to customers throughout Central and Northern Kentucky. In February 2017, the Company merged three of its subsidiary banks (United Bank & Trust Company [“United Versailles”] in Versailles, KY; First Citizens Bank, Inc. [“First Citizens”] in Elizabethtown, KY; and Citizens Bank of Northern Kentucky, Inc. [“Citizens Northern”] in Newport, KY) and its data processing subsidiary (FCB Services, Inc. [“FCB Services”] in Frankfort, KY) into its subsidiary bank Farmers Bank & Capital Trust Company (“Farmers Bank”) in Frankfort, KY, the name of which was immediately changed under the merger to United Bank & Capital Trust Company.
 
At year-end 2017 the Company had the following wholly-owned nonbank subsidiaries: FFKT Insurance Services, Inc., (“FFKT Insurance”), Farmers Capital Bank Trust I (“Trust I”), and Farmers Capital Bank Trust III (“Trust III”). FFKT Insurance is a captive property and casualty insurance company in Frankfort, Kentucky. Trust I and Trust III are unconsolidated trusts established to complete the private offering of trust preferred securities. For Trust I and Farmers Capital Bank Trust II (“Trust II”), the proceeds of the offerings were used to finance the cash portion of the acquisition in 2005 of Citizens Bancorp Inc. (“Citizens Bancorp”), the former parent company of Citizens Northern. In January 2016, the Company terminated Trust II as a result of the early extinguishment of debt. For Trust III, the proceeds of the offering were used to finance the cost of acquiring Company shares under a share repurchase program during 2007.
 
The Company provides a broad range of financial services at its 34 locations in 21 communities throughout Central and Northern Kentucky to individual, business, agriculture, governmental, and educational customers. Its primary deposit products are checking, savings, and term certificate accounts. Its primary lending products are residential mortgage, commercial lending, and consumer installment loans. Substantially all loans are secured by specific items of collateral including business assets, consumer assets, and commercial and residential real estate. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid from cash flow from operations of businesses. Other services provided by the Company include, but are not limited to, cash management services, issuing letters of credit, safe deposit box rental, and providing funds transfer services. The Company has other financial instruments, including deposit accounts in other financial institutions and federal funds sold, which could potentially represent a concentration of credit risk.
 
While the chief decision-makers monitor the revenue streams of the various products and services, operations are managed and financial performance is evaluated on a Company-wide basis. Operating segments are aggregated into one as operating results for all segments are similar. Accordingly, all of the financial service operations are considered by management to be aggregated in one reportable segment. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $1.7 billion in consolidated total assets.

United Bank
 United Bank is a state chartered bank originally organized in 1850. In February 2017, the Company merged United Versailles, First Citizens, Citizens Northern, and FCB Services into Farmers Bank, the name of which was immediately changed to United Bank & Capital Trust Company. United Bank is engaged in a wide range of commercial and personal banking activities, which include accepting savings, time and demand deposits; making secured and unsecured loans to corporations, individuals and others; providing cash management services to corporate and individual customers; issuing letters of credit; renting safe deposit boxes; and providing funds transfer services. The bank's lending activities include making commercial, construction, mortgage, and personal loans and lines of credit. The bank serves as an agent in providing credit card loans. It acts as trustee of personal trusts, as executor of estates, as trustee for employee benefit trusts and to a limited extent as registrar, transfer agent and paying agent for bond issues.
United Bank conducts business at its principal office and four branches in Frankfort, the capital of Kentucky, as well as branches in the following counties in Kentucky: Anderson, Boone, Bullitt, Campbell, Fayette, Hardin, Jessamine, Kenton, Mercer, Scott, and Woodford Counties. It is the largest bank operating in Anderson, Franklin and Scott Counties based on total bank deposits. The market served by United Bank is diverse, and includes government, commerce, finance, industry, medicine, education, and agriculture. On December 31, 2017, it had total consolidated assets of $1.6 billion, including loans of $1.0 billion. On the same date, total deposits were $1.4 billion and shareholders' equity totaled $162 million.
 
United Bank also provides bill payment services under the name of FirstNet. This service specializes in federal benefit and military allotment processing. United Bank processes payments to unaffiliated third parties, including those that are initiated under the U.S. military’s allotment system. It processes payments by active duty and retired service members and civilians made to third party lenders. The Company does not provide credit to individuals under the program. Over the last several years it has diversified its customer base to include nonmilitary payment processing, such as for unrelated insurance companies and other service providers. 
 
The military discretionary allotment system in place prior to 2015 allowed service members to automatically direct a portion of their paycheck to financial institutions or individuals of their choosing to pay for various items or services. As announced by the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”), active duty service members are no longer able to enter into new contracts to purchase, lease, or rent tangible consumer items such as vehicles, appliances, and electronics using the military allotment system for payment as of January 1, 2015. Contracts existing prior to January 1, 2015 were not affected. Payments for the purpose of savings, insurance premiums, mortgage and rent payments, support for dependents, or investments were also not affected. The restrictions do not apply to military retirees or civilians.
 
As previously disclosed by the Company, military allotment processing volumes and related revenue began to decline in 2015 as a result of the new DOD policy. This decline has been partially offset by United Bank’s efforts to expand its base of nonmilitary customers.
 
United Bank had three active direct subsidiaries at year-end 2017: Farmers Bank Realty Co. ("Farmers Realty"), Farmers Capital Insurance Corporation (“Farmers Insurance”), and EG Properties, Inc. (“EG Properties”).
 
Farmers Realty was incorporated in 1978 for the purpose of owning certain real estate used by the Company and United Bank in the ordinary course of business. Farmers Realty had total assets of $3.2 million on December 31, 2017.
 
Farmers Insurance was organized in 1988 to engage in insurance activities permitted to the Company under federal and state law. United Bank capitalized this corporation in December 1998. Farmers Insurance acts as an agent for an otherwise unrelated title insurance company and offers title insurance coverage on property financed by the Company. At year-end 2017, it had total assets of $597 thousand.
 
EG Properties was incorporated in November 2002 and is involved in real estate management and liquidation for certain properties repossessed by United Bank.

[“EGT Properties”], HBJ Properties, LLC [“HBJ Properties”], and ENKY Properties, Inc. [“ENKY”]) into EG Properties. EG Properties previously held a 93.4% interest in WCO, LLC (“WCO”), which was formed during 2012 to hold certain real estate repossessed by United Bank and United Versailles. WCO was dissolved during September 2016. EG Properties had total assets of $36.6 million at year-end 2017.

Leasing One Corporation (“Leasing One”) was incorporated in August 1993 to operate as a commercial equipment leasing company. Activity at Leasing One declined significantly as a result of its board deciding in 2010 to reduce staff and curtail new lending. The extent of its activity had been to service existing loans and terming out residuals until it was dissolved effective at year-end 2015.
United Bank previously was a limited partner in Austin Park Apartments, LTD and Frankfort Apartments II, LTD, two low income housing tax credit partnerships located in Frankfort, Kentucky. These investments provided federal income tax credits to the Company over a 10 year period which have since been fully exhausted; however, the Company maintained its investment in these partnerships over a 15 year compliance period in order to avoid possible recapture of the tax credits. The compliance period has since ended and United Bank liquidated its investments in these partnerships during 2016.

Lending Summary
 A significant part of the Company’s operating activities include originating loans, approximately 89% of which are secured by real estate at December 31, 2017. Real estate lending primarily includes loans secured by owner and non-owner occupied one-to-four family residential properties as well as commercial real estate mortgage loans to developers and owners of other commercial real estate. Real estate lending primarily includes both variable and adjustable rate products. Loan rates on variable rate loans generally adjust upward or downward immediately based on changes in the loan’s index, normally prime rate as published by the Wall Street Journal. Rates on adjustable rate loans move upward or downward after an initial fixed term of normally one, three, five, or seven years. Rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans are made annually after the initial fixed term expires and are indexed mainly to shorter-term Treasury indexes. Generally, variable and adjustable rate loans contain provisions that cap the amount of interest rate increases of up to 600 basis points and rate decreases of up to 100 basis points over the life of the loan. In recent years, it has been increasingly common for the Company to set a floor equal to the initial rate without further downward adjustments. In addition to the lifetime caps and floors on rate adjustments, loans secured by residential real estate typically contain provisions that limit annual increases at a maximum of 100 basis points. There is typically no annual limit applied to loans secured by commercial real estate.
 
The Company also makes fixed rate commercial real estate loans to a lesser extent with repayment periods generally ranging from three to seven years. The Bank makes first and second residential mortgage loans secured by real estate not to exceed 90% loan to value without seeking third party guarantees. Commercial real estate loans are made primarily to small and mid-sized businesses, secured by real estate not exceeding 80% loan to value. Other commercial loans are asset based loans secured by equipment and lines of credit secured by receivables and include lending across a diverse range of business types.
 
Commercial lending and real estate construction lending, including commercial leasing, generally includes a higher degree of credit risk than other loans, such as residential mortgage loans. Commercial loans, like other loans, are evaluated at the time of approval to determine the adequacy of repayment sources and collateral requirements. Collateral requirements vary to some degree among borrowers and depend on the borrower’s financial strength, the terms and amount of the loan, and collateral available to secure the loan. Credit risk results from the decreased ability or willingness to pay by a borrower. Credit risk also results when a liquidation of collateral occurs and there is a shortfall in collateral value as compared to a loan’s outstanding balance. For construction loans, inaccurate initial estimates of a project’s costs or the property’s completed value could weaken the Company’s position and lead to the property having a value that is insufficient to satisfy full payment of the amount of funds advanced for the property. Secured and unsecured direct consumer lending generally is made for automobiles, boats, and other motor vehicles. The Company does not presently engage in indirect consumer lending. The Bank’s credit card portfolio was sold during the fourth quarter of 2017. In most cases loans are restricted to the Bank’s general market area.
 
Loan Policy
 The Company has a lending policy in place that is amended and approved from time to time as needed to reflect current economic conditions, law and regulatory changes, and product offerings in its markets. The policy has established minimum standards that its bank subsidiary must adopt. Additionally, the policy is subject to amendment based on positive and negative trends observed within the lending portfolio as a whole. For example, the loan to value limits and amortization terms contained within the policy were reduced during the most recent economic and related real estate market decline. While new appraisals now reflect that decline, appraisal reviews and downward adjustments are a continuing area of focus when evaluating credit risk. The lending policy is evaluated for underwriting criteria by the Company’s internal audit department in its loan review capacity as well as by the Bank’s Chief Credit Officer and its regulatory authorities. Suggested revisions from these groups are taken into account, analyzed, and implemented by management where improvements are warranted.

The Bank’s Chief Credit Officer oversees all lending at the institution where the size and risk of individual credits are deemed significant to the Company. This position also monitors trends in asset quality, portfolio composition, concentrations of credit, reports of examinations, internal audit reports, work-out strategies for large credits, and other responsibilities as matters evolve.
Procedures
 The lending policy lists the products and credit services offered by the Bank. Each product and service has an established written procedure to adhere to when transacting business with a customer. The lending policy also establishes pre-determined lending authorities for loan officers commensurate with their abilities and experience. Further, the policy establishes committees to review and approve or deny credit requests at various lending amounts. This includes subcommittees of the Bank’s board of directors and, at certain lending levels, the entire bank board.
For loan relationships of $2.5 million to $7.5 million, either a subcommittee of the Bank’s board of directors or the board of directors will be presented with the loan request. For loan relationships of $7.5 million and above, the Bank’s full board of directors will be presented with the loan request. This only occurs when the potential credit has first been recommended by the loan officer and the Chief Credit Officer. When loan requests are within policy guidelines and the amount requested is within their lending authority, lenders are permitted to approve and close the transaction. A review of the loan file and documentation takes place within 30 days to ensure policy and procedures are being followed. Approval authorities are under regular review for adjustment by affiliate management and the Parent Company. Loan requests outside of standard policy may be made on a case by case basis when justified, documented, and approved by either the board of directors of the subsidiary bank, committee, or other authorized person as determined by the size of the transaction. Procedures are in place which require ongoing monitoring subsequent to loan approval. For example, updated financial statements are required periodically for certain types of credits and risk ratings are re-evaluated at least annually for credit relationships in excess of $500 thousand, which includes analyzing updated cash flows and loan to value ratios. Certain types of credit relationships of $1.0 million or above receive annual site visits.

However, the Company will also allow non-qualified mortgages with the review and approval of the appropriate loan committee of the Bank.

Loans to financial institutions are generally secured by the capital stock of the financial institution with a loan to value ratio not to exceed 60% and repayment terms not exceeding 10 years. Capital stock values of non-public companies are determined by common metrics such as a multiple of tangible book value or by obtaining third party estimates.

At year-end 2017, loans to financial institutions were zero.
 
Agricultural lending, such as for tobacco or corn, is limited to 75% of expected sales proceeds while lending for cattle and farm equipment is capped at 80% loan to value.

Hybrid Loans
 The Company and the Bank have a policy of not underwriting, originating, selling or holding hybrid loans. The Company does not currently hold hybrid loans. Hybrid loans include payment option adjustable rate mortgages, negative amortization loans, and stated income/stated asset loans.
Appraisals
 The Company uses appraisals to value the collateral securing loans and to help manage credit risk, particularly related to loans secured by real estate. The Company uses independent third party state certified or licensed appraisers. These appraisers take into account local market conditions when preparing their estimate of a property’s fair value. The Company evaluates appraisals it receives from independent third parties subsequent to the appraisal date by monitoring transactions in its markets and comparing them to its other projects that are similar in nature. The Company’s internal audit department reviews appraisals on a test basis to determine that assumptions used in appraisals remain valid and are not stale. New appraisals are obtained if market conditions significantly impact collateral values for those loans that are identified as impaired. Internal audit reviews appraisals related to all of the Company’s impaired loans and repossessed properties at least annually.
 
The Company considers appraisals it receives on one property as a means to extrapolate the estimated value for other collateral of similar characteristics if that property may not otherwise have a need for an appraisal. Should a borrower’s financial condition continue to deteriorate, an updated appraisal on that specific collateral will be obtained.
 
Appraisals obtained for construction and development lending purposes are performed by state licensed or state certified appraisers who are credentialed and on the Company’s approved list. Plans and specifications are provided to the appraiser by bank personnel not directly involved in the credit approval process. The appraisals conform to the standards of appraisal practices established by the Appraisal Standards Board in effect at the time of the appraisal. This includes net present value accounting for construction and development loans on an “as completed” and “as is” basis.
 
Appraisal reviews are conducted internally by bank personnel familiar with the local market and who are not directly involved in the credit approval process and externally by state licensed and certified appraisers. Bank personnel do not increase the valuation from the appraisal but may, in some instances, make a reduction. Upon completion, a follow up site visit by the appraiser is completed to verify the property was improved in accordance with the original plans and specifications and recertify, if appropriate, the original estimate of “as completed” market value. Circumstances where management may make adjustments to appraisals include the following:
 
As discussed above, construction and development appraisals are on an “as completed” basis. If work remains to be completed on a financed project, management will reduce the estimated value in the appraisal by the estimated cost to complete the work and, if required by the loan balance, establish reserves allocated to the loan or write down the loan based on the need to complete such work.
 
If an appraisal for given collateral is still valid (e.g. less than one year old, etc.), but due to market conditions and the bank’s familiarity with comparable property sales in the market the appraised value appears high, management may adjust downward from the last appraisal its estimate of the value of the collateral and, in turn, establish reserves allocated to the loan or write down the loan to reflect this downward adjustment.
 
Certain appraisals, such as for subdivision development and for other projects expected to take over one year to liquidate, are required to include estimated costs to sell. For others, management adjusts the appraised value by the estimated selling costs when they are either absent or not required. Additional reserves or direct write downs are made to the loan to reflect these adjustments.
 
Loan to value ratios are typically well under 100% at inception, which gives the Company a cushion if collateral values fall. However, when updated appraisals reveal collateral exposure (i.e. the value of the collateral for a nonperforming loan is less than originally estimated and no longer supports the outstanding loan amount), negotiations ensue with the borrower aimed at providing additional collateral support for the credit. This may be in many forms as determined by the financial holdings of the borrower. If not available, third party support for the credit is pursued (e.g., guarantors or equity investors). If negotiations fail to provide additional adequate collateral support, reserves are allocated to the loan or the loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral less the estimated costs to sell.

When a construction loan or development loan is downgraded, a new appraisal is ordered contemporaneously with the downgrade. The appraisers are instructed to give a fair value based upon both an “as is” basis and an “as completed” basis. The twofold purpose is to facilitate management’s decision making process in determining the cost benefits of completing a project compared with marketing the project “as is.”
 
The carrying value of a downgraded loan or nonperforming asset wherein the underlying collateral is an incomplete project is based on an updated appraisal at the “as is” value. The current appraisal is a compilation of the most recent sales available and therefore includes the risk premium established by market conditions. When comparable sales are not deemed to be reliable or the adjustments are not satisfactory, management will make appropriate adjustments to the fair value which includes a risk premium (discount) deducted using the discounted cash flow framework. The reserve or write down is expended upon completion of the appraisal and other relevant information assessment.
 
Interest Reserves
 Interest reserves represent funds loaned to a borrower for the payment of interest during the development phase on certain construction and development loans. Interest reserves were a common industry practice when banks were more actively lending and the predictability of a sale or stabilization of the project had a high probability. The interest reserve is a component of the loan proceeds which is determined at the loan’s inception after a full evaluation of the sources and uses of funds for the project, and is intended to match the project’s debt service requirements with its expected cash flows. In all construction lending projects, the Company monitors the project to determine if it is being completed as planned and if sales/stabilization projections are being met.
 
For present and future construction and development loan requests, borrowers must show sufficient cash reserves and significant excess cash flow from all sources in addition to other underwriting criteria measures. A project’s viability is a major consideration as well, along with the probability of its stabilization and/or sale. Interest reserves are primarily used for construction on large commercial, income producing property. Interest reserves on development loans are not commonplace due to the general lack of risk-appropriate opportunities currently in our markets combined with our low desire for this segment of the lending portfolio.
 
Supervision and Regulation
 The Company and its subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive supervision and regulation that affect virtually all aspects of their operations. The laws and regulations are primarily intended for the protection of depositors, borrowers, and federal deposit insurance funds, and, to a lesser extent, for the protection of stockholders and creditors. Changes in applicable laws, regulations, or in the policies of banking and other government regulators may have a material adverse effect on our current or future business. The following discussion is a summary of certain of the more important aspects of the relevant statutory and regulatory provisions and does not purport to be complete nor does it address all applicable statutes and regulations.
Supervisory Authorities
 The Company is a financial holding company, registered with and regulated by the Federal Reserve. Its subsidiary bank, United Bank, is a Kentucky state-chartered bank and a member of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The Company and the Bank are subject to supervision, regulation, and examination by the Federal Reserve, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), and the Kentucky Department of Financial Institutions (“KDFI”). The Company and the Bank are required to file regular reports with the FRB, the FDIC, and the KDFI. The regulatory authorities routinely examine the Company and the Bank to monitor compliance with laws and regulations, financial condition, adequacy of capital and reserves, quality and documentation of loans, payment of dividends, adequacy of systems and controls, credit underwriting, asset liability management, and the establishment of branches.
 
The Company is also subject to disclosure and other regulatory requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended), as administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Regulatory authorities may initiate enforcement proceeding against the Company for violations of laws or regulations, or for engaging in unsafe and unsound practices. Enforcement powers available to the regulatory agencies include the ability to assess civil monetary penalties, issuing cease and desist and similar orders, and initiating injunctive actions.
 
 13



Capital
 The FRB, the FDIC, and the KDFI require the Company and United Bank to meet certain ratios of capital to assets in order to conduct their activities. Current risk-based capital standards are based on the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision final rules issued in December 2010 related to global regulatory standards on bank capital adequacy and liquidity (commonly referred to as “Basel III”) previously agreed on by the Group of Governors and Heads of Supervision (the oversight body of the Basel Committee). U.S. federal banking agencies adopted final rules during 2013 to bring U.S. banking organizations into compliance with Basel III. Under the current rules, which were effective January 1, 2015, the Company is subject to capital requirements that include: (i) creation of a required ratio for common equity Tier 1 (“CET1”) capital, (ii) an increase to the minimum Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio, (iii) changes to risk-weightings of certain assets for purposes of the risk-based capital ratios, (iv) creation of an additional capital conservation buffer in excess of the required minimum capital ratios, and (v) changes to what qualifies as capital for purposes of meeting these capital requirements.
 
Under Basel III, the Company is required to maintain a minimum CET1 ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets. CET1 consists of common stock, related surplus, and retained earnings less certain deductions that primarily include goodwill, other intangible assets, and deferred tax assets. The deductions to CET1 are being phased-in over a four-year period beginning at 40% on January 1, 2015 and an additional 20% per year thereafter.
 
The Company is required to maintain a minimum Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio of 6%, a Total Risk-based Capital ratio of 8%, and a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 4%. Tier 1 Capital consists of common equity and related surplus, retained earnings, and a limited amount of qualifying preferred stock, less goodwill (net of certain deferred tax liabilities) and certain core deposit intangibles. Tier 2 Capital consists of non-qualifying preferred stock, certain types of debt and a limited amount of other items. Total Capital is the sum of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital. Under the capital rules effective January 1, 2015, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive income items (primarily unrealized gains and losses on available for sale investment securities) are not excluded from capital; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including the Company, could make a one-time permanent election to continue excluding these items comparable to their previous treatment. The Company made this election in order to avoid potentially significant fluctuations in its capital levels which can occur from the impact of changing market interest rates on the fair value of the Company’s investment securities portfolio.
 
Capital rules prohibit including certain hybrid and preferred securities in Tier 1 capital. Non-qualifying capital instruments under the final rule include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock. The rules grandfather these non-qualifying capital instruments that were issued before May 19, 2010 (subject to 25% of Tier 1 capital) for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of less than $15 billion as of December 31, 2009, including the Company. As of January 1, 2015, the Company’s non-qualifying capital instruments are subject to a limit of 25% of Tier 1 capital elements, excluding the non-qualifying capital instruments and after all regulatory capital deductions and adjustments applied to Tier 1 capital. Non-qualifying capital instruments excluded from Tier 1 capital under the 25% limitation may be included as a component of Tier 2 capital.
 
In measuring the adequacy of capital, assets are generally weighted for risk. Certain assets, such as cash and U.S. government securities, have a risk weighting of zero. Others, such as commercial and consumer loans, are generally risk weighted at 100%. Changes to risk-weighted assets that went into effect January 1, 2015 include: i) 150% risk weighting for non-residential mortgage loans past due more than 90 days or classified as nonaccrual; ii) 150% risk weighting (from 100%) for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development, and construction loans; iii) a 20% (from 0%) credit conversion factor for the unused portion of commitments with an original maturity of one year or less (except those unconditionally cancellable by the Company); and, iv) a 250% (from 100%) risk weighting for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from CET1. Risk weightings are also assigned for off-balance sheet items such as loan commitments. The various items are multiplied by the appropriate risk-weighting to determine risk-adjusted assets for the capital calculations. For the leverage ratio mentioned above, average quarterly assets (as defined) are used and are not risk-weighted.
 
In order to avoid restrictions on distributions, including dividend payments and discretionary bonus payments to its executives, the Company is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer of an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets once fully phased in. The capital conservation buffer is designed to create incentives for banking organizations to conserve capital during periods of economic stress. The addition of the capital conservation buffer, once fully phased in, effectively results in minimum ratios of 7%, 8.5%, and 10.5% for CET1, Tier 1 capital, and total capital, respectively, in order to avoid the restrictions on distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executives. The capital conservation buffer is being phased in over a four year period that began in 2016 by increments of 0.625% annually until reaching 2.5%. At year-end 2017, the Company meets the minimum capital ratios and a fully phased-in capital conservation buffer.

If an institution fails to remain well-capitalized, it will be subject to a series of restrictions that increase as the capital condition worsens. For instance, federal law generally prohibits a depository institution from making any capital distribution, including the payment of a dividend or paying any management fee to its holding company, if the depository institution would be undercapitalized as a result. Undercapitalized depository institutions may not accept brokered deposits absent a waiver from the FDIC, are subject to growth limitations, and are required to submit a capital restoration plan for approval, which must be guaranteed by the institution’s parent holding company. Significantly undercapitalized depository institutions may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions, including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized, requirements to reduce total assets, and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks. Critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. The Company is well-capitalized under the current rules, which require a CET1 ratio of 6.5%, a Tier 1 Risk-based Capital ratio of 8%, a Total Capital ratio of 10%, and a Tier 1 Leverage ratio of 5%.
Expansion and Activity Limitations
 With prior regulatory approval, the Company may acquire other banks or bank holding companies and its subsidiaries may merge with other banks. Acquisitions of banks located in other states may be subject to certain deposit-percentage, age, or other restrictions. In addition, as a financial holding company, the Company and its subsidiaries are permitted to acquire or engage in activities that are not permitted for bank holding companies such as insurance underwriting, securities underwriting and distribution, travel agency activities, broad insurance agency activities, merchant banking, and other activities that the FRB determines to be financial in nature or complementary to these activities. The FRB normally requires some form of notice or application to engage in or acquire companies engaged in such activities. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Company is generally prohibited from engaging in or acquiring direct or indirect control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company engaged in activities that are deemed not closely related to banking.
Limitations on Acquisitions of Bank Holding Companies
 In general, other companies seeking to acquire control of a financial holding company such as the Company would require the approval of the FRB under the Bank Holding Company Act. In addition, individuals or groups of individuals seeking to acquire control of a financial holding company would need to file a prior notice with the FRB (which the FRB may disapprove under certain circumstances) under the Change in Bank Control Act. Control is conclusively presumed to exist if an individual or company acquires 25% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company. Control may exist under the Change in Bank Control Act if the individual or company acquires 10% or more of any class of voting securities of the bank holding company and no shareholder holds a larger percentage of the subject class of voting securities.
Deposit Insurance
 The Company’s subsidiary bank is a member of the FDIC, and its deposits are insured by the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) up to prescribed limits of $250 thousand per depositor. The Company’s subsidiary bank is subject to quarterly FDIC deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The FDIC utilizes a risk-based assessment system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a risk matrix that takes into account a bank’s capital level and supervisory rating.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”) required changes to a number of components of the FDIC insurance assessment that was effective April 1, 2011. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to adopt a new DIF restoration plan to increase its reserve ratio to 1.35% from 1.15% of insured deposits by 2020. Under the restoration plan, the FDIC adopted regulations that redefined the assessment base as average consolidated assets less average tangible equity (as defined) during the assessment period. Since this resulted in a larger overall base when compared to the previous domestic deposits base methodology, overall assessment rates were lowered and the secured liability adjustment was eliminated from the rate calculation in an attempt to make the new assessments revenue neutral. At least semi-annually, the FDIC updates its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increase or decrease assessment rates. In establishing assessments, the FDIC is required to offset the effect of the higher reserve ratio against insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.
 
To determine the Company’s deposit insurance premiums, the Bank computes its assessment base, composed of average consolidated assets less average tangible equity (as defined), then applies the appropriate assessment rate. Graduated assessment rate decreases are set to phase in when the DIF reserve ratio exceeds 1.15%, 2.0%, and 2.5%. On June 30, 2016, the DIF reserve ratio surpassed the goal of 1.15%. As a result, assessment rates were lowered and the risk categories used in determining assessment rates were eliminated and assessment rates were established based on supervisory ratings (“CAMELS ratings”). Effective July 1, 2016, assessment rates range from 1.5 to 16 basis points for banks designated in the lowest risk category and between 11 to 30 basis points for banks designated in the highest risk category. The range of assessment rates applicable to each category varies depending on the level of the banks unsecured debt and brokered deposits.
 
 15



The FDIC may terminate insurance for depository institutions upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound financial condition, or has violated an applicable law, rule, regulation, order, or condition imposed by the FDIC.
 
In addition to deposit insurance assessments, all FDIC insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the FDIC to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation (“FICO”), a mixed-ownership government corporation established by the Competitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 possessing assessment powers in addition to the FDIC. The FDIC acts as a collection agent for FICO, whose sole purpose was to function as a financing vehicle for the now defunct Federal Savings & Loan Insurance Corporation. FICO assessment rates are determined quarterly and will continue until the FICO bonds mature through 2019.
 
Other Statutes and Regulations
 The Company and the Bank are subject to numerous other statutes and regulations affecting their activities. Some of the more important are summarized below.
 
Anti-Money Laundering. Financial institutions are required to establish anti-money laundering programs that must include the development of internal policies, procedures, and controls; the designation of a compliance officer; an ongoing employee training program; and an independent audit function to test the performance of the programs. The Company and the Bank are also subject to prohibitions against specified financial transactions and account relationships as well as enhanced due diligence and “know your customer” standards in their dealings with foreign financial institutions and foreign customers. Financial institutions must take reasonable steps to conduct enhanced scrutiny of account relationships in order to guard against money laundering and to report any suspicious transactions. Recent laws provide law enforcement authorities with increased access to financial information maintained by banks.
 
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act. The Bank is limited in its ability to lend funds or engage in transactions with the Company or other nonbank affiliates of the Company, and all transactions must be on an arm’s-length basis and on terms at least as favorable to the Bank as prevailing at the time for transactions with unaffiliated companies.
 
Dividends. The Parent Company’s principal source of cash flow, including cash flow to pay dividends to its shareholders, is the dividends that it receives from United Bank. Statutory and regulatory limitations apply to the Bank’s payments of dividends to the Parent Company as well as to the Parent Company’s payment of dividends to its shareholders. A depository institution may not pay any dividend if payment would cause it to become undercapitalized or if it already is undercapitalized. The federal banking agencies may prevent the payment of a dividend if they determine that the payment would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice. Moreover, the federal agencies have issued policy statements that provide financial holding companies and insured banks should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings.
 
Community Reinvestment Act. United Bank is subject to the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977 (“CRA”), as amended, and the federal banking agencies’ related regulations, stating that all banks have a continuing and affirmative obligation, consistent with safe and sound operations, to help meet the credit needs of the communities they serve. The CRA requires a depository institution’s primary federal regulator, in connection with its examination of the institution or its evaluation of certain regulatory applications, to evaluate the institution’s record in assessing and meeting the credit needs of the community served by that institution, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The regulatory agency’s assessment of the institution’s record is made available to the public. Failure of an institution to receive at least a “satisfactory” rating on a CRA examination could prevent a bank or its parent company from engaging in certain activities such as establishing de novo branches and branch relocations or acquiring other financial institutions.
 
Insurance Regulation. The Company’s subsidiaries that may underwrite or sell insurance products are subject to regulation by the Kentucky Department of Insurance.

Consumer Regulation. The activities of the Company and the Bank are subject to a variety of statutes and regulations designed to protect consumers. These laws and regulations:
 

● | limit the interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | govern disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | require financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | prohibit discrimination on the basis of race, creed, or other prohibited factors in extending credit;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require the Bank to safeguard the personal non-public information of its customers, provide annual notices to consumers regarding the usage and sharing of such information and limit disclosure of such information to third parties except under specific circumstances; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | govern the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The deposit operations of the Bank are also subject to laws and regulations that: 
 

● | require disclosure of the interest rate and other terms of consumer deposit accounts;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | impose a duty to maintain the confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribe procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (“EESA”). EESA was signed into law during 2008 as a measure to stabilize and provide liquidity to the U.S. financial markets. Under EESA, the Troubled Asset Relief Program (“TARP”) was created. TARP granted the U.S. Treasury (“Treasury”) authority to, among other things, invest in financial institutions and purchase troubled assets in an aggregate amount up to $700 billion.
 
In connection with TARP, the Capital Purchase Program (“CPP”) was launched on October 14, 2008. Under the CPP, the Treasury announced a plan to use up to $250 billion of TARP funds to purchase equity stakes in certain eligible financial institutions, including the Company. The Company received $30.0 million of equity capital under the CPP in January 2009. In the transaction, the Company issued 30,000 shares of fixed-rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock to the Treasury. The terms of the preferred shares required the Company to pay a 5% cumulative dividend during the first five years the shares were outstanding, resetting to 9% thereafter, and includes certain restrictions on dividend payments of lower ranking equity. The Company repurchased 20,000 of its outstanding preferred shares during 2014 for $20.0 million and repurchased the remaining 10,000 shared during 2015 for $10.0 million. No additional debt or equity was issued in connection with any of the shares redeemed.
 
During June 2012, the Treasury conducted an auction as part of ongoing efforts to wind down and recover its remaining CPP investments. The auction included preferred stock positions held by the Treasury of seven banks participating in the CPP, including the $30.0 million investment in the Company’s Series A preferred stock. The Treasury was successful in selling all of its investment in the Company’s Series A preferred stock to private investors through a registered public offering. The Company received no proceeds as part of the transaction.
 
Dodd-Frank Act. The Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in July 2010. The Dodd-Frank Act implements far-reaching changes to the regulation of the financial services industry, including provisions that:
 

● | centralize responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new agency responsible for implementing, examining, and enforcing compliance with federal consumer financial laws;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | apply the same leverage and risk-based capital requirements that apply to insured depository institutions to bank holding companies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require the federal banking regulators to seek to make their capital requirements countercyclical, so that capital requirements increase in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 17




● | change the assessment base for federal deposit insurance from the amount of insured deposits to consolidated assets less tangible capital;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | provide for new disclosure and other requirements relating to executive compensation and corporate governance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | make permanent the $250 thousand limit for federal deposit insurance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | repeal the federal prohibitions on the payment of interest on commercial demand deposits, thereby permitting depository institutions to pay interest on business transaction and other accounts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | increase the authority of the Federal Reserve to examine non-bank subsidiaries; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | codify and expand the “source of strength” doctrine as a statutory requirement. The source of strength doctrine represents the long held policy view by the Federal Reserve that a bank holding company should serve as a source of financial strength for its subsidiary banks. The Parent Company, under this requirement, is expected to commit resources to support a distressed subsidiary bank.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Volcker Rule. The Dodd-Frank Act prohibits insured depository institutions and their holding companies from engaging in proprietary trading except in limited circumstances, and prohibits certain ownership interests in and relationships with private equity and hedge funds (commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule”). On December 10, 2013, U.S. financial regulators, including the Federal Reserve, adopted final rules to implement the Volcker Rule. The final rules were effective April 1, 2014, but the conformance period to bring activities and investments into compliance was extended to July 21, 2015. The Company currently does not have any impermissible holdings under the rule.
 
Competition
 The Company faces vigorous competition for banking services from various types of businesses other than commercial banks and savings and loan associations. These include, but are not limited to, credit unions, mortgage lenders, finance companies, insurance companies, stock and bond brokers, financial planning firms, and department stores, which compete for one or more lines of banking business. The Company also competes for commercial and retail business not only with banks in Central and Northern Kentucky, but with banking organizations from Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and North Carolina which have banking subsidiaries located in Kentucky. These competing businesses may possess greater resources and offer a greater number of branch locations, higher lending limits, and may offer other services not provided by the Company. In addition, the Company’s competitors that are not depository institutions are generally not subject to the extensive regulations that apply to the Company and its subsidiary bank. As financial services become increasingly dependent on technology, permitting transactions to be conducted by telephone, mobile banking, and the internet, non-depository institutions are able to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services without offices located in our market area. The Company has attempted to offset some of the advantages of its competitors by arranging participations with other banks for loans above its legal lending limits, expanding into additional markets and product lines, and entering into third party arrangements to better compete for its targeted customer base. Competition from other providers of financial services may reduce or limit the Company’s profitability and market share.
 
The Company competes primarily on the basis of quality of services, interest rates and fees charged on loans, and the rates of interest paid on deposit funds. The business of the Company is not dependent upon any one customer or on a few customers, and the loss of any one or a few customers would not have a material adverse effect on the Company.
 
No material portion of the business of the Company is seasonal. No material portion of the business of the Company is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the government, though certain contracts are subject to such renegotiation or termination.
 
The Company is not engaged in operations in foreign countries.

Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 426 full-time equivalent employees. Employees are offered a variety of benefits. A salary savings plan, group life insurance, hospitalization, dental, vision, and major medical insurance along with postretirement health insurance benefits are available to eligible personnel. The Company maintains two postretirement health insurance benefit plans. Employees hired on or after January 1, 2016 are not eligible for the benefits related to those plans. Employees are not represented by a union. Management and employee relations are considered good.
The Company previously granted certain eligible employees the option to purchase a limited number of the Company’s common stock under a Stock Option Plan (“Plan”) approved by its shareholders in 1998. The Plan included the conditions and terms that the grantee must meet in order to exercise the options. No options have been granted under the Plan since 2004 and all unexercised options granted under the Plan expired during 2014. The Company has no current intention to grant any additional options under the Plan.
In 2004, the Company’s Board of Directors adopted an Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). The ESPP was subsequently approved by the Company’s shareholders and became effective July 1, 2004. Under the ESPP, at the discretion of the Board of Directors, employees of the Company and its subsidiaries can purchase Company common stock at a discounted price and without payment of brokerage costs or other fees and in the process benefit from the favorable tax treatment afforded such plans pursuant to Section 423 of the Internal Revenue Code.
Available Information
 The Company makes available free of charge through its website (www.farmerscapital.com) its Code of Ethics and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including its annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after electronically filing such material with the SEC. Any amendments to the Code of Ethics and any waiver applicable to the Company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer are also posted on the website.
