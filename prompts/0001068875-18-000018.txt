ITEM 1. Business
General Overview
Blucora, Inc. (referred to throughout this report as “Blucora,” the "Company", "we," "us," or "our") is a Delaware corporation that was founded in 1996, and, through organic growth and strategic acquisitions, we have become a leading provider of technology-enabled financial solutions to consumers, small business owners, and tax professionals. Our products and services in wealth management and tax preparation that we offer through HDV Holdings, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“HD Vest”) and TaxAct, Inc. and its subsidiary (“TaxAct”), respectively, help consumers to manage their financial lives. 
HD Vest provides financial advisors, who affiliate with HD Vest’s registered broker-dealer, investment adviser and/or insurance subsidiaries as independent contractors, an integrated, open platform that includes a broad variety of products offered through our brokerage, investment advisory, and insurance services to assist in making each financial advisor a financial service center for his/her clients. We regularly review the commissions and fees we charge for these products and services in light of the evolving regulatory and competitive environment and changes in client preferences and needs. We do not offer any proprietary products. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 4,000 advisors with branch offices in all 50 states utilized our HD Vest platform and supported approximately $44.0 billion of assets for almost 350,000 clients. HD Vest generates revenue primarily through securities and insurance commissions, quarterly investment advisory fees based on assets under management, and other fees. 
TaxAct provides affordable digital do-it-yourself (“DDIY”) tax preparation solutions for consumers and small business owners, and preparation software for tax professionals. During the year ended December 31, 2017, TaxAct powered approximately 4,500,000 consumer e-files and another 1,800,000 e-files through the 21,000 tax professionals who used TaxAct to prepare and file their taxes or those of their clients. TaxAct generates revenue primarily through its online service at www.TaxAct.com. The Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state jurisdictions, and Canada.
Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “BCOR.”
Our History
Blucora began in 1996 under the name InfoSpace, Inc. (“InfoSpace”). Over the next two decades, InfoSpace operated a number of digital businesses in search, directory, online commerce, media, and mobile infrastructure markets, with operations since 2008 focusing on internet search services and content (our “Search and Content” business).
In January 2012, InfoSpace acquired TaxAct, a leading provider of digital tax preparation solutions for consumers, small business owners, and tax professionals (our “Tax Preparation” business). In connection with this acquisition, InfoSpace changed its name to Blucora, Inc. in June 2012.
In August 2013, Blucora acquired Monoprice, Inc. (“Monoprice”), an e-commerce company that sold self-branded electronics and accessories to both consumers and businesses (our “E-Commerce” business).
In July 2015, Blucora acquired SimpleTax Software Inc. (“SimpleTax”), a provider of online tax preparation services for individuals in Canada.
For further detail on these acquisitions, see "Note 3: Business Combinations" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this report.
On October 14, 2015, we announced our plans to continue to operate our TaxAct subsidiary and to acquire HD Vest in order to focus on the technology-enabled financial solutions market (the “Strategic Transformation”). The acquisition of HD Vest closed on December 31, 2015. Through its registered broker-dealer, registered investment adviser, and insurance agency subsidiaries, HD Vest operates the largest U.S. tax-professional-oriented independent broker-dealer, providing wealth management solutions to financial advisors and their clients nationwide (our “Wealth Management” business). HDV Holdings, Inc. is the parent company of the Wealth Management business and owns all outstanding shares of HD Vest, Inc., which serves as a holding company for our various financial services subsidiaries. Those subsidiaries include HD Vest Investment Securities, Inc. (a registered broker-dealer), HD Vest Advisory Services, Inc. (a registered investment adviser), and HD Vest Insurance Agency, LLC (three insurance agencies domiciled in Texas, Massachusetts, and Montana). The Tax Preparation business consists of the operations of TaxAct, Inc. and its subsidiary ("TaxAct") and provides digital tax 
4

preparation solutions for consumers, small business owners, and tax professionals through its website www.TaxAct.com (collectively referred to as the "Tax Preparation business" or the "Tax Preparation segment").
As part of the October 14, 2015 announcement, we also stated our plans to divest the Search and Content and E-Commerce businesses. We completed both divestitures in 2016. Specifically, on August 9, 2016, we closed the sale of the Search and Content business to OpenMail LLC (“OpenMail”). On November 17, 2016, we closed the sale of the E-Commerce business to YFC-Boneagle Electric Co., Ltd (“YFC”). The results of operations of the Search and Content and E-Commerce businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented in this report. See "Note 4: Discontinued Operations" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this report for additional information. 
On October 27, 2016, as part of the Strategic Transformation and “One Company” operating model, Blucora announced plans to relocate its corporate headquarters by June 2017 from Bellevue, Washington to Irving, Texas. The actions to relocate the corporate headquarters were intended to drive efficiencies and improve operational effectiveness. See "Note 5: Restructuring" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this report for additional information. The restructuring is now substantially complete and it is expected to be completed by early 2018. 
We have two reportable segments: the Wealth Management segment, which is comprised of the HD Vest business, and the Tax Preparation segment, which is comprised of the TaxAct business. See "Note 2: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this report for additional information on the Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses and their revenue. See "Note 13: Segment Information" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II Item 8 of this report for information regarding revenue, operating income, and assets for our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation businesses.
Business Overview
Wealth Management Business
HD Vest was founded to help tax and accounting professionals integrate financial services into their practices. Unlike traditional independent broker-dealers and/or investment advisers whose client relationships are limited to providing investment advice, most HD Vest advisors have long-standing tax advisory relationships that anchor their wealth management businesses. We believe that tax and accounting professionals, with their existing client relationships and in-depth knowledge of their clients’ financial situations, have a competitive advantage and are better positioned than competitors to provide tailored financial solutions that enable clients to meet their goals. HD Vest primarily recruits independent tax professionals with established tax practices and offers specialized training and support, which allows them to join the HD Vest platform as independent financial advisors. HD Vest has designed a learning management system for its advisors, branded VestU™, with curriculum that introduces advisors to the investment business and helps them build their practices. The comprehensive training curriculum is administered through numerous outlets, including an annual three-day national sales conference, approximately 600 specialized local training events held annually, and on-demand learning paths.
HD Vest's business model provides an open-architecture investment platform and technology tools to help financial advisors identify investment opportunities for their clients, while the long-standing tax advisory relationships provide a large client base of possible investment clients. This results in an experienced and stable network of financial advisors, who have multiple revenue-generating options to diversify their earnings sources, and have access to HD Vest's innovative Mentor program and Chapter meetings. HD Vest also has a highly experienced home office team that is focused on solutions tailored to the advisor's practice. The home office team provides marketing, practice management, insurance and annuity, wealth management, compliance, succession planning, and other support to our advisors.
Tax Preparation Business
TaxAct, a top-three provider of digital tax preparation solutions, based upon the number of e-files made in 2017, has leveraged its strong brand, comprehensive suite of tax preparation solutions, and proven online lead generation capabilities to enable the filing of more than 64 million federal consumer tax returns in the U.S. and Canada since 2000. TaxAct operates as the value player in its market, with a mission to empower people to navigate the complexities of tax preparation with ease and accuracy at a fair price.
TaxAct's offerings come with a price lock guarantee, whereby the price at the start of the tax return filing process is the price when the return is filed, rather than pricing the offering at the time that the tax return is filed. We believe this price lock guarantee ensures price transparency and differentiates TaxAct from its competitors. TaxAct also provides an accuracy guarantee, where, if an error in our software results in a smaller refund or larger tax liability than the customer would receive 
5

using the same data with another tax preparation product, we will pay to the customer the difference in the refund or liability (up to $100,000) and refund the applicable software fees the customer paid us. In addition to these core offerings, TaxAct offers ancillary services such as refund payment transfer, audit defense, stored value cards, and retirement investment accounts through HD Vest, and a marketplace for customers to take advantage of personalized tax and financial savings opportunities through third party product providers. TaxAct has an established reputation that we believe is attractive to customers.
We had three offerings for consumers for tax year 2016, which is the basis for TaxAct's 2017 operating results: 

• | A "free" federal and state edition that handled simple returns;


• | A "plus" offering that contained all of the basic offering features in addition to tools to maximize credits and deductions, and enhanced reporting; and


• | A "premium" offering that contained all of the plus offering features in addition to tools for self-employed individuals to maximize credits and deductions.

For our offerings, state returns can be filed for free for free simple filers, or through the separately-sold state edition. We also had an offering for small business owners. 
TaxAct’s professional tax preparer software allows professional tax preparers to prepare and file individual and business returns for their clients. TaxAct offers flexible pricing and packaging options that help tax professionals save money by paying only for what they need. In addition, the professional tax preparer software includes valuable features that tax professionals count on to maximize their efficiency and productivity, including the option of entering data directly into tax forms, utilizing the question-and-answer interview method to enter data, or easily toggling between the two data entry methods. 
Growth Strategy
Our evolving growth strategy for HD Vest and TaxAct includes participating in favorable industry trends and executing growth strategies that we believe will result in customer and advisor retention and growth beyond that of the broader markets in which we operate. Our approach is grounded on the belief that the best way to sustainably grow a business is to earn loyalty based on continuously delivering ever-greater value to target customers and clients.
Favorable Industry Trends

• | Wealth Management Industry Trends - We believe that HD Vest is and will be the beneficiary of several positive industry trends, including growth of investable assets driven by baby boomers’ retirement accounts, a continued migration to independent advisor channels, liquidity events and a continued shift toward household use of financial advisors.


• | Tax Preparation Industry Trends - TaxAct participates in the consumer DDIY tax preparation solutions market, which is the fastest growing segment in the tax preparation industry and is bolstered by a growing millennial population that continues to adopt technology-enabled financial solutions that drive value and ease in their everyday lives, and we believe that tax simplification will drive digital consumer growth.

Executing our Growth Strategies

• | Brand Differentiation - A key objective of our strategy is to differentiate our HD Vest and TaxAct brands. It is important that our advisors, their clients, and our customers clearly identify and connect with our brands for the quality of products and services that we offer, as well as our values. In 2017, we took initial steps in this effort, beginning in the tax season, and we expect to make additional investments over time. Additionally, we believe that the synergies between HD Vest and TaxAct will provide additional brand differentiation opportunities and strengthen our connection with our advisors, their clients, and our customers. 


• | Innovate Continuously - As emerging technology and market trends change the way people manage their financial lives, our solutions also evolve. The retention and growth of our customer and advisor base are dependent, in part, upon our ability to deliver technology-enabled financial solutions that optimize user experience and capitalize on current technology, and provide innovations that integrate proven wealth management goals-based planning and portfolio management technology with tax planning and preparation technology. 

6


• | Offer a Comprehensive Product Suite - The products and services offered by HD Vest and TaxAct constitute a comprehensive suite of financial solutions. We believe that continued expansion of financial solutions, whether proprietary or third party, will be a source of growth for each business. In addition, the combination of HD Vest and TaxAct provides meaningful cross-serving opportunities for both businesses, further contributing to customer and advisor retention and growth. 


• | Continue to Provide Quality Customer Support, Education, and Training - A key element of our HD Vest business model is the ongoing education and training of tax professionals, which enables them to become financial advisors and effectively manage a growing wealth management practice. HD Vest provides these tax professionals with the resources and support to build confidence and competence, enabling them to grow assets under administration. The importance of quality customer support and education also flows through to our TaxAct business, where a seasoned tax support team provides support and education to consumers and tax professionals. 

Research and Development
Our wealth management and tax preparation services are delivered primarily via software and online platforms. Since the markets for software and online technology are characterized by rapid technological change, shifting customer needs and frequent new product introductions and enhancements, a continuous high level of investment is required to innovate and quickly develop new products and services as well as enhance existing offerings. Our product development efforts are becoming more important than ever as people and businesses are increasingly connected by technology and expect access to services at any place or time. Our research and development expenses were $13.3 million in 2017, $13.7 million in 2016 (which includes research and development by the HD Vest business beginning on January 1, 2016), and $4.8 million in 2015. 
Seasonality
Our Tax Preparation business is highly seasonal, with a significant portion of our annual revenue for such services earned in the first four months of our fiscal year. During the third and fourth quarters, the Tax Preparation segment typically reports losses because revenue from the segment is minimal while core operating expenses continue. We anticipate that the seasonal nature of that part of the business will continue in the foreseeable future.
Competition
We face intense competition in all markets in which our businesses operate. Many of our competitors or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and marketing resources, larger customer bases, longer operating histories, more developed infrastructures, greater brand recognition, better access to vendors, and more established relationships. Our competitors may be able to adopt more aggressive pricing policies, develop and expand their product and service offerings more rapidly, adapt to new or emerging technologies more quickly, take advantage of acquisitions and other opportunities more readily, achieve greater economies of scale, and devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products and services than we can. For our businesses to be successful, we must be competitive in the Wealth Management and Tax Preparation markets, as described in more detail below.
Wealth Management Competition
The wealth management industry is a highly competitive global industry. We and our financial advisors compete directly with a variety of financial institutions, including traditional wirehouses, independent broker-dealers, registered investment advisers, asset managers, banks and insurance companies, and direct distributors such as 1st Global and Cetera Financial Group, as well as larger broker-dealers such as Raymond James Financial. Mergers and acquisitions have resulted in consolidation in the wealth management industry. As a result, many of our competitors may have greater financial resources, broader and deeper distribution capabilities, and a more comprehensive offering of products and services. We and our financial advisors compete directly with those companies for the provision of products and services to clients, as well as for retention and hiring of financial advisors. 
We believe that our competitive position in the wealth management industry is a function of our ability to enable our advisors to offer investment guidance in the context of their clients' tax situations and more specifically to:

• | offer high-quality portfolio investment options and competitive product pricing;


• | offer a differentiated value proposition (in terms of brand recognition, reputation, and financial advisor payouts) that is sufficient to recruit and retain financial advisors;

7


• | offer products that are attractive to financial advisors and their clients;


• | negotiate competitive compensation arrangements with third-parties, including vendors, suppliers, and product sponsors;


• | develop and react to new technology, services, and regulation in the financial services industry; and


• | put in place a sufficient support and service network required to support our financial advisors and clients.

Tax Preparation Competition
Our TaxAct business operates in a very competitive marketplace. There are many competing software products and online services. Intuit’s TurboTax and H&R Block's DDIY consumer products and services have a significant percentage of the software and online service market. Our TaxAct business must also compete with alternate methods of tax preparation such as storefront tax preparation services, which includes both local tax preparers and large chains such as H&R Block, Liberty Tax, and Jackson Hewitt, and it may also be subject to new market entrants who may take some of our market share. Finally, our TaxAct business faces the risk that state or federal taxing agencies will offer software or systems to provide direct access for individual filers that will reduce the need for TaxAct’s software and services. 
We believe that our competitive position in the market for tax preparation software and services is a function of our ability to: 

• | differentiate our brand versus those of competitors;


• | offer competitive pricing;


• | continue to offer high-quality, easy-to-use, and accessible software and services that are compelling to consumers;


• | market the software and services in a cost effective way; and


• | offer ancillary services that are attractive to users, including enhanced tax and wealth management services through HD Vest.

Privacy and Security of Customer Information and Transactions
Our TaxAct business is subject to various federal, state and international laws and regulations and to financial institution and healthcare provider requirements relating to the privacy and security of the personal information of customers and employees. We are also subject to laws and regulations that apply to the Internet, behavioral tracking and advertising, mobile applications and messaging, telemarketing, email activities, data hosting and retention, financial and health information, and credit reporting. Additional laws in all of these areas are likely to be passed in the future, which could result in significant limitations on or changes to the ways in which we can collect, use, host, store, or transmit the personal information and data of our customers or employees, communicate with our customers, and deliver products and services, or may significantly increase our compliance costs. As our business expands to new industry segments and new uses of data that are regulated for privacy and security, or to countries outside the United States that have strict data protections laws, our compliance requirements and costs will increase.
Through a privacy policy framework designed to be consistent with globally recognized privacy principles, we comply with United States federal and other country guidelines and practices to help ensure that customers and employees are aware of, and can control, how we use information about them. The TaxAct.com website and its online products have been certified by TRUSTe, an independent organization that operates a website and online product privacy certification program representing industry standard practices to address users’ and regulators’ concerns about online privacy. We also use privacy statements to provide notice to customers of our privacy practices, as well as provide them the opportunity to furnish instructions with respect to use of their personal information. We participate in industry groups whose purpose is to develop or shape industry best practices, and to influence public policy for privacy and security.
To address security concerns, we use security safeguards to help protect the systems and the information customers give to us from loss, misuse and unauthorized alteration. Whenever customers transmit sensitive information, such as credit card information or tax return data, through one of our websites or products, we use industry standards to encrypt the data as it is transmitted to us. We work to protect our systems from unauthorized internal or external access using numerous commercially available computer security products as well as internally developed security procedures and practices.

HD Vest’s subsidiaries are subject to privacy regulation under federal and state law, which has been, and will continue to be, an area of focus for regulators.
Governmental Regulation
Blucora is a publicly traded company that is subject to Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and NASDAQ Global Select Market rules and regulations regarding public disclosure, financial reporting, internal controls, and corporate governance. The adoption of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as the implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), have significantly expanded the nature and scope of these rules and regulations. Our Wealth Management and Tax Preparation segments are subject to federal and state government requirements, including regulations related to consumer protection, user privacy, security, pricing, taxation, intellectual property, labor, advertising, broker-dealers, securities, investment advisers, asset management, insurance, listing standards, and product and services quality.
Our Wealth Management segment is subject to additional financial industry regulations and supervision, including by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”), the Department of Labor (“DOL”), state securities and insurance regulators, and other regulatory authorities. Our Wealth Management subsidiary HD Vest Investment Securities, Inc. is a broker-dealer registered with the SEC, a member of FINRA, and a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation and the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation. Broker-dealers and their representatives are subject to rules and regulations covering all aspects of the securities business, including sales and trading practices, use and safekeeping of clients’ funds and securities, capital adequacy, recordkeeping and reporting, the conduct of directors, officers, and employees, and general anti-fraud provisions. Broker-dealers and their representatives are also regulated by state securities administrators in those jurisdictions where they do business. Compliance with many of the rules and regulations applicable to us involves a number of risks, because rules and regulations frequently change and are subject to varying interpretations, among other reasons. Regulators make periodic examinations of our broker-dealer operations and review annual, monthly, and other reports on our operations and financial condition. Violations of rules and regulations governing a broker-dealer’s actions could result in censure, penalties and fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the restriction, suspension, or expulsion from the securities industry of such broker-dealer, its representatives or its officers or employees, or other similar adverse consequences.
Our Wealth Management subsidiary, HD Vest Advisory Services, Inc. is registered with the SEC as an investment adviser and is subject to the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Such requirements relate to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, advisory fees, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between the advisor and advisory clients, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements, and general anti-fraud provisions. The SEC periodically examines our investment adviser operations and reviews annual, monthly, and other reports on our operations and financial condition. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and other federal securities laws, ranging from fines and censure to termination of an investment adviser’s registration. Investment adviser representatives also are subject to certain state securities laws and regulations. Failure to comply with the Advisers Act or other federal and state securities laws and regulations could result in investigations, sanctions, profit disgorgement, fines, or other similar adverse consequences.
Our Wealth Management subsidiaries offer certain products and services subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and to regulations promulgated under ERISA or the Code, insofar as they provide services with respect to plan clients, or otherwise deal with plan clients that are subject to ERISA or the Code. ERISA imposes certain duties on persons who are “fiduciaries” (as defined in Section 3(21) of ERISA) and prohibits certain transactions involving plans subject to ERISA and fiduciaries or other service providers to such plans. Non-compliance with these provisions may expose an ERISA fiduciary or other service provider to liability under ERISA, which may include monetary penalties as well as equitable remedies for the affected plan. Section 4975 of the Code prohibits certain transactions involving plans (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1), which includes individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans) and service providers, including fiduciaries, to such plans. Section 4975 imposes excise taxes for violations of these prohibitions. 
In April 2016, the DOL adopted regulations (the “DOL fiduciary rule”) expanding the definition of who is a fiduciary under ERISA, and specifying how such fiduciaries must provide investment advice to account holders in ERISA plans, individual retirement accounts (“IRAs”), and certain other types of accounts described in the Code (collectively, “Covered Accounts”). The DOL fiduciary rule as currently drafted brings virtually all of the investment products and services HD Vest currently provides to IRA owners within the scope of ERISA and would require HD Vest to make significant changes to its policies, procedures and products with respect to Covered Accounts. In November 2017, however, the DOL formally delayed the effective date of key portions of the DOL fiduciary rule until July 2019. The purpose of this delay is to allow the DOL time 
9

to review and potentially substantially revise the fiduciary rule, and to facilitate coordination between the DOL and SEC potentially to promulgate uniform standards of conduct for all financial professionals. It is uncertain what further actions the DOL or SEC will take with respect to these matters or when any further rulemaking will be complete or effective. During this delay, HD Vest, when dealing with Covered Accounts, must follow the DOL’s Impartial Conduct Standards, which require HD Vest to act in the best interest of investors in Covered Accounts, charge no more than reasonable compensation, and avoid making material misrepresentations. See the section entitled "Risks Associated With our Businesses" in Part I Item 1A of this report for more information about the risks associated with future regulations and their potential impact on our operations.
Our Tax Preparation segment is subject to federal and state government requirements, including regulations related to the electronic filing of tax returns, the provision of tax preparer assistance, and the use and disclosure of customer information. We also offer certain other products and services to small businesses and consumers, which are also subject to regulatory requirements. As we expand our products and services, both domestically and internationally, we may become subject to additional government regulation. Further, regulators may adopt new laws or regulations or their interpretation of existing laws or regulations may differ from ours or expand to cover additional products and services. These increased regulatory requirements could impose higher regulatory compliance costs, limitations on our ability to provide some services in some states or countries, and liabilities that might be incurred through lawsuits or regulatory penalties. 
The Trump Administration has called for a broad review of, and potentially significant changes to, U.S. fiscal and tax laws and regulations. These changes have resulted in comprehensive tax reform and include the rolling back or repeal of various financial regulations, including the DOL fiduciary rule and the Dodd-Frank Act. We cannot predict the impact, if any, of these changes to our businesses. However, it is possible that some policies adopted by the new administration will benefit us and others will negatively affect us. Until we know what changes are enacted, we will not know whether in total we benefit from, or are negatively affected by, the changes.
We are subject to federal and state laws and government regulations concerning employee safety and health and environmental matters. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal and state agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that may have an impact on our operations.
See the section entitled "Risks Associated With our Businesses" in Part I, Item 1A of this report for additional information regarding risks related to governmental regulation of our business.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends upon our technology and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect such rights and the value of our corporate brands and reputation through a variety of measures, including: domain name registrations, confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with employees and third parties, protective contractual provisions, and laws regarding copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets. We hold multiple registered trademarks in the United States and in various foreign countries, and we may apply for additional trademarks as business needs require. We may not be successful in obtaining issuance or registration for such applications or in maintaining existing trademarks. In addition, registered marks may not provide us with any competitive advantages. We may be unable to adequately or cost-effectively protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, and failure to do so could weaken our competitive position and negatively impact our business and financial results. If others claim that our products infringe their intellectual property rights, we may be forced to seek expensive licenses, re-engineer our products, engage in expensive and time-consuming litigation, or stop marketing and licensing our products. See the section entitled "Risks Associated With our Businesses" in Part I Item 1A of this report for additional information regarding protecting and enforcing intellectual property rights by us and third parties against us.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had 487 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider employee relations to be positive. There is significant competition for qualified personnel in the industries in which we operate, particularly for software development and other technical staff. We believe that our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel.
Company Internet Site and Availability of SEC Filings
Our corporate website is located at www.blucora.com. We make available on that site, as soon as reasonably practicable, our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, proxy statements, Current Reports on Form 8-K, other reports filed with or furnished to the SEC, as well as any amendments to those filings. Our SEC filings, as well as our Code of Ethics and Conduct and other corporate governance documents, can be found in the Investor Relations section of our site and 
10

are available free of charge. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the SEC maintains a website at www.sec.gov that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding us and other issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
