Item 1. Business
Our Company
The J.G. Wentworth Company (“we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company”) is a Delaware holding company that was incorporated on June 21, 2013. The Company is focused on providing direct-to-consumer access to financing solutions through a variety of avenues, including: mortgage lending, structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment purchasing, prepaid cards, and access to providers of personal loans. Our direct-to-consumer businesses use digital channels, television, direct mail, and other channels to offer access to financing solutions. We warehouse, securitize, sell or otherwise finance the financial assets that we purchase in transactions that are structured to ultimately generate cash proceeds to us that exceed the purchase price we paid for those assets. 
We manage our company through the following two business segments: 
(i) Structured Settlement Payments ("Structured Settlements") - Structured Settlements provides liquidity to individuals with financial assets such as structured settlements, annuities and lottery winnings by either purchasing these financial assets for a lump-sum payment, issuing installment obligations payable over time, or serving as a broker to other purchasers of those financial assets. The Company engages in warehousing and subsequent resale or securitization of these various financial assets. Structured Settlements also includes corporate activities, payment solutions, pre-settlements and providing (i) access to providers of personal lending and (ii) access to providers of funding for pre-settled legal claims.
(ii) Home Lending ("Home Lending") - Home Lending is primarily engaged in retail mortgage lending, originating primarily Federal Housing Administration ("FHA"), U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs ("VA"), and conventional mortgage loans, and is approved as a Title II, non-supervised direct endorsement mortgagee with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development ("HUD"). In addition, Home Lending is an approved issuer with the Government National Mortgage Association ("Ginnie Mae"), Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"), and U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), as well as an approved seller and servicer with the Federal National Mortgage Association ("Fannie Mae").
We had revenue of $428.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, of which $313.9 million was from our Structured Settlements segment and $114.8 million was from our Home Lending segment. See Note 29 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under "Part II, Item 8 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data'" and "Part II, Item 7 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations'" for additional financial information for each of our reportable segments. 
In the first half of 2017, we focused on improving the performance of our Structured Settlements business, maintaining adequate liquidity through funding source optimization and rigorous expense controls while continuing to grow our Home Lending business and enhance the value of our mortgage servicing rights. 
During the second half of 2017, we entered into a consensual restructuring agreement with our lenders, which is further discussed below. The restructuring was completed in January 2018 and significantly reduced our debt and strengthened our balance sheet. Under the terms of the restructuring, we extinguished $449.5 million of our senior credit facility and obtained a new secured revolving credit facility of $70.0 million which is utilized for general corporate purposes and working capital. In addition to reducing the Company's annual debt service from $32.0 million to less than $5.0 million, we reconstituted our Board of Directors to reflect the new ownership of the Company and consequently, all previously issued and held equity interests were canceled without recovery. The restructuring was accomplished, and became effective on January 25, 2018, through a voluntary, pre-packaged, in-court process whereby the Company's operating entities, including those serving employees, customers, vendors and suppliers, were unaffected. We also continued to access the capital markets through the execution of a securitization of our structured settlements assets to extract what we believe was the maximum profitability based on current market conditions and underlying economics. 
At our Home Lending business, we concentrated on continuing to grow our business through operational scale while focusing on capital market execution and anticipating changes in the interest rate environment. 
Reorganization Plan under Chapter 11 and Bankruptcy Proceedings
On December 12, 2017, the Corporation, together with certain of its subsidiaries (the “Debtors”) filed voluntary cases (the “Chapter 11 Cases”) under Chapter 11 of title 11 of the United States Code (the “Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware (the “Bankruptcy Court”) to pursue the previously announced Joint Pre-Packaged Plan of Reorganization of Orchard Acquisition Company, LLC and its Debtor Affiliates, dated December 1, 2017 (as amended, the “Plan”). Only the Debtors filed the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, the direct and indirect subsidiaries of Orchard Acquisition Company, LLC, including the entities which conduct all of the Company's consolidated operations, have not filed for bankruptcy. 
2

On January 17, 2018, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving and confirming the Plan (the “Confirmation Order”). On January 25, 2018 (the “Effective Date”), the Debtors satisfied the conditions to effectiveness of the Plan and the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Debtors emerged from bankruptcy.
Pursuant to the Plan, (a) all claims arising under the Debtors’ pre-petition secured term loan facility and related guarantees were terminated and released, and each holder of such claims received its pro rata share of (i) cash consideration (the “Term Lender Cash Consideration”) and (ii) new common equity of the reorganized Company (the “New Common Equity”), subject to dilution by the Management Incentive Plan adopted on the Effective Date; (b) all pre-petition equity interests in The J.G. Wentworth Company, LLC (the “Partnership”) were canceled and in exchange each holder of such equity interests (the “Existing Partnership Equity holders”) received its pro rata share of (i) New Common Equity or (ii) cash consideration (the “Partnership Cash Consideration”), or a mix of both the Partnership Cash Consideration and New Common Equity (collectively, the “Partnership Consideration”); (c) all pre-petition claims against the Company (“TRA Claims”) arising under that certain Tax Receivable Agreement, dated as of November 14, 2013 (the “TRA”), were canceled and, in consideration, each TRA claimant received its pro rata share of the New Class A common stock and the New Class B common stock of the Company or cash consideration, at the sole election of each holder of a TRA claim. Consequently, as of January 25, 2018, the TRA claimants now hold, in the aggregate, 161,961 shares of New Class A common stock and 141,384 shares of New Class B common stock and received $4.8 million of cash consideration. The aggregate fair value of the total settlement was $6.6 million. 
Pursuant to the Plan all previously issued and held equity interests were canceled without recovery. 
Furthermore, the Company terminated the effectiveness of its registration statements and removed from registration any securities that remained unsold under Section 12 of the Exchange Act and suspended its reporting obligations under Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. 
On the Effective Date, we entered into a New Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (the “New RCF Agreement”) among Orchard Acquisition Company, LLC, as Parent Borrower (the “Parent Borrower”), J.G. Wentworth, LLC (“JGW LLC”), the lending institutions from time to time party thereto, and HPS Investment Partners, LLC, a related party, as administrative agent (the “Administrative Agent”). We utilized borrowings under the New RCF Agreement to fund the fees and expenses of the restructuring transactions contemplated by the Plan, the Partnership Cash Consideration, a portion of the Term Lender Cash Consideration, and working capital and other general corporate purposes. The New RCF Agreement provides for a new four-year revolving credit facility (the “New RCF”) with an aggregate borrowing availability of $70.0 million.
As a result of the foregoing, the Company’s corporate structure otherwise remained substantially the same as prior to the Chapter 11 Cases. The Company amended and restated its certificate of incorporation to provide for, among other things, the authorization of 225,000,000 shares of new Class A common stock, (the "New Class A common stock") and 25,000,000 shares of new Class B common stock, (the "New Class B common stock" and, together with the New Class A common stock, the "New Common Stock"). The Company is not authorized to issue any shares of preferred stock under its amended and restated certificate of incorporation. 
Pursuant to the Plan, the members of the Board of Directors of the Company were replaced with new members, as set forth in Part III, Item 10 "Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance" of this Form 10-K. 
In connection with the implementation of the Plan and as a result of the change in control effectuated by the Plan, the Debtors sought and obtained certain required regulatory approvals related to Home Lending prior to the effective date of the Plan. 
For additional information related to the Debtors’ emergence from bankruptcy and the terms of the New RCF, see Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” 
Structured Settlements
Structured Settlements, Annuities and Lottery Receivables
Through our Structured Settlements segment, we serve the needs of our customers by providing them with cash in exchange for a certain number of their fixed scheduled future payments. Customers desire liquidity for a variety of reasons, including costs related to debt reduction, housing, automotive, business opportunities, education and healthcare. We provide liquidity to our customers through:

• | Purchasing Structured Settlement Payments. Structured Settlements are financial tools used by insurance companies to settle claims on behalf of their customers. They are contractual arrangements under which an insurance company agrees to make periodic payments to an individual as compensation for a claim typically arising out of personal injury. These payments fall into two categories: guaranteed structured settlement payments, which are paid out until maturity regardless of the status of the beneficiary, and life contingent structured settlement payments, which cease upon the death of the beneficiary. Often, due to changes in their life circumstances, these individuals prefer a cash payment up front rather than such periodic payments, and we offer them that liquidity. We purchase all or part of these structured settlement payments at a discount to the

3

aggregate face amount of the future payments in exchange for a single up-front payment. These future structured settlement payments are generally disbursed to us directly by an insurance company. The structured settlement payments we purchase have long average lives of more than ten years and cannot be prepaid. Since the enactment of the federal Victims of Terrorism Tax Relief Act of 2001 (the "Tax Relief Act"), every one of our structured settlement payment stream purchases has been reviewed and approved by a judge. Based on information provided by the National Association of Settlement Purchasers, we believe we are the largest purchaser of structured settlement payments in the United States.

• | Purchasing Annuities. Annuities are insurance products purchased or inherited by individuals from insurance companies that entitle the beneficiary to receive a pre-determined stream of periodic payments. Often these individuals would prefer a cash payment up front rather than such periodic payments, and we offer them that liquidity. We purchase all or part of the annuity payments at a discount to the aggregate face amount of future payments in exchange for a single up-front payment.


• | Purchasing and Brokering Lottery Receivables. Lotteries are prizes that generally have periodic payments and are typically backed by state lottery commission obligations or insurance company annuities. Some lottery winners may prefer a cash payment up front rather than such periodic payments, and we offer them that liquidity. We purchase or broker to a third party all or part of the lottery receivables at a discount to the aggregate face amount of future payments in exchange for a single up-front payment to the lottery winners. As in the case of structured settlement payments, every one of our purchases and brokered deals of lottery receivables is reviewed and approved by a judge.

We act as an intermediary that identifies, underwrites and purchases individual payment streams from our customers, aggregates the payment streams and then finances them in the institutional market, principally at financing rates that are below our cost to purchase the payment streams. We purchase future payment streams from our customers for a single up-front cash payment that is negotiated with each of our customers. We fund our purchases of payment streams with short and long-term non-recourse financing. We initially fund our purchase of structured settlement payments and annuities through committed warehouse lines. Our guaranteed structured settlement and annuity warehouse facilities totaled $225.0 million at December 31, 2017. We regularly assess our financing sources and adjust the nature and amount of our committed warehouse lines in light of current and projected market conditions. We may seek to amend our warehouse facilities to better reflect our financing needs. We also intend to undertake a sale or securitization of these assets multiple times per year, subject to our discretion, in transactions that are designed to generate excess cash proceeds over the purchase price we paid for those assets and the amount of warehouse financing used to fund that purchase price. We finance the purchase of other payment streams using a combination of other committed financing sources, cash on hand and our operating cash flow.
We refer to undiscounted total receivable balances that we have purchased as TRB. TRB purchases for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $719.5 million and $713.4 million, respectively. Because our purchase and financing of periodic payment streams is undertaken on a positive cash flow basis, we view our ability to purchase payment streams as key to our business model. We continuously monitor the efficiency of marketing expenses and the hiring and training of personnel engaged in the purchasing process. Another key feature of our business model is our ability to aggregate payment streams from many individuals and from a diversified base of payment counterparties. We have reviewed the TRB which we purchase directly or purchase from third parties and have discontinued our focus on less profitable TRB.
We operate with multiple brands, two of which are highly recognizable brands in the segment, J.G. Wentworth and Peachtree, each of which generates a significant volume of inbound inquiries. Brand awareness is critical to our marketing efforts, as there are no readily available lists of holders of structured settlements, annuities or, in many cases, lotteries. Since 1995 we have invested significant resources in marketing to establish our brand names and increase customer awareness through multiple media outlets. As a result of our substantial marketing investment, we believe our two core brands are two of the most recognized brands in their product category. Additionally, since 1995, we have been building proprietary databases of current and prospective customers, which we continue to grow through our marketing efforts and which we consider a key differentiator from our competitors.
Payment Solutions and Personal Lending
As part of our diversification strategy, we entered into the payment solutions business and have set up relationships to provide inquiring individuals access to providers of personal loans. We do not lend to customers in these product lines and are not exposed to credit or default risk. Rather, we earn fees by leveraging our direct-to-consumer marketing channels and brand recognition to connect lenders and consumers.

Payment Solutions - Prepaid Cards
A prepaid card is a card that can be used to access money that has been paid to the card account in advance. There are a number of different types of prepaid cards. We have launched a General Purpose Reloadable ("GPR") card and a Consumer Incentive card. In each case, we act as a program manager and distributor of the card and have chosen to partner with third-party service providers to serve as the card-issuer, card-processor and as our network partner. A GPR card can be reloaded by a consumer to add more money after the funds originally loaded to the card account have been exhausted. We have branded our proprietary, bank-issued GPR card as The J.G. Wentworth Cash Now™ Visa® Card. GPR cards have features similar to a typical bank checking account, including fee-free direct deposit, in-store and on-line purchasing capability wherever Visa is accepted, bill payment and ATM cash access. Fees are charged to consumers for monthly account maintenance and other transactions, some of which are waived if certain conditions are met. We also sell customizable GPR cards to third party businesses.
A Consumer Incentive card is non-reloadable and can only be funded for a single load by a corporate entity, in this case, us. We have branded our proprietary, bank-issued Consumer Incentive card as The J.G. Wentworth Visa® Reward Card. We use The J.G. Wentworth Visa® Reward Card to support our structured settlement consumer acquisition and retention efforts by using the cards in place of paper checks. We also sell customizable Consumer Incentive cards to third-party businesses. In connection with our GPR and Consumer Incentive cards, we earn account maintenance and other transaction fees based on consumers' use of the cards. We also earn fees when we sell GPR and Consumer Incentive cards to third-party businesses. As of December 31, 2017, our payment solutions group had not generated significant revenues.
Personal Lending
Personal loans are unsecured loans, for which borrowers do not have to provide collateral. We have created a personal lending platform where consumers seeking personal loans can access third parties or their intermediaries online or on the phone. We do not lend to consumers and are not exposed to credit or default risk. We do not charge consumers for the use of our platform. Our revenue is generated from the up-front match fees paid by the lender on delivery of a lead and the closing of the loan. 
Pre-Settlement Funding
Pre-settlement funding is a transaction with a plaintiff that has a pending personal injury claim to provide liquidity while awaiting settlement. These are not loans; rather, there is an assignment of an interest in the settlement proceeds of the claim and, if and when a settlement occurs, payment is made to us directly via the claim payment waterfall, not from the claimant. If the plaintiff's claim is unsuccessful, the purchase price and accrual of fees thereon are written off. In April 2015, we stopped purchases of finance receivables associated with pre-settlement funding transactions. We do, however, continue to broker such transactions to third parties in exchange for broker or referral fees. We also continue to service $24.4 million in gross finance receivables (at cost) related to pre-settlement funding transactions that we purchased prior to the cessation of related funding activities. 
Home Lending 
Through our Home Lending segment, we serve our customers by originating and servicing U.S. residential mortgage loans. We originate primarily conventional, FHA and VA mortgage loans. We transfer mortgage loans into pools of Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae mortgage-backed securities ("MBSs"), and sell whole mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market. Our principal revenue channels include: (i) gains on the sale of mortgage loans from loan securitizations and whole loan sales; (ii) fee income from mortgage originations; (iii) service income from loan servicing and (iv) interest income on mortgage loans held for sale. We currently offer the following mortgage loan products: 

• | Conforming Mortgage Loans. Conforming mortgage loans are prime credit quality first-lien mortgage loans secured by a residential property that meet or "conform" to the underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac for inclusion in their guaranteed mortgage securities programs.


• | Non-conforming Mortgage Loans. Non-conforming mortgage loans are prime credit quality first-lien mortgage loans that conform to the underwriting standards established by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, except they have original principal amounts exceeding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac limits.


• | Government Mortgage Loans. Government mortgage loans are first-lien mortgage loans secured by owner occupied residences that are insured by the FHA or U.S. Department of Agriculture ("USDA"), or guaranteed by the VA and, in each case, securitized into Ginnie Mae MBSs.

Our Home Lending segment operates through our wholly-owned subsidiary, J.G. Wentworth Home Lending, LLC. Home Lending is a residential mortgage lender with active licenses in 45 states and the District of Columbia and is an approved Title II, non-supervised direct endorsement mortgagee with HUD. In addition, Home Lending is an approved issuer with Ginnie Mae, Freddie Mac, the USDA and the VA, as well as an approved seller/servicer with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. All of Home Lending's underwriting, closing, funding, and corporate functions are managed centrally at its headquarters in Woodbridge, Virginia. However, we rely on sales and sales support staff (including loan officers, processors, and administrative staff) located throughout the country.

Our loan origination operations primarily consist of distributed retail and direct-to-consumer operations. In our distributed retail channel, we generate leads and originate loans from business and personal referrals as well as from previous customers via our 24 branch locations that are located in 15 states. Our direct-to-consumer channel consists of affinity relationships and other marketing initiatives. Through affinity relationships we generate program leads and originate mortgage loans directly with borrowers through our telephone call centers or the Internet. Our direct-to-consumer marketing initiatives generate refinance and purchase mortgage leads through a variety of marketing channels including direct mail, paid search and search engine optimization. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, 11.3% and 13.8%, respectively, of our originations were through our distributed retail operations and 88.7% and 86.2%, respectively, were through our direct-to-consumer operations. After originating loans, we transfer those mortgage loans into pools of Ginnie Mae and Fannie Mae MBSs, and/or sell whole mortgage loans to third party investors in the secondary market.
Servicing primarily involves loan administration, payment processing, mortgage escrow account administration, collection of insurance premiums, response to homeowner inquiries, loss mitigation solutions, including loan modifications, and supervision of foreclosures and property dispositions on behalf of the owners of the loans. These activities generate recurring revenues and cash flows. Revenues primarily consist of servicing fees, which are generally expressed as basis points of the outstanding unpaid principal balance, and ancillary revenues such as late fees, modification fees and incentive fees. Our servicing portfolio includes mortgage servicing rights, which are rights we own and record as assets to service traditional residential mortgage loans for others either as a result of a purchase transaction or from the sale and securitization of loans we originate. We have elected to account for our MSR portfolio at fair value. Due principally to servicer advance requirements, MSRs require capital and liquidity; however, such advances are generally financeable. We sub-contract the actual servicing to a third-party provider. As of December 31, 2017, we serviced 21,974 loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $5.3 billion. 
Industry Overview
As a direct-to-consumer marketer, we originate consumer interest in a variety of cash related products across multiple channels. 
Structured Settlements
In our Structured Settlements segment, we purchase structured settlement payments from consumers. The use of structured settlements was established in 1982 when the U.S. Congress passed the Periodic Payment Settlement Act of 1982 (the "Settlement Act"), which allows periodic payments made as compensation for a personal injury to be free of all federal taxation to the payee, provided certain conditions are met. By contrast, the investment earnings on a single up-front payment are generally taxable, leading structured settlements to proliferate as a means of settling lawsuits. Following the emergence of structured settlements, a secondary market developed in response to the changing financial needs of the holders of structured settlements over time, with many requiring short-term liquidity for a variety of reasons. Purchasers in the structured settlement secondary market provide an up-front cash payment in exchange for an agreed-upon stream of periodic payments from a holder of a structured settlement. To avoid the imposition of a federal excise tax, since 2002, each purchased structured settlement payment stream requires court approval by a judge, who must rule that the transfer of the Structured Settlements and its terms are in the best interests of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee's dependents.
A portion of structured settlements may have a life contingent component. Life contingent structured settlements are similar to guaranteed structured settlements, however, unlike guaranteed structured settlements, which pay out until maturity regardless of the status of the beneficiary, life contingent structured settlement payments cease upon death of the beneficiary. We have developed a financing model that allows us to purchase these life contingent structured settlement payments without assuming any mortality risk. 
We also purchase annuities. Annuities are most often purchased to provide a reliable cash flow or a financial cushion for unexpected expenses during retirement or received by individuals via inheritance. The secondary market for annuities provides liquidity to holders, regardless of how they obtained their annuity. The purchasing and underwriting process for annuities is substantially similar to that for structured settlements. However, purchases of annuities do not require court approval.
In addition to structured settlements and annuities, we also purchase and act as a broker for lottery receivables. According to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries ("NASPL"), 44 states and the District of Columbia currently offer government-operated lotteries. For those lottery winners that have either elected or have been required to receive their lottery prize payout in the form of periodic payments, the secondary market provides liquidity and payment flexibility not otherwise provided by their current payment schedule. Twenty-six states have enacted statutes that permit lottery winners to voluntarily assign all or a portion of their future lottery prize payments. Similar to structured settlements, the voluntary assignment of a lottery prize requires a court order.
The results of our payment solutions business and access fees from third party providers of personal loans are included within the results of our Structured Settlements segment. Prepaid cards have emerged as an attractive product within the electronic payments industry. They are generally easy for consumers to understand and use because they work in a manner similar to traditional 
6

debit cards, allowing the cardholder to use a conventional plastic card (and in some cases a virtual card) linked to an account established at a financial institution. In most cases, the consumer can access the funds on the card at ATMs and/or the point of sale in retail locations using signature identification technologies or a personal identification number. Prepaid cards and related services offer consumers flexibility, convenience and spending control. 
The personal lending online market is changing the traditional brick and mortar banking system. By providing a platform where borrowers can connect with lenders, personal lending online marketplaces are making credit more affordable and available through a medium often overlooked by traditional banks. 
Prior to April 2015, we provided consumers with pre-settlement funding, which provides a plaintiff with a pending personal injury claim with immediate cash, which can be used by the plaintiff to fund out of pocket expenses, allowing the plaintiff to continue their lawsuit. In April 2015, we stopped conducting pre-settlement funding transactions. We do, however, continue to broker leads for such transactions to third parties in exchange for broker or referral fees, and continue to service our existing pre-settlement funding transaction portfolio. 
Home Lending
Our Home Lending segment conducts business in the residential mortgage lending industry in the United States. We participate in two distinct, but related, sectors of the mortgage industry: residential mortgage loan originations and residential mortgage loan servicing.
The U.S. residential mortgage market consists of a primary mortgage market that links borrowers and lenders and a secondary mortgage market that links lenders and investors. In the primary mortgage market, residential mortgage lenders such as mortgage banking companies, commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and other financial institutions originate or provide mortgage loans to borrowers. Lenders obtain liquidity for originations in a variety of ways, including by selling mortgage loans into the secondary mortgage market or by securitizing mortgage loans into MBSs. Banks that originate mortgage loans also have access to customer deposits to fund their originations business. The secondary mortgage market consists of institutions engaged in buying and selling mortgage loans in the form of whole loans, which represent mortgage loans that have not been securitized and MBSs. The GSEs (Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac), and Ginnie Mae participate in the secondary mortgage market by purchasing mortgage loans and MBSs for investment and by issuing guaranteed MBSs.
Each mortgage loan must be serviced by a loan servicer. Master servicers, which are loan servicers that own the MSRs they service, generally earn a contractual per loan fee on the unpaid principal balance of loans serviced, as well as incentive fees and associated ancillary fees, such as late fees. 
Loan servicing predominantly involves the calculation, collection and remittance of principal and interest payments, the administration of mortgage escrow accounts, the collection of insurance claims, the administration of foreclosure procedures and the disbursement of required advances. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to federal, state and, in some cases, local regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. These regulations govern and/or affect many aspects of our overall business. Certain government regulations may cover both of our business segments while certain other government regulations may cover specific business segments only. 
In order to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our businesses, we have policies, standards and procedures in place for our business activities and with our third-party vendors and providers. Laws, regulations, and related guidance evolve regularly, requiring us to adjust our compliance program on an ongoing basis. This will be particularly true of the next few months and years if the government overhauls much of the current regulatory landscape, which is the expectation of many professionals in the financial services industry. As a result, this regulatory disclosure should be viewed as a snapshot in time that is and will continue to be subject to future modification. Any future regulatory modifications could have a substantial impact on our profitability in the short, medium and long terms.

Regulatory Aspects of Our Overall Business
Dodd-Frank Act
Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 ("Dodd-Frank") established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"), which has regulatory, supervisory and enforcement powers over providers of consumer financial products and services. Included in the powers afforded to the CFPB is the authority to adopt rules declaring specific acts and practices to be "unfair," "deceptive" or "abusive," and hence unlawful. The CFPB could adopt rules imposing new and potentially burdensome requirements and limitations with respect to our lines of business. However, on November 25, 2017, Mick Mulvaney was appointed acting Director of the CFPB following the resignation of Director Richard Cordray. Acting Director Mulvaney has publicly stated that the way the new leadership will interpret and enforce Dodd-Frank will be “dramatically different,” however the precise changes are as yet unknown.
In addition to Dodd-Frank's grant of regulatory powers to the CFPB, Dodd-Frank gives the CFPB authority to pursue administrative proceedings or litigation for violations of fourteen federal consumer financial laws. In these proceedings, the CFPB can obtain cease and desist orders (which can include orders for restitution, reformation or rescission of contracts, payment of damages, refund or disgorgement, as well as other kinds of affirmative relief) and civil monetary penalties ranging from $5,437 per day for violations of federal consumer financial laws (including the CFPB's own rules) to $27,186 per day for reckless violations and $1,087,450 per day for knowing violations. Also, where a company has violated Title X of Dodd-Frank or CFPB regulations under Title X, Dodd-Frank empowers state attorneys general and state regulators to bring civil actions for the kind of cease and desist orders available to the CFPB. Pursuant to CFPB Bulletin 2016-02, supervised banks and non-banks could be held liable for actions of their service providers, such as sub-servicers. Additional information regarding the Civil Investigative Demands ("CIDs") from the CFPB relating to our structured settlement and annuity payment purchasing activities is included in Part I, Item III "Legal Proceedings" of Form 10-K. 
Dodd-Frank directs the federal banking agencies and the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), to adopt rules requiring an issuer or other entity creating an asset-backed security (including the securitizations of our payment streams and MBSs) to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for the assets underlying the security, subject to certain exceptions, including for qualified residential mortgages. In 2014, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, HUD, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC"), the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the SEC approved a credit risk retention rule that became effective on December 24, 2016 and requires sponsors of securitizations to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets. This risk retention requirement applies to securitizations of the payment streams we purchase in our Structured Settlements segment and will decrease the amount of cash that we receive in connection with each such securitization as we will not be able to sell the entire pool of bonds as we have done previously. We have analyzed this rule and we believe we have structured the securitizations of our payments streams to be in accordance with the rule. 
Anti-Money Laundering Laws
Federal anti-money laundering laws make it a criminal offense to own or operate a money transmitting business without the appropriate state licenses and registration with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network ("FinCEN"), of the U.S. Department of the Treasury (the "Treasury Department"). In addition, the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and the Treasury Department's implementing federal regulations require "financial institutions" to establish and maintain an anti-money-laundering program. Such a program must include: (i) internal policies, procedures and controls designed to identify and report money laundering; (ii) a designated compliance officer; (iii) an ongoing employee-training program; and (iv) an independent audit function to test the program. 
In addition, federal regulations require the reporting of suspicious transactions of at least $2,000 to FinCEN. Relevant federal regulations generally describe the three classes of reportable suspicious transactions as follows: transactions that a business knows, suspects, or has reason to suspect (i) involve funds derived from illegal activity or funds intended to hide or disguise such activity, (ii) are designed to evade the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act, or (iii) appear to serve no business or lawful purpose.
In connection with its administration and enforcement of economic and trade sanctions based on U.S. foreign policy and national security goals, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control ("OFAC") publishes a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups, and entities, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers, designated under programs that are not country-specific. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called "Specially Designated Nationals" ("SDNs"). Assets of SDNs are blocked, and we are generally prohibited from dealing with them. In addition, OFAC administers a number of comprehensive sanctions and embargoes that target certain countries, governments and geographic regions. We are generally prohibited from engaging in transactions involving any country, region or government that is subject to such comprehensive sanctions.
8

In addition, the Bank Secrecy Act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments and other suspicious activity that might denote money laundering, tax evasion or other criminal activity and requires financial institutions to remain in compliance with state and federal anti-money laundering laws.
Privacy and Information Safeguard Laws
In the ordinary course of our business, we collect certain types of data, which subjects us to certain privacy and information security laws in the United States, including, for example, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 and other laws or rules designed to regulate consumer information and mitigate identity theft. We are also subject to privacy laws of various states. These state and federal laws impose obligations with respect to the collection, processing, storage, disposal, use and disclosure of personal information, and require that financial institutions have in place policies regarding information privacy and security. In addition, under federal and certain state financial privacy laws, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies and practices for sharing nonpublic information with third parties, provide advance notice of any changes to our policies and, with limited exceptions, give consumers the right to prevent use of their nonpublic personal information and disclosure of it to unaffiliated third parties. Certain state laws may, in some circumstances, require us to notify affected individuals of security breaches of computer databases that contain their personal information. These laws may also require us to notify state law enforcement, regulators or consumer reporting agencies in the event of a data breach, as well as businesses and governmental agencies that own data. Furthermore, if enacted as proposed, California Senate Bill 297 would require lead generators to comply with the same legal requirements for information privacy and security as what applies to state licensed lenders.
Escheatment Laws
Unclaimed property laws of every U.S. jurisdiction require that we track certain information on our products and if qualifying customer funds are unclaimed at the end of an applicable statutory abandonment period, the proceeds of the unclaimed property be remitted to the appropriate jurisdiction. Statutory abandonment periods potentially applicable to certain of our products typically range from three to seven years.
Other Federal Regulations
In addition to the regulations discussed above, depending upon the particular business segment and the line of business therein, we may have to comply with a number of additional federal consumer protection laws, including, among others:

• | The Truth-in-Lending Act ("TILA") and Regulation Z, which implements TILA, require disclosure to customers or mortgagors of uniform, understandable information concerning certain terms and conditions of their loan and credit transactions. TILA also regulates the advertising of credit and gives borrowers, among other things, certain rights regarding updated disclosures and the treatment of credit balances.


• | The Fair Credit Reporting Act ("FCRA") regulates the use and reporting of information related to the credit history of consumers. FCRA requires a permissible purpose to obtain a consumer credit report, and requires persons to report loan payment information to credit bureaus accurately. FCRA also imposes disclosure requirements on creditors who take adverse action on credit applications based on information contained in a credit report.


• | The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act ("FDCPA") regulates the timing and content of debt collection communications. The FDCPA limits certain communications with third parties, imposes notice and debt validation requirements, and prohibits threatening, harassing or abusive conduct in the course of debt collection.


• | The Equal Credit Opportunity Act ("ECOA") prohibits discrimination on the basis of age, race and certain other characteristics in the extension of credit. Regulation B, which implements ECOA, restricts creditors from requesting certain types of information from applicants and from making statements that would discourage on a prohibited basis a reasonable person from making or pursuing an application. ECOA also requires creditors to provide consumers with timely notices of adverse action taken on credit applications.

Structured Settlements
The operations of our Structured Settlements segment are subject to specific federal and state regulation regarding the transfer of such payment streams and the tax implications of such transfers. In addition, our payment solutions and personal lending business lines operate within this segment and are subject to federal and state regulation relating to protection of consumer information, prepaid card fees, electronic funds transfers and escheatment of property.
Transfer Statutes
To protect the interests of individuals who wish to sell their rights to receive structured settlement payments, federal and state governments have instituted laws and regulations governing the transferability of these interests. Currently, the assignment of structured settlement payments from one party to another is subject to federal and, in most cases, state statutory and regulatory requirements. Most states have adopted transfer statutes to provide certainty as to who structured settlement payments are to be made and to ensure that individuals who wish to sell structured settlement payments are treated fairly. Under these transfer statutes, an individual who wishes to sell his/her right to receive payment must receive court approval that the transfer is in the individual's best interest before a transfer can take place. Under federal law, if court approval is not previously obtained, the acquirer of the structured settlement payments is subject to a significant excise tax on the transaction. To comply with these federal and state laws, there are a significant number of compliance items that must be completed before a transfer of structured settlement payment rights can take place.
While structured settlement transfer statutes vary from state to state, most are based upon model legislation regarding transfers of settlement payments, referred to as the Model Act, which was developed by various market participants, including the National Association of Settlement Purchasers and the National Structured Settlements Trade Association. A transfer statute typically sets forth, at a minimum, the following requirements that must be satisfied before a court will issue a transfer order approving a sale of structured settlement payments: (i) the court must find that the sale of the structured settlement payments is in the seller's best interest, taking into account the welfare and support of the seller's dependents; (ii) the settlement purchaser must have given notice of the proposed sale and related court hearing to the related obligor and issuer of the payments and certain other interested parties, if any; and (iii) the settlement purchaser must have provided to the seller a disclosure statement that (a) indicates, among other things, the discounted present value of the structured settlement payments in question and any expenses or other amounts to be deducted from the purchase amount received by the seller, and (b) advises the seller to obtain or at least consider obtaining independent legal, tax and accounting advice in connection with the proposed transaction. Any transfer statute may place additional affirmative obligations on the settlement purchaser, require more extensive findings on the part of the court issuing the transfer order, contain additional prohibitions on the actions of the purchaser or the provisions of a settlement purchase agreement, require shorter or longer notice periods, or impose other restrictions or duties on settlement purchasers. In particular, many transfer statutes specify that, if a transfer of structured settlement payments contravenes the terms of the underlying settlement contract, the settlement purchaser will be liable for any taxes and, in some cases, other costs incurred by the related obligor and issuer of the payments in connection with such transfer. Also, transfer statutes vary as to whether a transfer order issued under the statute constitutes definitive evidence that the related assignment complies with the terms of the applicable transfer statute. While many transfer statutes require a court to issue a finding at the time of the issuance of a transfer order that the related assignment complies with the terms of the applicable transfer statute, under several transfer statutes the issuance of a transfer order is only one of several factors used to determine compliance with the applicable transfer statute.
Most of the settlement agreements giving rise to the structured settlement receivables that we purchase contain anti-assignment provisions that purport to proscribe assignments or encumbrances of structured settlement payments due thereunder. Anti-assignment provisions give rise to the risk that a claimant or a payor could invoke the anti-assignment provision in a settlement agreement to invalidate a claimant's transfer of structured settlement payments to the purchaser, or force the purchaser to pay damages. In addition, at least one appellate court in Illinois has determined that the state transfer statute does not apply to certain transfers where an anti-assignment provision is applicable. Under certain circumstances, interested parties other than the related claimant or payor can also challenge, and potentially invalidate, an assignment of structured settlement payments made in violation of an anti-assignment provision. Whether the presence of an anti-assignment provision in a settlement agreement can be used to invalidate a prior transfer depends on various aspects of state and federal law, including case law and the state's particular adoption of Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code (the "UCC"). Ultimately, the decision of whether an anti-assignment provision is enforceable is made by the courts.
Many state courts have differing views as to whether the state court or a bankruptcy court must issue the final court order approving the sale of periodic payments where certain of the assets proposed for sale are subject to bankruptcy proceedings. In an Illinois ruling, the state court found no conflict between the Illinois transfer statute and the Bankruptcy Code that would necessitate pre-emption of the Bankruptcy Code over the transfer statute. In New Jersey, however, the state court refused to hear a trustee's petition for approval of a sale on the grounds that the sale involved property subject to bankruptcy proceedings and that such proceedings were beyond the jurisdiction of the state court. 
10

Many states have enacted transfer statutes with respect to lottery payments. While there are differences among the various lottery prize transfer statutes, such statutes typically require compliance with the following criteria before a court will approve the sale of a lottery winner's prize payments: (i) the assignment must be in writing and state that the lottery winner has a statutorily specified number of business days within which to cancel the assignment; (ii) the lottery winner must be provided with a written disclosure statement setting forth, among other things, (a) the payments being assigned, by amounts and payment dates, (b) the purchase price being paid, (c) the discount rate applied by the purchaser to the lottery prize payments and (d) the amount of any origination or closing fees to be charged to the lottery winner; (iii) written notice of the proposed assignment and any court hearing concerning the assignment must be provided to the applicable lottery commission's counsel prior to the date of any court hearing; and (iv) the lottery winner must provide a sworn affidavit attesting that (a) he is of sound mind, in full command of his faculties and not acting under duress and (b) has been advised regarding the assignment by his own independent legal counsel. A lottery prize transfer statute may: (i) place additional affirmative or negative obligations on the purchaser of the lottery receivable(s); (ii) impose additional prohibitions on the actions of the lottery originator and/or its assignors; (iii) override provisions of lottery purchase agreements; and (iv) require shorter or longer payment periods. Most state lottery commissions will acknowledge the transfer order in writing, either by means of a written acknowledgment, counter-execution of the transfer order or an affidavit of compliance with the soon-to-be-issued transfer order.
The failure on the part of a structured settlement payment purchaser or a lottery prize payment purchaser to comply with the terms of any applicable transfer statutes may have several adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a court decision declaring any related receivable purchases invalid, which would, in the case of a structured settlement payment transfer, enable the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), to impose an excise tax thereon.
Additional Restrictions on Annuity Transfers
Annuity contracts are usually assignable by the annuitant. In order to effect an assignment, providers of annuities must acknowledge the annuitant's sale of the annuity to the purchaser in writing and then redirect payments to the purchaser. In many states, annuities are excluded from the scope of Article 9 of the UCC, and therefore the UCC concept of "perfection" may not apply with respect to such assignments. Nevertheless, a precautionary UCC-1 financing statement can be filed against the annuitant. Many states restrict the procurement of an annuity contract with the sole intent to assign it. Consequently, it is often necessary to wait for at least six months after the issuance of the annuity contract in order to purchase any annuity payments streams arising thereunder. In some cases, it is sufficient for a prospective purchaser to obtain certain documentation affirming that the annuitant (or, if applicable, its predecessor in interest) did not procure the annuity contract with the intent to assign it.
Federal Tax Relief Act
Several provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), impact our structured settlement and annuity purchasing business. 
Generally, an assignee of a structured settlement obligation may exclude from gross income the settlement amounts received from the defendant to the extent that such amounts do not exceed the aggregate cost of any qualified funding asset (such as an annuity contract), pursuant to section 130 of the Code. Further, when a taxpayer receives a distribution payment from an annuity before attaining the age of 59 ½, the distribution is generally subject to a 10% penalty. However, such a penalty does not generally apply if the distribution is made under an annuity provided by suit or settlement as compensatory damages for personal injury or illness.
Section 5891 of the Code, as set forth by the Tax Relief Act, levies an excise tax upon those people or entities that acquire structured settlement payments from a seller, unless certain conditions are satisfied. The excise tax is equal to 40% of the discount imposed by the purchaser of the structured settlement payments. However, no such tax is levied if the transfer of such structured settlement payments is approved in a qualified court order. A qualified court order under the Tax Relief Act means a final order, judgment or decree that finds that the transfer does not contravene any federal or state law or the order of any court or administrative authority and is in the best interest of the payee, taking into account the welfare and support of the payee's dependents. The order must be issued under the authority of an applicable state statute of the state in which the seller is domiciled, or, if there is no such statute, under the authority of an applicable state statute of the state in which the payment obligor or annuity provider has its principal place of business, or by the responsible administrative authority (if any) that has exclusive jurisdiction over the underlying action or proceeding.
The IRS issued regulations that provide guidance on the reporting requirements for those paying the excise tax under Section 5891. The regulations require individuals liable for the excise tax to file a return and pay the tax no later than 90 days after the individual receives payments under the structure.
In July 2015, the Treasury Department, as part of its continuing effort to reduce paperwork and respondent burden, invited the general public and other federal agencies to comment on proposed and/or continuing information collection procedures with respect to the excise tax on structured settlement factoring transactions. In September 2015, the IRS published a Structured Settlement Factoring Audit Technique Guide ("ATG") that expands upon the factoring issue. The ATG outlines the process for 
11

reporting the excise tax and discusses a number of valuation techniques. On December 1, 2015, the IRS solicited comments in the Federal Register regarding Form 8876, Excise Tax on Structured Settlement Factoring Transactions. The comments were due on February 1, 2016. No formal action has been taken by the IRS to date based on the comments received. 
Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act
The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act (the "Card Act") establishes comprehensive legislation regarding fair and transparent practices relative to credit cards, gift certificates, store gift cards and general-use prepaid cards. The Card Act regulates certain dormancy, inactivity and service fees chargeable by issuers of prepaid cards and related disclosures. 
Other Federal Regulations
In addition to compliance with the regulations summarized above, in the Structured Settlements segment we must also continue to monitor developments relating to, and our possible required compliance with, a number of federal consumer protection laws and security standards, including, among others:

• | the Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act, which requires that telemarketers maintain an internal data base of consumers who do not wish to be contacted and not to call such customers;


• | the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, a proprietary information security standard for organizations that handle branded credit cards from the major card issuers including Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB; and


• | the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, which was designed to stop the deluge of unsolicited junk mail and regulates commercial email, establishes standards for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to opt out of receiving emails, and provides penalties for violations.

Dodd-Frank 
Dodd-Frank directs the federal banking agencies and the SEC, to adopt rules requiring an issuer or other entity creating an asset-backed security (including the securitizations of our payment streams and MBSs) to retain an economic interest in a portion of the credit risk for the assets underlying the security, subject to certain exceptions, including for qualified residential mortgages. In 2014, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, HUD, the FDIC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the SEC approved a credit risk retention rule that became effective on December 24, 2016 and requires sponsors of securitizations to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets. This risk retention requirement applies to securitizations of the payment streams we purchase in our Structured Settlements segment and will decrease the amount of cash that we receive in connection with each such securitization as we will not be able to sell the entire pool of bonds as we have done previously. We have analyzed this rule and we believe we have structured the securitizations of our payments streams to be in accordance with the rule. 
Electronic Funds Transfers Act
Regulation E, which implements the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, imposes requirements for the issuance and sale of gift cards. The requirements mandate that certain clear and conspicuous disclosures be provided to consumers at the point of sale and on the card itself, including with respect to any service, inactivity or dormancy fees that may be assessed. In addition, the regulation places certain restrictions and prohibitions on such fees.
On October 5, 2016, the CFPB issued a final rule providing consumer protections for general prepaid accounts that are not marketed as gift cards. The rule finalized new Regulation E requirements, implementing the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, for prepaid accounts. The new Regulation E requirements create tailored provisions governing disclosures, limited liability and error resolution rules, requirements for periodic statements and the posting of account agreements. The CFPB rule finalized further requirements for prepaid accounts under Regulation Z, implementing the Truth In Lending Act. Pursuant to the new Regulation Z rules, issuers of prepaid accounts must provide protections similar to those for credit cards if they allow consumers to use credit to make purchases in excess of the amount prepaid.
On January 25, 2018, the CFPB issued a final rule postponing the effective date of the revised final rule to April 1, 2019 from the previous effective date of April 1, 2018. 
As the Company moves further into the gaming application for its payment solutions products, it will have to evaluate certain additional regulatory requirements and their application to these products. In addition to any application of the previously noted prepaid card rules promulgated by the CFPB under its Dodd-Frank authority, to be eligible to participate in payments solutions for the gaming industry, the Company, its related and applicable subsidiaries and the managers thereof may have to apply for and be approved to provide the intended services to the industry or seek any applicable exemption from licensing. This application and licensing process may occur on the state level or the local jurisdictional regulatory level, such as with tribal authorities. This process may require submission and regulatory administrative review of various items of information with respect to the Company and its principals and may include background checks. The level of licensing and associated review is expected 
12

to vary by jurisdiction, but will require the Company to provide additional information in connection with annual reviews conducted by the applicable regulatory authorities in order for the Company to be able to continue to provide the services for these payment solutions products. These requirements will impose additional regulatory and ongoing costs to comply. 
Personal Lending
We have created a personal lending platform where consumers seeking personal loans can access third parties or their intermediaries online or on the phone. We do not lend to consumers and are not exposed to credit or default risk. We do not charge consumers for the use of our platform. Our revenue is generated from the up-front match fees paid by the lender on delivery of a lead and the closing of the loan. The business of providing consumer leads to third-party lenders has been the subject of increasing scrutiny by state and federal authorities. On July 4, 2017, Blue Global LLC, a lead generator for payday and other short-term small loans, installment loans, and auto loans, was fined $104 million by the FTC. In addition, on September 19, 2017, the CFPB fined lead generator Zero Parallel $350,000 for steering consumers to lenders that were unlicensed or otherwise offered unlawful loans. Our practices do not resemble the practices engaged in by Blue Global or Zero Parallel. However, the activities of bad actors in the lead generation industry have spurred intensified regulatory scrutiny and may result in increased regulation. For example, if enacted, proposed California Senate Bill 297 would require lead generators to register with the state; comply with legal requirements for the privacy and security of personal information; and refrain engaging in false, misleading or deceptive business or advertising practices.
Home Lending
Home Lending is subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation. Our mortgage originations and mortgage servicing operations are primarily regulated at the state level by state licensing, supervisory and administrative agencies. We, along with certain of our employees who engage in regulated activities, must apply for licensing (or licensing exemption) as a mortgage banker or lender, loan servicer, mortgage loan originator and/or debt default specialist, pursuant to applicable state law. These laws typically require that we file applications and pay certain processing fees to be approved to operate in a particular state, and that our principals and loan originators be subject to background checks, administrative review and continuing education requirements. Home Lending is actively licensed (or maintains an appropriate statutory exemption) to originate and service mortgage loans in 45 states and the District of Columbia. From time to time, we receive requests from states and other agencies for records, documents and information regarding our policies, procedures and practices regarding our mortgage originations and mortgage servicing business activities, and we are subject to periodic examinations by state regulatory agencies. We incur ongoing costs to comply with these licensing and examination requirements.
SAFE Act
The federal Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008 ("SAFE Act"), requires all states to enact laws requiring each individual who takes mortgage loan applications, or who offers or negotiates terms of a residential mortgage loan, to be individually licensed or registered as a mortgage loan originator. Employees of Home Lending, as a non-depository lender, must be licensed. These laws require each mortgage loan originator to enroll in the Nationwide Mortgage Licensing System ("NMLS"), apply for individual licenses with the state where they operate, complete a minimum number of hours of pre-licensing education and an annual minimum number of hours of continuing education, and successfully complete exams at both the national and state level.
Home Lending is also required to be registered with the NMLS and receive an NMLS identification number to use in attesting to the employment of its mortgage loan originators, and for other SAFE Act-related purposes. 
Other Federal Regulations
In addition to licensing requirements and SAFE Act compliance, we must comply with a number of federal consumer protection laws in our Home Lending segment, including, among others:

• | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act ("RESPA") and Regulation X, which govern certain mortgage loan origination activities and practices and the actions of servicers related to escrow accounts, loan servicing transfers, lender-placed insurance, loss mitigation, error resolution and other customer communications;


• | the federal Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, which allows military members to suspend or postpone certain civil obligations so that the military member can devote his or her full attention to military duties and requires us to adjust the interest rate of borrowers who qualify for and request relief to 6% for the duration of the borrower's active duty;


• | the Homeowners Equity Protection Act, which requires, among other things, the cancellation of mortgage insurance once certain equity levels are reached;


• | the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act and Regulation C thereunder, which require mortgage lenders to report certain public loan data;

13


• | the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, which permits consumers one copy of each of the three major credit reporting agency credit reports annually and contains provisions to reduce identity theft;


• | the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination in housing on the basis of race, sex, national origin, and certain other characteristics; and


• | certain provisions of Dodd-Frank (discussed above and in further detail below), including the Consumer Financial Protection Act.

Dodd-Frank 
The CFPB directly influences the regulation of residential mortgage loan originations and servicing in a number of ways. First, the CFPB has rulemaking authority with respect to many of the federal consumer protection laws applicable to mortgage originators and servicers, including TILA, RESPA and the FDCPA. Second, the CFPB has supervision, examination and enforcement authority over consumer financial products and services offered by certain non-depository institutions, including Home Lending, and large insured depository institutions. The CFPB's jurisdiction includes those persons originating, brokering or servicing residential mortgage loans and those persons performing loan modification or foreclosure relief services in connection with such loans.
As discussed above, in 2014, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, HUD, the FDIC, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the SEC approved a credit risk retention rule that requires sponsors of securitizations to retain not less than 5% of the credit risk of the assets. However, because substantially all of our mortgage loans are sold to, or pursuant to programs sponsored by, Fannie Mae or Ginnie Mae, the approved rule exempts these mortgage loans from the risk-retention requirements with regard to MBSs backed by such mortgage loans. 
On January 10, 2013, the CFPB issued a final rule, effective January 10, 2014, for the "ability to repay" requirement in Dodd-Frank. The rule, among other things, requires lenders to consider a consumer's ability to repay a mortgage loan before extending credit to the consumer, and limits prepayment penalties. The rule also establishes certain protections from liability for mortgage lenders with regard to the "qualified mortgages" they originate. For this purpose, the rule defines a "qualified mortgage" to include a loan with a borrower debt-to-income ratio of less than or equal to 43% or, alternatively, a loan eligible for purchase by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac while they operate under federal conservatorship or receivership, and loans eligible for insurance or guarantee by the FHA, VA or USDA. The VA has issued additional rules regarding the definition of "qualified mortgage" for a VA insured and guaranteed loan. Under the rule, all purchase money origination loans and refinances other than certain interest rate reduction refinance loans guaranteed or insured by the VA are defined as safe harbor qualified mortgage loans. The rule also designates as a qualified mortgage: (1) any loan that the VA makes directly to a borrower; (2) Native American direct loans; and (3) vendee loans, which are made to purchasers of properties the VA acquires as a result of foreclosures in the guaranteed loan program. Additionally, a qualified mortgage may not: (i) contain excessive up-front points and fees; (ii) have a term greater than 30 years; or (iii) include interest-only, negative amortization or balloon payments. To the extent we originate non-"qualified mortgages", either inadvertently or purposefully, and we are found to have failed to make a reasonable and good faith determination of a borrower's ability to repay any such loan, we could be subject to additional civil or criminal penalties including substantial fines, imprisonment for individual responsible parties, and statutory penalties payable to the borrower equal to the sum of the borrower's actual damages, twice the amount of the related finance charges up to $4,000, the actual amount of finance charges or fees paid by the borrower (unless we show our failure to comply is not material), and the borrower's attorney's fees and other costs in connection with the related litigation.
On October 3, 2015, the CFPB implemented a final rule combining the mortgage disclosures consumers previously received under TILA and RESPA. For more than 30 years, the TILA and RESPA mortgage disclosures had been administered separately by, respectively, the Federal Reserve Board and HUD. The final rule generally applies to most closed-end residential mortgage loans for which the creditor or mortgage broker receives an application on or after October 3, 2015.
On January 1, 2018, significant revisions to Regulation C, which implements the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (“HMDA”), became effective. Under the revised regulation, the number of data points that must be collected and reported is more than double what was previously required (i.e., from 23 to 48). New or revised data points include applicant or borrower age, credit score, unique loan identifier, property value, application channel, points and fees, borrower-paid origination charges, discount points, lender credits, loan term, prepayment penalty, non-amortizing loan features, interest rate, and loan originator identifier. In addition, the revised rules for identifying borrower race and ethnicity under the revised regulation are more complex. For example, borrowers who identify themselves as Hispanic now have the option of indicating whether they are Mexican, Puerto Rican, Cuban or other, which could include any ethnicity.
The CFPB's Loan Estimate combines some of the disclosures that were provided in the initial Truth in Lending statement with the disclosures that were provided in the RESPA Good Faith Estimate. The form also incorporates other disclosures that are required by Dodd-Frank or are currently provided separately. The Loan Estimate must be delivered or placed in the mail not more than three business days after receipt of an application and not less than seven business days before consummation of the transaction. 
14

The Loan Estimate must provide a "good faith estimate of the closing costs." An estimate is in good faith if the charge paid by or imposed on the consumer does not exceed the amount originally disclosed, with certain exceptions.
The CFPB's Closing Disclosure combines the disclosures that were provided in the final Truth in Lending statement with the disclosures that were provided in the RESPA HUD-1 or HUD-1A settlement statement. Like the Loan Estimate, the form also incorporates other disclosures. The Closing Disclosure generally must state the actual terms of the credit transaction, and the actual costs associated with the settlement of that transaction. The final rule requires that the consumer receive the Closing Disclosure no later than three business days before consummation of the transaction.
Title XIV of Dodd-Frank imposes a number of additional requirements on servicers of residential mortgage loans by amending certain existing provisions and adding new sections to TILA and RESPA. The penalties for noncompliance with TILA and RESPA are also significantly increased by Dodd-Frank and could lead to an increase in lawsuits against mortgage servicers. To that end, on January 10, 2014, the CFPB implemented final rules creating uniform standards for the mortgage servicing industry. The rules increase requirements for communications with borrowers, address requirements around the maintenance of customer account records, govern procedural requirements for responding to written borrower requests and complaints of errors, and provide guidance around servicing of delinquent loans, foreclosure proceedings and loss mitigation efforts, among other measures. On August 4, 2016, the CFPB issued an additional rule to provide certain borrowers with foreclosure protections more than once over the life of a loan, require servicers to provide important information to borrowers in bankruptcy, and provide protections to surviving family members and others who inherit property, and the CFPB issued an interpretive rule to provide servicers with certain safe harbors under the FDCPA. Since becoming effective, these rules have increased costs to service loans across the mortgage industry, including our costs.
Settlement and Enforcement Consent Orders
Several state agencies overseeing the mortgage industry have entered into settlements and enforcement consent orders with mortgage servicers regarding certain foreclosure practices. These settlements and orders generally require servicers, among other things, to: (i) modify their servicing and foreclosure practices, for example, by improving communications with borrowers and prohibiting dual-tracking, which occurs when servicers continue to pursue foreclosure during the loan modification process; (ii) establish a single point of contact for borrowers throughout the loan modification and foreclosure processes; and (iii) establish robust oversight and controls of third party vendors, including outside legal counsel, that provide default management or foreclosure services on their behalf. Many of these practices are considered by regulators, investors and consumer advocates as industry "best practices." As such, we must continually review and consider appropriate adoption of many of these practices as well.
Competition
We operate across several highly competitive and diverse industries, across which we believe our key competitive strengths are our established brand names, well developed direct-to-consumer channels and depth of operating management experience in each of our business segments. In addition, in our Home Lending segment, we believe we have a competitive advantage given that we operate in two distinct channels - distributed retail and direct-to-consumer. There are a limited number of competitors that successfully operate utilizing each of these unique channels on a national level. 
Structured Settlements Competition
The various market participants focused on the purchase of structured settlement, annuity and lottery payment streams are generally small, and competition is primarily based upon marketing, referrals, price and quality of customer service. We compete with established purchasers and, as a result of the relatively low barriers to entry in the industry (low cost of capital, ease of online lead generation, etc.); we also compete with numerous smaller market entrants who enter the market from time to time, particularly when interest rates decrease. 
Many of our competitors with respect to our payment solutions business are larger banks and card providers with diversified consumer bases and strong name recognition, and competition is primarily based upon ATM withdrawal fees and monthly service fees. In our personal lending business, we compete with other lead aggregators, including online intermediaries that operate network-type arrangements, and competition is primarily based upon interest rates and service. We also face competition from lenders that source consumer loan originations directly through their owned and operated websites, by phone or by direct mail. 
Home Lending Competition
The mortgage originations industry is a highly competitive industry. Our competitors include banks, credit unions, mortgage brokers and mortgage banking companies. We compete directly with many large financial institutions, regional or local banking institutions and very organized and branded direct lending or retail lending mortgage loan originators. Competitors can vary by state and region. Competition can take on a variety of levels with competition based on rates, service levels, products, existing customer base and fees.
Employees
15

As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 751 employees, of which 740 were full-time employees. We believe that our relations with our employees are good. None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or represented by an employee union.
Seasonality
Structured Settlements' business is not generally subject to seasonal fluctuations. Home Lending's purchase originations business is generally subject to seasonal fluctuations, as activity tends to diminish somewhat in the months of December, January and February, when home sales volume and loan originations volume are at their lowest. This may result in seasonal fluctuations in Home Lending's revenue. 
Intellectual Property
We own or have rights to trademarks, service marks or trade names that we use in connection with the operation of our business. In addition, our names, logos and website names and addresses are our service marks or trademarks. Some of the trademarks we own or have the right to use include "J.G. Wentworth" and "Peachtree Financial Solutions." Many of our trademarks are highly recognizable and important to our multi-channel direct response marketing platform.
Corporate Information
Our principal executive offices are located at 1200 Morris Drive, Suite 300, Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania 19087-5148 and our telephone number at that address is (484) 434-2300. The J.G. Wentworth Company's corporate website is located at http://corporate.jgwentworth.com/about/. The content on our website is available for information purposes only. It should not be relied upon for investment purposes, nor is it incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless expressly noted.
Implications of being an Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 ("JOBS Act"). As a result, we are permitted to, and have opted to, rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other companies that are not emerging growth companies. In particular, we can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards which allows us to delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We took advantage of the extended transition period as permitted under the JOBS Act. Following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we will no longer file reports with the SEC because we no longer have a class of securities registered under the Exchange Act.
