Item 1. | Business

As used in this annual report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires or indicates, references to “the Company,” “our company,” “we,” “our” and “us” (1) for periods prior to the completion of our formation transactions, refer to The New Home Company LLC and its subsidiaries and affiliates, which we sometimes refer to as “TNHC LLC,” and (2) following the completion of our formation transactions, refer to The New Home Company Inc. and its subsidiaries. The New Home Company LLC was formed on June 25, 2009 as a Delaware limited liability company. On January 30, 2014, in connection with our initial public offering, The New Home Company LLC was converted into a Delaware corporation and renamed The New Home Company Inc., which we refer to as our formation transaction. You should read the following in conjunction with the section titled "Rick Factors", which is included in Part I, Item 1A in this annual report on Form 10-K.
Our Company
We are a new generation homebuilder focused on the design, construction and sale of innovative and consumer-driven homes in major metropolitan areas within select growth markets in California and Arizona, including coastal Southern California, the San Francisco Bay area, metro Sacramento and the greater Phoenix area. We also seek to create unique communities via our significant land development expertise.
We were founded in August 2009, towards the end of an unprecedented downturn in the U.S. homebuilding industry. In January 2014, we completed our initial public offering of shares of our common stock. We believe our management team has extensive and complementary construction, design, marketing, development and entitlement expertise, as well as strong relationships with key land sellers within each of our local markets, and a reputation for quality building, which provide a competitive advantage in being able to acquire land, participate in and create masterplans, obtain entitlements and build quality homes. 
On February 16, 2017, the Company announced the retirement of Wayne Stelmar from his role as Chief Investment Officer.  Effective February 17, 2017, Mr. Stelmar was retained by the Company as a consultant on a part time basis. The Company has also executed an employment agreement with Leonard Miller, pursuant to which he will be hired and appointed as our Chief Operating Officer, effective March 13, 2017.  Mr. Miller was most recently California Regional President for Richmond American Homes, an affiliate of M.D.C. Holdings, Inc., where he served since 2004. Concurrent with Mr. Miller’s appointment, Tom Redwitz, our current Chief Operating Officer, will transition to the role of Chief Investment Officer.
We employ a local market, consumer-driven approach to designing differentiated homes to meet the unique lifestyle needs of homebuyers across a variety of demographics. We believe our approach to market research and construction expertise across an extensive product offering allows us the flexibility to pursue a wide array of land acquisition opportunities and appeals to a broad range of potential homebuyers, including entry-level, move-up, move-down and luxury customers. The homes that we and our unconsolidated joint ventures build range in price from approximately $300,000 to over $9 million, with home sizes ranging from approximately 800 to 6,200 square feet. We believe that customer-focused community creation and product development, as well as exemplary customer service, are key components of the lifestyle connection we seek to establish with each homebuyer. 
Additionally, we strive to enhance the home-buying experience and buyers’ personal investment in their homes by actively engaging them in the selection of design options and upgrades. We believe that our on-site design studios, which allow buyers to personalize our home offerings, are a key source of competitive differentiation and often contribute to greater profitability. In addition to our on-site design studios, we also believe our emphasis on customer care provides us a competitive advantage. In 2013, 2014 and 2015 we were awarded the Eliant Homebuyers’ Choice Award for Best Overall Customer Care Experience. Our commitment to customer satisfaction is a key element of company culture, which fosters an environment where team members can innovate. We believe our reputation for high quality, differentiated architecture and design, as well as high customer satisfaction and company culture, enhances our overall financial performance and generates increased customer loyalty.
Our Business
For financial reporting, we are organized into two reportable segments: homebuilding and fee building. Our homebuilding operations are comprised of divisions in Northern California, Southern California and our newest division in Arizona, which was established during 2015 through the purchase of lots in an unconsolidated joint venture. Although our primary business focus is building and selling homes for our own account, we also have a meaningful fee building business. We believe our fee building business complements our homebuilding business in what we believe to be among the most attractive 
5

masterplan communities in coastal Southern California. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries is usually the general contractor for our and our unconsolidated joint ventures’ projects and retains subcontractors for home construction and land development. For financial information about our segments, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following table shows the percentage of each segment's revenue in relation to our consolidated total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014. For additional information related to geographic location of our homebuilding revenues, see Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations."

We are currently focused on identifying unique sites and creating communities that allow us to design, construct and sell consumer-driven single-family detached and attached homes in major metropolitan areas in coastal Southern California, the San Francisco Bay area, metro Sacramento and the greater Phoenix area. We seek sites where we are rewarded for thoughtful land planning and architecture, and additional defining characteristics of our markets include barriers to entry, job growth, high employment to building permit ratios and increasing populations, which can create growing demand for new housing. Moreover, our management team has deep local market knowledge of the California homebuilding and the land planning and development business. We consider ourselves a local market, consumer-driven homebuilder with expertise across a wide variety of product types and customer segments, including entry-level, move-up, move-down and luxury customer segments. We perform extensive consumer research that helps us create land plans and design homes that meet the needs and desires of our targeted buyers. A key element of our strategy is to allow buyers to personalize their homes regardless of the price point. Each of our communities has an on-site design center with dedicated designers who are knowledgeable about the attributes of the homes offered in the community. We believe that the active participation of buyers in selecting options and upgrades results in buyers becoming more personally invested in their homes, which leads to fewer cancellations.
We seek to maximize returns and reduce exposure to land risk through the use of land options, joint ventures and other flexible land acquisition arrangements. We believe our lot option and joint venture strategy is a key factor in allowing us to leverage our entity-level capital and returns on equity, participate in and develop larger masterplan communities, and establish a homebuilding platform focused on high-growth, land-constrained markets. In addition, we believe that our professional reputation and long-standing relationships with key land sellers, including masterplan community developers, brokers and other builders, as well as our institutional investors and joint venture partners, enable us to acquire well-positioned land parcels in our existing markets as well as new target markets.

Summary of Owned and Controlled Lots

As of December 31, 2016, we owned or controlled an aggregate of 1,576 lots, plus another 935 lots pursuant to our fee building contracts. The following table presents certain information with respect to our wholly owned and fee building lots as of December 31, 2016. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Lots Owned and Controlled" for further detail.

(1) | Includes lots that we control pursuant to option contracts, purchase contracts or non-binding letters of intent that are subject to customary conditions and have not yet closed. There can be no assurance that such acquisitions will occur. 


(2) | Lots owned by third party property owners for which we perform general contracting services.

Acquisition Process
Our land acquisition strategy focuses on purchasing entitled finished, or partially improved land sufficient for construction of homes over a two- to three-year period from the initiation of homebuilding activity. We also selectively acquire parcels that require land development activities. Our acquisition process generally includes the following steps aimed at reducing development and market cycle risk:

• | review of the status of entitlements and other governmental processing, including title reviews;


• | identification of target buyer and appropriate housing product;


• | determination of land plan to accommodate desired housing product;


• | completion of environmental reviews and third-party market studies;


• | preparation of detailed budgets for all cost categories;


• | completion of due diligence on the land parcel prior to committing to the acquisition;


• | utilization of options, joint ventures and other land acquisition arrangements, if necessary;


• | limitation on the size of an acquisition relative to the Company's pro forma capitalization; and


• | centralized acquisition approval process through a tiered Corporate and Executive Committee.

Before purchasing a land parcel, we engage and work closely with outside architects and consultants to design our homes and communities.
We also differentiate our acquisition strategy based on whether the land is in a masterplan community, or part of a larger development. For land which is not part of a larger development or masterplan, we generally enter into a purchase agreement with the land owner and deliver a deposit, which becomes non-refundable upon the expiration of a specified due diligence period. The closing is generally tied to the date on which we have obtained development entitlements for the land. For land which is part of a larger development being developed by a master developer, we generally enter into a purchase agreement with the master developer and pay a deposit that becomes non-refundable upon expiration of the due diligence period. The closing in master developments is generally tied to the issuance of final land development entitlements and completion of certain infrastructure and other improvements by the master developer. In master developments we may acquire all of the land at the closing or we may acquire the land in “phases”. In master developments we may be required to (a) pay to the master developer a share of our net profit in excess of a specified margin and/or (b) grant the master developer the right to repurchase the land if we fail to develop the land in accordance with applicable development requirements or wish to sell the land in bulk. Our acquisition-development financing is generally obtained using one or more of the following: (i) through unsecured lines of credit; (ii) secured acquisition-development loans; (iii) equity obtained from joint venture partners and/or (iv) land bank arrangements with providers who take title to the land at closing subject to agreements which obligate us to perform all development activities with respect to the land and provide us with an option to purchase the land.

Homebuilding, Marketing and Sales Process
The homes that we and our unconsolidated joint ventures are building range in price from approximately $300,000 to over $9 million, with home sizes ranging from approximately 800 to 6,200 square feet. Homebuilding revenue contributed to 73%, 65% and 37% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the average sales price of homes delivered from our communities was approximately $2.0 million, $1.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively. 
We typically develop communities in phases based upon projected sales. We seek to control the timing of construction of subsequent phases in the same community based on sales demand in prior phases and the number of qualified potential homebuyers that exist on our priority buyer list. Our construction process is driven by sales contracts that generally precede the start of the construction of homes. The determination that a potential home buyer is qualified to obtain the financing necessary to complete the purchase is an integral part of our process. Once qualified, our on-site design centers, with designers dedicated to a specific community, work with the buyer to tailor the home to meet the buyer’s needs. This practice is designed to enhance the buyers’ connection to the home and we believe leads to increased option sales.
The design of our homes must conform to zoning requirements, building codes and energy efficiency laws. As a result, we contract with a number of architects and other consultants in connection with the design process. Substantially all of our construction work is done by subcontractors and trade partners with us acting as the general contractor. We also enter into contracts as needed with design professionals and other service providers who are familiar with local market conditions and requirements. We do not have long-term contractual commitments with our subcontractors trade partners, suppliers or laborers. We maintain strong and long-standing relationships with many of our subcontractors and trade partners. We believe that our relationships with subcontractors and trade partners have been enhanced through involving them prior to the start of a new community, maintaining our schedules and making timely payment. By dealing fairly, we believe we are able to keep our key subcontractors and trade partners loyal to us.
Sales and Marketing
In connection with the sale and marketing of our homes, we make extensive use of advertising and other promotional activities, including through our website (www.NWHM.com), social-media, brochures, direct mail and other community-specific collateral materials. The information contained in, or that can be accessed through our website, is not incorporated by reference and is not a part of this annual report on Form 10-K.
We primarily sell our homes through our own sales representatives. Our in-house sales force works from sales offices located in model homes or sales centers close to, or within each community. Sales representatives assist potential buyers by providing them with floor plan, price and community amenity information, construction timetables and tours of model homes. Sales personnel are licensed by applicable real estate bodies in their respective markets and generally have had prior experience selling new homes in the local market.
Generally, we build model homes at each project and have them professionally decorated and landscaped to display design features and options available for purchase in the design center. We believe that model homes play a significant role in helping homebuyers understand the efficiencies and value provided by each floor plan type. Interior decorations vary among our models and are selected based upon the lifestyles of our targeted homebuyers. Structural changes in design from the model homes, other than those predetermined, are not generally permitted, but homebuyers may select various other optional construction and design amenities. Our on-site design centers are an integral part of this process. Specific options are selected for each community based upon the price of the home and anticipated buyer preferences. Options include structural (room configurations or pre-determined additional square footage), electrical, plumbing and finish options (flooring, cabinets, fixtures). In certain communities, we also offer turn-key landscape options. Each design center is managed by our own designers dedicated to the specific community. We believe this approach enables us to create a strong relationship with our buyers that results in fewer cancellations and increased revenue.
We typically sell homes using sales contracts that include cash deposits by the purchasers. Before entering into sales contracts, we pre-qualify our customers through a preferred mortgage provider. However, purchasers can generally cancel sales contracts if they are unable to sell their existing homes, if they fail to qualify for financing, or under certain other circumstances. Although cancellations can delay the sale of our homes, they have historically not had a material impact on our operating results. For our communities, the cancellation rate of buyers who contracted to buy a home but did not close escrow as a percentage of overall orders was 12%, 10% and 13% during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Cancellation rates are subject to a variety of factors, including those beyond our control, such as adverse economic conditions and increases in mortgage interest rates.
8

Customer Financing
At each of our communities, we seek to assist our homebuyers in obtaining financing by arranging with preferred mortgage lenders to offer qualified buyers a variety of financing options. Most homebuyers utilize long-term mortgage financing to purchase a home, and mortgage lenders will usually make loans only to qualified borrowers.
Quality Control and Customer Service
We pay particular attention to the product design process and carefully consider quality and choice of materials in order to attempt to eliminate building deficiencies. The quality and workmanship of the subcontractors and trade partners we employ are monitored using our personnel and third-party consultants. We make regular inspections and evaluations of our subcontractors and trade partners to seek to ensure that our standards are met.
We maintain a quality control and customer service staff whose role includes providing a positive experience for each customer throughout the pre-sale, sale, building, delivery and post-delivery periods. These employees are also responsible for providing after-sales customer service, including the coordination of warranty requests. Our quality and service initiatives include taking homebuyers on a comprehensive tour of their home during construction and prior to delivery. In addition, we use a third party, Eliant, to survey our homebuyers in order to improve our standards of quality and customer satisfaction.
Insurance and Warranty Program
We provide a limited one-year warranty to our homeowners covering workmanship and materials. In addition, we generally provide a more limited warranty, which generally ranges from a minimum of two years up to the period covered by the applicable statute of repose, that covers certain defined construction defects. The limited warranty covering construction defects is transferable to subsequent buyers and provides for the resolution of unresolved construction-related disputes through binding arbitration. Additionally, we have dedicated customer service staff that work with our homebuyers and coordinate with subcontractors and trade partners, as necessary, during the warranty period. We believe that our reserves are adequate to cover the ultimate resolution of our potential liabilities associated with known and anticipated warranty and construction defect related claims and litigation. While our subcontractors who perform our homebuilding work generally provide us with an indemnity for claims relating to their workmanship and materials, we also purchase general liability insurance that covers development and construction activity at each of our communities. Our subcontractors are usually covered by these programs through an owner-controlled insurance program, or "OCIP." Consultants such as engineers and architects are generally not covered by the OCIP but are required to maintain their own insurance. In general, we maintain insurance, subject to deductibles and self-insured amounts, to protect us against various risks associated with our activities, including, among others, general liability, “all-risk” property, construction defects, workers’ compensation, automobile, and employee fidelity. Our warranty reserves include expected costs associated with the deductibles and self-insured amounts.
Seasonality
We have experienced seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements in each of our reportable segments. We typically take orders for more homes in the first half of the fiscal year than in the second half, which creates additional working capital requirements in the second and third quarters to build our inventories to satisfy the deliveries in the second half of the year. We expect this seasonal pattern to continue over the long-term, although it may be affected by volatility in the homebuilding industry.
Backlog
At December 31, 2016 and 2015, homes under contract, but not yet delivered (“backlog”) totaled 79 and 67, respectively, with an estimated sales value of $187.3 million and $166.6 million, respectively. We expect to deliver all of the homes in backlog at December 31, 2016 during 2017 under their existing home order contracts or through the replacement of an existing contract with a new home order contract. The estimated backlog sales value at December 31, 2016 may be impacted by, among other things, subsequent home order cancellations, incentives provided, and/or options and upgrades selected. 
Labor and Raw Materials
Typically, all the raw materials and most of the components used in our business are readily available in the United States. Most are standard items carried by major suppliers. Increases in the cost of building materials and subcontracted labor may reduce gross margins from home sales to the extent that market conditions prevent the recovery of increased costs through higher home sales prices. From time to time and to varying degrees, we may experience shortages in the availability of building materials and/or labor in each of our markets. These shortages and delays may result in delays in the delivery of homes under construction, reduced gross margins from home sales, or both. We continue to monitor the supply markets to achieve favorable prices.
9

Joint Ventures
Our joint venture strategy has been instrumental in leveraging our entity-level capital and establishing a homebuilding and land development platform focused on high-growth, land-constrained markets. We own interests in our unconsolidated joint ventures that generally range from 5% to 35%. We also earn management fees from such joint ventures.
We serve as the administrative member, manager or managing member of each of our nine homebuilding and four land development joint ventures. We do not, however, exercise control over the joint ventures, as the joint venture agreements generally provide our respective partners with the right to consent to certain actions. Under most joint venture agreements, certain major decisions must be approved by the applicable joint venture’s executive committee, which is comprised of both our representatives and representatives of our joint venture partners. In addition, some of our joint venture agreements grant both partners a buy-sell right pursuant to which, subject to certain exceptions, either partner may initiate procedures requiring the other partner to choose between selling its interest to the other partner or buying the other partner’s interest. Additional information related to our unconsolidated joint ventures is set forth in Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations." 
Fee Building Services
Although our primary business focus is building and selling homes for our own account, we also selectively provide general contracting services to build homes for independent third-party property owners. We refer to these projects as “fee building projects.” For the year ended December 31, 2016, 96% of our fee building revenue represents fee building billings and 4% represents management fees from unconsolidated joint ventures. Our services with respect to fee building projects may include design, development, construction and sale of the homes. We earn revenue on our fee building projects either as a flat fee for the project or as a percentage of the cost or revenue of the project depending upon the terms of the agreement with our customer. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, fee building revenue contributed to 27%, 35% and 63%, respectively, of total revenue. The Company’s fee building revenues have historically been concentrated with a small number of customers.  We have several fee building agreements with Irvine Pacific, LP and revenues from this customer totaled 26%, 32%, and 55% of our total consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our billings to this customer are dependent upon such customer’s decision to proceed with construction and the agreements can be canceled at any time. We cannot predict whether these agreements will continue in the future or the current pace of construction, and the loss of these billings could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Item 7, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Fee Building" and Note 1 "Revenue Recognition - Fee Building" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this revenue concentration.
Government Regulation and Environmental Matters
We are subject to numerous local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction and similar matters, which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements, the result of which is to limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Communities that are not entitled may be subjected to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees and exactions for communities in their jurisdiction. Communities for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety and welfare issues, which can further delay these communities or prevent their development.
We are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given homebuilding site vary according to multiple factors, including the site’s location, its environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. In addition, in those cases where an endangered or threatened species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the restriction or elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. Legislation related to climate change and energy efficiency can impose stricter building standards, which may increase our cost to build. From time to time, the EPA and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions taken with respect to us may increase our costs. Further, we expect that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on homebuilders in the future. Environmental regulations can also have an 
10

adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber. California is especially susceptible to restrictive government regulations and environmental laws.
Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases, and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for related damages, including for bodily injury, and for investigation and clean-up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. A mitigation system may be installed during the construction of a home if a cleanup does not remove all contaminants of concern or to address a naturally occurring condition such as methane. Some buyers may not want to purchase a home with a mitigation system.
Competition
We believe our on-site design studios, emphasis on customer care, and reputation for high quality, differentiated architecture and design provides us a competitive advantage; however, competition in the homebuilding industry is intense, and there are relatively low barriers to entry into our business. We compete with numerous homebuilders of varying sizes. A number of our primary competitors are significantly larger, have a longer operating history and may have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us. Accordingly, they may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, home-buying customers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials and skilled labor. Our competitors may independently develop land and construct homes that are superior or substantially similar to our products. We also compete for sales with individual resales of existing homes and with available rental housing. Increased competition could hurt our business, as it could prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, and lead to pricing pressures on our homes that may adversely impact our revenues and margins. If we are unable to successfully compete, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 289 employees, 114 of whom were executive, management and administrative personnel located in our offices, 60 of whom were sales and marketing personnel and 115 were involved in field construction. Although none of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, certain of the third party subcontractors and trade partners engaged by us are represented by labor unions or are subject to collective bargaining arrangements. We believe that relations with our employees, subcontractors and trade partners are good.
