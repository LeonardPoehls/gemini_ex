GENERAL
 
The following is a summary of some of the information contained in this document. Unless the context requires otherwise, references in this document to “our Company,” “us,” “we,” “our.” “Greenhouse Solutions" or the "Company" are to Greenhouse Solutions, Inc.
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS 
 
Our Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on April 8, 2009. We were previously involved in the sale and distribution of urban gardening products and greenhouses in the North American market, but we are currently expanding the business into the development, marketing, production, and sale of hemp oil enhanced products for both personal health use and canine use, in addition to probiotic-based nutraceuticals. As a nutraceutical company, we are engaging in the acquisition, licensing and commercialization of nutraceutical products and technologies. We seek strategic licensing partnerships to reduce the risks associated with the drug development process. We maintain a website at www.ghsolutionsinc.com. Such website is not incorporated into or a part of this filing. We are no longer pursuing our greenhouse design and consulting operations.

COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
NUTRACEUTICAL PRODUCTS
 
We previously expanded our business model with efforts in the development, marketing, production, and sales of hemp oil products for both the personal health and companion pet markets utilizing a licensed probiotic delivery system (US Patent #6,080,401) and other licensed formulas. Hemp is naturally occurring from both the cannabis and hemp species of the Cannabis Sativa plant. The extracted oil is non-psychoactive and is actively being researched and investigated by others for use in a number of conditions, including: Dravet Syndrome, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), depression and schizophrenia. As research continues into the broad spectrum of uses for hemp oil products, We intend to produce and sell various products for the wellness marketplace that utilize hemp oil and Phyto cannabinoids.
 
In furtherance of our objectives, on November 5, 2015, the Company signed a Joint Venture Agreement with KOIOS, LLC to develop and market a hemp protein-based energy drink utilizing KOIOS proprietary formulae.
 
On November 19, 2015, the Company signed a Master License Agreement with Dr. M.S. Reddy. Dr. Reddy has developed intellectual property for the nutritional industries pertaining exclusively to the use of hemp and hemp related products in combination with the probiotics. The Company has agreed to acquire an exclusive license from Dr. Reddy for use of the intellectual property in the products and proprietary formulations of products for marketing. In consideration for the license, the Company issued Dr. Reddy 3,000,000 shares of the Company's restricted common stock. Dr. Reddy shall be paid 20% of the net profit from sales of each quantity of licensed products sold on a 45 day trailing basis and Dr. Reddy may demand accounting at any time.
 
KOIOS JOINT VENTURE
 
The Company entered into a Joint Venture with KOIOS, LLC to develop and market a hemp protein-based energy drink. Koios is a nootropic supplement developer, with products that support cognitive function and mental clarity. Together with Koios, we developed a new addition to its beverage product line called “Raspberry Wonder,” an infusion of its proprietary and successful blend of nootropics with hemp oil. Hemp seed oil generally contains a 3:1 ratio of Omega 6 (linolei/LA) to Omega 3 (alpha-linoleic/LNA) essential fatty acids, which has been suggested as a ratio that may increase long-term human nutrition. In addition, hemp seed oil also contains smaller amounts of three other polyunsaturated fatty acids in gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), oleic acid and stearidonic acid. This essential fatty acid combination is thought to be unique among edible oil seeds. Raspberry Wonder is marketed as a dietary supplement to enhance brain function, boost energy and burn fat, the Raspberry Wonder is available to purchase through Koios’ website, www.mentaltitan.com, as well as at stores throughout the country. Work is underway now to develop the next generation of Raspberry Wonder, which will use the Company’s patent-protected process to suspend active probiotics in the beverage.
 
In order to market the product, the Company and Koios ran a promotion and as a result, we had identified target distributors who indicated an interest in distributing our product. Among them are:
 
 
· | Europa Sports Products Inc. (“Europa Sports”) recently merged with Lone Star distribution, making them the largest distributor of Sports Nutrition Products in the country, representing over 50,000 locations. Our target is that the product will arrive at Koios in the last week in August or first week of September.

Our joint venture, Koios, uses a brokerage firm to help facilitate new store openings along with adding new stores in the Midwest region. Koios is focused on the Midwest region because main competitors do not have a presence in these areas and there is a strong desire for natural and organic alternatives. 
 
Koios has also invested significant time and effort into creating a user-friendly and attractive online environment, gaining approximately 6,000 Instagram followers and approximately 9,000 Facebook followers.
 
Koios continues to expand thier ambassador network and drive traffic to the brand. Currently, Koios athletes and ambassadors are estimated to have a combined audience of over a million people. Koios has continued to tap into the world of CrossFit and e-sports. Koios recently attended the CrossFit games, which led to approximately 20 new CrossFit gyms that carry Koios products and that will also carry the Raspberry Wonder beverage with the Company’s hemp oil. 
 
Koios recently entered into an agreement with a Denver-based distributor, Hyperion Wholesale. Koios believes that this new relationship we will add over 300 new stores that carry their products, including Raspberry Wonder, by the end of 2016. As a result of the relationship with Hyperion, ten new 7-Eleven stores and several other convenience stores across Colorado’s Front Range. 
 
WishingUWell is Koios’ online distributor, with a web presence on Amazon.com. 
 
OTHER PRODUCTS
 
The Company intends to generate future revenues from sales of our hemp oil enhanced products for both the personal health and companion pet markets, as well as seeking out other joint venture opportunities in which our hemp oil can be used.
 
The Company is working with a major health supplement developer to produce water-soluble, probiotic infused Phytocannabinoid oils in an ingredient for nutraceutical product manufacturers. The water solubility of probiotics, an exclusively licensed innovation of the Company, means that this ingredient could be integrated into any number of formulations, including capsules and foods, as well as beverages. A major American university is engaged in a full study of the compound to establish the health benefits of this new ingredient. With this, the Company is also engaged in research and development of a new probiotic hemp oil-infused cold-brew coffee beverage.

Due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient revenues from our operating activities and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due, in their report on our financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, our registered independent auditors included additional comments indicating concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our financial statements contain additional note disclosures describing the circumstances that led to this disclosure by our registered independent auditors. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.
 
CORPORATE STRATEGY
 
We have shifted our focus entirely to nutraceutical products for humans and animals.
 
NUTRACEUTICAL PRODUCTS
 
Cannabidiol is a naturally-occurring substance found in both the cannabis and hemp species of the Cannabis Sativa plant and is generally marketed through hemp oil as a nutritional supplement. The extracted oil is non-psychoactive and is being researched by others for possible prescription for a number of conditions, including: Dravet Syndrom, Multiple Sclerosis (MS), depression, and schizophrenia. As research continues into the broad spectrum of uses for hemp oil derived products, we intend to seek to develop various products for the wellness marketplace that may utilize the ingredient.
 
We have begun to develop, market, produce, and sell hemp oil products, through the Koios Joint Venture, for personal health and may also enter the companion pet market, some of which may utilize a licensed probiotic delivery system (US Patent #6,080,401). We acquired a limited license to use the above referenced Patent developed by scientist Dr. M.S. Reddy for hemp oil and cannabis based products. Dr. Reddy's patent covers a wide variety of therapeutic and nutraceutical cannabis and industrial hemp products. We also acquired exclusive license rights to a number of proprietary nutraceutical formulations from MGRD, Inc., owned by Officer and Directors Rik Deitsch. 
 
Dr. Reddy's licensed patent includes the introduction of probiotics as part of the delivery method for certain therapeutics. Probiotics are bacteria or micro-organisms that are beneficial to the health of an individual. They are essentially an opposite of antibiotics, which are inhibitory to other bacteria, including probiotic bacteria. Probiotics are predominately lactic acid producing bacteria. In contrast to herbal medicine, probiotics developed as a science only recently; and this science remains unacknowledged by many medical practitioners. One of the earliest discoveries that bacteria can improve human health was by Dr. Metchnikoff, a Russian scientist, in 1907. Since then, there have been favorable reports about probiotics’ utility, including, for example, that lactobacillus acidophilus reduces colon cancer in humans. In 2011, experts at Yale University reviewed the research. They concluded that probiotics are most effective for, but not limited to: Treating childhood diarrhea, treating ulcerative colitis, treating necrotizing enterocolitis (a type of infection and inflammation of the intestines mostly seen in infants), preventing antibiotic-associated diarrhea and infectious diarrhea, preventing pouchitis (an inflammation of the intestines that can follow intestinal surgery), treating and preventing eczema associated with cow’s milk allergy, helping the immune system, treating symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, treating vaginitis, treating diarrhea caused by C. difficile bacteria, and treating Crohn’s disease.
 
The use of pre- and pro-biotics have become commonplace in the last few years, with research providing evidence for their benefit in the treatment and prevention of a variety of gastrointestinal issues, as well as immune system dysfunctions. Probiotics are bacteria or micro-organisms that are beneficial to the health of an individual. The license includes the introduction of probiotics as part of the delivery method for certain therapeutic products derived from hemp or cannabis (at this time being only CBD without THC). We intend to develop different therapeutic products with the help of probiotics, with the design to deliver therapy more efficiently and at lower dosages, intending to reduce possible complications, as well as increasing efficacy. 
 
The Company intends to pursue different products that incorporate both hemp oil, and the licensed water-soluble probiotics, whether we produce them or we enter other joint ventures to achieve our goals.

ONLINE RETAIL OF PRODUCTS
 
We intend to expand our online marketing of our products through our website, in addition to promoting the sales of our joint venture products through our website.
Strategic Focus
 
Our corporate strategy in developing our operations is as follows:
 
To design and produce hemp oil enhanced nutraceutical products for sale to the general public.
 
We intend to create hemp oil products that contain formulations unseen in the current market in the nutraceuticals industry. We believe that our formulations will set us apart from competing products for promoting health.
 
We have a license agreement for exclusive rights to formulations for hemp oil products, intended for, subject to performance, treating various symptoms of diseases and ailments. We intend to begin manufacturing and marketing of these hemp oil products with expansion of products over the next five years.
 
To further the joint venture relationship with Koios and seek other ventures where possible.
 
We plan to expand our relationship with Koios where possible, including potentially adding the probiotic aspect to the beverage selection, and seek out other opportunities for joint ventures with different product categories. 
 
COMPETITION, MARKETS, REGULATION AND TAXATION
 
COMPETITION
 
Nutraceutical Industry
 
The nutraceutical industry is subject to significant competition and pricing pressures. We may experience significant competitive pricing pressures as well as competitive products. Several significant competitors may offer products with prices that may match or are lower than ours. We believe that the products we offer are generally competitive with those offered by other supplement and nutraceutical companies; however, we believe that our products are unique and will set themselves apart from competing products. It is possible that one or more of our competitors could develop a significant research advantage over us that allows them to provide superior products or pricing, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage. Continued pricing pressure or improvements in research and shifts in customer preferences away from natural supplements could adversely impact our customer base or pricing structure and have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 
MARKETS
 
The user market for hemp oil products and other nutraceuticals is generally an individual who has a specific health issue where a health advisor or distributor has provided or directed that user to our product. The market for nutraceuticals is subject to many influential factors, but the main issues affecting the market are consumer spending and government regulation.
 
The market for greenhouses includes household consumers and agricultural businesses alike. The market for greenhouses may see increased demand amongst agricultural businesses, particularly in states like Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, with the legalization of cannabis.
 
REGULATION OF NUTRACEUTICALS
 
The formulation, manufacturing, processing, labeling, packaging, advertising and distribution of our products are subject to regulation by several federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”), the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (“USDA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”). These activities are also regulated by various agencies of the states and localities in which our products are sold. The FDA regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of dietary supplements (including vitamins, minerals, and herbs) and cosmetics, whereas the FTC has jurisdiction to regulate the advertising of these products.

The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (“DSHEA”) defines “dietary supplements” as vitamins, minerals, herbs, other botanicals, amino acids and other dietary substances for human use to supplement the diet, as well as concentrates, metabolites, constituents, extracts or combinations of such dietary ingredients. New dietary ingredients (those not marketed in the U.S. prior to October 15, 1994) must be the subject of a notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” The notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing of the new dietary ingredient. The FDA has issued guidance regarding the content of a new dietary ingredient notification. Should the FDA choose to enforce the guidance, it could have a negative effect on the innovation and continued marketing of dietary supplements; the FDA may not accept any particular evidence of safety for any new dietary ingredient, preventing the marketing of those dietary ingredients.
 
DSHEA permits “statements of nutritional support” to be included in labeling for dietary supplements without premarket FDA approval, however, such statements must be submitted within 30 days of marketing and must bear a label disclosure that “This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.” Statements of nutritional support may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect body structure, function or well-being, but may not expressly or implicitly represent that a dietary supplement will diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent a disease. A company using such statements must possess scientific evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. Any statements determined to be outside of these guidelines or unsubstantiated would be prevented from being used.
 
DSHEA also provides that so-called “third-party literature,” a peer-reviewed scientific publication linking a particular dietary ingredient with health benefits, may be used “in connection with the sale of a dietary supplement to consumers” without the literature being subject to regulation as labeling. Third-party literature must not be false or misleading; the literature may not “promote” a particular manufacturer or brand of dietary supplement; and a balanced view of the available scientific information on the subject matter must be presented. Any dissemination of non-compliant literature could subject our product to regulatory action as an illegal drug. 
 
The FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) regulations require dietary supplements to be prepared, packaged and held in compliance with strict rules, and require quality control provisions similar to those in the GMP regulations for drugs. The FDA could in the future choose to inspect one of our facilities for compliance with these regulations and could cause non-compliant products made or held in the facility to be subject to FDA enforcement actions.
 
The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of the FDCA and their regulation of foods, dietary supplements and cosmetics may increase or become more restrictive in the future. Additional legislation could be passed which would impose substantial new regulatory requirements for dietary supplements, potentially raising our costs and hindering our business.
 
Our advertising is subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In recent years the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of dietary supplement and weight loss products and companies. Additionally, some states also permit advertising and labeling laws to be enforced by private attorney generals, who may seek relief for consumers, seek class action certifications, seek class wide damages and product recalls of products sold by us. Any of these types of adverse actions against us by governmental authorities or private litigants could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
In addition to FDA and FTC regulations, our products may face further regulation under the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, which governs international trade and domestic control of narcotic substances including cannabis extracts. Countries may interpret and implement their treaty obligations in a way that creates a legal obstacle to our obtaining marketing approval for our products in those countries. These countries may not be willing or able to amend or otherwise modify their laws and regulations to permit our products to be marketed, or achieving such amendments to the laws and regulations may take a prolonged period of time. In the case of countries with similar obstacles, we would be unable to market our product candidates in countries in the near future or perhaps at all if the laws and regulations in those countries do not change.
 


8

CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE REGULATION
 
At some point our products may be developed and be subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations and failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, may adversely affect the results of our business operations, both during clinical development and post approval, and our financial condition.
 
Certain products we may develop could contain controlled substances as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA. Controlled substances that are pharmaceutical products are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, no currently “accepted medical use” in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II drugs is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription. We do not intend to produce “controlled substances” at this time, due to regulatory complications.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES
 
Other than time spent researching our proposed business we have not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. We do not currently plan to spend any funds on research and development activities in the future.
COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS
 
As we begin to manufacture nutraceutical products, we or our contract manufacturers will become subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of our products and our non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water and groundwater. Failure to comply with those laws and regulations could result in costs for corrective action, penalties or the imposition of other liabilities. Changes in environmental laws or the interpretation thereof or the development of new facts could also cause us to incur additional capital and operational expenditures to maintain compliance with environmental laws and regulations. We will also become subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment without regard to fault or knowledge about the condition or action causing the liability. Failure to comply with environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.
EMPLOYEES
 
We have one full-time employee at the present time, John Michak, our COO. Our officers and directors are responsible for planning, developing and operational duties, and will continue to do so throughout the early stages of our growth. We have no intention of hiring additional employees until we have sufficient, reliable revenue from our operations. We do not have written employment agreements with any of our officers or directors at this time.

REPORTS TO SECURITIES HOLDERS
 
We provide an annual report that includes audited financial information to our shareholders. We will make our financial information equally available to any interested parties or investors through compliance with the disclosure rules for a small business issuer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We are subject to disclosure filing requirements including filing Form 10K annually and Form 10Q quarterly. In addition, we will file Form 8K and other proxy and information statements from time to time as required. We do not intend to voluntarily file the above reports in the event that our obligation to file such reports is suspended under the Exchange Act. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ("SEC"), at the SEC's Public Reference Room at 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site (http://www.sec.gov) that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.
