General Discussion

We intend on complying with the dividend policy set forth in our prior filings, and more specifically, our registration statement on Form S-11/A. We currently operate through related-party/affiliate entities in holding title to those single family residences in our portfolio – American Realty Partners, LLC (“American Realty”), ARP Borrower, LLC (“ARP Borrower”), ARP Borrower II, LLC (“ARP Borrower II”), AHIT Valfre, LLP, a Maryland limited liability partnership (“AHIT Valfre”), and AHIT Northern NM Properties, LLP, a Maryland limited liability partnership (“AHIT Northern”).

The Company will continue to acquire, renovate, lease, and manage primarily single-family residential properties, and engage in such other activities as are reasonably incidental to the foregoing. More specifically, the Company intends on engaging in the business of purchasing real estate for the purpose of making cosmetic changes, repairs, and other enhancements in order to increase the value of the properties, and then rent such property to tenants. The Company does not intend to acquire commercial properties. We intend to conduct our operations so that neither we nor any of our subsidiaries are required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the 1940 Act.
 
The Company recently acquired IX Biotechnology, Inc. (“IXB”). IXB aims to be the largest producer of certified organic cannabidiol (“CBD”) oil in the United States. IXB was developed as a joint venture combining several strategic partners, including the Shoshone, Battle Mountain and Washoe Indian tribes, as well as combing various concepts and industry-specific knowledge in commercial hemp and cannabis research and sales. These relationships enable IXB access to tribal lands for farming commercial hemp and cannabis, and will allow IXB to sell hemp and cannabis products in retail outlets on tribal lands. IXB will be a full integrated seed to shelf certified organic biotechnology company. As a result of the acquisition, the Company will continue to manage its real estate assets, while diversifying its portfolio to include the expansion and development of IXB’s CBD technologies.

(1) Manley Purchase Agreements 
 
The Company entered into a Real Property Purchase Agreement with Benny J. Manley and Patricia A. Manley (collectively “Manley”), referred to in the Company’s filings as the “Manley Purchase Agreement.” Pursuant to the Manley Purchase Agreement, the Company acquired a residential property from Manley in exchange for the issuance of 722,883 shares of the Company’s restricted common stock. Additionally, the Company took title to the property subject to the property indebtedness in the agreed amount of $563,755 (the “Property Indebtedness”). The Property Indebtedness includes a Promissory Note between the Company and Marcus E. Cox and Dolores A. Cox, trustees of the Marcus E. Cox and Dolores A. Cox November 1995 Living Trust (the “Cox Trust”), in the amount of $314,831 (the “Cox Note”) and the assumption of the mortgage note in the amount of $248,924. The acquisition closed on April 11, 2016.
 
The Cox Note releases Manley’s preexisting loan obligations and deed of trust with the Cox Trust, as the Company agreed to assume the debt. The Cox Note and a new deed of trust was filed by the Cox Trust after closing of the Manley Purchase Agreement. Manley acknowledged that it remains a party to any and all agreements associated with the Property Indebtedness; however, the Company agreed to indemnify and hold Manley harmless from any and all future obligations owed on the Property Indebtedness after Closing.
 
(2) AHIT Valfre Restructuring 
 
On April 18, 2016, AHIT Valfre closed its internal restructuring and financing with FirstKey Mortgage, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“FirstKey Mortgage”). The Company was the General Partner of AHIT Valfre prior to the closing of the financing with FirstKey Mortgage. In order to accommodate the underwriting requirements of FirstKey Mortgage, the Company, as General Partner, and Valfre Holdings, LLC, James Valfre and Pamela Valfre, as Limited Partners, agreed to the First Amended Limited Liability Partnership Agreement dated March 25, 2016 (“AHIT Valfre First Amended Partnership Agreement”). The AHIT Valfre First Amended Partnership Agreement was not effective until the closing of the financing with FirstKey Mortgage (“AHIT Valfre First Amended Partnership Agreement”).
 
The partners in AHIT Valfre agreed to restructure their respective interests in the partnership resulting in AHIT Valfre GP, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company (“AHIT Valfre GP”) and AHIT Valfre Limiteds, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company (“AHIT Valfre Limiteds”) serving as General Partner and Limited Partner, respectively, of AHIT Valfre. AHIT Valfre filed its Amended Certificate of Limited Liability Partnership with the State of Maryland on April 20, 2016 setting forth the restructuring.
 
The Company is the sole member of AHIT Valfre GP. American Realty is defined as the “Springing Member” under the Operating Agreement for AHIT Valfre GP and AHIT Valfre Limiteds. As Springing Member, American Realty agreed to certain duties and responsibilities in the event of an occurrence of any event causing the last remaining member of AHIT Valfre GP or AHIT Valfre Limiteds to cease to be a member of the particular company, other than (i) an assignment by the last remaining members of all of its membership interest in the company and the admission of a new member pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Operating Agreement, or (ii) the resignation of the member and the admission of an additional member of the Company pursuant to Section 6.1 of the Operating Agreement.

As the Springing Member, American Realty agreed that it shall, without any action of any person and simultaneously with the member ceasing to be a member of the Company, automatically be admitted to AHIT Valfre GP or AHIT Valfre Limiteds, as the case may be, as a “Special Member,” and shall continue the company without dissolution. As the Special Member, American Realty would have no interest in the profits, losses and/or capital of the company and no right to receive any distributions of company’s assets. In addition, American Realty would not have the right to any conversion options under Section 721 of the Internal Revenue Code. Other than its wholly-owned subsidiary having the “Springing Member” interest in AHIT Valfre Limiteds, the Company has no interest in AHIT Valfre Limiteds.
 
The previously disclosed substantive rights, duties and obligations of the General Partner and the Limited Partner under the AHIT Valfre Limited Liability Partnership Agreement dated August 1, 2015, remain, for the most part, consistent with the AHIT Valfre First Amended Partnership Agreement. However, the partners under the AHIT Valfre First Amended Partnership Agreement have agreed that, rather than the limited partnership interests being held in the name of the individual limited partners, AHIT Valfre Limiteds would be issued 300,026 limited partnership interests, which are subsequently broken down into the number of membership units held by Valfre Holdings, LLC (69,555), James Valfre (192,050) and Pamela Valfre (38,421) in AHIT Valfre Limiteds under its special purpose entity Operating Agreement. Furthermore, in order to meet the underwriting requirements of FirstKey, for purposes of identification of equity interests in AHIT Valfre, the partners agreed that AHIT Valfre GP, as the General Partner, would retain a 1% equity ownership in AHIT Valfre and AHIT Valfre Limiteds, as Limited Partner, would retain a 99% equity ownership in the Partnership, subject to the balance of the provisions of the AHIT Valfre First Amended Agreement.
 
The Company holds title to ten properties through AHIT Valfre. In addition to the nine properties previously titled to AHIT Valfre, American Realty conveyed the property located at 920 West Joy Ranch Road in Phoenix, Arizona to AHIT Valfre in order to accommodate the financing with FirstKey Mortgage, and in turn, the Company, American Realty, AHIT Valfre GP and AHIT Valfre Limiteds agreed to indemnify and hold FirstKey Mortgage harmless from any and all claims, actions or other losses related to the conveyance. As a result, AHIT Valfre holds title to ten properties financed through FirstKey Mortgage. All profits and income from these properties are allocated to the Company under the First Amended Limited Liability Partnership Agreement. 
 
The debt that had been assumed by AHIT Valfre has been paid off through the Loan Cooperation Agreement between (a) FirstKey Mortgage, as Lender, (b) AHIT Valfre, as Borrower, (c) AHIT Valfre GP and AHIT Valfre Limiteds, as Pledgors, and (d) our Chairman of the Board and Chief Financial Officer, and beneficial owner, Sean Zarinegar, as Sponsor. The principal amount of the Balloon Note under the Loan Cooperation Agreement is $1,203,600 with interest accruing at 6.070% with a monthly payment of $7,270.45. The Balloon Note matures on May 1, 2021, absent any events of default thereunder. In addition to granting one or more mortgages or deeds of trust to FirstKey as collateral, the Company has guaranteed the obligations of AHIT Valfre, and AHIT Valfre GP and AHIT Valfre Limiteds have provided guaranties and have pledged their interests in their respective entities to FirstKey Mortgage.

(3) AHIT Northern NM Properties, LLP
 
On July 13, 2016, the Company and Northern New Mexico Properties, LLC, a New Mexico limited liability company (“NM”) entered into a Master UPREIT Formation Agreement (the “UPREIT Agreement”). Pursuant to the UPREIT Agreement, the Company and NM agreed to organize and operate an umbrella limited liability partnership organized in Maryland called “AHIT Northern NM Properties, LLP" (“AHIT Northern”). In anticipation of the Master UPREIT Agreement, the Company organized AHIT Northern in Maryland on June 22, 2016. NM’s member, Les Gutierrez, was appointed director on the Company’s Board of Directors.
 The Company is the General Partner of AHIT Northern pursuant to the UPREIT Agreement, Contribution Agreements and all related documents, including but not limited to the UPREIT Partnership Agreement (collectively, the “AHIT Northern Agreements.”). Pursuant to the AHIT Northern Agreements, in consideration for the conveyance of the seven single family residences, with an agreed upon net asset valuation of $1,333,000, to AHIT Northern, which were acquired by AHIT Northern “subject to” existing mortgages, AHIT Northern issued limited partnership interests (collectively, the “Limited Partnership Interests” or singularly a “Limited Partnership Interest”) to NM (500,614) and the Company (5,006).
 The Company and NM entered into the AHIT Northern Agreements contemplating, amongst other things that AHIT Northern would be operated to reduce risk and increase diversification of real estate holdings, and to seize an opportunity for AHIT Northern NM Properties, LLC for estate and tax planning purposes through an exchange under Section 721 of the Internal Revenue Code (defined in the AHIT Northern Agreements as the “Intended Tax Treatment”). More specifically, commencing on July 13, 2017, the Limited Partnership Interests held by NM shall be convertible, at the option of the holder thereof, at any time and from time to time, and without the payment of additional consideration by the holder thereof, into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock in the Company on a 1:1 basis. AHIT Northern may require any holder of a Limited Partnership Interest to convert each of his, her or its Limited Partnership Interest into the number of fully paid and nonassessable shares of common stock in the Company after July 13, 2017. The Company consented to waiving similar conversion rights.
 The AHIT Northern transaction closed on August 10, 2016.
 
(4) The Company Engages Tobin & Company
 On August 18, 2016, the Company executed an Engagement Letter (the “Agreement”) with Tobin & Company Securities, LLC, a North Carolina limited liability company (“Tobin”). Tobin provides a variety of financial services, including identifying, evaluating, negotiating, and securing financing sources for its clients. Pursuant to the Agreement, Tobin and its exclusive client representative Justin Floyd (“Floyd”) are providing the following services to the Company: (i) identify and/or locate prospective capital sources for the Company, (ii) develop and furnish material(s) describing the Company’s business to such prospective capital sources, (iii) introduce such prospective capital sources to the Company, (iv) and assist in the negations with prospective capital sources.

In exchange for Tobin’s services, the Company provided a non-refundable retainer fee of $20,000. Upon the Company’s securing of investment through capital sources introduced to the Company by Tobin or Floyd, Tobin will receive an additional fee equal to five percent (5%) of the total debt or equity proceeds received by the Company from the capital source(s), known as a “Success Fee.” The term of the Agreement is (6) months, beginning on July 15, 2016 (the “Initial Term”). After the Initial Term, the Agreement automatically renews on a month-to-month basis, unless terminated by either party with fifteen (15) days’ notice.
 
(5) Restructuring of Performance Realty Management
 
On July 28, 2016, Performance Realty was issued 439,401 shares of common stock in the Company pursuant to a Designation and Acceptance of Rights (the “Designation”) entered into between Performance Realty, the Company, and the “Designor” under the Designation - Sean Zarinegar, who at the time served as the Chairman of the Board and Chief Financial Officer for the Company.
 
The Designation was unanimously approved by the Company’s Board of Directors with Mr. Zarinegar abstaining from vote. This issuance resulted in Performance Realty owning 1,439,401 shares of issued and outstanding common stock in the Company, of which 1,000,000 shares issued on September 28, 2015 were registered with the Company’s registration statement on Form S-11 with an effective date of June 22, 2016. This issuance did not adjust Mr. Zarinegar’s beneficial ownership in the Company; however, it did increase Performance Realty’s beneficial ownership to 1,439,401, or 16%.
 
On August 15, 2016, as part of a restructuring of related parties, Performance Realty and the Company closed on a Stock Exchange and Restructuring Agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”). Pursuant to the Articles of Amendment to Articles of Organization of Performance Realty dated April 1, 2016, the Class A Units have preference over the common units in Performance Realty, on, amongst other things, “…any future reorganization or stock exchange on a pro rata basis, as determined by [Mr. Zarinegar, as Manager].” Furthermore, pursuant to the disclosures in the Private Offering for Performance Realty under Rule 506(b) of Regulation D, which resulted in the issuance of 144 (rounded up) Class A Units to forty-eight holders, and Section 3.3(t) of the Operating Agreement for Performance Realty, which had been attached as an exhibit to the Private Offering, Mr. Zarinegar, as Manager, was granted limited power of attorney by each Class A Unit holder to vote their respective proxy on any future exchange, such as the one agreed to in the Exchange Agreement. As a result of the closing of the Exchange Agreement, those prior members of Performance Realty at Exhibit A of the Exchange Agreement were issued shares of common stock in the Company, which was subsequently modified through the Consent of the Board of Directors regarding the issuance, and which will be forth in the updated Selling Shareholder chart in the Post-Effective Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form S-11.
 
Prior to the Exchange Agreement, Performance Realty had represented that its business model and intent was to expand on its property management services for other real estate investment trusts, or other property holding and operating companies, similar to the services rendered as manager of American Realty Partners, LLC, an Arizona limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. However, Mr. Zarinegar, as authorized under the Operating Agreement for Performance Realty, determined, exercising his sound business judgment and discretion, that the Class A Unit holders would benefit from an issuance of shares in the Company considering the trajectory of the Company’s acquisitions, and the fact that the Company is publicly reporting with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) and trades on the OTCQB marketplace.

The Company determined that the exchange of units for stock between related parties under the Exchange Agreement was beneficial to its overall capital structure. For United States federal income tax purposes, the transactions contemplated in the Exchange Agreement were intended to qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (together with all rules and regulations issued thereunder (the “Code”)) and the Exchange Agreement was intended to be adopted as a plan of reorganization for purposes of Section 368 of the Code. Notwithstanding this intention, Performance Realty and the Company have advised the Class A Unit members of Performance Realty that it was not passing on whether the exchange actually qualifies for a tax-free event under the Code; rather, the parties advised the Performance Realty members of the intended treatment set forth herein.
 
(6) Other Business Developments
 
On March 13, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement with IX Biotechnology, Inc. (“IXB”). The Stock Exchange Agreement resulted in a change in control of the Company, a restructuring of the Board of Directors, and the acquisition of cannabidiol oil assets and technologies. This acquisition may have a material effect on the Company’s business and operations moving forward. For more information, the Company incorporates by reference its Periodic Report on Form 8-K dated March 16, 2017.
