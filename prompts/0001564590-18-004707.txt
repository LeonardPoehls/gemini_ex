Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a medical device company focused on the development and commercialization of polymer-based bioresorbable products for vascular applications. On April 3, 2017, our second generation and first commercial product, Fantom, was approved for sale under a CE Mark, which allows us to commercialize in Europe and other jurisdictions that recognize the CE Mark. Fantom is a sirolimus-eluting bioresorbable scaffold designed specifically for coronary vascular applications. We believe Fantom is uniquely positioned to meet a market opportunity because of its distinctive features. Fantom is the only bioresorbable scaffold made from Tyrocore™, our proprietary tyrosine-derived polymer designed specifically for vascular scaffold applications. Tyrocore is inherently x-ray visible, making Fantom the first and only bioresorbable scaffold that is fully visible under x-ray.  Fantom is designed with thin struts while maintaining strength and with distinct ease-of-use features such as expansion with one continuous inflation and no requirement for refrigerated storage. 
 In February 2018, we received CE approval for our third generation product, Fantom Encore, in the 2.5 millimeter diameter size.  Fantom Encore has thinner struts than Fantom (95 microns versus 125 microns in the 2.5 millimeter diameter size) and comparable strength and visibility.  Fantom Encore has the thinnest struts of any commercially available bioresorbable scaffold.  We believe that thin struts are associated with better healing and clinical outcomes.  Reductions in strut thickness are considered one of the most important improvements for bioresorbable scaffolds.  
 We began our commercial launch of Fantom late in the second quarter of 2017 and shipped our first product in the third quarter of 2017. Our sales strategy involves a phased approach beginning first with direct sales in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. We will expand geographically as we move into additional phases of our launch throughout 2018 and beyond. We anticipate commercializing Fantom Encore later in 2018. We expect that the Fantom Encore family will ultimately replace the Fantom family.
 Although we initiated commercial sales of Fantom in the third quarter of 2017, we are still very early in the commercialization stage.  The withdrawal of Absorb, a competitor’s product, in 2017, and the negative publicity related to Absorb’s safety have severely impacted the market for bioresorbable scaffolds, and companies with bioresorbable scaffolds that were made from the same polylactic acid polymer, or PLLA, as Absorb have reduced scale and appear to have abandoned their efforts to commercialize such scaffolds.  Because Fantom is not made with the same polymer as Absorb, we continue to believe that we can commercialize Fantom despite the impact that the withdrawal of Absorb has had on the market and demonstrate the benefits of bioresorbable technology.  That said, we must now rebuild the market for bioresorbable scaffolds, which can be more challenging than selling into an existing, healthy market.  Our rebuilding activities include educating physicians regarding the unique features of Fantom and Fantom Encore, continuing to publish results from our pivotal clinical trial (FANTOM II) and conducting and initiating additional clinical trials to build the clinical evidence needed to support market adoption.  
 In 2018, we plan to expand our product portfolio into peripheral arterial disease by applying for CE Mark with our bioresorbable scaffold technology for below-the-knee revascularization. The majority of the arteries below the knee have similar sizes and dimensions to coronary arteries, making this a viable treatment option. Resorbable technology is attractive in this application because of the frequent need for retreatment in this patient population. If and when we receive CE Mark, we plan to conduct a pilot trial in a small number of centers to assess product performance, inform product development activities and determine commercial strategy.
 As of December 31, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents and investment
 securities totaled $20.0 million, which, based on our current operating plans and projections, we believe will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs through the first quarter of 2019. Our projections are predicated on us achieving certain minimum levels of sales of Fantom and Fantom Encore.  If we are unable to achieve these levels of sales, we may be compelled to reduce operating and capital expenditures or sell certain assets.

Market Opportunity
 Coronary Artery Disease
 Cardiovascular disease, or CVD, is a term used to describe all diseases and conditions that relate to the heart and blood vessels in the body. Coronary arteries, which supply blood to the heart, are susceptible to the buildup of plaque and the formation of lesions, which can inhibit or block blood flow, a condition known as coronary artery disease. If arteries become too narrow as a result of plaque buildup, the heart (“cardiac”) muscle may become starved of nutrients and oxygen, resulting in chest pain known as angina. As artery narrowing becomes more severe, death of cardiac muscle downstream from the blockage can occur due to a lack of oxygen. The sudden death of cardiac muscle can result in a heart attack, or “myocardial infarction.”
 CVD is a leading cause of death. A January 2015 report published by the World Health Organization cited CVD as the number one cause of death globally, with an estimated 17.5 million deaths in 2012, representing 31 percent of all global deaths. According to the 2017 Update of Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics published by the American Heart Association, or AHA, coronary heart disease accounts for more than 360,000 deaths in the United States, or approximately one in every seven deaths, and coronary artery disease costs an estimated $199.6 billion in direct and indirect costs. According to the AHA, each year about 790,000 people in the United States will have a heart attack.
 The European Heart Network reported in early 2017 that ischemic (coronary) heart disease is the single leading cause of death in Europe, accounting for approximately 1.7 million deaths per year, or 14 percent of all male and 12 percent of all female deaths. In addition, the Australia Institute of Health and Welfare reported that coronary artery disease kills more Australians than any other disease, accounting for 21,500 deaths in 2011, or 15 percent of all deaths in Australia. In 2011, an estimated 69,900 people in Australia over the age of 25 had a heart attack.
 Current Interventional Treatments for Coronary Artery Disease
 There are various methods to prevent, slow progression, reduce symptoms, and reverse (“treat”) coronary artery disease. Lifestyle factors contribute to the development of coronary artery disease and lifestyle interventions such as eating healthy and being physically active are used for prevention and treatment. Evidence shows that healthy lifestyle alternatives are not being universally adopted. As an added therapy, medications such as beta blockers, diuretics, aspirin, nitroglycerin, and calcium channel blockers are used to reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels and/or aid in the treatment of coronary artery disease. Although lifestyle changes and drug therapy can improve quality of life and prolong survival, genetic factors must also be considered, and many patients will require an invasive surgery or a minimally invasive treatment such as stenting, to improve cardiac health. 
 Surgical or minimally invasive procedures, developed and used over the past four decades, quickly and safely restore blood flow by either surgically rerouting the flow around a plaque buildup or by reopening the artery with an interventional procedure. As technology has advanced, procedure-related complications have decreased, costs have been reduced, and procedure and recovery times have been shortened. Physicians have rapidly adopted each new advancement. The main treatment options used by physicians and available to patients are:
  
• | Coronary Artery Bypass Surgery: An extremely invasive procedure requiring open heart surgery. The bypass is achieved by removing a vein or artery from somewhere else in a patient’s body and connecting it to the blocked artery, bypassing the blockage. This allows oxygen-rich blood to reach the heart muscle. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Balloon Angioplasty: A minimally invasive procedure developed in the 1970s in which a balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin or wrist and advanced to a blockage in the heart. At the blockage site, the balloon is inflated to compress plaque and widen the narrowed artery, restoring blood flow. Although rapidly adopted because it is minimally invasive and results in shorter hospital and recovery times compared to 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bypass surgery, the long-term effectiveness of balloon angioplasty is limited by restenosis, a re-narrowing of the artery caused by the elastic recoil of the artery wall or formation of arterial scar tissue. Restenosis typically requires another angioplasty procedure or bypass surgery. Also, some patients experience abrupt vessel closure after angioplasty, leading to complications such as heart attack, emergency bypass surgery, or death.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bare Metal Stents: A minimally invasive therapy introduced in the 1990s to address the issues of abrupt vessel closure and restenosis following balloon angioplasty. Stents are small permanently implanted tube-like devices that are inserted into an artery to prop it open and facilitate blood flow. While bare metal stents minimized the issues and complications of abrupt vessel closure, restenosis continued to be a significant problem. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug-Eluting Metal Stents: A metal stent that additionally delivers a therapeutic drug to help minimize buildup of scar tissue during healing. After bare metal stents were introduced, physicians determined that restenosis resulted from the trauma of the procedure and stent, rather than from the underlying coronary artery disease. To overcome restenosis, delivery of pharmacological agents from stents was developed; the drugs used range from cytotoxic types (for example, paclitaxel) to immunosuppressants (sirolimus, zotarolimus, and everolimus). Patients usually also undergo treatment with aspirin and anti-clotting or anti-platelet drugs, such as clopidogrel (sold as Plavix) or ticlopidine (sold as Ticlid) after stenting, to reduce the incidence of blood clots, or “thrombosis.” 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In coronary stenting, we believe the key measures of success or failure of the therapy are:
  
• | Target Lesion Revascularization, or “TLR,” which measures the incidence of required re-stenting or bypass surgery due to a failure of the initial coronary angioplasty and stenting; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Major Adverse Cardiac Events, or “MACE,” which are events of cardiac death, ischemia (“heart attack”), or TLR.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bioresorbable Scaffolds: A stent therapy that achieves the benefits of metal stents with the added advantage that the stent dissolves after the artery has healed. After drug-eluting metal stents were introduced and studies showed they successfully lowered the rates of restenosis, safety concerns arose when long-term studies suggested occurrence of late stent thrombosis and TLR. Drug-eluting bioresorbable scaffolds were devised to achieve the proven benefits of drug-eluting metal stents but eliminate the long-term risks of a permanent implant and allow an artery to return to its natural function. While numerous coronary bioresorbable scaffolds have been under development, due to the many technical challenges of the technology, we believe that only three are currently available for sale, all of which are available for sale only under CE Mark.

Coronary Stent Market
 In 2017, annual worldwide sales of coronary stent sales approximated $3.8 billion according to JP Morgan Equity Research Interventional Cardiology Market Model. According to analyst reports, approximate 2017 annual coronary stent sales were:

• | $1.4 billion in the United States from approximately 1.2 million stent implants;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $2.0 billion in Europe and Asia (excluding Japan) from approximately 4.3 million stent implants; and,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | $0.4 billion in Japan from approximately 230,000 stent implants.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 Sales of bioresorbable scaffolds began in 2012 in locations outside the United States following CE Mark of Abbott’s Absorb scaffold. Two other companies obtained a CE Mark for their bioresorbable scaffolds in subsequent years and Absorb became commercially available in more than 100 countries, including the United States.  Of the worldwide stent sales, bioresorbable scaffold sales were estimated to be $86.0 million in 2013, with an increase to an estimated $127.0 million in 2016.  In 2017, Abbott withdrew Absorb from the worldwide market due to low commercial sales.  Additionally, Abbott reported high rates of adverse events in its clinical studies. Absorb was made with PLLA.  Our bioresorbable scaffold, Fantom, is made from a proprietary material called Tyrocore. The withdrawal of Absorb will have a negative impact on the market for the next several years. We believe that Fantom will be able to rebuild the confidence in and potential for bioresorbable scaffolds as we build clinical and commercial data.  See “—Competition” for additional information.
 Our Technology
 REVA is a leader in bioresorbable polymer technologies for vascular applications. Our bioresorbable polymers are derived from the naturally occurring tyrosine amino acid. The molecular structure of tyrosine includes a phenyl ring. The phenyl ring structure is the backbone for polycarbonate polymers. We have differentiated our polycarbonate 
 - 5 -


polymers by binding iodine to the phenyl ring. The resulting iodinated polycarbonate polymer can be leveraged in many vascular applications such as coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and embolic particles.
 REVA has developed four polymer families based on the iodinated polycarbonate structure. We have also developed expertise and capabilities to develop, manufacture, and test these polymers. We have the ability to tailor the polymer properties to the clinical application by modifying characteristics such as strength, flexibility, degradation and resorption time, and the capability to delivery drugs. The first polymer that we have developed into a commercial product is called Tyrocore. Tyrocore is the material used to make the Fantom bioresorbable scaffold.  
 We believe Tyrocore offers the following advantages as compared to other polymer-based scaffold materials:
  
• | Strength: Tyrocore is strong owing to the polycarbonate structure that forms the polymer backbone. In addition, the manufacturing process contributes to the strength of the final material. Tyrocore’s strength confers advantageous properties to the final scaffold such as a thinner profile, low recoil, and greater over-expansion range. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Visibility: The use of covalently-bound iodine in Tyrocore enables our entire scaffold to be visible under x-ray, including standard fluoroscopy, providing visibility approximating that of metal stents. Other commercially available bioresorbable scaffolds utilize metal “markers” at each end of a scaffold; under x-ray, these metal markers are the only visible portion of those scaffolds and they remain in the vessel wall permanently. Our improved visibility allows interventional cardiologists to more accurately assess the implant quality and position. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biocompatibility: Tyrocore has been tested for biocompatibility in a variety of preclinical and clinical studies. In a 12-month preclinical study of our desaminotyrosine polycarbonate polymer, no adverse biological reactions occurred during the scaffold material degradation. Additionally, we performed human clinical trials with the Fantom bioresorbable scaffold. Imaging results have been reported at the 6, 9, and 24-month time points and demonstrated excellent vessel healing. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Degradation and Resorption: Tyrocore degrades into benign metabolites (consisting of monomers, water, and carbon dioxide) that are cleared from the body. Tyrocore is designed to maintain structural integrity for a period of time and then to degrade and resorb. This resorption removes all foreign material from the body. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We license Tyrocore and related improvements from Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, or “Rutgers.” See “— Distribution and License Agreements” for additional information. We work in collaboration with Rutgers to continually develop and enhance Tyrocore.
 Our Products
 REVA’s first commercial product is Fantom, a drug-eluting bioresorbable scaffold. Bioresorbable scaffolds are an alternative to metal stents to hold an artery open during healing after a percutaneous coronary intervention procedure. Unlike metal stents, which are a permanent implant, bioresorbable scaffolds provide support to the artery during the healing process and then degrade and resorb from the artery. This resorption removes all foreign material related to the scaffold from the body.
   Bare metal and drug-eluting stents are small, mesh tubes that are placed in the artery during a percutaneous coronary intervention procedure to prop and hold the artery open during healing. These stents are made from a metal alloy and drug-eluting stents are coated with a mixture of drug and polymer. After the drug-eluting stent is placed in the artery, the drug elutes into the vessel wall to reduce vessel narrowing during healing. Over time, the stent heals into the artery wall where it remains as a permanent implant and can interfere with future diagnostic or therapeutic procedures, as well as result in adverse events. In fact, per one study conducted, drug-eluting stents are associated with an annual risk of adverse events of 0.2-0.7% from 5 to 10 years after treatment1.
 Bioresorbable scaffolds, on the other hand, become fully encapsulated into the artery wall, and resorb from the body after the artery has fully healed.  There are three primary potential benefits of bioresorbable scaffolds compared to bare metal and drug-eluting metal stents: 
  
• | Minimization of Long-Term Adverse Events: Once the scaffold is fully resorbed, there is no foreign material present, thus the risks associated with a permanent implant are eliminated. It should be noted that our scaffolds

are the only scaffolds that are 100% bioresorbable. All other bioresorbable scaffolds contain small permanent markers for limited x-ray visibility which remain behind once the scaffold is resorbed. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Enhanced Applications for Diagnostic Procedures: Metal stents can interfere with non-invasive imaging technologies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography scanning (CT scanning). Bioresorbable scaffolds are made from polymers, which do not interfere with these imaging modalities.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Options for Future Medical Treatment: Coronary artery disease is typically progressive and many patients will require additional treatments. We believe that the polymer material of bioresorbable scaffolds and its bioresorption make future medical procedures easier because there is no metal to interfere. A patient may undergo re-stenting, be treated for lesions located in the same artery as the original stent or undergo surgical procedures. These treatments may be inhibited by the existence of a metal stent, whereas the resorption of a scaffold helps to ensure all treatment options remain available.

 Fantom consists of a standard deformable stent design fabricated from our proprietary polymer, Tyrocore, that we coat with sirolimus, a proven anti-proliferative drug.  This drug is available from a number of different sources and has been approved by both European and U.S. regulatory bodies. We coat the outside surface of our scaffold using a polymer solution containing a target dose of sirolimus. The Tyrocore used for the coating solution is the same Tyrocore used in the scaffold structure. Through our preclinical studies, we have demonstrated a controlled release of the drug over 30 days; most of the drug is released within 90 days. We believe our release characteristics optimize the efficacy of the drug.
 
Fantom was designed with the following features that we believe make it commercially competitive with other bioresorbable scaffolds and drug-eluting metal stents:
  
• | Strong and Resilient: Fantom is made with Tyrocore, which, in conjunction with our scaffold design and our method of processing, maintains the strength and structural integrity necessary to support an artery during the critical 90-day healing period after implant. We believe our specific polymer formulation is inherently less prone to cracking and breakage than other polymers. This strength and resiliency supports our thinner struts, a broader over-expansion range and single step inflation; three very important differentiating factors for Fantom. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Thin Profiles and Ease of Use: Due to the strength of the Tyrocore polymer, Fantom is designed with a thinner profile than other commercially available bioresorbable scaffolds. Thin profiles have been shown to improve vessel healing and reduce adverse events. Fantom is implanted using a standard balloon catheter and is compatible with a standard 6-french delivery catheter size. Our scaffolds do not require any change to traditional storage or handling or to the method of deployment.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Visible Using Standard Imaging Techniques: Fantom is the only commercially available bioresorbable scaffold that is fully visible under x-ray. X-ray visibility allows the physician to see the scaffold during implant to ensure accurate placement within the vessel, which has the potential to reduce adverse events. Competitive bioresorbable scaffolds are designed with metallic radiopaque markers on each end of the scaffold which may provide guidance on the approximate location of the scaffold but do not inform the physician with full details of scaffold deployment. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Standard Resorption Rate: Fantom loses its molecular weight within approximately one year after implant, which allows the vessel to move more naturally. It loses its mass over the next three years, with total resorption taking approximately four years. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biocompatible and Safe: Fantom is made with Tyrocore, and has been demonstrated to be biocompatible in preclinical testing. In a 12-month study during which the scaffold was degrading, there was no indication of adverse biological reactions, consistent with the other tests of the polymer. Reported results from the FANTOM II human clinical trial has shown a low rate of Major Adverse Cardiac Events at 24 months. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In February 2018, we received CE approval for our third generation coronary scaffold, Fantom Encore, in the 2.5 millimeter diameter size.  Fantom Encore has thinner struts than Fantom (95 microns versus 125 microns in the 2.5 millimeter diameter size) and comparable strength to Fantom.  We anticipate commercializing Fantom Encore later in 2018.  
 We anticipate allocating a small amount of resources to new product testing in 2018, primarily focused on expanding the size matrix of Fantom Encore and developing a product for a below-the-knee vascular application. The majority of the arteries below the knee have similar sizes and dimensions to coronary arteries, making this a viable treatment

option. Resorbable technology is attractive in this application because of the frequent need for retreatment in this patient population. If and when we receive CE Mark, we plan to conduct a pilot trial in a small number of centers to assess product performance, inform product development activities and determine commercial strategy.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our goal is to become a world leader in the production and sale of bioresorbable vascular products for use in humans. To achieve this goal, we are pursuing the following business strategies:

• | Gain Commercial Acceptance and Demonstrate Clinical Safety and Efficacy of Fantom and Fantom Encore: We are commercializing Fantom in targeted countries based on our CE Mark. The safety and efficacy of Fantom is supported by data reported from the FANTOM II clinical trial which showed low rates of Major Adverse Cardiac Events of 4.2% in 240 patients at 12 months and 5.6% in the initial 125 patients who completed 24 months of follow-up by the fall of 2017. We will continue to follow and report clinical results on patients in the FANTOM II clinical trial through 5 years. In addition, we are conducting trials in more complex patients and launching a post-market trial. We believe the combined clinical and commercial evidence will support the broad adoption of Fantom and Fantom Encore. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand Geographically: We are executing our commercialization in phases. Initially, we have launched with a direct sales force in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. During 2018 we will evaluate and expand into additional countries that accept the CE Mark. We will go direct or with distributor partners depending on specific market dynamics. The countries we will be considering during 2018 include Italy, Spain, Turkey, Brazil, Belgium, Denmark, and The Netherlands. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance Fantom Product Line: We intend to continue to enhance Fantom, by refining or adding features and expanding the available sizes. We intend to commercialize Fantom Encore in 2018 and to begin to expand our product size matrix. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Build Awareness and Support among Leading Physicians: Our commercial strategies include collaboration with key opinion leaders in the field of interventional cardiology. We believe these key physicians will be advocates of our technology and important in the market adoption of our products once approved. Additionally, we will look to these physicians to generate and publish scientific data that further supports the benefits of our scaffolds. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Leverage Our Technology Platform into Other Therapeutic Areas: We believe our technology is applicable to therapies beyond coronary artery disease. For example, we intend to pursue the use of our technology to treat peripheral arterial disease, which is an expanding market. Resorbable technology is attractive for peripheral arterial disease because of the frequent need for retreatment in this patient population. We are pursuing CE Mark for a Tyrocore-based product in a below-the-knee application. Arteries below the knee have similar dimensions to coronary arteries making this a viable treatment option. Treatments for other peripheral artery applications require research and development of polymers with properties designed specifically for those applications. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide the Highest Quality Products for Our Customers and Patients: We have assembled a team of employees and consultants who are experienced professionals in the medical device industry and who are focused on patient safety and product quality. We incorporate these principles in every aspect of our products, including development, manufacturing, quality assurance, and clinical research. We intend to offer only the highest quality products to patients and physician customers. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand and Strengthen Our Intellectual Property Portfolio: We plan to continue to expand our current intellectual property portfolio. While we believe that our current portfolio will allow us to effectively market our products for the treatment of coronary artery disease, we plan to create, originate, license, and acquire additional intellectual property to enhance our existing position and enable us to more effectively expand and protect our technology. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Explore Licensing Opportunities: We intend to explore opportunities to leverage our intellectual property portfolio by out-licensing our technology, polymer and/or products to third parties or through the establishment of partnerships. For example, we may seek a partner to license our polymer for use as embolic beads. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Testing
 We have tested our bioresorbable scaffolds during their development, a period spanning over 12 years. Our preclinical tests show the technology to be safe and effective, with over 1,000 scaffolds tested across various animal 
 - 8 -


models. Our bench tests confirm the intended product features, with over 30,000 scaffolds tested in various manners. Our preclinical tests generally comprise the following:
  
• | Comparative Testing: We compared our scaffolds to commercially available metal stents and, to a lesser extent, bioresorbable scaffolds. Our tests show that our scaffolds maintain the openness of the artery in the 90 days following implant and allow the lumen size (the inside area of the artery) to increase during resorption. Comparatively, the lumen size of arteries implanted with metal stents was almost unchanged. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strength and Fatigue Testing: We conducted engineering and life cycle tests with equipment that replicates both the physiological conditions in the coronary artery as well as measures the maximum stress levels that our technology can withstand. These tests demonstrated satisfactory scaffold design and polymer strength, low levels of polymer embrittlement, and resistance to fatigue failure prior to significant degradation of the scaffold. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Biocompatibility Testing: The biological response to our scaffold has been evaluated by assessing healing in animal coronary arteries using standard microscopy for stented arteries (where the vessel is examined under a microscope). These tests have demonstrated that the polymer is safe and no adverse response occurs in the artery, including while the polymer degrades. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rate of Degradation Testing: Our degradation rate tests demonstrate that our scaffolds maintain their structural integrity and strength for at least 90 days, the healing time of an artery following the implant procedure. By design, at 12 months the scaffold no longer has significant mechanical strength and the polymer continues to resorb and be eliminated from the body for approximately four years. A study of the byproducts resulting from the resorption of our scaffold showed no accumulation in key organs or tissues of the animal’s body and that the byproducts are cleared from the body. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Toxicity Testing: Among other tests, we performed an ISO-10993-1 test for genotoxicity. Our test showed that there is no change to the DNA or chromosomes of cells tested and that our polymer is not genotoxic. We have conducted preclinical tests for several other types of toxicity that also demonstrated the polymer is safe. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug Testing: Implanting a stent can injure an artery and the body’s wound-healing process can cause excessive scar tissue to form inside the stent, referred to as “in-stent restenosis.” The drug sirolimus minimizes overgrowth of tissue, thereby minimizing in-stent restenosis. It has been used in drug-eluting stents, has a demonstrated safety profile, and is proven effective at reducing restenosis. We tested the effects of sirolimus, which we apply to the surface of our scaffold in a coating. Our studies demonstrated no major drug toxicity.

 This testing has shown that our technology was sufficiently safe and effective in animals to support continued product development. We used the data from our preclinical tests in our application for CE Mark of Fantom. 
 Clinical Studies and Regulatory Strategy
 We have targeted Europe, and other countries that recognize the European CE Mark, as our initial commercial markets. For each jurisdiction in which we perform clinical studies or commercialize products, we are subject to significant regulatory requirements, with which we intend to fully comply.
 The European Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC sets out the essential requirements for clinical studies, product approval, and CE Mark in the European Union; there are numerous other directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, and labeling for medical devices. We obtained CE Mark approval for Fantom in April 2017.  We intend to seek additional regulatory approvals for Fantom in Australia, Japan and China, in addition to seeking a Premarket Approval Application (PMA) in the United States.
 Prior to its approval, Fantom had been implanted in 247 patients in the FANTOM I and FANTOM II clinical trials conducted in eight countries outside the United States. We used six-month clinical results from 117 patients in the FANTOM II clinical trial for our CE Mark application. We have reported additional data from the FANTOM II clinical trial which showed low rates of Major Adverse Cardiac Events of 4.2% in 240 patients at 12 months and 5.6% in the initial 125 patients who completed 24 months of follow-up by the fall of 2017.  We will continue to follow and report clinical results on patients in the FANTOM II clinical trial through 5 years.
 Prior to the FANTOM I and II clinical trials, we enrolled a total of 165 patients in three clinical trials between 2007 and 2014 with predecessor scaffolds, which combined our proprietary “slide and lock” designs with our proprietary polymer formulations. While these predecessor, first generation scaffolds demonstrated viability of the technology, we believed enhanced characteristics were needed and, therefore, developed our Fantom scaffold during 2014.

We have two additional clinical trials of Fantom ongoing evaluating use of our bioresorbable scaffold in broader patient populations and are in the process of initiating a third trial.  In the first trial, we are enrolling patients in the FANTOM II Cohort C Study, which is specifically related to more complex patients with lesions longer than those treated in the first two cohorts and patients with multiple vessel disease.  We anticipate enrollment of 30 patients in this trial by the end of 2018.  In the second trial, we are enrolling patients in a pilot trial to specifically examine the safety and performance of Fantom in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) indication.  We anticipate enrollment of 10 to 20 patients in this trial by the end of 2018.  In addition to those two indication expansion trials, we are in the process of initiating a larger scale post-market registry trial.  In this trial we will be assessing the continued safety of Fantom when used in regular clinical practice in approximately 1,500 patients.  We expect to begin enrollment in this trial in the second quarter of 2018 and to follow patients through 5 years of clinical follow-up.
 We have partnered with a distributor who is seeking regulatory approval in Brazil.  We anticipate approval and initiation of commercial sales in Brazil in 2018.
 We are currently in discussions with the FDA to conduct a clinical trial in the United States, which is expected to be a randomized trial of between 1,800 and 2,200 patients. We are working towards having conditional Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval to conduct the clinical trial by the end of 2018.  We will need to obtain additional funding to conduct a U.S. clinical trial.
 Manufacturing
 Manufacturing of medical devices is subject to strict quality requirements.  See “—Government Regulation” for additional information.  Our manufacturing operations take place at our facility in San Diego, California.  The facility includes laboratories for polymer development and synthesis, chemistry, engineering, and product assembly, including clean rooms and quality control laboratories. We believe our facility has the capacity to produce the quantities of Fantom that will be needed for initial commercial sales and for ongoing clinical trials.  An independent third-party has certified that our facility conforms to EN ISO 13485:2012. We may expand our manufacturing beyond our current facility at such point when sales growth forecasts suggest we will reach the capacity of our facility.
 The process to manufacture Fantom involves seven main steps, most of which are conducted on-site and some of which are outsourced. Our strategy to outsource selected processes is intended to minimize capital and operating costs while maintaining required quality standards. The manufacturing steps are as follows:
  
• | Polymer Manufacture: Performed at our facility. 
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | Polymer Tube Fabrication: Performed at our facility. 
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | Lasing of Polymer Tubes: Outsourced to a domestic third party. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | Drug Coating: Drug purchased from a foreign supplier; coating prepared and applied at our facility. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Catheter System: System purchased from a domestic supplier; coating purchased from a foreign supplier. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Assembly, Mounting on the Catheter, Quality Assurance, and Packaging: Performed at our facility. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sterilization: Outsourced to a domestic third-party. 
--+------------------------------------------------------

 Certain materials used in our products are purchased from, and certain portions of our manufacturing process are completed by, third-parties. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We are dependent on a limited number of third-party suppliers for delivery system catheters, sirolimus and other components, and the loss of any of these suppliers, or their inability to provide us with an adequate supply of materials that meet our quality and other requirements, could harm our business.” 
 In February 2017, we entered in an agreement with a third-party logistics provider located in The Netherlands. Under this agreement, the third party is responsible for the warehousing and distribution of our products, as well as order processing and accounts receivable, with respect to our sales in the EU.  Products are stored in a temperature-controlled environment and in accordance with ISO 13485 requirements.  
 
Competition
 
While physicians may recommend alternative treatments for CVD, such as drug therapy, bypass surgery, angioplasty, or bare metal stenting, we expect the primary competition for our products to be drug-eluting stents. The market leaders for metal stents (bare and drug-eluting) are Abbott, Boston Scientific Corporation and Medtronic. The 
 - 10 -


drug-eluting stent industry is highly competitive. Competitive conditions include technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance and design, product potential for overall cost-effectiveness, name and brand recognition, relationships with physicians and patients, product safety and the availability of supporting clinical data, sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, and intellectual property protection. 
 
Drug-eluting stents were first available in 2002. Since then, drug-eluting stent technology experienced rapid innovation with improvements in material, design, and clinical performance. Today, product sales from three manufacturers, Abbott, Boston Scientific, and Medtronic, account for approximately 95% of the global drug-eluting stent market with minimal differences in product performance and market share. We expect that future innovation in drug-eluting stents will involve incremental performance improvements that do not translate into meaningful clinical benefit.
 Bioresorbable scaffolds are the next innovation in CVD treatment that has the potential to deliver a meaningful improvement in clinical benefit for patients.  Of the three major drug-eluting stent manufacturers, only Abbott has commercialized a bioresorbable scaffold. Abbott began selling its bioresorbable scaffold, named Absorb, outside of the United States in 2012 and achieved rapid adoption and early commercial success. During this time, Abbott conducted multiple large clinical studies and then secured FDA approval in July 2016. In September 2017, Abbott withdrew Absorb from the worldwide market due to low commercial sales.  Additionally, Abbott reported high rates of adverse events in its clinical studies. The clinical outcomes and resulting withdrawal of Absorb has had a significant negative impact on the adoption of bioresorbable scaffolds. 
 Today there are three categories of bioresorbale scaffolds based on the scaffold material: polylactic acid (also known as polylactide or PLLA), magnesium alloy, and Tyrocore, which is REVA’s proprietary polymer for Fantom. PLLA is the most commonly used material for bioresorbable scaffolds. Scaffolds with CE Mark in this category include Absorb from Abbott and DESolve from Elixir Medical. Based on clinical trials of which we are aware, a number of other companies are developing PLLA bioresorbable scaffolds, including Amaranth Medical and Meril Life Sciences. The adverse events reported in the Absorb clinical studies have raised concerns about the utility of PLLA as an appropriate material for bioresorbable scaffolds. Today there is minimal commercial activity from companies with PLLA scaffolds. Abbott stated that it is developing a next generation polylactic acid bioresorbable scaffold, which it could advance into clinical trials in the future.
 In June 2016, Biotronik received CE Mark for its Magmaris magnesium alloy bioresorbable scaffold based on data from 118 patients enrolled in the BIOSOLVE II clinical trial. Magmaris is a first generation scaffold with a similar strut profile to Absorb, and the magnesium alloy is not visible under x-ray. Magmaris offers a limited size matrix with only six sizes available. The ability of Biotronik to obtain reimbursement for and secure adoption of its scaffold may further define the bioresorbable scaffold market.
 Fantom and Fantom Encore are made from our proprietary polymer called Tyrocore. We secured CE Mark for Fantom in April 2017 and for the 2.5 mm diameter of Fantom Encore in February 2018. Compared to first generation PLLA and magnesium alloy scaffolds, Fantom and Fantom Encore offer thinner strut profiles, improved ease-of-use, and full x-ray visibility. Fantom and Fantom Encore face competition from the negative perceptions of bioresorbable scaffolds created by the market withdrawal of Absorb and from drug-eluting stents. This competition will have a negative impact on our commercialization activities for the next several years while we generate clinical data and gain commercial experience. However, we believe that Fantom and Fantom Encore are differentiated from Absorb and other bioresorbable scaffolds based on their unique features and that we will be able to rebuild the confidence in bioresorbable scaffolds. 
 Products in the CVD market, including our products, can be subject to rapid product adoption or obsolescence, as well as regulatory changes. We compete with established medical device companies, as well as earlier-stage companies that often have differentiated technology and potentially superior solutions. Although we believe Fantom has technological advantages over competitive products, these advantages may be reduced or eliminated, should competitors introduce new products. We also compete to recruit and retain qualified scientific and management personnel, establish clinical trial sites and patient registrations, and acquire technologies complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business. 
 See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business—We compete against companies that have longer operating histories, more established or approved products, and greater resources, which may prevent us from achieving market penetration or improving operating results” for additional information regarding our competition and the competitive landscape.

Research and Development
 Since inception, we have devoted a significant amount of resources to develop our technology. Our research and development expenses, which include the costs to conduct our human clinical trials, were $12.8 million in 2017, $18.2 million in 2016 and $16.8 million in 2015. We expect our research and development expenditures to decrease in 2018 as we dedicate a significant portion of our resources to the commercialization of Fantom and supporting registry studies. If and when we successfully establish commercial feasibility of Fantom, we expect our research and development expenses to increase and we may focus on new product development and initiation of new clinical trials of Fantom, including, if we receive FDA approval for it and if we have raised sufficient capital to support it, an FDA clinical trial of Fantom. 
Sales and Marketing
 We commenced commercial activities for Fantom during the second quarter of 2017 and revenues were first recorded in the third quarter of 2017.  We have built a small sales force that is initially focused on a small number of targeted accounts to drive adoption and prove the commercial viability of Fantom. We plan a broader roll-out following the initial sales efforts, mostly using independent distributors. 
 Generally, we expect our planned targeted roll-out to occur as follows:
  
• | Initial Markets: The European Union, or EU, will be our initial commercial market target since the CE Mark is our first regulatory approval. Our initial countries of focus are Germany, Switzerland and Austria. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Follow-on Markets: Other countries that accept the CE Mark or the clinical data from the FANTOM II clinical trial, including Italy, Spain, Brazil and select countries in the Middle East, will be our second commercial market targets. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Longer Term: We will target the United States, Australia, Japan and China commercial markets in the future because they require more extensive, and expensive, clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have considered many aspects of commercial sales, including product pricing. In most countries, a significant portion of medical expenses is covered by third-party payors. Reimbursement in the EU varies by country and often by hospital. We believe that numerous hospitals have established budgets to purchase coronary stents and the purchase decision is often driven by the interventional cardiologists working at those hospitals. Since bioresorbable scaffolds were introduced to the market in 2012, they have traditionally been priced at a significant premium to drug-eluting stents.  Fantom is priced at a premium as well, which may hinder or prohibit its broad adoption.  
 We will continue to monitor and, if we believe appropriate, revise our sales and marketing plans and strategy based on market changes and acceptance, competitor activities, and timing of regulatory approvals.
 Third-Party Reimbursement
 In most countries, a significant portion of patient medical expense is covered by third-party reimbursement, consisting of both government-funded and private insurance programs. While each payor develops and maintains its own coverage and reimbursement policies, the vast majority of payors have established policies for stents. We believe that our products generally will fall within existing reimbursement guidelines, or within new reimbursement guidelines that were established by other bioresorbable scaffold companies, although some refinement in policies may be needed for our products. Some countries may require us to gather additional clinical data before agreeing to coverage and reimbursement for our products. We intend to complete the requisite clinical studies and obtain coverage and reimbursement approval in countries where it makes economic sense to do so.  To date, the customers who have purchased Fantom in the European countries in which it has been sold have been able to obtain third-party reimbursement. However, reimbursement guidelines differ from region to region. Before we can obtain reimbursement for our products in Australia, Japan, China, the United States, or any other country, we will need to obtain appropriate regulatory approvals for product sales in such countries. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, and copyrights, together with non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technologies. Our patents and patent applications covering the fundamental technology underlying our “slide and lock” design have been developed internally, while the technology underlying our polymer has been either licensed or developed by us.
 - 12 -


As of February 23, 2018, on a worldwide basis, our patent portfolio comprised approximately 281 issued and pending U.S. and foreign patents that we own directly or for which we are the licensee. Our latest patent expiration date with respect to these patents is 2036. We have been issued 52 U.S. patents and have 11 U.S. patent applications that are pending examination or have been allowed by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. For these 63 technology patents and applications, we have sought intellectual property protection outside the United States and have been granted 189 foreign patents and have 29 pending foreign applications. We do not know if any of our pending patent applications will be issued, nor do we know whether our patents, if issued, will adequately cover our technology or will be able to be successfully enforced. Even if valid and enforceable, our patents may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from inventing a scaffold like ours, despite our patent rights. We believe that the remaining lives of our patents provide adequate time to generate revenues from sales, subject to timing of the clinical pathway and regulatory approvals. 
 We actively monitor our intellectual property position and review new developments to identify prudent extensions to our patent portfolio to ensure protection of our key technology, as well as to maximize our defensive strategy through the coverage of similar technology developments. We employ an in-house patent attorney and utilize external patent counsel to assist us in managing our intellectual property portfolio. The stent industry has been subject to numerous patent filing and infringement lawsuits. Whether we would, upon commercialization, infringe any patent claim will not be known with certainty unless and until a court interprets a patent claim in the context of litigation. If an infringement allegation is made against us, we may seek to invalidate the asserted patent claim and may allege non-infringement of the asserted patent claim. In order for us to invalidate a U.S. patent claim, we would need to rebut the presumption of validity afforded to patents issued in the United States with clear and convincing evidence of invalidity, which is a high burden of proof. To date, none of our patents or patent applications has been subject to reexamination, interference, or other legal challenge.
 We require all employees to sign confidentiality and invention assignment agreements under which they are bound to assign to us inventions made during the term of their employment. These agreements prohibit our employees from using, disclosing, or bringing onto the premises any proprietary information belonging to a third party. In addition, our consultants are required to sign agreements under which they must assign to us any inventions that relate to our business. These agreements also prohibit our consultants from incorporating into any inventions the proprietary rights of third parties without informing us. It is our policy to require all employees to document potential inventions and other intellectual property in laboratory notebooks and to disclose inventions to patent counsel in written form.
 We also rely on confidentiality restrictions and trade secrets to protect our technology. We generally require our consultants and other parties who may be exposed to our proprietary technology to sign non-disclosure agreements which prohibit such parties from disclosing or using our proprietary information except as may be authorized by us.
 Distribution and License Agreements
 Boston Scientific Corporation Agreement
 In 2007, we entered into a distribution option agreement with Boston Scientific Corporation, or BSC, in which we granted BSC an option to negotiate country-by-country or worldwide exclusive rights to sell, market, and distribute our scaffolds. BSC’s election window to exercise the option was triggered in 2017 when we delivered an extensive set of positive clinical data supporting Fantom’s performance. BSC did not exercise the option and it expired in August 2017. With expiration of the option, all aspects of the distribution option agreement are now concluded.
Rutgers License 
 In July 2010, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey (“Rutgers”) that superseded the exclusive license agreement we entered into with Rutgers in 2004. Under the 2010 license agreement, we have an exclusive, worldwide right, including sublicensing rights, to develop and commercialize products that utilize certain polymers in the vascular field. Terms of this agreement require us to pay annual license fees to Rutgers until a product is commercially sold in a major market. Also, to maintain our rights under this agreement, we must achieve certain development and commercialization milestones. The term of the this agreement continues until the expiration of the last to expire of the patents licensed to us, which we believe is 2036. Rutgers may sublicense certain technology that Rutgers invented, we jointly invented with Rutgers, or that we solely invented, outside our field of use. If Rutgers sublicenses inventions and improvements solely owned by us, Rutgers will pay us a percentage of all income and consideration Rutgers receives from such sublicenses. 
 - 13 -


The royalties due under the 2010 license agreement vary depending upon type of product, use of product, stage of product, location of sale, and ultimate sales volume and price. We believe the royalties will range from a minimum of approximately $15 to a maximum of approximately $50 per product sale, with license provisions for escalating minimum royalties that could be as high as $2.2 million per year. Additionally, in the event we receive certain milestone payments related to this technology, the agreement requires that up to 40 percent of the milestone amount be paid to the licensors. The agreement required annual licensing payments of $175,000 until the underlying technology was commercialized in 2017. The agreement also requires other payments to occur during commercialization that could total $950,000, payment of $350,000 upon a change in control of our ownership, payments of up to $300,000 annually to extend regulatory filing periods related to certain technology (of which, payments totaling up to $250,000 per year during the years 2016, 2017, and 2018 may be deferred to January 1, 2019), and payment of patent filing, maintenance, and defense fees. 
 Government Regulation
 United States
 We do not currently have any products approved for sale in the United States.  We are in discussions with the FDA regarding our preclinical data and our clinical trial strategy for Fantom.  We believe that these discussions will continue throughout 2018. In order to commence a clinical trial in the United States, we will need to obtain additional financing.
 Fantom (and Fantom Encore) is considered a combination product because it combines two regulated components in a single product:  a drug and a medical device. In the United States, the FDA assigns the review of a combination product, based on the product’s “primary mode of action,” to one of its centers, such as the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (“CDER”) or the Center for Devices and Radiological Health, or CDRH. The center to which the product is assigned will have primary jurisdiction over the PMA of the product. 
 Because the primary mode of action for Fantom is that of a medical device, when, and if, we apply for approval in the United States, Fantom will be reviewed by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act with CDRH having primary responsibility for review and regulation of our products. As a result, we expect our clinical trial of drug-eluting scaffolds to be conducted under an IDE application in accordance with 21 CFR Part 812. However, it is possible the FDA may assign our products to CDER. Based on FDA precedent and jurisdictional statements to date, we believe that the drug component of our products will not require separate FDA approval and that it will be reviewed in the context of our PMA, with CDRH consulting with CDER as needed. Even if the FDA assigns our products to be regulated by CDER, the drug component of the product will likely not require separate CDER approval but will be evaluated in the context of our PMA as a whole, with application of drug standards as deemed appropriate by FDA based on the circumstances.
 FDA regulations govern the following activities that we and our suppliers, licensors, and partners perform and will continue to perform to ensure that the products we distribute domestically or export internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:
  
• | product design, development, and testing;
--+------------------------------------------


• | product manufacturing and production;
--+--------------------------------------


• | product safety;
--+----------------


• | product labeling and storage;
--+------------------------------


• | record keeping;
--+----------------


• | premarket approval;
--+--------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | product sales and distribution; and,
--+-------------------------------------


• | post-marketing requirements including monitoring for and reporting of adverse events and malfunctions.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Clinical Trials:  Clinical trial data is almost always required to support a PMA application. Clinical trials of our scaffolds in the United States will require submission of an IDE application, supported with appropriate data, and approvals by the FDA and institutional review boards. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with applicable regulations and must adhere to extensive record keeping and reporting requirements. We, the FDA, or the institutional review board at a clinical site may suspend a clinical trial at any time for any reason, including a belief that the risks 
 - 14 -


to the patients in a trial outweigh the anticipated benefits. U.S. clinical trials of the scope we anticipate for our products can typically take years to complete and may encounter challenges at any stage that may require a trial to be halted.
 Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements:  The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting, or implantable devices or devices not substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device, are placed in Class III, requiring PMA. Our scaffolds are Class III devices and will require FDA approval. A PMA must be supported by extensive data, including but not limited to, technical, preclinical, clinical, manufacturing, and labeling to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device. A PMA must also contain a full description of the device and its components and a full description of the methods, facilities, and controls used for manufacturing of the device.
 Product Modifications:  New PMAs or PMA supplements are required for all significant modifications to a manufacturing process, labeling, use, or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial application, except the supplement is limited to information needed to support the device changes. Certain modifications may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 Pervasive and Continuing Regulation:  When a device is approved for sale, numerous regulatory requirements apply to the commercial product. These include:
  
• | Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, and Quality System Regulations, or QSR, that require manufacturers, including third-party suppliers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labeling and promotion regulations, which limit the manner in which companies can market their products and impose requirements for content and format of labeling and promotional materials, and FDA prohibitions against promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device reporting regulations, which require manufacturers to report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance regulations, which will apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and efficacy data for the device; and,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specific conditions of approval that may be imposed on a specific PMA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. When, and if, we are approved to sell in the United States, we will be subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and the Food and Drug Branch of the California Department of Health Services to determine our compliance with QSR and other regulations. The manufacturing facilities of our suppliers may also be inspected by the FDA or other regulatory authorities to determine their compliance with GMP regulations. The FDA monitors marketing and promotional activities for matters of concern and may receive complaints from competitors or other third parties regarding our products.
 In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a medical device, manufacturer, or facility may result in restrictions on the manufacturing or marketing of an approved device, including costly recalls or withdrawal of the device from the market. The FDA also has the authority to require repair, replacement, or refund of any medical device that has been manufactured or distributed. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action being taken by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions:
  
• | inspectional observations or warning letters, identifying concerns that must be corrected;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, injunctions, consent decrees, and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | recall or seizure of our products;
--+-----------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing our requests for PMA or new intended uses;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawing PMA approval; and/or,
--+----------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------

Fraud and Abuse:  We are directly, or indirectly through our business associates, subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the False Claims Act. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing payments, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment is made under a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. This statute is broad and prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful outside the health care industry. Recognizing that this statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements, Congress authorized a series of safe harbor regulations. The safe harbors set forth provisions that give some assurance to health care providers and others that they will not be prosecuted. The failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit precisely within a safe harbor does not necessarily mean that it is illegal or that prosecution will be pursued; however, conduct and arrangements that do not fully satisfy each applicable safe harbor may result in increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities. All parties to a prohibited transaction may be prosecuted, whether any party sought or received payment from any federally funded program. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment, and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal statute.
 The U.S. False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim or using false statements to obtain payment from the federal government. Suits filed under the False Claims Act, known as “qui tam” actions, can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly referred to as “whistleblowers,” may share in any amounts paid to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing of qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing more health care companies to defend False Claims. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each separate False Claim. Various states have also enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act. Similarly, the federal Civil Monetary Penalty statute imposes penalties of up to $50,000 per violation for filing certain types of proscribed claims or engaging in prohibited acts.
 In addition to the laws described above, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created two new federal crimes:  health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including those of private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing, or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 The penalties for violating any of the laws described above or other applicable state and federal fraud and abuse laws, include civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government health care programs, and the operating sanctions.
 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act:  Our operations may be impacted by the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which is referred to as the Affordable Care Act, or ACA. Among other things, the ACA imposed a 2.3 percent excise tax on sales of medical devices sold in the United States and intended for human use; such excise tax is suspended through 2019 and we are unable to predict whether the suspension will be continued beyond 2019. There is no exemption for small companies. If not permanently eliminated, we believe the tax will apply to our scaffolds when we begin commercial sales of our products in the U.S. The ACA also requires (under what are referred to as “Sunshine” or “Open Payments” requirements) manufacturers of covered devices to report details regarding certain payments and other financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals. These reporting provisions preempt state laws that require reporting of the same information, but not those that require reports of different or additional information. Failure to comply results in significant civil monetary penalties. We expect compliance with the ACA to impose significant administrative and financial burdens on us.
 Environmental Regulation:  We are subject to numerous federal, state, and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, fire hazard control, and disposal of hazardous substances. Some of these laws require us to obtain licenses or permits to conduct our operations. We have numerous policies and procedures in place to ensure compliance with these laws and to minimize the risk of occupational exposure to hazardous materials. We do not expect our operations to produce quantities of hazardous or toxic waste or radiation that would require the use of extraordinary disposal practices. Although the costs to comply 
 - 16 -


with these laws and regulations have not been material, we cannot predict the impact of new or amended laws or regulations or any changes in the way existing and future laws and regulations are interpreted or enforced, nor can we ensure we will be able to obtain or maintain any required licenses or permits.
 International
 International sales of medical devices are subject to foreign governmental regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain clearance or approval by a particular country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may be different. 
 The primary regulatory environment in Europe is the EU, which consists of 28 countries. Three members of the European Free Trade Association, Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein have voluntarily adopted medical device laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have entered into Mutual Recognition Agreements, or MRA, and allow the sale of medical devices that meet EU requirements.
 The EU has three core directives concerning medical devices:  Medical Devices Directive, or MDD, In-Vitro Diagnostic Medical Devices Directive, and Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive. Also, the European Committees for Standardization have set forth voluntary standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling, and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Prior to marketing or using a medical device in the EU, it must undergo a conformity assessment process as set forth in the relevant medical devices directives (Conformité Européenne, or CE). Once a medical device is approved for CE Mark, it can be commercially distributed in the EU, the member states of the European Free Trade Association, and countries with MRAs. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the type and class of product, but normally involves a self-assessment by the manufacturer and an assessment by a third-party notified body, an independent and neutral institution appointed in an EU country. The assessment may also include an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the device for compliance with ISO 13485, which are voluntary harmonized standards. Each EU member country implements the MDD into national laws that are enforced by a competent authority in that country. For example, the authority in the United Kingdom is the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. In addition to obtaining CE Mark, many EU countries require completion of a formal registration process before products can be commercially sold. This in-country process may delay our ability to commercialize.
 Before any medical device can be supplied within Australia, it must be included on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods and comply with the provisions of the Australian Therapeutic Goods Act. While much of the documentation produced for obtaining the CE Mark in Europe can be used to obtain registration in Australia and the regulatory requirements are similar to European regulations, compliance generally requires the following:
  
• | full technical documentation demonstrating compliance to all relevant standards and regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | full quality assurance certification to the key international standard; and,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the ability of the manufacturer to undertake post market surveillance processes.
