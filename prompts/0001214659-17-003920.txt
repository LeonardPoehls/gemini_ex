Overview of Recent Developments
 
ZAP designs, develops, manufactures and sells fully electric and advanced technology vehicles. The acquisition of 51% of the equity shares of Zhejiang Jonway Automobile Co. Ltd., or Jonway, in January 2011 was attained by funding of initially more than $36 million from Cathaya Capital, of which US$19 million of the $36 million was in the form of a convertible note with interest. The goal was to have access to an automobile manufacturing facility for producing electric vehicles and to have access to the electric vehicle market in China through Jonway Automobile’s dealership network.  We believed that this would help position ZAP as a significant supplier to electric vehicles in the Chinese market.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has an outstanding unpaid principal balance of $20,679,069 due to China Electric Vehicle Corporation (“CEVC”) in regards to the Company’s Amended and Restated Promissory Note dated March 22, 2012 (“Note”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Note, CEVC has right to convert the unpaid principal balance of the Note into shares of common stock of the Company’s Chinese subsidiary - Jonway Auto (“Conversion”). Upon Conversion, the Company’s indebtedness to CEVC under the Note shall be satisfied in full and CEVC, or its designee, shall hold approximately 39.479% of the equity of Jonway Auto and the Company’s equity position in Jonway Auto shall be reduced from 51% to approximately 11.52%. Accordingly, the Company shall be forced to deconsolidate Jonway Auto.  On December 23, 2016, the Company received the Conversion Notice from CEVC.  Effective on April 3, 2017, the CEVC and the Board of the Company have mutually agreed to put the conversion temporarily on hold  as  the Board of the Company approved the initiation of due diligence with respect to the possible merger of the Company with Jonway Group’s motorcycle business with the intention of developing its “light electric vehicle” business. It is expected that the assessment of the merger and the related due diligence would be completed in the second quarter of 2017 and with a decision on the overall structure of the merger to be made by the end of the second quarter of 2017.  CEVC may elect to accept the shares of the Jonway Auto or accept the shares of the Company in satisfaction of the Note based on the outcome of the due diligence and the assessment result of the merger.
 
Effective on May 7, 2016, the Company accepted the resignations of Tian Ming and Bai Jianxiong, respectively, as directors.  Ms. Ming and Mr. Bai each resigned for personal reasons and not as a result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, accounting policies or practices.
 
Effective on October 21, 2016, the Company accepted the resignation of Co Nguyen as a director and as member of the Company’s Audit Committee.  Mr. Nguyen resigned for personal reasons and not as a result of any disagreement with the Company on any matter relating to the Company’s operations, accounting policies or practices.
 
The current board members remaining on the board are Alex Wang and Wang Huaiyi.

During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company experienced significant decrease of sales and enlarged operating loss due to multiple unexpected factors.  In 2016, the government reevaluated the policies on new energy vehicle subsidies and an “anti-subsidy” campaign was continuously practiced in 2016 and the payments of subsidies were reduced and delayed. The delay in subsidy payments by the central government has created uncertainty the Company’s EV sales.  Without the fast turnaround on the subsidies to support the working capital, the sales of Jonway Auto dropped substantially during fiscal 2016. In addition, all EV are now required to be re-evaluated for inclusion in a qualified catalog of models eligible for subsidies. But the updated catalog has yet to be published.
 
In order to more efficiently address the market demand for EVs, especially in the smaller cities, Jonway launched a smaller more economical lower speed vehicle (LSV), the Urbee which is lead acid based. This small lead acid battery EV is much cheaper than the lithium based EVs, but is not eligible for government subsidies.  The Urbee being a much lighter vehicle requires less battery and is able to sustain a reasonable range of 150 km between charges.
 
The Urbee EV is targeting the lower end market in China and internationally. However, today China does not offer low speed vehicle (LSV) licenses, and most of the LSVs sold in China are in the Shandong and Hunan provinces where local governments have granted an exception to support LSVs. The LSV products in China are not eligible for subsidy, even if produced with lithium batteries, because China has not yet approved this as an automobile category. Although several hundred thousand LSVs were sold in 2014, these have been sold primarily in the provinces where local governments have granted such exceptions to support LSVs in small towns and villages. This support is given in order to enable consumers to have a lower cost alternative means of transportation without adding to air pollution.
 
The near term objective for the Company is to produce EV minivan, and work with a few partners in China initially as OEM manufacturers with Dong Feng Motors’ label, and subsequently to co-label with Dong Feng so that Jonway Auto will begin to get market recognition for its products.  As for the Urbees, since China does not have a LSV category for its automobiles, many dealers are hesitant to carry Urbees.  Urbees as a LSV is not yet an authorized automobile category that can be registered with a license plate. The places where Urbees are sold in China are primarily in very small towns and villages where buyers are buying Urbees as an alternative to motorcycles for a safer and more comfortable means of transportation.  This market remains limited in China.  Since the Urbees are DOT approved for the US, the Company will begin a marketing effort to sell Urbees in special vertical markets in the US, such as retirement homes, resorts and university campuses.
 
The lithium batteries for EV remain expensive, and the Chinese market is reliant on subsidies to afford the purchase of EV.  The latest subsidy policies of China has changed and requires the EVs that are being sold to run a minimum of 30,000km before the government would process the subsidies.  This has significantly retarded the EV market, and has reduced the demand for the EV minivans from Dong Feng Motors.  As a result, Jonway Auto is now looking at other options to develop its business.  The overall demand for EV minivan has been reduced substantially due to the lack of available subsidies to compensate for the high cost of the lithium batteries.  The EV minivan market is particularly sensitive to cost, and without the immediate availability of the subsidies to support the sales, this market in China has shrunk.
 
The high cost of lithium battery EV power train has created working capital challenges for Jonway Auto. This represents more than 60 percent of the cost of the minivan EVs that are being produced.   Therefore without adequate working capital that is able to sustain a long payback period of at least 2 years for reimbursements from the government for subsidies, the EV minivan market will be stalled for the time being.
 
With the demand for high working capital, outstanding liability that Jonway Auto has accrued and the lack of bank financing because of Chinese bank credit crunch, ZAP and Jonway Auto are looking at several options to address the financial needs and outstanding liabilities.  Jonway Auto may in the future be looking for equity financing in China which may reduce ZAP’s majority ownership of Jonway Auto.  Therefore, ZAP is considering reorganizing the Company to reduce the financial burdens of the bank loans and supplier payables that were carried over from the gasoline vehicle business under Jonway Auto and separating this from the business associated with the sales and marketing of EVs produced by Jonway and potentially with other partner companies’ electric vehicles, such as the recent agreement signed with Dong Feng Automobile for the EV minivans. Currently the sales and marketing organization of Jonway Auto is under a separate subsidiary of Jonway Auto, and this may be retained by ZAP while reorganizing the manufacturing production arm of Jonway Auto. The repayment of the CEVC convertible note would also reduce the outstanding liability of ZAP, while maintaining control of the sales and marketing of Jonway Auto’s business with the sales subsidiary.

Background and History
 
ZAP has twenty years of experience inventing, designing, manufacturing and selling innovative products. In 1995, we began marketing electric transportation on the internet through our website www.zapworld.com. We have been a pioneer in developing and marketing electric vehicles such as the zero- emission ZAP® electric bicycle, the ZAP Power System, which adapts to most bicycles and the ZAPPY® folding electric scooter. In 2003, we announced our first electric automobiles, including an electric automobile imported from our Chinese supplier. And in 2004, we introduced electric all-terrain vehicles. In 2005, we introduced multi-fuel vehicles, capable of running on ethanol and/or gasoline. From 2006 to 2009, we introduced the all-electric Xebra Truck, ZAP Truck XL and ZAPVAN Shuttle.
 
ZAP was incorporated in 1994 under the name “ZAP Power Systems,” and changed its name to “ZAPWORLD.COM” in 1999 and ZAP in 2001. ZAP’s principal executive offices are located at 2 West 3rd Street, Santa Rosa, California 95401. ZAP’s telephone number is (707) 525-8658. ZAP’s main company website is www.zapworld.com. Information contained on the website is not incorporated by reference herein and you should not consider information on the website to be part of this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
ZAP has twenty years of experience designing, developing, manufacturing and selling innovative electric transportation products and Jonway has more than ten years of automobile manufacturing production history, and holds the rights to the license for manufacturing SUVs and minivans (Chinese Auto License #6) issued out of the city of Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province. This is the only automobile license issued by Hangzhou city, which is considered one of the largest and more industrially advanced cities in China. Jonway’s factory has approximately 400 factory workers and engineers and around 1 million square feet of manufacturing space, with the ability to produce up to 50,000 automobiles per year, and an extensive sales distribution network in China.
 

Our Vehicles and Products
 
ZAP Automotive Products: Electric Vehicles
 
ZAP Jonway SUV A380, E380 and E380-S. ZAP’s current automotive product line includes the all-electric E-380 SUV. The E-380 SUV has a range of 150km and speed of up to 130km per hour. It has a 25 kwatt engine, with peak performance of over 60kwatt. This has been type approved for China and is available for international markets.  This product although is available but is no longer marketed due to the high cost and lack of readily available subsidy from the government.
ZAP Jonway Minivan. The Minivan which was introduced in 2012 is offered in the traditional gasoline model with a 1.1 liter engine. This minivan offered as EV with two options in 2015: one with lead acid for the low end market where range is limited to 80km and speed is no more than 100km per hour and a high end model with lithium batteries where speed is 130km per hour and range is over 200 km distance. This product is being produced in very small volume due to the lower demand from Dong Feng Motors, as a result of the changed subsidy policies of China.
 
URBEE. The Urbee is a low-speed electric vehicle. With a driving range of over 150 km per charge, it is ideally suited for daily city driving with overnight recharging. The Urbee can hold up to two passengers is designed for corporate and university campuses, airports, warehouses, military bases, retirement communities and golf courses. A four passenger, four door version is now available in China, and has a higher power engine. The maximum speed for the Urbee is 60kph (~37 mph). The Urbee is type approved for Europe as L6 vehicle, and DOT approved as LSV in the U.S. As it is classified as a LSV (Low speed vehicle) the Urbee is limited by its controller to travel at speed up to 25 mph (the maximum for LSV’s) in the US and European markets. This vehicle is DOT compliant and the Company is obtaining CARB approval in the US for all the different versions of the Urbees and the European version for the 2-door had been type approved for Europe.

Jonway and other Strategic Relationships
 
Jonway.
 
We acquired 51% of the equity shares of Jonway in January 2011.
 
Jonway is a limited liability company incorporated in Sanmen County, Zhejiang Province of the People’s Republic of China, or PRC, in April 2004 by Jonway Group Co., Ltd., or Jonway Group, and three individuals.
 
Under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, only an enterprise approved by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and listed in the National Catalog for Whole Automobile Manufacturing Enterprises and Products, or the National Catalog, is allowed to manufacture whole automobiles and is limited to the models designated therein for each manufacturer. The National Catalog functions as a manufacturing permit or license to allow the enterprises to manufacture specified automobile models under specified brands, as listed in therein.
 
Neither Jonway nor Jonway Group is in the National Catalog or qualified directly to produce whole automobiles. Zhejiang UFO Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd., or Zhejiang UFO, to which Jonway Group is one of three shareholders with minority interest, is listed in the National Catalog as a qualified manufacturer of certain UFO-brand cars. Jonway currently has authorization from Zhejiang UFO to use Zhejiang UFO’s manufacturing permits and licenses to assemble and sell the automobiles manufactured by Jonway at the Sanmen branch of Zhejiang UFO, or the Sanmen Branch, pursuant to the Contractual Operation Agreement entered into among Zhejiang UFO, Jonway and Jonway Group on January 1, 2006, or the Operations Agreement. This agreement gives Jonway the authority to manufacture #6 Catalogue licensed vehicles which specifically includes SUVs and Minivans in China. This license is required in China for sales in China and for export internationally. Pursuant to the Operations Agreement:
 
 
· | Zhejiang UFO granted Jonway the full power to operate and manage the Sanmen Branch and manufacture the SUV and minivan products for which Zhejiang UFO has manufacturing permits or licenses, except for certain professional matters; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The parties agreed that the Sanmen Branch shall not manufacture or sell other automobiles or products without Zhejiang UFO’s authorization or conduct any business with a third party other than Jonway; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Jonway agreed to pay certain contracting fees to Zhejiang UFO. Zhejiang UFO and Jonway Group have mutually agreed that the Operations Agreement will be extended indefinitely for Jonway to produce and sell the SUV and minivan models. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



We understand that laws of the People’s Republic of China do not expressly prohibit the aforementioned arrangements. However, it is possible that the government of the People’s Republic of China may decide that manufacturing Jonway automobiles under Zhejiang UFO’s license or the manufacturing of vehicles with a brand name other than the UFO brand listed in the National Catalog is not in full compliance with laws of the People’s Republic of China. In this case, Jonway could face sanctions from the government, including fines, an order to cease operations, and revocation of Jonway’s general business license. To be a qualified automobile manufacturer, Jonway may apply to the government of the People’s Republic of China to be separately listed on the National Catalog.  However, due to the current industry policies of the government of the People’s Republic of China, new manufacturing permits and licenses are rarely, if ever, granted and even then, applying for new models is likely to be a time-consuming process.  Also, if the government were to revoke Zhejiang UFO's license or if Zhejiang UFO refuses to apply for Jonway models under the National Catalog, Jonway may have to look for alternative partners that could lend the use of such a license for a fee. If this were to happen, it may take some time to formalize the agreement with the potential new partner. However, this is not uncommon, as currently, there are many companies in China already utilizing another company’s license to manufacture the automobiles.

Jonway has a general business license issued by the company registration authority of the People’s Republic of China, indicating that it is duly incorporated, validly existing and has an operation term of 36 years, or until 2040, which term may be extended, subject to government approval.
 
Under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, a foreign investor is not allowed to acquire more than a 50% equity interest in a company which is qualified to manufacture whole automobiles. As Jonway is not in the National Catalog and is not qualified to produce whole automobiles, ZAP’s acquisition of 51% of the equity shares of Jonway has been approved by the relevant governmental authorities.
 
In July 2010, ZAP entered into that Certain Equity Transfer Agreement for the Purchase and Transfer of Certain Equity Interest in Zhejiang Jonway Automobile Co., Ltd, as amended with Jonway Group, or the Jonway Acquisition Agreement, for the acquisition of 51% of the total equity shares of Jonway, for a total purchase price of $31.75 million of which $29.03 million in cash was paid from the funding by Cathaya Capital into ZAP in order to attain the 51% equity purchase and an additional 8 million shares of ZAP stock valued at $2.72 million have been paid for the total purchase price of $31.75 million. To complete this transaction, Cathaya Capital funded ZAP a total of US$36 million at the time when the transaction was closed. Out of this $36 million, $19 million was in the form of a convertible note through a special purpose vehicle China Electric Vehicle Corporation (CEVC). With interest accrual the current face value of the note is US$20,679,069.
 
On January 21, 2011, ZAP completed the acquisition of 51% of the equity shares of Jonway, which transaction was approved by the Department of Commerce of Zhejiang Province in September 2010. As of December 31, 2014, ZAP, Jonway Group, Wang Gang and Wang Xiao Ying held 51%, 39%, 8% and 2% of Jonway’s equity shares, respectively.  In June 2010, ZAP issued 40 million shares of stock valued at $10 million to Cathaya Capital, L.P., or Cathaya, in order to pay $10 million of the purchase price under the Jonway Acquisition Agreement. In January 2011, ZAP issued $19 million of convertible debt to CEVC, a subsidiary of Cathaya in order to pay an additional $19,030,000 under the Jonway Acquisition Agreement, including a foreign currency adjustment of $30,000. In March 2012, the convertible debt was extended to August 12, 2013 with no interest payments. This convertible note has been extended subsequently multiple times, each time for an additional year and the last extension puts the expiration date at December 31, 2016, with interest accrual at 8% per annum. As of December 31, 2016, the Company has an outstanding unpaid principal balance of $20,679,069 CEVC in regards to the Company’s convertible note.  Pursuant to the terms of the convertible note, CEVC has right to convert the unpaid principal balance of the Note into shares of common stock of the Company’s Chinese subsidiary -Jonway Auto (“Conversion”). Upon Conversion, the Company’s indebtedness to CEVC under the Note shall be satisfied in full and CEVC, or its designee, shall hold approximately 39.479% of the equity of Jonway Auto and the Company’s equity position in Jonway Auto shall be reduced from 51% to approximately 11.52%. Accordingly, the Company shall be forced to deconsolidate Jonway Auto.
 On December 23, 2016, the Company received the Conversion Notice from CEVC. Effective on April 3, 2017, the CEVC and the Board of the Company have mutually agreed to put the conversion temporarily on hold  as  the Board of the Company approved the initiation of due diligence with respect to the possible merger of the Company with Jonway Group’s motorcycle business with the intention of developing its “light electric vehicle” business. It is expected that the assessment of the merger and the related due diligence would be completed in the second quarter of 2017 and with a decision on the overall structure of the merger to be made by the end of the second quarter of 2017.  CEVC may elect to accept the shares of the Jonway Auto or accept the shares of the Company in satisfaction of the Note based on the outcome of the due diligence and the assessment result of the merger.
 
Jonway is located at the Da Tang industry zone of Jiantiao Village, Sanmen County, Zhejiang Province in China.  Jonway has around 1 million square feet of manufacturing space, on 64 acres of land with the ability to produce up to 50,000 automobiles per year. Jonway distributes its vehicles through a network of more than three hundred factory and authorized dealers. The lack of working capital has constrained the production delivery of the SUVs despite orders in the backlog.  The reduced working capital caused delay in shipments for orders placed by the dealers.  This delay in shipment further aggravates the reduction of sales.   Chinese banks overall have been reducing the available credit to small and medium size companies in China, in order to increase the banks’ credit reserves.  Jonway’s loans with the banks, following market trends, have been reduced due to the bank’s credit reduction.  Jonway is seeking additional financing from Chinese banks and institutions.  If Jonway were successful in getting investors or strategic partners to do equity funding of the working capital and on-going manufacturing costs of Jonway, ZAP’s equity ownership of Jonway will be reduced to below 51%.  However, ZAP would still continue to own the rights for sales of the EV products of Jonway.
 
Jonway launched the five-door manual transmission A380 SUV and the five-door automatic transmission A380 SUV in March 2009 and in October 2010, respectively. In 2014, Jonway reduced the number of different SUV models offered to the dealers and focused on promoting the more cost competitive 1.5 liter model. Jonway has stopped the production of its gasoline SUVs and minivan due to its realignment to focus on electric vehicle market only. Jonway successfully introduced Urbee, a lead acid driven small electric vehicle in April 2014. This widens the product line of the Company, and allows it to sell these smaller LSV EVs internationally.

ZAP Hangzhou. In 2009, ZAP and Better world formed a joint venture technology development company in Hangzhou. Currently, the joint venture is 37.5% owned by ZAP, 25% owned by Jonway Group, and 37.5% owned by Better World. The joint venture has been discontinued due to the cost of supporting a separate satellite office in Hangzhou.  The company registration will be dissolved this year.  All of the engineering formally done within this organization has been moved to Sanmen.
 
Better World sales and distribution of Z-Chargers. ZAP USA has exclusive sales and distribution rights on Better World’s Z-Charger stations. Due to the limited resources of the Company and Jonway Auto’s focus on manufacturing only EV minivans in order to reduce capital costs, and operational overhead, the charging station business has been discontinued before 2015.
 
Technology
 
ZAP has developed expertise in electric drive train integration and ZAP Hangzhou JV has filed more than 10 patents, and has key technologies in the area of vehicle management system (VMS). This is the control system that manages and coordinates the functions between the motor, the battery management system and the auxiliary systems that require power from the batteries, such as power steering, power brakes, air conditioning and heating, power windows and locks.
 
Jonway’s research and development expenses were $0.4 million in 2016 and $1.5 million in 2015.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
The sales by ZAP has been underfunded and the Company was unable to deliver sales in the US or South America.  As a result, the international sales effort has been on hold.  With the new focus by Jonway to emphasize primarily on electric vehicle markets in China, the dealerships established for the gasoline products are not necessarily appropriate. Given the lack of readily available recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles, the main market for EVs  could be fleets. The current dealership networks from Jonway sell primarily to end customers. Fleet markets tend to be vertical markets that are better addressed by specialized sales force.  This new sales force or sales channel is currently being cultivated through the partnerships that Jonway is establishing with its minivan EV partners.
 
Historically, we spent a low level of marketing and sales expenditure due to the shortage of available funds, and as a result Jonway has relied more on the major partners that it has established recently to launch the sales of its EV products.
 
After-Sales Services
 
ZAP currently offers a limited one-year warranty on its fleet and utility vehicles and six- and three-month warranties on its consumer electric scooters and bicycles, respectively. ZAP offers factory-training for dealer and distributor service technicians.   In China, Jonway Auto provides a one year warranty on the products it delivers to Dong Feng Motors, and plans to follow the same service support model with other major EV partners.  The strategy for EV marketing and sales is to remain focused on working with major partners instead of developing local direct sales dealers due to Jonway’s focus on fleets which are primarily with strategic partners as well as the cost overhead of direct sales and marketing.
 
Manufacturing
 
ZAP Jonway manufactures the A380 electric SUV and the minivan at Jonway’s manufacturing facility in Sanmen, Zhejiang China.  This facility has the capacity to produce up to 50,000 vehicles per year, this includes the production of EV minivans.   In 2014, Jonway commenced the production of Urbee with the production capacity of 30,000 vehicles per year. Jonway’s facility is certified under the ISO 9000 quality standards promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization.
 
Jonway’s manufacturing operations include pressing, welding, painting and assembling lines.
 
Sources and Availability of Parts and Supplies
 
Materials, parts, supplies and services used in ZAP Jonway’s business are generally available from a variety of sources. However, interruptions in production or delivery of these goods could have an adverse impact on our general operations, or our manufacturer’s operations and production of ZAP Jonway’s products. ZAP Jonway strives to have at least two sources for parts and supplies. ZAP Jonway continues to forge partnerships with top tier suppliers in the automotive and electric vehicle component business.  Mitsubishi currently supplies a complete drive train for the Jonway A380 SUV.

Regulation
 
Vehicle Safety and Testing
 
In China, the vehicles sold have to undergo type approval for safety and compliance to local regulatory requirements for both gasoline and electric vehicles. These type approvals are granted only for vehicles that have been authorized as one of the catalogued registered license vehicles that the automobile manufacturer is allowed to manufacture and sell in China.
 
In the U.S., our vehicles are subject to numerous regulatory requirements established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, or NHTSA, including all applicable United States federal motor vehicle safety standards, or FMVSS. As a manufacturer, we must self-certify that a vehicle meets or otherwise obtain an exemption from all applicable FMVSSs, as well as the NHTSA bumper standard, before the vehicle can be imported into or sold in the United States. There are numerous FMVSSs that apply to our vehicles. Examples of these requirements include:
 
  
· | Crash-worthiness requirements—including applicable and appropriate level of vehicle structure and occupant protection in frontal, side and interior impacts including through use of equipment such as seat belts and airbags which must satisfy applicable requirements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Crash avoidance requirements—including appropriate steering, braking, electronic stability control and equipment requirements, such as, headlamps, tail lamps, and other required lamps, all of which must conform to various photometric and performance requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Electric vehicle requirements—limitations on electrolyte spillage, battery retention, and avoidance of electric shock following specified crash tests;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Windshield defrosting and defogging—defined zones of the windshield must be cleared within a specified timeframe; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Rearview mirror requirements—rearward areas that must be visible to the driver via the mirrors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



Several FMVSS regulations that NHTSA has promulgated or amended recently contain phase-in provisions requiring increasing percentages of a manufacturer’s vehicles to comply over a period of several model years. Those FMVSSs generally allow low volume manufacturers (those who manufacture fewer than 5,000 vehicles annually for sale in the United States) and limited line manufacturers (those who sell three or fewer vehicle lines in the United States) to defer compliance until the end of the phase-in period. Under U.S. law, we are required to certify compliance with, or obtain exemption from, all applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards.
 
We are also required to comply with other NHTSA requirements of federal laws administered by NHTSA, including the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, consumer information labeling requirements, early warning reporting requirements regarding warranty claims, field reports, death and injury reports and foreign recalls, and owner’s manual requirements.
 
Our vehicles sold in Europe are subject to European Union safety testing regulations. Many of those regulations, referred to as European Union Whole Vehicle Type Approval, or WVTA, are different from the federal motor vehicle safety standards applicable in the United States and may require redesign and/or retesting. The Small Series WVTA permits the manufacture and sale in the European Union of no more than 1,000 vehicles per year. ZAP Jonway plans to keep European sales of ZAP Jonway vehicles at less than 1,000 vehicles per year, and has no plans to commence testing of ZAP Jonway vehicles for the WVTA to assure compliance with the European Union requirements to permit unlimited sales. Similarly, Japan has additional testing regulations applicable to high volume manufacturers, in addition to import rules. We also plan to keep Japanese sales of ZAP Jonway vehicles at a low volume, and have no plans to comply with the Japanese requirements to permit high volume sales in these jurisdictions.
 
The EPA requires us to calculate and display the range of our electric vehicles on a label we affix to the vehicle’s window. The EPA specifies that we follow testing requirements set forth by the Society of Automotive Engineers, or SAE, which further requires that we test using the United States EPA’s combined city and highway testing cycles. Based on initial indications from the EPA, we believe it is likely that the EPA will modify its testing cycles in a manner that, when applied to our vehicles, could reduce the advertised range of our vehicles. To the extent that the EPA adopts these procedures in place of the current procedures from the SAE, this could impair our ability to advertise ZAP vehicles at their current advertised range. Moreover, such changes could impair our ability to deliver the Alias and the electric Jonway A380 SUV with the initially advertised range. Although the real life customer experience of the range of our electric vehicles will not change due to the changes in the EPA standards, the reduction in the advertised range could negatively impact our sales and harm our business.

The Automobile Information and Disclosure Act require manufacturers of motor vehicles to disclose certain information regarding the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, optional equipment and pricing. In addition, the Act allows inclusion of city and highway fuel economy ratings, as determined by EPA, as well as crash test ratings as determined by NHTSA if such tests are conducted. As a manufacturer of only electric vehicles, compliance with the EPA labeling requirements on fuel economy is currently optional for ZAP.
 
EPA Emissions & Certificate of Conformity
 
For ZAP Business
 
The Clean Air Act requires that we obtain a Certificate of Conformity issued by the EPA and a California Executive Order issued by the California Air Resources Board, or CARB, with respect to emissions for our vehicles, particularly greenhouse gasses. The Certificate of Conformity is required for vehicles sold in states covered by the Clean Air Act’s standards and both the Certificate of Conformity and the Executive Order is required for vehicles sold in states that have sought and received a waiver from the EPA to utilize California standards. The California standards for emissions control for certain regulated pollutants for new vehicles and engines sold in California are set by CARB. States that have adopted the California standards as approved by EPA also recognize the Executive Order for sales of vehicles. The EPA and CARB are both moving forward with more stringent regulations regarding greenhouse gases for future model years and ZAP may face increased cost in complying with these regulations for conventional fuel vehicles.  The EV Urbee is CARB and DOT approved for the US market.
 
Manufacturers who sell vehicles without a Certificate of Conformity may be subject to penalties of up to $37,500 per violation and be required to recall and remedy any vehicles sold with emissions in excess of Clean Air Act standards.
 
For Jonway Business
 
The China government has adopted various measures to institute a uniform supervision and administration system with respect to vehicle emissions, including an automobile product authentication procedure and a network of testing centers across China. The State Environmental Protection Administration from time to time publishes notices to inform the public of new vehicle models that comply with its regulatory emission standards. Automobile manufacturers are not allowed to produce or register vehicle model or automobile product that failed to comply with such regulatory emission standards.
 
The State Environmental Protection Administration limits exhaust emission on the basis of China I, II, III and IV. Different limits of exhaust emission and testing measures in these standards shall be applied to different types of vehicles.
 
Battery Safety and Testing
 
Our battery pack conforms to mandatory regulations that govern transport of “dangerous goods” that may present a risk in transportation, which includes lithium-ion batteries. The governing regulations, which are issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, are based on the UN Recommendations on the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods Model Regulations, and related UN Manual Tests and Criteria. The regulations vary by mode of transportation when these items are shipped such as by ocean vessel, rail, truck, or by air.
 
We have completed the applicable transportation tests for our prototype and production battery packs demonstrating our compliance with the UN Manual of Tests and Criteria, including:
 
  
· | Altitude simulation—simulating air transport;
--+----------------------------------------------


· | Thermal cycling—assessing cell and battery seal integrity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


· | Vibration—simulating vibration during transport;
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Shock—simulating possible impacts during transport;
--+----------------------------------------------------


· | External short circuit—simulating an external short circuit; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Overcharge—evaluating the ability of a rechargeable battery to withstand overcharging.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The cells in our battery packs are composed mainly of lithium metal oxides. The cells do not contain any lead, mercury, cadmium, or other hazardous materials, heavy metals, or any toxic materials. In addition, our battery packs include packaging for the lithium-ion cells. This packaging includes trace amounts of various hazardous chemicals whose use, storage and disposal is regulated under federal law. The NHTSA is likely to issue regulations regarding lithium ion batteries and electronic control systems in the future and ZAP will face the cost of complying with such regulations.
 
Automobile Manufacturer and Dealer Regulation
 
State law regulates the manufacture, distribution and sale of automobiles, and generally requires motor vehicle manufacturers and dealers to be licensed. We are registered as both a motor vehicle manufacturer and dealer in California and are obtaining or have obtained certification in other states.
 
To the extent possible, we plan to secure dealer licenses (or the equivalent of a dealer license) and engage in activities as a motor vehicle dealer in other states as appropriate and necessary. Some states, such as Texas, do not permit automobile manufacturers to be licensed as dealers or to act in the capacity of a dealer. To sell vehicles to residents of states where we are not licensed as a dealer, to the extent permitted by local law, both the actual sale and all activities related to the sale would generally have to occur out of state. In this scenario, it is possible that activities related to marketing, advertising, taking orders, taking reservations and reservation payments, and delivering vehicles could be viewed by a state as conducting unlicensed activities in the state or otherwise violating the state’s motor vehicle industry laws. Regulators in these states may require us to hold and meet the requirements of appropriate dealer or other licenses and, in states in which manufacturers are prohibited from acting as dealers, may otherwise prohibit or impact our planned activities.
 
In jurisdictions other than California, a customer may try to purchase our vehicles over the internet. However, some states, such as Kansas, have laws providing that a manufacturer cannot deliver a vehicle to a resident of such state except through a dealer licensed to do business in that state which may be interpreted to require us to open a store in the state of Kansas in order to sell vehicles to Kansas residents. Such laws may be interpreted to require us to open a store in such state before we sell vehicles to residents of such states. If we sell vehicles to such a state without having opened a store there, the state could take action against us; including levying fines or requiring that we refrain from certain activities at that location. In addition, some states have requirements that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold in the state, which may be interpreted to also require that service facilities be available with respect to vehicles sold over the internet to residents of the state, thereby limiting our ability to sell vehicles in states other than California.
 
The foregoing examples of state laws governing the sale of motor vehicles are just some of the regulations we will face as we sell our vehicles. In many states, the application of state motor vehicle laws to our specific sales model is largely without precedent, particularly with respect to sales over the internet, and would be determined by a fact specific analysis of numerous factors, including whether we have a physical presence or employees in the applicable state, whether we advertise or conduct other activities in the applicable state, how the sale transaction is structured, the volume of sales into the state, and whether the state in question prohibits manufacturers from acting as dealers. As a result of the fact specific and untested nature of these issues, and the fact that applying these laws intended for the traditional automobile distribution model to our sales model allows for some interpretation and discretion by the regulators, state legal prohibitions may prevent us from selling to consumers in such state.
 
California laws, and potentially the laws of other states, restrict the ability of licensed dealers to advertise or take deposits for vehicles before they are available. We have not received any communications on our Alias reservations from the New Motor Vehicle Board or the Department of Motor Vehicles, or DMV, which has the power to enforce these laws. There can be no assurance that the DMV will not take the position that our vehicle reservation or advertising practices violate the law. We expect that if the DMV determines that we may have violated the law, it would initially discuss its concerns with us and request voluntary compliance. If we are ultimately found to be in violation of California law, we might be precluded from taking reservation payments, and the DMV could take other actions against us, including levying fines and requiring us to refund reservation payments. Resolution of any inquiry may also involve restructuring certain aspects of the reservation program. The DMV also has the power to suspend licenses to manufacture and sell vehicles in California, following a hearing on the merits, which it has typically exercised only in cases of significant or repeat violations and/or a refusal to comply with DMV directions.
 
Certain states may have specific laws which apply to dealers, or manufacturers selling directly to consumers, or both. For example, the state of Washington requires that reservation payments or other payment received from residents in the state of Washington must be placed in a segregated account until delivery of the vehicle, which account must be unencumbered by any liens from creditors of the dealer and may not be used by the dealer. We do not have a segregated account for reservations of Washington residents, but the reservations are freely refundable and ZAP has not used the capital provided by such reservations. Our failure to comply with this requirement could require us to return or refund the reservation, or result in other fines or penalties. There can be no assurance that other state or foreign jurisdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payment received from customers. Our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could harm our liquidity.
 
 13
 

Furthermore, while we have performed an analysis of the principal laws in the European Union relating to our distribution model and believe we comply with such laws, we have not performed a complete analysis in all foreign jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions we have not yet entered or laws we are unaware of in jurisdictions we have entered that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices. Even for those jurisdictions we have analyzed, the laws in this area can be complex, difficult to interpret and may change over time.
 
In addition to licensing laws, specific laws and regulations in each of the states and their interpretation by regulators may limit or determine how we sell, market, advertise, and otherwise solicit sales, take orders, take reservations and reservation payments, deliver, and service vehicles for consumers and engage in other activities in that state. We have not performed a complete analysis in all jurisdictions in which we may sell vehicles. Accordingly, there may be laws in jurisdictions where we sell vehicles that may restrict our vehicle reservation practices or other business practices.
 
Warranties
 
Under the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, our written warranties must disclose, fully and conspicuously, in simple and readily understood language, the terms and conditions of the warranty to the extent required by rules of the Federal Trade Commission. Our warranties must comply with certain federal and state mandated requirements. We currently offer three and six-month warranties on our products.
Non-Highway Vehicle Regulations
 
The federal government and individual states have promulgated or are considering promulgating laws and regulations relating to the use and safety of certain of our products. The federal government is currently the primary regulator of product safety. The NHTSA has federal oversight over product safety issues related to NEVs and low speed vehicles.  We have regulated the speed of our NEVs to comply with NHTSA requirements.
China Regulations for Jonway Vehicles
 
Filing or Approval Requirement for Automobile Manufacturing Projects
 
On May 21, 2004, the People’s Republic of China’s National Development and Reform Commission, or NDRC, promulgated the Policy on Developing the Automotive Industry, or the Developing Policy, which requires certain investment projects for automobile manufacturing to obtain an approval from the NDRC at the proper level and meet certain requirements regarding parts manufactured, technology development capacity, total investment and production scale. For example, to establish a new auto manufacturing company, the total investment shall be no less than RMB 2 billion, among which the self-owned capital shall be no less than RMB 800 million. The project must establish a research and development center and the investment in the research and development center shall be no less than RMB 500 million. Investment projects of newly established passenger car or heavy-cargo vehicle manufacturer shall also manufacture engines that match the complete vehicles.
 
Under the laws of the People’s Republic of China, a foreign investor may not acquire more than a 50% equity interest in a company qualified to manufacture whole automobiles. A foreign investor-backed automobile manufacturer must also be structured such that the Chinese party owns not less than 50% of the equity shares of such a joint venture. The State Council, through the national NDRC and the Ministry of Commerce or its competent local delegate, must approve newly established projects for manufacturing automobiles with foreign investment.
 
National Catalog
 
Under the law of the People's Republic of China, only an enterprise approved by Ministry of Industry and Information Technology and listed in the National Catalog is allowed to manufacture whole automobiles and is limited to the models listed therein.  Any new vehicle model must be listed in the National Catalog. Based on a contract by and among the Sanmen Branch of Zhejiang UFO Automobile Manufacturing Co., Ltd. (“Zhejiang UFO”), Jonway Group and Jonway dated as of January 1, 2006, Zhejiang UFO has authorized Jonway to operate its Sanmen Branch to assemble and sell UFO branded SUVs for a period of 10 years starting from January 1, 2006, and all parties have agreed that this will be extended beyond this period indefinitely. All of Jonway Automobile’s vehicles’ applications for National Catalog have been done by Zhejiang UFO. The National Catalog license under UFO authorizes the manufacturing of SUVs and minivans, and the agreement between Zhejiang UFO and Jonway Group is that Jonway Automobile will have exclusivity on this National Catalogue license to manufacture and sell the approved SUVs and minivans applied through UFO’s license
 
According to the Developing Policy, an investment project for manufacturing automobile components and parts must be filed with the provincial NDRC and a company with foreign investment must be approved by the Ministry of Commerce, or its competent local delegate. Jonway has complied with all the government regulations.
 
 14
 

China Compulsory Certification
 
The Provisions on the Administration of Compulsory Product Certification promulgated by the People’s Republic of China’s State Administration on Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine require the compulsory product certification, or CCC, for certain products, such as automobiles, which must be so marked before they leave the factory, are sold, are imported or are used in other business activities shall administer the compulsory product certification throughout the country. The SUVs manufactured by Jonway at the Sanmen Branch have this certification.
Competition
 
ZAP Jonway currently faces strong competition from established automobile manufacturers, including manufacturers of all-electric vehicles such as the Nissan LEAF. The electric vehicles from Tesla and other models from Mitsubishi are already on the market or will be introduced soon. In addition, several manufacturers, including General Motors, Toyota, Ford, and Honda, are each selling hybrid vehicles, and certain of these manufacturers have announced plug-in versions of their hybrid vehicles, such as the Chevrolet Volt, which is a plug-in hybrid vehicle that operates purely on electric power for a limited number of miles, at which time an internal combustion engine engages to recharge the battery.
 
Moreover, it has been reported that Daimler, Lexus, Audi, Renault, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and Subaru are also developing electric vehicles. Several other companies have also announced plans to enter the market for performance electric vehicles, although none of these have yet come to market. Finally, electric vehicles have already been brought to market in China and other foreign countries where ZAP Jonway operates or hopes to operate and we also expect a number of those manufacturers to enter the United States market as well.
 
ZAP Jonway faces competition on its conventional fuel vehicles in China from established automobile manufacturers Honda and Ford, and from China- based manufacturers Chery, Zongtai and Great Wall Auto.
 
Our competitors generally have more significant financial resources, established market positions, longstanding relationships with customers and dealers, and more significant name recognition, technical, marketing, sales, manufacturing, distribution and other resources than ZAP Jonway does. The resources available to ZAP Jonway’s competitors to develop new products and introduce them into the marketplace exceed the resources currently available to ZAP Jonway. ZAP Jonway also faces competition from smaller companies with respect to ZAP’s consumer products, such as ZAP’s electric bicycle and scooter. ZAP Jonway expects to face competition from the makers of consumer batteries and small electronics with respect to the ZAP portable energy line. This intense competitive environment may require ZAP Jonway to make changes in our products, pricing, licensing, services, distribution or marketing to develop, maintain and improve ZAP Jonway’s current technology and market position.
 
Seasonal Variations
 
ZAP Jonway’s business is subject to seasonal influences for consumer products. Sales volumes in this industry typically slow down during the winter months from November to March in the United States and during the spring and summer months in China.
Inflation
 
ZAP and Jonway’s raw materials and finished products and automobiles are sourced from stable, cost-competitive industries. As such, we do not foresee any material inflationary trends for our product sources.
Intellectual Property
 
ZAP Jonway’s success depends, at least in part, on our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, ZAP Jonway relies on a combination of patents, patent applications, trade secrets, including know-how, employee and third party nondisclosure agreements, copyright laws, trademarks, intellectual property licenses and other contractual rights to establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology.
 
ZAP Jonway does not know whether any of ZAP or Jonway’s pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or whether the examination process will require ZAP or Jonway to narrow their claims. Even if granted, there can be no assurance that these pending patent applications will provide ZAP Jonway with protection.
 
Subsidiaries
 
ZAP has the following wholly-owned subsidiaries:  Voltage Vehicles, a Nevada company, ZAP Hong Kong, a Hong Kong limited company. Voltage Vehicles is not currently an operating subsidiary. Voltage Vehicles stopped operations in October 2013. ZAP Hong Kong was established in 2011 as a wholly foreign owned enterprises (“WOFE”) and has no operation since incorporated.
 
 15
 

We hold 51% of the equity shares of Jonway. As of December 31, 2016, Jonway has the following wholly-owned subsidiaries: Jonway Taizhou Selling Company, Jonway Taizhou Leasing Company and Taizhou Fuxing Vehicles Sale Co., Ltd. We also have 37.5% equity investment in ZAP Hangzhou Joint Venture and 50% equity investment in Shanghai Zapple Joint Venture.  Both the ZAP Hangzhou Joint Venture and Shanghai Zapple Joint Venture are no longer in operation.
 
Employees
 
As of April 17, 2017, the Company’s subsidiary of Jonway Auto had a total of over 435 employees, all of whom are full-time employees.  In 2016, Jonway Auto replaced or retrained the majority of its factory staff in order to realign the skills of the employees to support EV production.

NOTE 1 - ORGANIZATION
 
ZAP was incorporated in California in September, 1994 (together with its subsidiaries, the “Company” or “ZAP Group”).  ZAP Group markets electric, alternative energy, and fuel efficient automobiles and commercial vehicles, motorcycles and scooters, and other forms of personal transportation. The Company’s business strategy is to develop, acquire, and commercialize electric vehicles and electric vehicle power systems which the Company believes have fundamental practical and environmental advantages over available internal combustion modes of transportation and that can be produced commercially on an economically competitive basis. 
 
In pursuit of a manufacturing plant and a partner with an existing product line, a distribution and customer support network in China, and experience in vehicle manufacturing, ZAP acquired a majority of the outstanding equity in Zhejiang Jonway Automobile Co., Ltd. (“Jonway Auto”). At the time of the acquisition, the Company believed that its acquisition of 51% equity interest of Jonway Auto would enable it to access the rapidly-growing Chinese market for electric vehicles (“EV”) and to expand its EV business and distribution network around the world. The Company also believed Jonway Auto’s ISO 9001 certified manufacturing facility would provide the competitive production capacity and resources to support production of ZAP Group’s planned line of electric SUV, minivan, and Neighborhood EV (“NEV”). 
 
Jonway Auto is a limited liability company incorporated in Sanmen County, Zhejiang Province of the People’s Republic of China (the “PRC”) on April 28, 2004 by Jonway Group Co., Ltd. (“Jonway Group”). Jonway Group is under the control of three individuals, Wang Huaiyi, Alex Wang (the son of Wang Huaiyi) and Wang Xiaoying (the daughter of Wang Huaiyi), and all three individuals are collectively referred to as the “Wang Family” herein with. 
 
ZAP has a wholly owned subsidiary, ZAP Hong Kong, a Hong Kong limited company. ZAP Hong Kong was established in 2011 as a wholly foreign owned enterprises (“WOFE”) and has no operation since incorporated. Jonway Auto established three wholly-owned subsidiaries, namely, Taizhou Selling Co., Ltd., focusing on vehicles marketing and distribution, Taizhou Fuxing Vehicle Sale Co., Ltd., focusing on minivan marketing and distribution in China, and Taizhou Vehicle Leasing Co., Ltd., focusing on the vehicle leasing business in Taizhou.
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company has an outstanding unpaid principal balance of $20,679,069 due to China Electric Vehicle Corporation (“CEVC”) in regards to the Company’s Amended and Restated Promissory Note dated March 22, 2012 (“Note”).  Pursuant to the terms of the Note, CEVC has right to convert the unpaid principal balance of the Note into shares of common stock of the Company’s Chinese subsidiary, Jonway Auto (“Conversion”). Upon Conversion, the Company’s indebtedness to CEVC under the Note shall be satisfied in full and CEVC, or its designee, shall hold approximately 39.479% of the equity of Jonway Auto and the Company’s equity position in Jonway Auto shall be reduced from 51% to approximately 11.52%. Accordingly, the Company shall be forced to deconsolidate Jonway Auto.  Effective on April 3, 2017, the CEVC and the Board of the Company have mutually agreed to put the conversion temporarily on hold as the Board of the Company approved the initiation of due diligence with respect to the possible merger of the Company with Jonway Group’s motorcycle business with the intention of developing its “light electric vehicle” business (See Note 10).

NOTE - 2 – GOING CONCERN
 
As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by approximately $71.6 million and its equity deficiency was $46.1 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company’s sales dropped 63% and its net loss increased by 70% comparing to year ended December 31, 2015.  In addition, the Company has recurring net losses, and there is an uncertainty whether the Company will be able to continue to consolidate its Chinese subsidiary, Jonway Auto, due to the pending decision of the Note holder, CEVC, to convert the Note with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $20.7 million into shares of Jonway Auto common stock, which will reduce the Company’s equity position in Jonway Auto to approximately 12% (see Notes 1 and 10). All these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Given the Company’s expected capital expenditure for its working capital needs in the foreseeable future, as well as the payments should be made to the creditors, the Company has comprehensively considered available sources of funds as follows:  

· | Financial support and credit guarantee from related parties; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


· | Other available sources of financing from domestic banks and other financial institutions given its credit history.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



The Company does not currently have sufficient cash or commitments from financing to sustain its operations for the next twelve months. The Company plans to substantially increase cash flows from operations and revenue derived from its products. If the Company’s revenues do not reach the level anticipated in its plan then the Company may not be able to obtain the necessary additional capital on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. As a result, the Company may be unable to implement its current plans for expansion, repay its debt obligations or respond to competitive pressures, any of which would have a material adverse effect on its business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations. The accompanying consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. 
 
In assessing the Company’s liquidity, the Company monitors and analyzes its cash on-hand, liquidation value of its current assets, and its operating and capital expenditure commitments.  The Company’s principal liquidity needs are to meet its working capital requirements, operating expenses and capital expenditure obligations. 
 
Jonway Auto intends to utilize its existing credit lines (see Note 9) to expand its electric vehicle business as well as other future vehicle models. This includes on-going working capital needs, electric vehicle production equipment requirements, testing, homologation and new EV product molds. Also, the Company’s principal shareholder, Jonway Group, has agreed to provide the necessary support to meet the Company’s financial obligations through December 31, 2017 in the event that the Company requires additional liquidity.
 
The Company will require additional capital to expand its current operations.  In particular, the Company requires additional capital to continue development of its electric vehicle business, to continue strengthening its dealer network and after-sale service centers and expanding its market initiatives.  The Company also requires financing the investment for the continued roll-out of new products and to add qualified sales and professional staff to execute on its business plan and pursue its efforts in the research and development of advanced technology vehicles, such as the new ZAP Alias, the electric and other fuel efficient vehicles.
 
The Company intends to fund its short and long term liquidity needs related to operations through the incurrence of indebtedness, equity financing or a combination of both.  The Company’s ability to fund these needs will depend on its future performance, which will be subject in part to general economic, financial, regulatory and other factors beyond its control, including trends in its industry and technological developments.

NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
 
Basis of Presentation and Consolidation
 
The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of ZAP, and its subsidiaries: Jonway Automobile, Voltage Vehicles, Advanced Technology Vehicles, ZAP and ZAP Hong Kong as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 and are prepared in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).
 
Management considers subsidiaries to be companies that are over 50% controlled. Significant intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation; profits from intercompany sales, are also eliminated; non-controlling interests are included in equity.  The Company accounts for its 37.5% interest in ZAP Hangzhou and its 50% interest in Shanghai Zapple using the equity method of accounting because it has significant influence but not control.
 
ZAP’s common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board under the symbol “ZAAP.OB.”
 
Use of Estimates
 
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. The more significant estimates relate to revenue recognition, contractual allowances and uncollectible accounts, intangible assets, accrued liabilities, warranty costs, impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets, litigation and contingencies. Estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the Company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for judgments about results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results and values may differ significantly from these estimates.
Concentration of Risk

The Company’s operations are substantially carried out in the PRC. Accordingly, the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations maybe substantially influenced by the political, economic and legal environments in the PRC, and by the general state of the PRC’s economy. The Company’s operations in the PRC are subject to specific considerations and significant risks not typically associated with companies in North America and Western Europe. These include risks associated with, among others, the political, economic and legal environments and foreign currency exchange. The Company’s results may be adversely affected by changes in governmental policies with respect to laws and regulations, anti-inflationary measures, currency conversion and remittance abroad, and rates and methods of taxation, among other things. 
 
Financial instruments which subject the Company to potential credit risk consist of its cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. The Company places its cash and cash equivalents with one high credit quality financial institution. As of December 31, 2016, deposits exceeded the amount of insurance provided by $32,000; however, these deposits typically are redeemable upon demand and, therefore, the Company believes the financial risks associated with these financial instruments are minimal. The Company has not experienced any losses to date on its deposits. 
 
The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers, and generally does not require collateral on its accounts receivable. The Company estimates the need for allowances for potential credit losses based on historical collection activity and the facts and circumstances relevant to specific customers and records a provision for uncollectible accounts when collection is uncertain.
 
The Company currently relies on various outside contract manufacturers in China to supply vehicles parts and products for its customers. Although management believes that other contract manufactures could provide similar services and intends to transition its manufacturing to Jonway’s facilities in Sanmen, China, but, if these Chinese companies are unable to supply electric vehicles and the Company is unable to transition manufacturing to Jonway’s facilities or find alternative sources for these product and services, the Company might not be able to fill existing backorders and/or sell more electric vehicles. Any significant manufacturing interruption could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.

NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
Revenue Recognition

The Company records revenues for non-Jonway sales when all of the following criteria have been met: 
 

- | Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. The Company generally relies upon sales contracts or agreements, and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Sales price is fixed or determinable. The Company assesses whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. 
- | Delivery has occurred. The Company uses shipping terms and related documents, or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. The Company’s customary shipping terms are FOB shipping point. 
- | Collectability is reasonably assured. The Company assesses collectability based on creditworthiness of customers as determined by our credit checks and their payment histories. The Company records accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts and estimated customer returns. 

 
The Company records revenues for Jonway sales only upon the occurrence of all of the following conditions:
 

- | The Company has received a binding purchase order from the customer or distributor authorized by a representative empowered to commit the purchaser (evidence of a sale);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | The purchase price has been fixed, based on the terms of the purchase order; 
- | The Company has delivered the product from its factory to a common carrier acceptable to the customer; and 
- | The Company deems the collection of the amount invoiced probable. 

 
The Company provides no price protection. Sales are recognized net of sale discounts, rebates and return allowances.
 
Stock-based Compensation

The Company accounts for stock-based compensation which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values on the grant date. The Company estimates the fair value of stock-based awards on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model (the “Black-Scholes model”). The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line method. The Company estimates forfeitures at the time of grant and revise its estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates.
 
The Company accounts for stock-based compensation awards and warrants granted to non-employees by determining the fair value of the warrants or stock-based compensation awards granted as either the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. If the fair value of equity instruments issued is used, it is measured using the stock price and other measurement assumptions as of the earlier of either (1) the date at which commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instruments is reached, or (2) the date at which the counterparty’s performance is complete.
 
Revenue-based Taxes
 
The Company reports revenue net of any revenue-based taxes assessed by governmental authorities that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue-producing transactions. The primary revenue-based taxes are sales tax and value-added tax (“VAT”).

NOTE 3 - SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
 
Income Taxes

The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with ASC 740, Income Taxes, which requires the Company to use the assets and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the assets and liability method, deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carry forward. Under this accounting standard, the effect on deferred income taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion, or all of, a deferred tax asset will not be realized. 
 
ASC 740-10, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes defines uncertainty in income taxes and the evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigation based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer met.
 
Foreign Currency Translation
 
The Company and its wholly owned subsidiaries/investments, maintain their accounting records in United States Dollars (“US$”) whereas Jonway Auto maintains its accounting records in the currency of Renminbi (“RMB”), being the primary currency of the economic environment in which their operations are conducted.
 
Jonway Auto’s principal country of operations is the PRC.  The financial position and results of Jonway Auto’s operations are determined using RMB, the local currency, as the functional currency.  The results of operations and the statement of cash flows denominated in foreign currency are translated at the average rate of exchange during the reporting period.  Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the applicable rates of exchange in effect at that date.  The equity denominated in the functional currency is translated at the historical rate of exchange at the time of capital contribution.  Due to the fact that cash flows are translated based on the average translation rate, amounts related to assets and liabilities reported on the statement of cash flows will not necessarily agree with changes in the corresponding balances on the balance sheet.  Translation adjustments arising from the use of different exchange rates from period to period are included as a component of stockholders’ deficiency as “Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.”
 
The value of RMB against US$ and other currencies may fluctuate and is affected by, among other things, changes in China’s political and economic conditions, any significant revaluation of RMB may materially affect the Company’s financial condition in terms of US$ reporting.  The following table outlines the currency exchange rates that were used in creating the consolidated financial statements in this report: 


 | December 31, 2016 | December 31, 2015

Loss per Share
 
Basic and diluted net loss per share is computed by dividing consolidated net loss by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The Company’s potentially dilutive shares, which include outstanding common stock options, convertible debt and warrants, have not been included in the computation of diluted net loss per share for all periods presented as the result would be anti-dilutive. Such potentially dilutive shares are excluded when the effect would be to reduce a net loss per share. 
Cash and Cash Equivalents

The Company invests its excess cash in short-term investments with various banks and financial institutions. Short-term investments are cash equivalents, as they are part of the cash management activities of the Company and are comprised of investments having maturities of three months or less when purchased.  The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. 
Restricted Cash

The Company’s subsidiary Jonway Auto has cash restricted in connection with the issuance of bank acceptance notes to various suppliers of spare parts which were issued through Jonway Auto’s banks.  To issue these bank acceptance notes to Jonway Auto’s suppliers, the banks require a deposit of 50% or 100% of the full amount of such notes which are payable within 6 months from issuance.  Upon the maturity date, restricted funds will be used to settle the bank acceptance notes.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 820, “Fair Value Measurements” and ASC 825, Financial Instruments, requires an entity to use observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. It establishes a fair value hierarchy based on the level of independent, objective evidence surrounding the inputs used fair value. A financial instrument’s categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. It prioritizes the inputs into three levels that may be used to measure fair value:

Level 1: | Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
---------+-----------------------------------------------------------


Level 2: | Inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, and inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Level 3: | Unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists, therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions and methodologies that result in management’s best estimate of fair value.
---------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



 The carrying value of financial instruments included in current assets and liabilities approximate their fair values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. The carrying value of the senior convertible debt (see Note 8), which approximates fair value, is influenced by interest rates and the Company’s stock price, and is determined by prices for the convertible debts observed in market trading, which are Level 2 inputs. The Company’s Trade name was measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis, as further discussed below under “Intangible Assets”.
 
 Accounts Receivable
 
Accounts and note receivable consist mainly of receivables from our established dealer network.  A credit review is performed by the Company before the dealer is approved to purchase vehicles from the Company. The Company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its dealers, and generally does not require collateral on its accounts receivable. The Company estimates the need for allowances for potential credit losses based on historical collection activity and the facts and circumstances relevant to specific customers and records a provision for uncollectible accounts when collection is uncertain. Any uncollectible receivables will be written off against the allowance. The allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $1.4 million and $1.5 million on December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Inventories

ZAP Inventories consist primarily of vehicles, both gas and electric, parts and supplies, and finished goods and are carried at the lesser of lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis for ZAP and moving average basis for Jonway) or market (net realizable value or replacement cost). The Company maintains reserves for estimated excess, obsolete and damaged inventory based on projected future shipments using historical selling rates, and taking into account market conditions, inventory on-hand, purchase commitments, product development plans and life expectancy, and competitive factors. If markets for the Company’s products and corresponding demand were to decline, then additional reserves may be deemed necessary. Any changes to the Company's estimates of its reserves are reflected in cost of goods sold within the statement of operations during the period in which such changes are determined by management.
 
As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has reserved approximately $1.2 million and $1.3 million of its inventory for obsolescence, respectively.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment consists of land, building and improvements, machinery and equipment, office furniture and equipment, computer equipment and software, vehicles, and leasehold improvements. Property and equipment is stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization, and is depreciated or amortized using straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life. Costs of maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred; significant renewals and betterments are capitalized. Estimated useful lives are as follows:  

Machinery and equipment | 5-10 years 
--------------------------------+---------------------------
Computer equipment and software | 3-5 years 
Office furniture and equipment | 5 years 
Vehicles | 5 years 
Leasehold improvements | 10 years or life of lease,
 | whichever is shorter 
Building and improvements | 20-30 years 

Land Use Rights
 
Under PRC law, all land in the PRC is permanently owned by the government and cannot be sold to an individual or company but companies can purchase the land use rights for the specified period of time, as in the Company’s industry the industrial purpose has a useful life of 50 years.  The government grants individuals and companies the right to use parcels of land for specified periods of time.  These land use rights are sometimes referred to informally as “ownership”.  Land use rights are stated at cost less accumulated amortization.  Amortization is provided over the respective useful lives, using the straight-line method.  Estimated useful life is 50 years, and is determined in the connection with the term of the land use right.

Long-lived Assets

Long-lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Events that trigger a test for recoverability include material adverse changes in projected revenues and expenses, significant negative industry or economic trends, and a significant adverse change in the manner in which an asset group is used. An estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the asset, or by the appropriate grouping of assets, is compared to the carrying value to determine whether impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the impairment charge is measured and recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds it estimated fair value, which is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets, if available. If quoted market prices are not available, the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques, including a discounted value of estimated future cash flow and fundamental analysis. When an impairment loss is recognized for assets to be held and used, the adjusted carrying amount of those assets is depreciated over their remaining useful life. 

For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $12.5 million to against all the carrying value of the related production facilities in Jonway Auto (see Note 6).
 
Intangible Assets
 
Intangible assets consist of patents, trademarks, government approvals and customer relationships (including client contracts). For financial statement purposes, identifiable intangible assets with a finite life are being amortized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of seven years for the EPA license and 8.5 years for the customer relationships. Costs incurred by the Company in connection with patent, trademark applications and approvals from governmental agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency, including legal fees, patent and trademark fees and specific testing costs, are expensed as incurred. Purchased intangible costs are amortized over an estimated economic life of the asset, generally seven years, commencing on the acquisition date. Costs subsequent to the acquisition date are expensed as incurred. In Process Technology and trade name are determined to have an indefinite useful life and not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $2.1 million and $0.1 million for the trade name, respectively. The impairment charge was recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of intangible assets exceed its estimated fair value, which was estimated based on discounted cash flows (level 3 inputs).
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $2.4 million for the intangibles and goodwill (see Note 7), and an impairment loss of approximately $5.5 million for the distribution agreements (see Note 8).
 
Goodwill
 
 Goodwill is determined to have an indefinite useful life and not amortized, but instead is tested for impairment at least annually.   The Company assesses annually whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired during the year.  The Company performs its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year.   Calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and assumptions by management.  To the extent the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, there is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired and a second step of the impairment test is performed to determine the amount of the impairment to be recognized, if any. The Company recognized an impairment loss on goodwill of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 as the Company concluded that the carrying amount of the goodwill has exceeded its fair value based on appraisals.

Product Warranty Costs
 
Jonway provides a 3-year or 60,000 kilometer warranty for its SUV and minivan products. Jonway records the estimated cost of the product warranties at the time of sale using the estimated cost of product warranties based on historical results. The estimated cost of warranties has not been significant to date. Should actual failure rates and material usage differ from our estimates, revisions to the warranty obligation may be required.

Comprehensive Loss
 
Comprehensive loss represents the net loss for the period plus the results of certain changes to shareholders’ equity (deficiency) that are not reflected in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company’s comprehensive loss consists of net losses, foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net losses on investments.  
Shipping and Handling Costs
 
 The Company includes shipping and handling costs relating to the delivery of products in sales and marketing expense. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, shipping and handling costs were $54,000 and $442,000, respectively.
Reclassification
 
Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reported results of operations.
 
Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)” (“ASU 2014-09”). ASU 2014-09 requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. ASU 2014-09 will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles when it becomes effective and permits the use of either the retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. The guidance also requires additional disclosure about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from customer contracts. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, “Deferral of the Effective Date” (“ASU 2015-14”), which defers the effective date for ASU 2014-09 by one year. For public entities, the guidance in ASU 2014-09 will be effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017 (including interim reporting periods within those periods), which means it will be effective for the Company’s fiscal year beginning October 1, 2018. In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, “Principal versus Agent Considerations (Reporting Revenue versus Net)” (“ASU 2016-08”), which clarifies the implementation guidance on principal versus agent considerations in the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-10, “Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing” (“ASU 2016-10”), which reduces the complexity when applying the guidance for identifying performance obligations and improves the operability and understandability of the license implementation guidance. In May 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-12 “Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients” (“ASU 2016-12”), which amends the guidance on transition, collectability, noncash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. In December 2016, the FASB further issued ASU 2016-20, “Technical Corrections and Improvements to Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASU 2016-20”), which makes minor corrections or minor improvements to the Codification that are not expected to have a significant effect on current accounting practice or create a significant administrative cost to most entities. The amendments are intended to address implementation and provide additional practical expedients to reduce the cost and complexity of applying the new revenue standard. These amendments have the same effective date as the new revenue standard. The Company is planning to adopt Topic 606 in the first quarter of our fiscal 2019 using the retrospective transition method, and is continuing to evaluate the impact of its pending adoption of Topic 606 will have on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.  The Company’s current revenue recognition policies are generally consistent with the new revenue recognition standards set forth in ASU 2014-09.  Potential adjustments to input measures are not expected to be pervasive to the majority of the Company’s contracts.  While no significant impact is expected upon adoption of the new guidance, the Company will not be able to make that determination until the time of adoption based upon outstanding contracts at that time.

In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-01, “Financial Instruments – Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities”. The new guidance is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments. The new guidance makes targeted improvements to existing U.S. GAAP by: (1) requiring equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, or those that result in consolidation of the investee) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. Requiring public business entities to use the exit price notion when measuring the fair value of financial instruments for disclosure purposes; (2) Requiring separate presentation of financial assets and financial liabilities by measurement category and form of financial asset (i.e., securities or loans and receivables) on the balance sheet or the accompanying notes to the financial statements; (3) Eliminating the requirement for public business entities to disclose the method(s) and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value that is required to be disclosed for financial instruments measured at amortized cost on the balance sheet; and. (4) Requiring a reporting organization to present separately in other comprehensive income the portion of the total change in the fair value of a liability resulting from a change in the instrument-specific credit risk (also referred to as “own credit”) when the organization has elected to measure the liability at fair value in accordance with the fair value option for financial instruments. The new guidance is effective for public companies for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect this update will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)”, to increase the transparency and comparability about leases among entities. The new guidance requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a corresponding lease asset for virtually all lease contracts. It also requires additional disclosures about leasing arrangements. For public business entities, ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, and requires a modified retrospective approach to adoption. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
 
In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments, to address diversity in how certain cash receipts and cash payments are presented and classified in the statement of cash flows”. The amendments provide guidance on the following eight specific cash flow issues: (1) Debt Prepayment or Debt Extinguishment Costs; (2) Settlement of Zero-Coupon Debt Instruments or Other Debt Instruments with Coupon Interest Rates That Are Insignificant in Relation to the Effective Interest Rate of the Borrowing; (3) Contingent Consideration Payments Made after a Business Combination; (4)Proceeds from the Settlement of Insurance Claims; (5) Proceeds from the Settlement of Corporate-Owned Life Insurance Policies, including Bank-Owned; (6) Life Insurance Policies; (7) Distributions Received from Equity Method Investees; (8) Beneficial Interests in Securitization Transactions; and Separately Identifiable Cash Flows and Application of the Predominance Principle. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. If it is impracticable to apply the amendments retrospectively for some of the issues, the amendments for those issues would be applied prospectively as of the earliest date practicable. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption on the consolidated financial statements and related disclosure. 
 
In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-17, “Consolidation (Topic 810): Interests Held through Related Parties That Are under Common Control”. The amendments affect reporting entities that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate a variable interest entity in certain situations involving entities under common control. Specifically, the amendments change the evaluation of whether a reporting entity is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity by changing how a reporting entity that is a single decision maker of a variable interest entity treats indirect interests in the entity held through related parties that are under common control with the reporting entity. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
 
In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18,  "Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash", which requires that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of- period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in this ASU apply to all entities that have restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents and are required to present a statement of cash flows under Topic 230. The amendments are effective for public business entities for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The amendments should be applied using a retrospective transition method to each period presented. The adoption of this guidance will increase cash and cash equivalents by the amount of restricted cash on the Company's consolidated statement of cash flows.
 
In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, "Business Combinations (Topic 805): Clarifying the Definition of a Business". The amendments in this ASU clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. Basically these amendments provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business. If the screen is not met, the amendments in this ASU first, require that to be considered a business, a set must include, at a minimum, an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and second, remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements. These amendments take effect for public businesses for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2017 and interim periods within those periods. The Company does not expect that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 6 - PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, NET, AND LAND USE RIGHTS (continued)
 
 Due to the increased competition in the auto manufacturing industry and the high cost of lithium battery, the net sales of Jonway Auto decreased significantly during the year ended December 31, 2016. The Company’s current sales volume and gross margin for the electronic vehicles could not justify the carrying value of the related long-lived asset or asset group, therefore, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $12,480,000 against the carrying value of all the related production facilities in Jonway Auto for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Both market approach and cost approach were used to determine the fair value of the land and building using Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy because there is an established secondary market. Cost approach was used to determine the fair value of equipment using Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy due to quoted price is available for similar assets.

Four pieces of land were acquired from the acquisition of Jonway auto in 2011. All land in the People’s Republic of China is government owned and cannot be sold to any individual or company. However, the government grants the user a “land use right” (the Right) to use the land. The Company has the right to use the land for 50 years and amortized the Right on a straight-line basis over the period of 50 years. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, land use rights consist of the following:
 

 | December 31, 2016 | | | December 31, 2015 |

As of December 31, 2015, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $0.08 million for the trade name. The impairment loss was based on the fair value, which was based on the estimation of discounted cash flow.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company experienced significant decrease of sales and enlarged operating loss due to multiple unexpected factors.  In 2016, the government reevaluated the policies on new energy vehicle subsidies and an “anti-subsidy” campaign was continuously practiced in 2016 and the payments of subsidies were reduced and delayed. The delay in subsidy payments by the central government for EV lithium batteries has created uncertainty the Company’s EV sales.  Without the fast turnaround on the subsidies for lithium batteries to support the working capital, the sales of Jonway Auto dropped substantially during fiscal 2016. In addition, all EV are now required to be re-evaluated for inclusion in a qualified catalog of models eligible for subsidies. But the updated catalog, which previously covered 2,193 models from 235 manufacturers, has yet to be published. In addition, the Company’s EV sales are largely dependent on the government’s subsidy and incentive. The temporary suspension and reexamination of the government subsidy program on EVs resulted in a significant drop in the Company sales in fiscal 2016. For the purpose of the impairment test, the Company applied fair-value-based impairment test on the intangibles and goodwill, similar to the review for impairment of other long-lived assets, and the resulting fair value determination is significantly impacted by estimates of future margins, capital needs, economic trends and other factors. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized to the extent the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. As a result, the Company recognized an impairment loss of approximately $2.4 million for the intangibles and goodwill as of December 31, 2016. Income approach was used to value the fair value of these intangible assets.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $5.5 million and $1.0 million for the distribution right, respectively. Due to the deterioration of the sales and enlarged loss from operations in fiscal 2016, which resulted into great uncertainty of future distribution of Jonway products, the Company recognized an impairment loss of $5.5 million for the distribution rights for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the net carrying value of distribution rights with Jonway Auto was nil.
 
Distribution Agreement with Better World, Ltd
 
On January 15, 2010, ZAP entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement with a related party, Better World, Ltd., a British Virgin Islands company, whereby the Company issued 6 million shares of its common stock valued at $2.16 million in exchange for an agreement on terms relating to rights to the distribution of Better World products, such as charging stations for electric vehicles both in the U.S. and internationally. Priscilla Lu, Chairman of the Board of Directors of ZAP, is also a director of Better World, Ltd.
Distribution Agreement with Goldenstone Worldwide Limited for Jonway Products
 
On October 10, 2010, ZAP entered into an International Distribution with Goldenstone Worldwide Limited as the distributor of Jonway products such as gasoline SUV’s and gasoline and electric motor scooters, both in the U. S. and internationally. In connection with the distribution agreement the Company also issued 30 million shares of ZAP common stock valued at $14.4 million. The Jonway Group had previously granted exclusive worldwide distribution of Jonway products to Goldenstone Worldwide Limited. ZAP acquired a 51% equity interest in Jonway Auto but this equity interest did not include the worldwide distribution rights for Jonway Products. Therefore it was necessary for ZAP to acquire distribution rights for Jonway Products.

Jonway Group supplies some of plastics spare parts to Jonway Auto and gave guarantees on Jonway short term bank facilities from China-based banks. Jonway made such purchase from Jonway Group for a total of $294,000 and $5.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.  In addition, Jonway sold Jonway Group in the amount of $Nil and $5,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
