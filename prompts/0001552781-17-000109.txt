ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General
 ACRE Realty Investors Inc. is a commercial real estate investment and operating company focused on commercial real estate investments.
 On January 30, 2015, our company and A-III Investment Partners LLC (“A-III”), a joint venture between affiliates of Avenue Capital Group and C-III Capital Partners LLC, which is controlled by Island Capital Group LLC, closed a series of transactions that recapitalized our company and resulted in a change in control of our company. At the closing, A-III purchased 8,450,704 shares of our company’s common stock at a purchase price of $1.42 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $12 million, and our company issued to A-III warrants to purchase up to an additional 26,760,563 shares of our company’s common stock at an exercise price of $1.42 per share ($38 million in the aggregate). The purchase price per share and the exercise price of the warrants are subject to a potential post-closing adjustment upon completion of the sale of our company’s four legacy land parcels held on January 30, 2015, which could result in the issuance of additional shares of common stock to A-III and an increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants. We used a portion of the proceeds of A-III’s investment to pay off certain of our outstanding indebtedness as discussed further below.
 Immediately after the closing, our company’s name was changed to ACRE Realty Investors Inc., and the name of our operating partnership was changed to ACRE Realty LP. On February 2, 2015, our common stock began trading under the new ticker symbol “AIII” (NYSE MKT: AIII). Our principal office was moved to 399 Park Avenue, 6th Floor, New York, New York 10022.
 As a result of the transaction, A-III is the largest shareholder of our company, owning as of December 31, 2016 approximately 41.24% of our outstanding shares of common stock, or approximately 39.75% on a diluted basis assuming conversion of the outstanding units of limited partnership interest in our operating partnership into our company’s common stock and assuming no exercise of the warrants we granted to A-III.
 Effective as of the closing of the A-III transaction, our management was changed and our company became externally managed by A-III Manager LLC (our “Manager”), which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of A-III, pursuant to a management agreement between our company and the Manager that was executed at the closing of the A-III transaction on January 30, 2015. Immediately after the closing, the Manager designated, and the Board of Directors (the “Board”) appointed, the following persons as executive officers of the company: Edward Gellert is Chief Executive Officer and President; Robert Gellert is Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer and Treasurer; Gregory Simon is Executive Vice President, General Counsel and Secretary; and Mark E. Chertok is Chief Financial Officer. Charles S. Roberts, who previously served as the company’s Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, was appointed as an Executive Vice President after the A-III transaction and through December 31, 2016, pursuant to an Employment Agreement, which expired on December 31, 2016, at which time Mr. Roberts ceased to be an officer or employee of our company.
 We currently own one remaining legacy property, a tract of land totaling 38 acres, which is held for sale as of December 31, 2016. On October 7, 2016, the operating partnership entered into a sale contract with Roberts Capital Partners, LLC, which is an affiliate of one of our directors. The sale of the property is expected to close during the second quarter of 2017, subject to an extension option and certain closing conditions. Our current focus is on selling the remaining legacy property. We do not intend to focus on development projects as we have in the past. Going forward, we expect to pursue a flexible real estate investment strategy. We may invest in multifamily, office, mixed-use office, retail, industrial, healthcare or lodging properties, as well as preferred equity or debt instruments secured by mortgages on these types of properties, mezzanine loans secured by pledges of equity interests in entities that own these types of properties or other forms of subordinate debt in connection with these types of properties.
 The Operating Partnership
 We conduct our business through ACRE Realty LP, which owns the remaining legacy property that is held for sale and will own, either directly or indirectly through subsidiaries or joint ventures, any future properties we acquire. We refer to ACRE Realty LP as our operating partnership. The limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership provides that it is not required to be dissolved until 2093. Our company is the sole general partner of our operating partnership and, as of December 31, 2016, owned a 96.39% interest in our operating partnership. Our ownership interest in our operating partnership entitles us to share in cash distributions from, and in the profits and losses of, the operating partnership generally in proportion to our ownership percentage. In this report, we refer to units of limited partnership interest in the operating partnership as “units” and to the holders of units as “unitholders.”

Under the limited partnership agreement of our operating partnership, unitholders generally have the right to require the operating partnership to redeem their units. A unitholder who submits units for redemption will receive, at our election, either (a) 1.647 shares for each unit submitted for redemption (the “Conversion Factor”), or (b) cash for those units at their fair market value, based upon the then current trading price of the shares. Prior to December 29, 2015, we had an informal policy of issuing shares, in lieu of cash, in exchange for units. On December 28, 2015, our Board formally adopted a policy whereby we shall only issue our common shares for redemption of units, rather than paying cash for such redemption in accordance with the operating partnership agreement.
 Whenever we issue and sell shares of our common stock, we are obligated to contribute the net proceeds from that issuance and sale to the operating partnership and the operating partnership is obligated to issue units to us. The operating partnership agreement permits the operating partnership, without the consent of the unitholders, to sell additional units and add limited partners.
 Legacy Property Sales 
 On October 7, 2016, the operating partnership entered into a sale contract with Roberts Capital Partners, LLC, which is an affiliate of one of our directors, to sell Highway 20 for a purchase price of $4,725,000, including a reimbursement of $1,050,000 relating to prepaid sewer taps. This transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of 2017, subject to an extension option and certain closing conditions.
Manager
 In connection with our recapitalization transactions with A-III, on January 30, 2015, our company, our operating partnership, and the Manager entered into a management agreement, among other things, to provide for the day-to-day management of our company by the Manager, including investment activities and operations of our company and its properties. The management agreement requires the Manager to manage and administer the business activities and day-to-day operations of our company and its subsidiaries in conformity with our company’s investment guidelines and other policies that are approved and monitored by our Board. These investment guidelines and other policies may be modified and supplemented from time to time pursuant to approval by a majority of the Board (which must include a majority of the independent directors) and the Manager’s investment committee.
 The Manager maintains an administrative services agreement with A-III, pursuant to which A-III and its affiliates, including Avenue Capital Group and C-III Capital Partners, provide a management team along with appropriate support personnel for the Manager to deliver the management services to us. Under the terms of the management agreement, among other things, the Manager is required to refrain from any action that, in its reasonable judgment made in good faith, is not in compliance with our approved investment guidelines and would, when applicable, adversely affect the qualification of our company as a REIT. The management agreement has an initial five-year term and will be automatically renewed for additional one-year terms thereafter unless terminated either by us or the Manager in accordance with its terms.
 Because we are externally managed by the Manager, we currently have no employees of our own. Charles S. Roberts, one of our directors, was employed by us as our Executive Vice President after the A-III transaction and through December 31, 2016 pursuant to an Employment Agreement that expired on December 31, 2016, at which time Mr. Roberts ceased to be an officer or employee of our company. Each of our officers, other than our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Chertok, who is an employee of FTI Consulting, Inc. (“FTI”), is an employee of the Manager or another affiliate of A-III.
 Environmental and Other Regulatory Matters
 Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, the company may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of hazardous or toxic substances at its properties, including properties that have previously been sold.
 The environmental assessments we have previously obtained on our properties have not revealed any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, or results of operations, nor are we aware of any liability of that type.
