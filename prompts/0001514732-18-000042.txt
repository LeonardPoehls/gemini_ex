ITEM 1. Business.
Overview

SAExploration Holdings, Inc. and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the “Corporation”, "we", "us", or "our") is an internationally-focused oilfield services company offering a full range of vertically-integrated seismic data acquisition and logistical support services in Alaska, Canada, South America, West Africa and Southeast Asia to our customers in the oil and natural gas industry. In addition to the acquisition of 2D, 3D, time-lapse 4D and multi-component seismic data on land, in transition zones between land and water, and offshore in depths reaching 3,000 meters, we offer a full-suite of logistical support and in-field data processing services. We operate crews around the world that are supported by over 27,500 owned land and marine channels of seismic data acquisition equipment and other leased equipment as needed to complete particular projects. Seismic data is used by our customers, including major integrated oil companies, national oil companies and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies, to identify and analyze drilling prospects and maximize successful drilling. The results of the seismic surveys we conduct belong to our customers and are proprietary in nature; we do not acquire data for our own account or for future sale or maintain multi-client data libraries.
We specialize in the acquisition of seismic data in logistically complex and challenging environments and delicate ecosystems, including jungle, mountain, arctic and subaquatic terrains. We have extensive experience in deploying personnel and equipment in remote locations, while maintaining a strong quality, health, safety and environmental ("QHSE") track record and building positive community relations in the locations where we operate. We employ highly specialized crews made up of personnel with the training and skills required to prepare for and execute each project and, over time, train and employ large numbers of people from the local communities where we conduct our surveys. Our personnel are equipped with the technology necessary to meet the specific needs of the particular project and to manage the challenges presented by sensitive environments.
We were initially incorporated in Delaware on February 2, 2011, under the name Trio Merger Corp. as a blank check company in order to serve as a vehicle for the acquisition of a target business. On June 24, 2013, we completed a business combination in which the entity formerly known as SAExploration Holdings, Inc. (“Former SAE”) merged into our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”), and we operate the business of Former SAE.
Our principal headquarters are located in Houston, Texas at 1160 Dairy Ashford Rd., Suite 160, Houston, Texas, 77079, Telephone: (281) 258-4400, and our web address is www.saexploration.com. We do not intend for information contained in our website to be a part of this report.
Our operations in our various geographic locations are conducted through our subsidiary SAExploration, Inc. and its wholly-owned subsidiaries and branch offices in the United States (primarily Alaska), Canada, Peru, Colombia, Bolivia, and Malaysia. 
Recent Developments
On December 19, 2017, we entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “2017 Restructuring Support Agreement”) with holders (the “2017 Supporting Holders”) that beneficially owned in excess of 85% in principal amount of our 10.000% Senior Secured Second Lien Notes due 2019 (the “Second Lien Notes”), pursuant to which the 2017 Supporting Holders agreed to enter into and implement a deleveraging restructuring transaction (the “2017 Restructuring”), subject to the terms and conditions of the 2017 Restructuring Support Agreement with us. The closing of the 2017 Restructuring occurred on January 29, 2018 and has significantly restructured our debt and changed our capital structure. The 2017 Restructuring, as well as our 2016 Restructuring (collectively the "Restructurings") are discussed further in Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 
Seismic Data Acquisition Services

We provide a full range of seismic data acquisition services, including in-field data processing, and related logistics services. We currently provide our services on a proprietary basis to our customers and the seismic data acquired is owned by our customers once acquired.
Our seismic data acquisition and logistics services include the following:

• | Program Design


• | Planning and Permitting

3


• | Camp Services


• | Survey


• | Drilling


• | Recording


• | Reclamation; and


• | In-field Data Processing

Program Design, Planning and Permitting. A seismic survey is initiated at the time the customer requests a proposal to acquire seismic data on its behalf. We employ an experienced design team, including geophysicists with extensive experience in 2D, 3D, time-lapse 4D, and multi-component survey design, to recommend acquisition parameters and technologies to best meet the customer’s exploration objectives. Our design team analyzes the request and works with the customer to put an operational, personnel and capital resource plan in place to execute the project.
Once a seismic program is designed, we assist the customer in obtaining the necessary permits from governmental authorities and access rights of way from surface and mineral estate owners or lessees where the survey is to be conducted. It is usually our permitting crew that is first to engage with the local residents and authorities. We believe our knowledge of the local environment, cultural norms and excellent QHSE track record enable us to engender trust and goodwill with the local communities, which our customers are able to leverage over the longer exploration cycle in the area.
Camp Services. We have developed efficient processes for assembling, operating and disassembling field camps in challenging and remote project locations. We operate our camps to ensure the safety, comfort and productivity of the team working on each project and to minimize our environmental impact through the use of wastewater treatment, trash management, water purification, generators with full noise isolation and recycling areas.
In areas like South America and Southeast Asia, logistical support needs to be in place to establish supply lines for remote jungle camps. To insure the quality of services delivered to these remote camps, we own ten supply and personnel river vessels to gain access to remote jungle areas. We also have five jungle camps and a series of 40 fly camps that act as advance camps from the main project camp. Each of these jungle base camps contains a full service medical facility complete with doctors and nurses in the remote chance any potential injuries need to be stabilized for medical transport. The camps are equipped with full meal kitchens held to high standards of cleanliness, sleeping and recreational quarters, power supply, communications links, air support, water purification systems, black water purification systems, offices, repair garages, fuel storage and many more support services.
Survey and Drilling. In a typical seismic recording program, the first two stages of the program are survey and drilling. Once the permitting is completed, our survey crews enter the project areas and begin establishing the source and receiver placements in accordance with the survey design agreed to by the customer. The survey crew lays out the line locations to be recorded and, if explosives are being used, identifies the sites for shot-hole placement. The drilling crew creates the holes for the explosive charges that produce the necessary acoustical impulse.
The surveying and drilling crews are usually employed by us but may be third party contractors depending on the nature of the project and its location. Generally, the choice of whether to subcontract out services depends on the expertise available in a certain region and whether that expertise is more efficiently obtained through subcontractors or by using our own labor force. For the most part, services are subcontracted within Alaska and Canada and our personnel are used in other regions where we operate. When subcontractors are used, we manage them and require that they comply with our work policies and QHSE objectives.
In Alaska and Canada, the surveying and drilling crews are typically provided by third party contractors but are supervised by our personnel. In Alaska and Canada, our vibroseis source units consist of the latest source technology, including eight AHV IV 364 Commander Vibrators and twelve environmentally friendly IVI mini vibrators, complete with the latest Pelton DR electronics. In South America and Southeast Asia, we perform our own surveying and drilling, which is supported by up to 200 drilling units, including people-portable, low impact self-propelled walk behind, track-driven and heli-portable deployed drilling rigs. Our senior drilling staff has a combined work experience of over 50 years in some of the most challenging environments in the world. On most programs there are multiple survey and drilling crews that work at a coordinated pace to remain ahead of the data recording crews.
Recording. We use equipment capable of collecting 2D, 3D, time-lapse 4D and multi-component seismic data. We utilize vibrator energy sources or explosives depending on the nature of the program and measure the reflected signals with strategically placed 
4

sensors. Onshore, geophones are manually buried, or partially buried, to ensure good coupling with the surface and to reduce wind noise. Offshore, the reflected signals are recorded by either hydrophones towed behind a survey vessel or by geophones placed directly on the seabed. We increasingly employ ocean bottom nodes positioned by remote operated vehicles on the seafloor in our marine data acquisition operations. We have available over 27,500 owned land and marine seismic recording channels with the ability to access additional equipment, as needed, through rental or long-term leasing sources. All of our systems record equivalent seismic information but vary in the manner by which seismic data is transferred to the central recording unit, as well as their operational flexibility and channel count expandability. We utilize 11,500 channels of Sercel 428/408 equipment, 6,000 channels of Fairfield Land Nodal equipment and 10,000 channels of Geospace GSX equipment.
Historically, we have made significant capital investments to increase the recording capacity of our crews by increasing channel count and the number of energy source units we operate. This increase in channel count demand is driven by customer needs and is necessary in order to produce higher resolution images, increase crew efficiencies and undertake larger scale projects. In response to project-based channel requirements, we routinely deploy a variable number of channels with a variable number of crews in an effort to maximize asset utilization and meet customer needs. When recording equipment is at or near full utilization, we utilize rental equipment from strategic suppliers to augment our existing inventories. We believe we will realize the benefit of increased channel counts and flexibility of deployment through increased crew efficiencies, higher revenues and increased margins.
Historically, we have dedicated a significant portion of our capital investment to purchasing and leasing wireless recording systems rather than the traditional wired systems. We utilize this equipment as primarily stand-alone recording systems, but on occasion it is used in conjunction with cable-based systems. The wireless recording systems allow us to gain further efficiencies in data recording and provide greater flexibility in the complex environments in which we operate. In addition, we have realized increased crew efficiencies and lessened the environmental impact of our seismic programs due to the wireless recording systems because they require the presence of fewer personnel and less equipment in the field. We believe we will experience continued demand for wireless recording systems in the future.
We also utilize multi-component recording equipment on certain projects to further enhance the quality of data acquired and help our customers enhance their development of producing reservoirs. Multi-component recording involves the collection of different seismic waves, including shear waves, which aids in reservoir analysis such as fracture orientation and intensity in shales and allows for more descriptive rock properties. 
Reclamation. We have experienced teams responsible for reclamation of the areas where work has been performed so as to minimize the environmental footprint from the seismic program. These programs can include reforestation or other activities to restore the natural landscape at our worksites.
In-field Data Processing. Our knowledgeable and experienced team provides our customers with superior quality in-field data processing. We believe that our strict quality control processes meet or surpass industry-established standards, including identifying and analyzing ambient noise, evaluating field parameters and employing obstacle-recovery strategies. Using the latest technology, our technical and field teams electronically manage customer data from the field to the processing office, minimizing time between field production and processing. All of the steps employed in our in-field data processing sequence are tailored to the particular customer project and objectives.
Industry Overview
Seismic technology is the primary tool used to locate oil and gas reserves, and it facilitates the development of complex reservoirs. Seismic data is used to pinpoint and determine the locations of subsurface features favorable for the accumulation of hydrocarbons, as well as define the make-up of the sedimentary rock layers and their corresponding fluids. Seismic data is acquired by introducing acoustic energy into the earth and water through controlled energy sources. Seismic energy sources can consist of truck-mounted vibration equipment in accessible terrain, explosives such as dynamite in more difficult terrain, or vessel-mounted air guns in shallow water and certain marsh environments. The sound waves created by explosives or vibration equipment are reflected back to the surface and collected by seismic sensors referred to as “geophones” or “hydrophones,” which measure ground and water displacement. One or more strategically positioned seismic sensors are connected to a recording channel which transmits the data to a central recording location. A typical project involves the use of thousands, and sometimes tens of thousands, of channels recording simultaneously over the survey area. In general, the higher the number of recording channels employed in a given survey, the richer the data set that is produced.
A seismic survey is acquired with a surface geometry grid of seismic energy sources and receivers extending over very large areas. The size of this grid varies with and depends on the size, depth and geophysical characteristics of the target to be imaged. The lines must be accurately positioned, so the location of each source and receiver point is obtained using either GPS, inertial, or 
5

conventional optical survey methods depending upon the vegetation and environment in the prospect area. Seismic receivers are deployed on the surface of the area being surveyed at regular intervals and patterns to measure, digitize and transmit reflected seismic energy to a set of specialized recording instruments. The transportation of cables, geophones and field recording equipment can be by truck, vessel or helicopter depending upon the terrain and environment within the area to be imaged.
Land seismic data acquisition. For land applications, geophones are buried, or partially buried, to ensure good coupling with the surface and to reduce wind noise. Burying geophones in the ground is a manual process and may involve anywhere from a few to more than 100 people depending on the size of the seismic crew and the terrain involved. Cables that connect the geophones to cabled recording systems may also be deployed manually or, in some cases, automatically from a vehicle depending on the terrain. The acoustic source for land seismic data acquisition is typically a fleet of large hydraulic vibrator trucks, but may also be explosives detonated in holes drilled for such purposes.
On a typical land seismic survey, the seismic recording crew is supported by a permitting and surveying crew along with a vibroseis and/or drilling crew. The permitting crew secures permission from the landowner and mineral owner or lessee to gain access to the surface and subsurface rights to conduct the seismic program. The surveying crew lays out the receiver locations to be recorded and, in a survey using an explosive source, identifies the sites where the drilling crew creates the holes for the explosive charges that produce an acoustical impulse. In other surveys, a mechanical vibrating unit, such as a vibrator truck, is used as the seismic energy source. The seismic crew lays out the geophones and recording instruments, directs shooting operations and records the acoustical signal reflected from subsurface strata. The number of individuals on each crew is dependent upon the size and nature of the seismic survey.
Offshore seismic data acquisition. In marine surveys, air guns, which release high-pressure compressed air into the water column, are used as the acoustic energy source. For ocean bottom cable operations, an assembly of vertically oriented geophones and hydrophones connected by electrical wires typically is deployed on the sea floor to record and relay data to a seismic recording vessel. Increasingly, ocean bottom nodes positioned by remote operated vehicles are used in areas of obstructions (such as production platforms) or shallow water inaccessible to ships towing seismic streamers (such as submerged cables).
Transition zone seismic data acquisition. In the transition zone area where land and water come together, elements of both land data acquisition and offshore data acquisition are employed. Transition zone seismic data acquisition is similar to ocean bottom cable applications in that both hydrophones and geophones are lowered to the ocean floor. However, due to the shallow water depths, only small vessels and manual labor can be used to deploy and retrieve the cables. Additionally, the source vessels and acoustic source arrays must be configured to run in shallow water. In transition zone areas consisting of swamps and marshes, explosives must be used as an acoustic source in addition to air guns.
Two-dimensional, or 2D, seismic data is recorded using single lines of receivers crossing the earth’s surface, and, once processed, results in only a profile image of the earth, and the data is generally used only to identify gross structural features. Prior to 1980, all seismic data acquired was 2D, and 2D surveys are still widely employed in locations previously unexplored by E&P companies to provide preliminary data for broad-scale exploration evaluation. Three-dimensional, or 3D, seismic data surveys have proven more effective in providing detailed views of subsurface structures. 
The increased use of 3D seismic data by the oil and natural gas industry in the 1980s helped drive significant increases in drilling success rates as better data quality allowed operators to optimize well locations and results. Today, the vast majority of seismic data acquired in North America is 3D, of which high density 3D is a growing component.
More recently, the seismic industry has seen the development of four-dimensional, or 4D, imaging technology, also known as time-lapse seismic. 4D seismic data incorporates numerous 3D seismic surveys over the same reservoir at specified intervals of time and can help determine changes in flow, pressure and saturation. As hydrocarbons are depleted from a field, the pressure and composition of the fluids may change. By scanning a reservoir over a given period of time, the flow of the hydrocarbons within can be traced and better understood. In addition, 4D seismic data can help geologists understand how a reservoir reacts to gas injection or water flooding and can help locate untapped pockets of oil or natural gas within the reservoir.
In conventional 3D seismic surveys, only the primary wave, or P-wave, is acquired. P-wave reflection cannot always image fluid saturated zones properly. Multi-component seismic data acquisition captures the seismic wave field more completely than conventional P-wave techniques. In multi-component acquisition, multiple sets of data are received at each receiver, P-wave and two measurements (X, Y) of the shear wave, or S-wave. Information obtained from the S-wave passing through a fluid-saturated medium provides a better interpretation of the reservoir structure. Evaluating P- and S-wave data together provides additional information to reduce uncertainty in prospect evaluation.
6

Once seismic data is acquired, complex mathematical algorithms are used to transform the data into 2D profiles, 3D volumes of the earth’s subsurface or 4D time-lapse seismic data. These images are then interpreted by geophysicists and geologists for use by oil and natural gas companies in evaluating prospective areas, designing drilling programs, selecting drilling sites and managing producing reservoirs.
Markets and Trends
North America
While the last several years have seen a decline in demand, the North American market has historically been a stable and sustainable market for 3D seismic data acquisition. Use of 3D technology is the norm in the United States and Canada as international oil companies seek to maximize the efficiency of their reservoirs and reduce exploration risk.
We expanded into North America in 2011 through our acquisitions of Datum Exploration Ltd. in Canada and Northern Exploration Services in Alaska. With each of those acquisitions, we brought on board personnel with extensive operations experience in each location. Our operations in the North American market are consistent with our strategy to help increase our equipment utilization rates, while concurrently increasing margins, by balancing growth in North and South America, which have complementary operating seasons. While this model continues to be a viable operating model, the industry downturn has created significant pressure on competitive cost structures and pricing, particularly during the early 2017 winter season. However, we are beginning to see characteristics that would suggest this trend may be shifting towards an increase in overall regional activity assuming there is a longer period of consistency in the commodity price environment. 
South America
The economies in South American countries continue to expand and develop, demanding significantly more energy to fuel their growth. As the political environments stabilize, oil companies are increasing operations in the market and are seeking experienced seismic service providers with complex environment know-how, strong QHSE records and excellent relations with local communities to satisfy their exploration needs.
We have maintained operations in South America since 2006 while further growing our presence in Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, and Peru. However, the global oil and natural gas industry downturn significantly impacted exploration activity in South America particularly during 2017 and 2016. While some improvements in the level of customer interest can be seen by an increase in inquiries and subsequent tenders, no assurance can be given that this will result in increased activity or that future decreases in activity will not occur again.
Southeast Asia
Exploration activities in Southeast Asia have declined recently with lower commodity prices but there is a steady demand for energy in the region. In 2010, we entered the Southeast Asian market by commencing operations in Papua New Guinea for one of our major long-time customers. We have expanded our operations in Southeast Asia into New Zealand and deep-water marine work in Malaysia. We expect Southeast Asia to continue to be a predominantly marine-based market in the current commodity price environment. This trend is expected to continue as long as customers remain hesitant to commit capital to large onshore projects that are more exploration driven. 
West Africa
In late 2016, we entered the West Africa market to perform a deep-water ocean bottom marine project for a major customer. Historically, West Africa has presented numerous offshore marine opportunities. More recently, offshore marine seismic activity has been increasing in certain West African countries. These projects are more focused on production-enhancement initiatives than new exploration. Despite the current macro-economic instability related to the oil and natural gas industry downturn, we expect overall offshore marine seismic activity to continue to improve in the near to medium-term future. 
Strengths
Full service logistics provider. A majority of our revenues is earned through high-margin logistics-related activities performed in-house. Unlike many other seismic data acquisition companies, we focus on providing a complete service and logistical solutions package, especially in our international operations, which allows efficient movement into remote areas. This provides us with opportunities to capture a larger portion of the revenues associated with each project and gives us what we believe to be a strategic advantage over our competitors, who generally outsource logistics services to multiple third parties. Usually we are the first point of contact with the local communities, and we believe having contact with these communities from initiation of the project through the seismic phase and demonstrating our commitment to QHSE forms relationships that benefit us and our customers over the 
7

longer term. Additionally, our logistical expertise can be a value proposition in price negotiations with our customers, allowing us to maintain higher margins in certain regions of the world, particularly in the more remote areas and challenging environments.
International platform. We operate in numerous regions around the world and continue to maintain our market share in those markets. Our experience includes projects in Alaska, Canada, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, West Africa and New Zealand. We maintain a local presence in many of these areas. As the majority of our operations are focused in locations previously unexplored by E&P companies, the first projects in those areas tend to be for the acquisition of 2D data for preliminary, broad-scale exploration evaluation. That initial acquisition often leads to further work, as the 2D data is used to determine the location and design of additional 3D and 4D surveys, which are then used for more detailed analysis to maximize actual drilling potential and success. Typically, once we are hired for a project, we tend to get follow-on surveys due to our familiarity with the customer, the local communities and the project. The international platform also enables us to expand and contract in various regions around the world to match the changes in demand in certain regions as driven by commodity prices, economic factors and energy consumption in the local markets.
Extensive experience in challenging environments. We specialize in seismic data acquisition services in logistically challenging environments on land, in transition zones and in water. We believe that our extensive experience operating in such complex locations, including our expertise in logistics management and deploying personnel and equipment customized for the applicable environment, provides us with a significant competitive advantage. Many of the areas of the world where we work have limited seasons for seismic data acquisition, requiring high utilization of key personnel and redeployment of equipment from one part of the world to another. Most of our remote area camps, drills and support equipment are easily containerized for transport to locations anywhere in the world. As a result, if conditions deteriorate in a current location or demand rises in another location, we are able to quickly redeploy our crews and equipment to other parts of the world. We have a logistical support department that works with management to keep our equipment strategically located in areas of high utilization.
Strong local relationships and stringent QHSE processes. E&P companies seek experienced seismic service providers with complex environment know-how, strong QHSE records and excellent relations with local communities to satisfy their seismic needs. Our highly trained and qualified QHSE team has extensive experience working in diverse ecosystems and complex cultural environments. We believe this experience allows us to deliver high quality data and efficient operations through systems and processes designed to minimize health and safety risk and overall community and environmental impact. We believe that our strong local relationships, QHSE track record and our history of successful reclamation programs facilitate negotiating permits and other seismic data acquisition rights on behalf of our customers.
Cash flow generation supported by backlog and competitive bids. As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately $50 million of backlog under contract, in addition to approximately $478 million of bids outstanding. We believe our backlog results in comparatively better visibility to future cash flows relative to our peers. Such visibility is also evidenced by our number of bids outstanding. Our key operations outside of North America are generally in countries with strict concession leasing requirements, resulting in clients planning seismic shoots well in advance of the capital being spent. Additionally, the short duration of operating seasons, especially in Alaska, leads to more advanced planning which in turn results in a more accurate cash flow forecast. Non-North American seismic shoots are also less susceptible to cancellation due to the long-term nature of very expensive development programs compared to more volatile, commodity-price driven shorter-term projects typical of North America.
Strong relationships with blue chip customer base. Members of our management team have long-standing relationships often extending over 30 years with many of the largest oil and gas companies in the world. Our global operating footprint allows us to leverage those relationships throughout the world, and we believe our prior performance for those customers enhances our ability to obtain new business from existing and past customers.
Experienced management team with significant operational experience and ownership stake. We believe the experience, knowledge base and relationships that our management team has built over the years enhance our operating and marketing capabilities and underlie our strong reputation in the industry. In fact, we believe the operating expertise of our management team frequently leads to winning bids for new business. Virtually every member of our management team has technological and first-hand experience of the seismic data acquisition industry stemming from years of field work. 
Strategy

We believe we have a strategic advantage over a substantial number of our competitors in the areas in which we operate because of our expertise in logistics and our ability to provide a complete solution in remote and complex areas.
We plan to build upon our competitive strengths to grow our business through the following strategies:
8


• | Maintain strict focus on contract work with key clients. We intend to continue to work on a fully contracted basis with major national and international oil and gas companies and capitalize on our long-term relationships with our customers. Unlike many of our competitors, we do not acquire data for our own use or maintain multi-client data libraries, which are either unfunded or partially funded speculative libraries, and involve significantly more risk and uncertainty. We seek to add value for our customers through a material reduction of the following risks:


• | Exploration risk-we deliver consistent high-quality seismic data utilizing the most advanced technology;


• | Data acquisition risk-we fulfill our promises regarding the timing, quality and scope of our services;


• | Reputation risk-we attract and retain highly skilled and experienced professionals who embody our strong focus on customer service, safety and environmental safeguards;


• | QHSE risk-we place the highest priority on the health and safety of our workforce, the protection of our assets, the environment and the communities where we conduct our work, and we strive for continual improvement in all QHSE aspects; and


• | Financial risk-we are able to employ a higher proportion of turnkey contracts in our operations, which shift most of the business interruption risks onto us.


• | Provide full in-house logistics services. We intend to continue to focus on our logistics expertise, which, in addition to our seismic data acquisition abilities, allows us to provide a complete service package to our customers. We believe our vertical integration will continue to provide for efficient movement into remote areas as we further expand internationally, giving us a strategic advantage over our competitors. Many of the areas of the world where we work have limited seasons for seismic data acquisition, requiring high utilization of key personnel and redeployment of equipment from one part of the world to another. We believe that few of our competitors have a global reach that is similar to ours. 


• | Focus on global diversification and capitalize on market positioning in emerging basins. We seek to maintain our market share in the markets in which we currently operate and continue our positioning into other emerging markets, such as worldwide ocean bottom seismic services, which we believe hold the highest degree of potential for opportunities during this downturn in the overall market. Emerging economies will likely continue to expand and develop, demanding significantly more energy to fuel their growth. As the political environments stabilize in many of those countries, oil and natural gas companies will likely increase operations in these markets. With our geographic expansion from providing services exclusively in South America to providing services in Alaska, Canada, Southeast Asia and West Africa, we are able to achieve better utilization of our personnel and equipment through redeployment from off-season areas to in-season areas, helping to reduce some of the volatility in our financial performance. 


• | Maintain local relationships and stringent QHSE processes as the foundation of all our projects. We plan to maintain our focus on strong community relations and QHSE standards. We believe our continued success in those areas can be leveraged to help us further maintain our market share in these emerging markets.


• | Continue higher utilization of turnkey contracts to capitalize on higher operating margins. Our contracts for proprietary seismic data acquisition services reflect a high proportion of turnkey contracts, which are fixed fee, compared to term contracts, which use a variable or day-rate fee basis. This provides us with the opportunity to maximize the advantage we have from being a full-service provider and the operational efficiencies created by our vertical integration. Our customers prefer turnkey contracts because they shift much of the business interruption risk onto us. We also increasingly use hybrid contracts where we may share with our customers a certain degree of the risks for certain business interruptions, such as weather, community relations and permitting delays, that are outside of our control.

We enable these strategies by continuing to pursue excellence in the following activities:

• | Building and maintaining mutually beneficial, long-term relationships with customers;


• | Aggressively marketing our capabilities and customer-value added proposition;


• | Continually monitoring technological developments in the industry and, as needed, implementing cutting-edge technologies that can give us a competitive advantage;


• | Sharing best practices across regions to ensure the consistent delivery of high quality service; and

9


• | Continuing to seek innovative ideas to reduce the seasonal gaps in our equipment utilization rates.

Seasonal Variation in Business
Seismic data acquisition services are performed outdoors and, consequently, are subject to weather and seasonality. Particularly in Alaska and Canada, the primary season for seismic data acquisition is during the winter, from approximately December to April, since much of the terrain for seismic data acquisition cannot be accessed until the ground has frozen. The weather conditions during this time of year can affect the timing and efficiency of operations. In addition, this prime season can be shortened by warmer weather conditions.
In South America and Southeast Asia, our operations are affected by the periods of heavy rain in the areas where seismic operations are conducted. Specifically, the jungle areas of Colombia, Bolivia and Peru are affected by heavy rain during certain parts of the year so we must either avoid taking projects during these time periods or limit the weather risk in a particular customer contract. Many of the heavy rain periods in South America, though, are during the high season for Alaska and Canada, and there are opportunities to maximize the utilization of equipment and personnel by moving them between these regions to take advantage of the different high seasons.
In all areas of operation, the weather is an uncontrollable factor that affects our operations at various times of the year. We try to minimize these risks during the bidding process by utilizing the expertise of our personnel as to the weather in a particular area and through the negotiation of downtime clauses in our contracts with our customers. Due to the unpredictability of weather conditions, there may be times when adverse conditions substantially affect our operations and the financial results of a particular project may be impacted.
Marketing

Our services are marketed from our various offices around the world. We have a corporate business development and marketing staff and also have local managers who interact with customers in each country of operations. Through these customer interactions, we are able to remain updated on a customer’s upcoming projects in the area and to work with the customer on projects in other countries.
Contracts are obtained either by direct negotiation with a prospective customer or through competitive bidding in response to invitations to bid. Most of our revenue historically has been generated through repeat customer sales and new sales to customers referred by existing and past customers. In addition, a significant portion of our engagements results from competitive bidding. Contracts are awarded primarily on the basis of price, experience, availability, technological expertise and reputation for dependability and safety. With the involvement and review of senior management, bids are prepared by knowledgeable regional operations managers who understand their respective markets, customers and operating conditions and who communicate directly with existing and target customers during the bid preparation process.
We also work closely with customers on a direct award basis to plan particular seismic data acquisition projects. Due to the complexity of the areas where we do business, these projects can take a number of months in planning and consulting with the customer on exploration goals and parameters of the projects to fit within a particular budget. By working closely with the customer, we are able to acquire seismic data for a project efficiently and within the customer’s required timeframe.
Contracts and Backlog
We conduct data acquisition services under master service agreements with our customers that set forth certain obligations of our customers and us. A supplemental agreement setting forth the terms of a specific project, which may be canceled by either party on short notice, is entered into for every data acquisition project. The supplemental agreements are either “turnkey” agreements that provide for a fixed fee to be paid to us for each unit of data acquired, or “term” agreements that provide for a fixed hourly, daily or monthly fee during the term of the project. Turnkey agreements generally mean more profit potential, but involve more risks due to potential crew downtimes or operational delays. Under term agreements, we are ensured a more consistent revenue stream with improved protection from crew downtime or operational delays, but with a decreased profit potential.
Our contracts for proprietary seismic data acquisition services reflect a high proportion of turnkey contracts, which is preferred by our customers because it shifts much of the business interruption risk onto us; however, it provides us with the greatest opportunity to maximize the advantage we have from being a full-service provider and the operational efficiencies created by our vertical 
10

integration. We attempt to negotiate on a project-by-project basis some level of weather downtime protection within the turnkey agreements and increasingly use hybrid contracts where we may share with our customers a certain degree of the risks for certain business interruptions, such as weather, community relations and permitting delays, that are outside of our control.
Our backlog estimates represent those projects for which a customer has executed a contract or signed a binding letter of award. Our backlog can vary significantly from time to time, particularly if the backlog is made up of multi-year contracts with some of our more significant customers. Backlog estimates are based on a number of assumptions and estimates including assumptions related to foreign exchange rates and proportionate performance of contracts. The realization of our backlog estimates is further affected by our performance under term rate contracts, as the early or late completion of a project under term rate contracts will generally result in decreased or increased, as the case may be, revenues derived from those projects. Contracts for services are also occasionally modified by mutual consent and often can be terminated for convenience by the customer. Because of potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers’ projects, and the possibility of early termination of customer contracts, we cannot predict with certainty when or if our backlog will be realized. Material delays, payment defaults or cancellations on the underlying contracts could reduce the amount of backlog currently reported and, consequently, could inhibit the conversion of that backlog into revenues. In addition, worsening overall market conditions are likely to result in further reductions of backlog, which will impact our financial performance.
Customers

Our customers include national and international oil companies and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies. Our revenues are derived from a concentrated customer base; however, we are not substantially dependent on any one customer. Based on the nature of our contracts and customer projects, our significant customers can and typically do change from year to year and the largest customers in any one year may not be indicative of the largest customers in the future. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we had three customers, Conoco Phillips Alaska, Inc., Chevron and Hocol Petroleum Limited, that individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue and represented 75% of consolidated revenue for the year. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we had three customers, Alaskan Seismic Ventures, BG Bolivia Corporation and Hocol Petroleum Limited, that individually exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue and represented 74% of our consolidated revenue for the year. 
Competition

The acquisition of seismic data for the oil and gas industry is a highly competitive business. Factors such as price, experience, asset availability and capacity, technological expertise and reputation for dependability and safety of a crew significantly affect a potential customer’s decision to award a contract to us or one of our competitors. In addition, the recent excess supply and downturn in commodity prices has decreased demand for seismic services, further intensifying the competitive landscape and causing further pressure on pricing and margins.
Our competitors include much larger companies with greater financial resources, more available equipment and more crews, as well as companies of comparable and smaller sizes. Our primary competitors are Compagnie Générale de Géophysique (CGG), Geokinetics, Inc., Global Geophysical Services, Inc., BGP, Inc. and Dawson Geophysical Company. In addition to those companies, we also compete for projects from time to time with smaller seismic companies that operate in local markets.
Intellectual Property

We rely on certain proprietary information, proprietary software, trade secrets and confidentiality and licensing agreements to conduct our operations. We continually strive to improve our operating techniques and technologies, through internal development activities and working with vendors to develop new processes and technologies to maintain pace with industry innovation. Through this process, we have developed certain proprietary processes and methods of doing business, particularly with respect to logistics. Although those processes and methods may not be patentable, we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with our key managers and customers.
Equipment Purchases and Capital Expenditures

During 2017, we made minimal capital expenditures of approximately $2.7 million, primarily related to the purchase of a set of vibrators and additional camp equipment. During 2016, we made capital expenditures of approximately $3.4 million for the purchase of vibrators for our North American operations. Under our current business model, capital expenditures will be kept at minimum levels, other than very low maintenance expenditures, until we see improvement in the overall oil and natural gas market.

Historically, in line with our focus on wireless land data acquisition, we purchased a cable-less seismic data acquisition system which allows up to three crews to operate under the system at the same time. Following customer needs for higher density land programs using a single point receiver application and to answer the demand for conventional and unconventional oil and gas exploration, we purchased high sensitivity geophones and two types of vibrators, further strengthening our position as a full solution provider for land data acquisition methods and technologies. Additional equipment investments were made for ongoing operations in Alaska in order to increase efficiency. We also invested in cable equipment in order to provide customers in Latin America with cable systems as wireless technology is slower to take hold in that market.
We will continue to employ and expand as needed our wireless equipment on a worldwide basis while maintaining the ability to provide services to the still existing cable markets. Our capital purchases have and will allow us to take advantage of all aspects of the geophysical exploration services market, ranging from land, marine and transition zone data acquisition; 2D, 3D, 4D and multi-component data acquisition; use of different methods to acquire data such as using vibroseis (vibrating) and impulsive sources; as well as vertical seismic profiling and reservoir monitoring. Investments in expanding further into our South America and Southeast Asia markets will also focus upon surveying, drilling and base camp operations. 
Government and Environmental Regulations

Our operations are subject to various international, federal, provincial, state and local laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations govern various aspects of operations, including the discharge of explosive materials into the environment, requiring the removal and clean-up of materials that may harm the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and access to private and governmental land to conduct seismic surveys. We believe we have conducted our operations in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing our activities.
The costs of acquiring permits and remaining in compliance with environmental laws and regulations, title research, environmental studies and surveys are generally borne by our customers. Although our direct costs of complying with applicable laws and regulations have historically not been material, the changing nature of such laws and regulations makes it impossible to predict the cost or impact of such laws and regulations on future operations. Additional United States or foreign government laws or regulations would likely increase the compliance and insurance costs associated with our customers’ operations. Significant increases in compliance expenses for customers could have a material adverse effect on customers’ operating results and cash flows, which could also negatively impact the demand for our services.
Employees and Subcontractors

As of February 28, 2018, we had 1,237 employees, 88 of whom were located in the United States. From time to time and on an as-needed basis, we supplement our regular workforce with individuals that we hire temporarily or as independent contractors in order to meet certain business needs. Our U.S. employees are not represented by any collective bargaining agreement, and we believe that our employee relations are good.
Generally, the choice of whether to subcontract out services depends on the expertise available in a certain region and whether that expertise is more efficiently hired through subcontractors or by using our own labor force. For the most part, services are subcontracted within North America and our personnel are used in other regions where we operate. When subcontractors are used, we manage them and require that they comply with our work policies and QHSE systems.
