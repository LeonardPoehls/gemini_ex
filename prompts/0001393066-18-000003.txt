Our Products
We manage our business based on the products we manufacture. Our reportable segments correspond to our principal product lines: market pulp, tissue, wood products, newsprint and specialty papers. Certain segment and geographical financial information, including sales by segment and by geographic area, operating income (loss) by segment and long-lived assets by

geographic area, can be found in Note 20, “Segment Information” to our consolidated financial statements and related notes (“Consolidated Financial Statements”) appearing in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” of this Form 10-K.
Market pulp
We produce market pulp at seven facilities in North America, with total capacity of approximately 1.7 million metric tons, or approximately 10% of total North American capacity, making us the third largest pulp producer in North America. Approximately 75% of our virgin pulp capacity is softwood-based: northern bleached softwood kraft (“NBSK”) pulp, southern bleached softwood kraft (“SBSK”) pulp and fluff pulp. We are also the world’s largest producer of recycled bleached kraft (“RBK”) pulp and a competitive producer of northern bleached hardwood kraft (“NBHK”) pulp and southern bleached hardwood kraft (“SBHK”) pulp. Wood pulp is the most commonly used material to make paper and tissue. Pulp not converted into paper or tissue is sold as market pulp, which is used to make a range of consumer products including tissue, packaging, specialty paper products, diapers and other absorbent products. Approximately 28% of our 2017 market pulp shipments were exported outside of North America, including significant exports to Europe, Asia and Latin America.
Tissue
We produce tissue products at three facilities in North America, located in Florida and Tennessee. With total capacity of 128,000 short tons (116,000 metric tons), which includes our new tissue machine at our facility in Calhoun, we are a fully integrated manufacturer operating four tissue machines and 14 converting lines. We manufacture a range of tissue products for the away-from-home and at-home markets, including recycled and virgin paper products, covering premium, value and economy grades. We also sell parent rolls not converted into tissue products.
Wood products
We operate 14 sawmills in Canada that produce construction-grade lumber sold in North America. Our sawmills produce dimension spruce-pine-fir lumber and provide wood chips to our pulp and paper mills in Canada. Our sawmills also supply wood residue to our other segments, to be used as fuel to produce electricity and steam based on renewable sources. In 2017, we shipped 1.9 billion board feet of construction-grade lumber. We also operate two remanufactured wood products facilities that manufacture bed frame components, finger joints and furring strips, two engineered wood products facilities that manufacture I-joists for the construction industry, and one wood pellet facility, all of which are located in Quebec and Ontario.
Newsprint
We produce newsprint at eight facilities in North America. With total capacity of approximately 1.8 million metric tons, which represents approximately 8% of total worldwide capacity and approximately 43% of total North American capacity, we are the largest producer of newsprint in the world. We sell newsprint to newspaper publishers worldwide and also to commercial printers in North America for uses such as inserts and flyers. In 2017, North American deliveries represented 62% of our total newsprint shipments.
Specialty papers
We produce specialty papers at six facilities in North America. With total capacity of approximately 1.2 million short tons (1.1 million metric tons), our specialty papers segment is composed of uncoated mechanical papers, including supercalendered (“SC”) paper and white paper, as well as coated mechanical papers and uncoated freesheet papers. With 724,000 short tons (657,000 metric tons) of capacity, or approximately 22% of total North American capacity, we are the largest producer of uncoated mechanical papers in North America, and the fourth largest in the world. Also, with 345,000 short tons (313,000 metric tons) of capacity, or approximately 14% of total North American capacity, we are North America’s third largest producer of coated mechanical papers. Our specialty papers are used in books, retail inserts, direct mail, coupons, magazines, catalogs, bags, and other commercial printing applications. We sell specialty papers to major commercial printers, direct mailers, publishers, catalogers and retailers, mostly in North America.

Other products
We also sell green power produced from renewable sources, wood chips and other wood related products to customers located in Canada and the United States. Sales of these other products are considered a recovery of the cost of manufacturing our primary products.

Raw Materials
In the manufacture of our paper, tissue, pulp and wood products, our operations consume substantial amounts of raw materials such as wood, chemicals, and recovered paper (primarily sorted office paper), as well as energy. We purchase raw materials and energy sources (to complement internal generation) primarily on the open market. These raw materials are market-priced commodities and as such, are subject to fluctuations in market prices. For additional information about commodity price risk, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Commodity Price Risk” of this Form 10‑K.
Wood
Our sources of wood include purchases from local producers, including sawmills that supply residual wood chips, wood harvested from government-owned land on which we hold timber supply guarantees or harvesting rights, and property we own or lease. In Quebec, under the Sustainable Forest Development Act, volumes are allocated through timber supply guarantees, which are five years in length and renewable, subject to certain conditions. As of December 31, 2017, we were allocated 4.3 million cubic meters of supply through the timber supply guarantees. In Ontario, we had long-term harvesting rights for approximately 11.5 million acres of government-owned land, as of December 31, 2017. The harvesting rights licenses in Ontario are 20 years in length and automatically renew every five years, contingent upon our continual compliance with environmental performance and reforestation requirements.
We depend heavily on harvesting rights and timber supply guarantees over government-owned land in Ontario and Quebec, respectively. The volume of harvest permitted under these licenses is subject to limits, which are generally referred to as the annual allowable cut (“AAC”). The AAC is reviewed regularly, typically every five years in Quebec and every 10 years in Ontario. The chief forester of the province of Quebec ordered significant reductions to the allowable harvest between 2006 and 2018, and announced a preliminary increase of 5.9% to the AAC for the spruce, pine, fir, and larch species that we require, for the period of 2018 to 2023. Also, about 25% of the total allowable harvest in Quebec is allocated through an open auction system.
In addition to the forest management regulations that we must abide with, we have sought out independent certification for 100% of the forests that we manage or on which we hold significant harvesting rights in order to demonstrate our strong belief that it is possible to carefully harvest trees while maintaining biodiversity and protecting the forest; values important to a range of stakeholders. The woodlands that we manage are all independently certified to at least one of two internationally recognized forest management standards: Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (“SFI®”) and Forest Stewardship Council® (“FSC®”). In 2017, we successfully maintained SFI forest management certification for all of our managed woodlands in Quebec and Ontario. One FSC forest management certificate in the Abitibi region of Quebec was not renewed at the end of its five-year term and expired on January 2, 2018. We continue to maintain the other FSC forest management certificates that we held in Quebec and Ontario. In addition, we continue to be one of the largest holders of SFI and FSC forest management certificates in North America.
We have also instituted fiber-tracking systems at all of our North American facilities to ensure that our wood fiber supply comes from acceptable sources such as certified forests and legal harvesting operations, with the exception of our Hialeah tissue mill. These systems are third-party certified according to one or more of three internationally recognized chain of custody standards, namely SFI, FSC and Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (“PEFC”). 100% of our wood and fiber sources is procured through the FSC Controlled Wood standard, the FSC chain of custody certification, the PEFC due diligence requirements or the SFI fiber sourcing requirements, and in some cases a combination of these standards, with the exception of our Hialeah tissue mill, which sources 100% of its recycled fiber supply from our U.S. pulp network.
We strive to improve our forest management and wood fiber procurement practices and we encourage our wood and fiber suppliers to demonstrate continual improvement in forest resource management, wood and fiber procurement and third-party certification.
Chemicals
We use various chemicals in our pulp and paper manufacturing operations including caustic soda, sodium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide, liquid sodium hydrosulfite, and sulfuric acid.
Recovered paper
We are a large consumer of recycled fiber in North America and have de-inking plants that use advanced mechanical and chemical processes to manufacture high quality pulp from recovered paper to produce RBK pulp. The Menominee and Fairmont pulp mills manufacture products containing 100% recycled fiber. In 2017, we used 440,000 metric tons of recovered paper in our production processes.
6

Energy
Steam and electrical power constitute the primary forms of energy used in pulp, tissue and paper production. Process steam is produced in boilers using a variety of fuel sources, as well as heat recovery units in mechanical pulp facilities. All of our operating sites generate 100% of their own steam requirements. In 2017, our Alma, Calhoun, Catawba, Coosa Pines, Dolbeau, Gatineau, Kénogami, Saint-Félicien and Thunder Bay operations collectively consumed approximately 48% of their electrical requirements from internal sources, notably on-site cogeneration and hydroelectric dams. We purchased the balance of our electrical energy needs from third parties. We have seven sites that operate cogeneration facilities and all of these sites generate primarily “green energy” from renewable biomass. In addition, we utilize alternative fuels such as used oil and tire-derived fuel to reduce consumption of fossil fuels.
We also have one hydroelectric generation and transmission network (Hydro-Saguenay in the Saguenay region of Quebec), which consists of seven generating stations with 170 MW of capacity. The water rights agreements required to operate some of these facilities typically range from 10 to 25 years and, subject to certain conditions, are generally renewable for additional terms. In some cases, the agreements are contingent on the continued operation of the related paper mills and a minimum level of capital spending in the region. For the other facilities, the right to generate hydroelectricity stems from our ownership of the riverbed on which these facilities are located.
Competition
In general, our products, other than tissue, are globally-traded commodities. The markets in which we compete are highly competitive and, aside from quality specifications to meet customer needs, the production of our products, other than tissue, does not depend upon a proprietary process or formula. Pricing and the level of shipments of our products are influenced by the balance between supply and demand as affected by global economic conditions, changes in consumption and capacity, the level of customer and producer inventories, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Prices for our products have been and are likely to continue to be highly volatile.
We produce six major grades of market pulp (NBSK, SBSK, NBHK, SBHK, RBK and fluff), for which we compete with a number of major market pulp producers, primarily with operations in North America. Market pulp being a globally-traded commodity, we also compete with other producers from South America (eucalyptus hardwood and radiata pine softwood), Europe (northern hardwood and softwood) and Asia (mixed tropical hardwood). Price, quality, service and fiber sources are considered the main competitive determinants.
We are an integrated manufacturer of tissue products and compete with several major competitors in the North American tissue market. The key competitive attributes in this market include price, product quality, service and customer relationships. Competition is also significantly affected by geographic location, as freight costs represent a material portion of the costs. We compete with branded and private-label products within North American products.
We compete in North America with both large North American and numerous smaller local lumber producers in a highly competitive market. We also compete with European producers in the North American market during periods of favorable currencies and prices. Because there are few distinctions between lumber from different producers, competition is primarily based on price. Competition is also affected by cost and availability of wood, freight cost and labor.
Newsprint is produced by numerous manufacturers worldwide. In 2017, the five largest North American producers represented approximately 87% of North American newsprint capacity and the five largest global producers represented approximately 32% of global newsprint capacity. We face competition from both large global producers and numerous smaller regional producers. Price, quality and customer relationships are important competitive determinants.
Our specialty papers, including uncoated mechanical, coated mechanical, and uncoated freesheet papers, compete on the basis of price, quality, service and breadth of product line. We compete with numerous uncoated mechanical paper producers, with the five largest North American producers representing 84% of the North American uncoated mechanical papers capacity and the five largest global producers representing 47% of global uncoated mechanical papers capacity in 2017. In addition, imports from overseas accounted for approximately 12% of North American uncoated mechanical paper demand in 2017. We also compete with a number of other coated mechanical paper producers with operations in North America. In 2017, the five largest North American producers represented approximately 93% of North American capacity for coated mechanical papers. Imports of coated mechanical papers accounted for approximately 15% of North American demand in 2017. There are also numerous worldwide suppliers of other grades of paper such as coated freesheet.
Substantially all of our U.S. imports of SC paper, uncoated groundwood (“UGW”) paper, and softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian mills are subject to one or more orders requiring us to pay cash deposits to the U.S. for estimated countervailing or anti-dumping duties. Since October 20, 2015, we have been required to pay cash deposits at a subsidy rate of 17.87% for estimated countervailing duties on our U.S. imports of SC paper produced at our Canadian mills. We also became 
7

required to pay cash deposits for estimated countervailing duties and anti-dumping duties on our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian sawmills, since April 28, 2017, and June 30, 2017, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the rates for such estimated countervailing and anti-dumping duties were 14.7% and 3.2%, respectively. Additionally, since January 16, 2018, we have been required to pay cash deposits to the U.S. at a preliminary rate of 4.42% for estimated countervailing duties on our U.S. imports of UGW paper produced at our Canadian mills. The countervailing duty and anti-dumping investigations of UGW paper produced in Canada are at a preliminary stage, and it is uncertain at the conclusion of those investigations, at what rate, if any, we will be required to pay cash deposits to the U.S. for estimated countervailing or anti-dumping duties on our imports to the U.S. of UGW paper produced at our Canadian mills. During any period in which our U.S. imports of SC paper, UGW paper, or softwood lumber products from our Canadian mills are subject to countervailing duty or anti-dumping cash deposit requirements or duty requirements, our competitive position of those products could be materially affected. For additional information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Legal and Compliance Risk – We are subject to countervailing or anti-dumping duties on our U.S. imports of paper products and substantially all of our U.S. imports of softwood lumber products produced at our Canadian mills, which could materially affect our operations and cash flows,” of this Form 10‑K.
As with other global commodities, the competitive position of our products is significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk – Foreign Currency Exchange Risk,” of this Form 10-K.
Trends in non-print media are expected to continue to adversely affect demand for traditional print media, including our newsprint and specialty papers, and those of our customers. For additional information, see Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Strategic Risk – Developments in non-print media are expected to continue to adversely affect the demand for some of our key products, and our responses to these developments may not be successful,” of this Form 10-K.
Based on market interest, we offer a number of our products, particularly market pulp and wood products, with specific designations to one or more globally recognized forest management and chain of custody standards. Our ability to conform to new or existing guidelines for certification depends on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, such as: changes to the standards or the interpretation or the application of the standards; the adequacy of government-implemented conservation measures; and the existence of territorial disputes between First Nations and governments. If we are unable to offer certified products, or to meet commitments to supply certified product, it could adversely affect the marketability of our products and our ability to compete with other producers.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 7,700 people, of whom approximately 5,100 were represented by various unions, primarily Unifor, and the Confederation of National Trade Unions (the “CNTU”) in Canada and predominantly by the United Steelworkers International (the “USW”) in the U.S. In the past year, we renewed or entered into a number of agreements with unions, covering approximately 260 employees in Canada. Collective agreements covering approximately 1,300 employees in Canada are scheduled to expire in 2018, affecting certain pulp and paper mills, sawmills and woodlands operations.
While we intend to renew collective agreements, there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew agreements on satisfactory terms, or that we will maintain continuously satisfactory agreements with all of our unionized employees. Should we be unable to do so, it could result in strikes, work stoppages or disturbances by affected employees, which could cause us to experience a disruption of operations and affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Trademarks
We have registrations or pending applications for our key trademarks “RESOLUTE” and “resolute Forest Products & Design” in the countries of our principal markets, as well as “RESOLUTE FOREST PRODUCTS”, “R Design”, and “RESOLUTE TISSUE” in Canada and the United States, and “RÉSOLU” and “Produits forestiers résolu & Design” in Canada. The current registrations of these trademarks are effective for various periods of time and may be renewed periodically, provided that we, as the registered owner, comply with all applicable renewal requirements.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to a variety of federal or national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We believe our operations are in material compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. While it is impossible to predict future environmental regulations that may be established, we believe that we will not be at a significant competitive disadvantage with regard to meeting future Canadian or United States standards. For additional information, see Note 16, “Commitments and Contingencies – Environmental matters,” to our Consolidated Financial Statements.

We make our Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and our Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports, available free of charge on our website (www.resolutefp.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we file or furnish such materials to the SEC. The SEC also maintains a website (www.sec.gov) that contains our reports and other information filed with the SEC. In addition, any materials we file with the SEC may be read and copied at the SEC’s Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, D.C., 20549. Information on the operations of the Public Reference Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. Our reports are also available on the System for Electronic Document Analysis and Retrieval website (www.sedar.com).
