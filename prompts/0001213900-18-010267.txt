Introduction
 
Until the change in control described below, we were a medical device company that, subject to government approval, planned to manufacture and market medical devices.
 
In August 2017, Hassan Salari, Francine Salari, Julian Salari, Fredrick Salari, who then collectively owned 53,933,373 shares of our common stock (the “Control Shares”), representing approximately 76.04%, of our outstanding shares of common stock, sold the Control Shares to Team Youn Bio Medicine International Corp. Limited, a China based company (“Team Youn”), for a total purchase price of $275,000 pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Agreement dated July 17 , 2017 (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”).
 
Contemporaneously with the sale of the Control Shares, we sold to Dr. Hassan Salari, our former President and Chief Executive Officer, all of the outstanding shares of our wholly-owned subsidiary, Eternity Healthcare Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“Eternity BC”), and assigned to Dr. Salari certain intellectual property and technology related to the development, testing and manufacture of our medical device needle free injection technology, together with all “know-how” and other proprietary rights related thereto (the “IP Rights”) for a total purchase price of $CAD100,000 (equivalent to $USD79,590) pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement. Payment of the purchase price for the shares of the subsidiary and the IP Rights was made by crediting an equal amount against the $CAD1,163,966 indebtedness we owed to Dr. Salari for advances made to pay operating expenses. Our remaining $CAD1,063,966 of indebtedness to Dr. Salari was assigned to Team Youn pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement.
 
On October 16, 2017, an affiliate of our company transferred all of the shares of Trillion Enterprises Group Limited (“Trillion Enterprise”), a dormant company incorporated under the law of British Virgin Islands (“BVI”) on February 23, 2013, to us without consideration . Hong Kong Trillion Holdings Limited (“HK Trillion”) was incorporated by Trillion Enterprise as a wholly-owned subsidiary on March 15, 2013. Both Trillion Enterprise and HK Trillion had no operations since their inception.
 
On December 13, 2017, we and HK Trillion entered into a share exchange agreement pursuant to which we issued 17,181,769 shares of our common stock to Guizhou Tongren Zoken Biotechnology Co., Ltd. and Guizhou Zhongjing Times Management Co., Ltd., the equity holders of Guizhou Tongren Healthy China Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (“Guizhou Tongren”), in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Guizhou Tongren, a company formed on September 15, 2017 to engage in the business of providing stem cell storage and related medical therapies in China. As a result of the share exchange, Guizhou Tongren became a wholly-owned subsidiary of HK Trillion.
 
On January 16, 2018, we issued 82,946,800 shares of common stock to Team Youn upon conversion of CAD $1,063,966 (approximately USD$ 829,468) at a conversion price of USD$ 0.01 per share, pursuant to a Debt Conversion Agreement with Team Youn.
 
On February 22, 2018 we amended our articles of incorporation to authorize the issuance of up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock by our Board of Directors in one or more series, with such designations, powers, privileges, rights, qualifications and limitations as our Board of Directors may determine, and to increase the number of shares of common stock we are authorized to issue from 300,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 (the “Charter Amendment”). The Charter Amendment was adopted and approved by unanimous written consent in lieu of a meeting of our Board of Directors dated as of January 18, 2018 and by written consent in lieu of a meeting of stockholders signed by Team Youn, the record owner of 137,880,173 shares of our common stock, representing approximately 80.60% of our outstanding shares of common stock.
 
Overview
 
We are engaged in the business of providing stem cell storage and related medical therapies in China. Guizhou Tongren, our wholly-owned subsidiary, a leading stem cell therapy service company serving Guizhou Province and Western China, is constructing a 50,000 square-feet facility in Tongren, Guizhou Province, China for stem cell harvesting, storage and transformation, and patient treatment that will utilize the proprietary biotechnology developed by partner entities which is expected to be operational in September 2018. Guizhou Province is located in southwest China with a population of approximately 35.5 million. The facility will consist of a fully equipped stem cell therapy laboratory, immune cell research room, a genetics and gene research laboratory, and customer treatment rooms. Upon completion, the facility will be capable of servicing about 45,000 patients annually, and storing about 200,000 cell units.

Once completed, the facility will provide its clients with treatments and services similar to those provided by hospitals which rely upon specialized laboratories to service their clients. Unlike those hospitals, which ship their patients’ stem cells to external laboratories for storage and transformation, all work will be done on site at the Tongren facility.
 
On March 26, 2018, we entered into a Credit Loan Agreement with Shenzhen Dongyang Medical Technology Co., Ltd. (“Dongyang Medical”), as lender, and our wholly-owned subsidiary, Guizhou Tongren, pursuant to which we agreed to guaranty payment of the indebtedness under a loan facility providing Guizhou Tongren with advances of up to $25 million. Advances under the loan facility bear interest at the rate of 10% per annum. The loan facility has a term of five years. Advances under the credit facility will be used to construct and equip the medical facility and to provide Guizhou Tongren with working capital to operate the medical facility.
 
On May 10, 2018, Guizhou Tongren entered into a Procurement Consignation Agreement with Dongyang Medical and consigned Dongyang Medical to procure medical equipment costing approximately $31.36 million (RMB 198.568 million) that Guizhou Tongren will need to carry out its planned cell storage, transformation and application service business. Pursuant to the agreement, Guizhou Tongren will pay the purchase price to Dongyang Medical in five years after the equipment is accepted by Guizhou Tongren. Any unpaid balances will bear 10% interest annually from the date of acceptance, and the interest is payable every six months.

Market for Our Services
 
In recent years, cell therapy and stem cell technologies’ development has induced rapid growth in the stem cell related treatment market globally. According to Technavio, the global cell therapy market reached $63.5 billion in year 2015 and will grow at a 34% rate for the next 20 years. China has been a major player in stem cell technology research and application due to less religious resistance, large clinical resources from its population and patient base, and government policies’ support.
 
From the perspective of an industry chain, the first level of the stem cell industry is the extraction and storage of stem cells, the midstream is the research and development of stem cell preparation and related stem cell drugs, and the last level is the therapeutic application of stem cells. According to Market Research and Transparency Market Research, China’s stem cell industry is established. However, the market is still very under-served outside of tier-one cities such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. The current national total stem cell storage rate in 2016 was still less than 1% in China, and the regional storage rate varies greatly. The estimated stem cell storage rate in 2016 in more developed regions is approximately 3% (based on the number of new subscriber sign-ups for the year divided by the number of newborns). Market Research & Transparency Market Research also points out that, China’s stem cell storage market should be expected to exceed RMB 30 billion if it catches developed countries’ storage rate level.
 
As one of the few players in China’s stem cell storage, transformation and application market, we intend to focus on serving people in provinces in the middle and western part of China. We plan to reach potential customers through cooperation with major physical examination institutions and health management institutions. Through cooperation with medical research institutions such as the research departments of major hospitals and leading universities in cell therapy, we hope to reach potential patients who are not satisfied with traditional treatments methods. By establishing our own healthcare associations and holding healthcare forums to educate the market, we hope to attract potential consumers.
 
Competition 
 
As an emerging industry with advanced technologies, there are few players in the stem cell market in China. Most participants in the industry are focused on newborns’ core blood stem cell storage (there are seven government-licensed core blood banks nationally), and fewer provide adult stem cell extraction and storage. There are very few competitors engaged in stem cell transformation and application. Some companies such as Guanhao Biotech have set up storage centers in highly-developed cities (e.g. Guanhao Biotech’s new storage center in Hangzhou has the capacity of storing 100,000 cell units).
 Geographically, the current adult stem cell storage banks are all located in North China, East China and South China. There is no company serving middle and western China. We are establishing our facility in Quizho to open the market in Middle and Western China. The target market includes Guizhou, Yunan, Guangxi, Xinjiang and Tibet and we have already chosen Tongren, Guizhou as our first storage and treatment center. The center will be capable of storing 200,000 cell units and serving 45,000 customers annually. We believe this strategy can differentiate us from our competitors and enable us to gain a leading position in the middle and western regions of China.
 
Government Regulation
 
We operate our business in China under a legal regime consisting of the State Council, which is the highest authority of the executive branch of the PRC central government, and several ministries and agencies under its authority including:

● | the National Health and Family Planning Commission (NHFPC); 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA); 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the SAFE; 
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | the Ministry of Commerce (MOC); and 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The State Council and ministries and agencies have issued a series of rules that regulate a number of different substantive areas of our business, which are discussed below.
 
In April 2007, the NDRC issued the “Eleventh Five-Year Plan for Bio-industry Development”, which stated the target of: based on the development foundation and comparative advantages of China’s bio-industry, build up a large-scale industry and enhance the ability of independent innovation. The requirements of industrialization, agglomeration and internationalization accelerated the development of biomedicine, bio-agriculture, bio-energy, bio-manufacturing, bio-environmental protection and other industries.

In June 2009, the General Office of the State Council issued the “Notice on Several Policies for Promoting the Accelerated Development of the Biological Industry”, which refines the Outline of the National Medium- and Long-Term Scientific and Technological Development Plan (2006-2020) and the Development of the Biological Industry. The support policy for the bio-industry in the Five-Planning Plan. Proposing to accelerate the cultivation of the bio-industry is a major measure for China to grasp the strategic opportunities of the new scientific and technological revolution and comprehensively build an innovative country in the new century; accelerate the cultivation of the bio-industry into a pillar industry in the high-tech field and a strategic emerging industry of the country.
 
In 2016, the “13th Five-Year Plan for National Economic and Social Development”, “Made in China 2025” and “Guidelines for the Development of Pharmaceutical Industry” were successively introduced to promote new medical technologies such as precision medicine, tumor immunotherapy and stem cell therapy. The development has positive significance. The “13th Five-Year Plan for Biological Industry Development” will accelerate the development of new applications that benefit people’s livelihood, implement the bio-industry project for the development of healthy China and beautiful China, and promote the application of emerging technologies such as genetic testing and cell therapy. In addition, the CFDA’s “Guidelines for the Research and Evaluation of Cellular Products” established the principles for the evaluation of future cellular products, releasing a clear signal to the market, which will prompt the improvement of industry thresholds and supervision, allowing enterprises to focus on upgrading core technologies and Improve the standardization and standardization of the industry in the cell industry.
 
On March 6, 2017, in order to implement the key special management tasks of the national key R&D plan, give full play to the role of experts in project process management, ensure the implementation of special tasks and the realization of mission objectives, China Biotechnology Development Center established “stem cells and transformation research” special expert group.
 
In June 2017, the Ministry of Science and Technology, the NHFPC, the General Administration of Sports, CFDA, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and the Logistics Support Department of the Central Military Commission reissued the “13th Five-Year Plan” for the Health Industry Science and Technology Innovation Project. “A new plan after the “13th Five-Year Plan for Health and Health Technology Innovation”, both plans explicitly require the accelerated clinical application of stem cell and regenerative medicine, immunotherapy and other biological treatment frontier technologies. In the same month, the Guangzhou Municipal Development and Reform Commission publicly solicited the “Guangzhou Biomedical Industry Development Five-Year Action Plan (2017-2021)” (draft for comments) to clearly define stem cells and regenerative medicine, immune cell therapy, CAR-T cell therapy, and precision. Medical and other industries are listed as the leading enterprises in the new industry and strive to achieve a revenue of 100 billion RMB from the end of 2021.
 
At the end of August 2017, the US FDA approved Novartis’s cellular immunotherapy market. The China State Food and Drug Administration has issued the “Guidelines for the Research and Evaluation of Cellular Therapeutic Products (Trial)”. It means that the door to the clinic application of stem cell technologies has finally opened.
 
On November 22, 2017, the Stem Cell Biology Branch of the Chinese Society of Cell Biology officially released China’s first universal standard for stem cells, “General Requirements for Stem Cells,” which will promote the standardization of stem cells treatment in China. The “General Requirements for Stem Cells” stipulates six parts of stem cell terms and definitions, classification, ethics, and quality requirements. Based on key issues such as safety, efficacy, and stability of stem cell preparations, general requirements for donor cell screening tissue collection, cell separation, culture, cryopreservation, and detection have been established.
 
On November 28, 2017, the second batch of stem cell clinical research filing agencies was announced. Up to now, the National Health and Safety Commission and the Food and Drug Administration have announced the first batch of 114 stem cell clinical research institutions, including 102 medical units and the first batch of 12 military hospitals. Shenzhen, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Beijing and other cities have successively issued regional support policies to accelerate the clinical application and approval of stem cell technology.
 
In December 2017, the Chinese government issued trial guidelines concerning development and testing of cell therapy products in China. Although these trial guidelines are not yet codified as mandatory regulation, we believe they provide a measure of clarity and a preliminary regulatory pathway for our cell therapy operations in a still uncertain regulatory environment.
 
Employees
 
As of July 1, 2018, we had no employees other than Wei-Tao Wang, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial officer.
