ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Core-Mark,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Core-Mark Holding Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
Company Overview 
Core-Mark is one of the largest wholesale distributors to the convenience retail industry in North America, providing sales, marketing, distribution and logistics services to approximately 45,000 customer locations across the United States ("U.S.") and Canada through 32 distribution centers (excluding two distribution facilities we operate as a third-party logistics provider). Our origins date back to 1888, when Glaser Bros., a family-owned-and-operated candy and tobacco distribution business, was founded in San Francisco, California. 
Our mission is to be the most valued marketer of fresh and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry. While the past century has brought incredible changes to our business and the world in which we operate, our goal is the same today as it was 130 years ago - to provide customers with the best possible service and to help them grow their sales and profits. We have grown our business organically and through acquisitions which have expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base. 
We operate in an industry where, in 2016, total in-store sales at convenience retail locations across both the U.S. and Canada were approximately $264.0 billion. In the U.S., total in-store sales at convenience locations in 2016 were approximately $233.0 billion, an increase of 3.2% over the prior year, based on the National Association of Convenience Stores ("NACS") State of the Industry ("SOI") report. Over the ten years from 2007 through the end of 2016, U.S. convenience in-store sales have increased by a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 3.3%. The most recent NACS Convenience Industry Store Count noted that the U.S. had approximately 155,000 convenience store locations as of December 31, 2017. Approximately 103,000, or 66%, of the convenience stores in the U.S. are considered independents with ten or fewer stores. In Canada, we estimate that total in-store sales at convenience locations in 2016 were approximately CAD $41.1 billion generated through approximately 27,000 stores, based on the Canadian Convenience Store Association 2016 Industry report.
Core-Mark is one of two national distributors to the convenience store industry in the U.S. and is the largest in Canada. Our established national market presence rests primarily with our ability to service customers in every geographic region within the U.S. through 27 primary distribution centers and servicing customers in Canada with our five Canadian distribution centers. We offer our national and large regional convenience store customers scale and buying power, and we offer our independent store customers store support and marketing programs to assist them in growing their businesses. Our Vendor Consolidation Initiative (“VCI”), Focused Marketing Initiative (“FMI”) and Fresh programs have a proven track record of helping our customers grow their sales and profits at an accelerated rate. We believe this gives us a strong competitive advantage in the North American convenience store industry. 
Company Highlights
Our net sales grew from $8.9 billion in 2012 to $15.7 billion in 2017, yielding an annual compounded growth rate of approximately 12%. Our growth has been driven primarily by our business strategies described more fully below. We believe these strategies have positioned us to continue to grow our approximate 7% market share of total in-store sales within the convenience store channel in North America and to take advantage of growth opportunities with other retail store formats. Below are recent key highlights:

• | In July 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Farner-Bocken Company ("Farner-Bocken"), located in Carroll Iowa, for approximately $174.0 million. The acquisition of Farner-Bocken further expands our market share in the Midwest. 


• | In May 2017, we began service of our three-year supply agreement with approximately 530 Walmart Inc. ("Walmart") stores in five western states (Arizona, California, New Mexico, Nevada and Utah). Core-Mark is the primary distributor to these stores for candy, tobacco and certain snack foods. Candy sales, the largest product category serviced under the agreement, contributed to approximately 24% to the total sales for this category. 


• | In October 2016, we began service of our five-year supply agreement with 7-Eleven Inc. ("7-Eleven") as the primary wholesale distributor to approximately 900 stores serviced from three of our divisions in the western U.S.- Las Vegas, NV, Salt Lake City, UT and Sacramento, CA.

• | In June 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Pine State Convenience ("Pine State"), a division of Pine State Trading Company, located in Gardiner, Maine, for approximately $88 million.

Business Strategy
Our objective is to increase overall return to stockholders by growing our revenues and leveraging operating costs to increase profitability. As one of the largest marketers of fresh and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry in North America with a track record of effectively selling into other retail channels, we believe we are well-positioned to meet this objective moving forward. Our business strategy includes the following initiatives, designed to further enhance the value we provide to our retail customers:
Fresh Products. There is an increasing trend among consumers to purchase fresh food from convenience and other retail store formats. To meet this demand, we have modified and upgraded our refrigerated capacity, including investing in chill docks, and tri-temperature ("tri-temp") trailers, which provide the infrastructure to deliver a significant range of chilled items including milk, produce and other fresh foods to retail outlets. We have established partnerships with strategically-located dairies, fresh kitchens and bakeries to further enable us to deliver premium consumer items such as sandwiches, wraps, cut-fruit, parfaits, pastries, doughnuts, bread and home meal replacement solutions. We continue to promote our fresh products through the development of unique and comprehensive marketing and equipment programs that assist retailers in showcasing their fresh product offerings. We believe our investments in infrastructure, combined with our strategically located suppliers and in-house expertise, position us as the leader in providing fresh products and programs to the convenience retail industry. Proper execution of Vendor Consolidation Initiative ("VCI"), the cornerstone being dairy distribution, provides Core-Mark the critical mass necessary to offer retailers a multiple weekly delivery platform, which facilitates the proper handling and dating of fresh products. We believe that fresh items are increasingly driving consumer decisions and will continue to be an important category.
Vendor Consolidation Initiative. We expect our VCI program will allow us to continue to grow our sales by capitalizing on the highly fragmented supply chain that services the convenience retail industry. A convenience retailer generally receives store merchandise through a large number of direct-store deliveries. This represents a highly inefficient and costly process for retailers. Our VCI program targets inefficiencies in the convenience store supply chain by offering the retailer the ability to receive multiple weekly deliveries for the bulk of their products, including dairy and other merchandise they previously purchased from multiple direct-store delivery companies. This simplifies the customer supply chain and provides retailers with an opportunity to improve inventory turns and working capital, reduce operational and transaction costs, and greatly diminish their out-of-stocks.
Focused Marketing Initiative. Designed to enhance our relationship with our independent customer base and to further differentiate us in the market place, our FMI program is centered on increasing the sales and profitability of the independent store through improved category insights, optimized retail price strategy and demographic decision-making, along with providing Core-Mark’s marketing solutions to create a comprehensive retail marketing strategy. We believe our innovative approach, which focuses on building a trusted partnership with our customers, has established us as the market leader in providing valuable marketing and supply chain solutions to the convenience retail industry.
Acquisitions and Expansion. We believe there is significant opportunity to increase our market presence and revenue growth through strategic and opportunistic acquisitions and the continued expansion of our facility infrastructure. We completed seven acquisitions and added three primary distribution centers between 2008 and 2017, which expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base. We will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing acquisitions that allow further leveraging of our geographic footprint and bring Fresh and VCI to a broader customer base.
Competitive Strengths 
We believe we have the following fundamental competitive strengths, which form the foundation for our business strategy:
Innovation and Flexibility. Wholesale distributors typically provide convenience retailers access to a broad product line, the ability to place small quantity orders, inventory management and access to trade credit. Our capability to increase sales and profitability with existing and new customers is based on our ability to deliver consistently high levels of service, innovative marketing programs, technology solutions and logistics support. We believe we are one of the first to recognize emerging trends and to offer retailers our unique strategic solutions such as Fresh, VCI, and FMI.
Distribution Capabilities. The wholesale distribution industry is highly fragmented and historically has consisted of a large number of small, privately-owned businesses and a small number of large, full-service wholesale distributors serving multiple geographic regions. Relative to smaller competitors, large national distributors such as Core-Mark benefit from several competitive advantages including: increased purchasing power, the ability to service large national chain accounts, economies of scale in sales and operations, and the resources to invest in information technology and other productivity-enhancing technologies. Our wholesale distributing capabilities provide valuable services to both manufacturers of consumer products and convenience retailers.

Manufacturers benefit from our broad retail coverage, inventory management, efficiency in processing small orders and frequency of deliveries. Convenience retailers benefit from our distribution capabilities by gaining access to a broad product line, optimizing inventory management and accessing trade credit.
Customers 
We service approximately 45,000 customer locations in all 50 states in the U.S. and five Canadian provinces. Our primary customer base consists of traditional convenience stores, as well as alternative outlets selling consumer packaged goods. Our traditional convenience store customers include many of the major national and super-regional convenience store operators, as well as independently owned convenience stores. Our alternative outlet customers comprise a variety of store formats, including grocery stores, drug stores, big box or supercenter stores, liquor stores, cigarette and tobacco shops, hotel gift shops, military exchanges, college and corporate campuses, casinos, hardware stores, airport concessions and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products.
Our top ten customers accounted for 38.7% of our net sales in 2017 including Murphy U.S.A., our largest customer, which accounted for 12.2% of our total net sales.
Products 
We purchase a variety of brand name and private label products, in excess of 55,000 stock keeping units ("SKUs"), from suppliers and manufacturers. Cigarette products represent less than 5% of our total SKUs purchased. We offer customers a variety of food/non-food products, including fast food, candy, snacks, groceries, fresh products, dairy, bread, beverages, other tobacco products, general merchandise, and health and beauty care products.
Below is a comparison of our net sales mix by primary product category for the last three years (in millions):

Cigarette Products. We purchase cigarette products from major U.S. and Canadian manufacturers. We have no long-term cigarette purchase agreements and buy substantially all of our products on an as-needed basis. Cigarette manufacturers historically offer structured incentive programs to wholesalers based on maintaining market share and executing promotional programs. Net sales of the cigarettes category grew 5.3% in 2017 to $10,887.4 million, accounting for approximately 69.4% of our total net sales and 27.0% of our total gross profit in 2017. We control major purchases of cigarettes centrally to optimize inventory levels and purchasing opportunities. Daily replenishment of inventory and brand selection is controlled by our distribution centers.
In 2017, our cigarette carton sales in the U.S. and Canada decreased 2.5% and 2.3%, respectively, caused by the expiration of distribution agreements with Kroger Convenience and with Circle K Corp. in the Southeastern Region of the U.S., increases in excise taxes in certain jurisdictions, and a general decline in carton sales to existing customers. These impacts were partially offset by the addition of Walmart in May 2017 and 7-Eleven in October 2016, and the acquisitions of Farner-Bocken in July 2017 and Pine State in June 2016. In the industry overall, U.S. and Canadian cigarette consumption steadily declined over the last decade. Based on data compiled from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Economic Research Service and provided by the Tobacco Merchants Association ("TMA"), total cigarette consumption in the U.S. declined from 374 billion cigarettes in 2007 to 262 billion cigarettes in 2016, or a compounded annual decline of approximately 3.9%. Total cigarette consumption declined in Canada from 30 billion cigarettes in 2007 to 26 billion cigarettes in 2016, or a compounded annual decline of approximately 1.6% based on statistics provided by the TMA. Although we anticipate overall cigarette consumption will continue to decline, we expect to offset 
3

these declines through market share expansion, growth in our non-cigarette categories and incremental gross profit from cigarette manufacturer price increases. 
 We expect cigarette manufacturers will continue to raise prices as carton sales decline in order to maintain or enhance their overall profitability.
Excise taxes are levied on cigarettes and other tobacco products by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments and are also imposed by various states, localities and provinces. We collect state, local, and provincial excise taxes from our customers and remit these amounts to the appropriate authorities based on the credit terms, if applicable, extended by each jurisdiction. Net sales and cost of sales included amounts related to state, local and provincial excise taxes were approximately $3.5 billion, $3.0 billion and $2.2 billion in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Food/Non-food Products. Our food products include fast food, candy, snacks, groceries, beverages and fresh products such as sandwiches, juices, salads, produce, dairy and bread. Our non-food products include cigars, tobacco, health and beauty care products, general merchandise and equipment. Net sales of the combined food/non-food product categories grew 14.5% in 2017 to $4,800.2 million, which was 30.6% of our total net sales, driven primarily by incremental sales to existing customers and market share gains including Walmart and the acquisition of Farner-Bocken. The increase in candy was driven primarily by sales to Walmart, which we began servicing in May 2017. Sales generated from Fresh, VCI and FMI were the primary drivers of increased sales to existing customers. Our OTP and Health, beauty & general categories continued to benefit from higher sales of smokeless tobacco and e-cigarettes products, respectively, which we believe will be a continuing trend. Gross profit for food/non-food categories grew $61.0 million, or 11.8%, to $577.8 million in 2017, which was 73.0% of our total gross profit. Our strategy is to continue to grow sales of food/non-food products through our Fresh, VCI and FMI strategies. In order to take advantage of the significantly higher margins earned by food/non-food products, two of our key business strategies, Fresh and VCI, focus primarily on the highest margin categories in the food/non-food group. We believe there is an increasing trend toward purchases of fresh food from convenience and other retail store formats. Combined sales of our Food and Fresh categories grew $185.1 million, or 10.2%, to $1,997.4 million in 2017. Sales of OTP increased $138.5 million, or 12.2%, while the Health, beauty and general category increased $66.6 million or 14.9%, driven primarily by this trend, as well as market share gains. 
Suppliers 
We purchase products for resale from approximately 5,300 trade suppliers and manufacturers located across the U.S. and Canada. In 2017, we purchased approximately 81% of our products from our top 20 suppliers, with our top two suppliers, Philip Morris USA, Inc. and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, accounting for approximately 35% and 23% of our purchases, respectively. We coordinate our purchasing from suppliers by negotiating, on a Company-wide basis, special arrangements to obtain volume discounts and additional incentives, while also taking advantage of promotional and marketing incentives offered to us as a wholesale distributor. In addition, buyers in each of our distribution facilities purchase products directly from manufacturers, improving product mix and availability for individual markets.

Operations 
As of December 31, 2017, we operated a network of 32 primary distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada (excluding two distribution facilities we operate as a third-party logistics provider). Twenty-seven of our distribution centers are located in the U.S. and five are located in Canada. 
 The map below depicts the scope of our operations and the names of our distribution centers.
We operate five consolidation centers which buy products from our suppliers in bulk quantities and then redistribute the products to many of our other distribution centers. The products purchased by our consolidation centers may include frozen and chilled items, candy, snacks, beverages, health and beauty care and general merchandise products. We operate two additional facilities as a third-party logistics provider dedicated solely to supporting the logistics and management requirements of one of our major customers, Alimentation Couche-Tard, Inc. ("Couche-Tard"). One distribution facility located in Phoenix, Arizona, is referred to as the Arizona Distribution Center. The other distribution facility located in San Antonio, Texas, is referred to as the Retail Distribution Center. 
Our proprietary Distribution Center Management System platform provides our distribution centers with the flexibility to adapt rapidly to changing business needs and allows them to provide our customers with necessary information technology requirements and integration capabilities.
Distribution 
As of December 31, 2017, we employed approximately 2,100 transportation department personnel, including delivery drivers, shuttle drivers, routers, training supervisors and managers, all of whom focus on achieving safe, on-time deliveries. Our daily orders are picked and loaded nightly in reverse order of scheduled delivery. At December 31, 2017, our distribution fleet primarily consisted of approximately 1,500 leased tractors and trailers with over 1,300 additional owned tractors and trailers. We have made a significant investment in recent years to upgrade our trailer fleet to tri-temp, which gives us the capability to deliver frozen, chilled and non-refrigerated goods in one delivery. Excluding the fleet of trucks and trailers acquired from the acquisition of Farner-Bocken, 100% of our trailers were tri-temp as of December 31, 2017 This provides us the multiple temperature zone capability needed to support our focus on delivering fresh products to our customers. 
As of December 31, 2017, approximately 16% of our trucks ran on Compressed Natural Gas ("CNG"), which allows us to reduce our carbon footprint and lower our transportation costs. To date, we have opened seven CNG stations, two of which we 
5

own, located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and Corona, California, and the other five are operated in partnership with U.S. Oil and are located in Aurora, Colorado, Forrest City, Arkansas, Sanford, North Carolina, Atlanta, Georgia and Tampa, Florida under the name GAIN Clean Fuel ("GAIN"). In addition to providing fuel to our fleet, the GAIN stations are also open to other public fleets for fueling.
Competition 
Competition within the industry is based primarily on the range and quality of the services provided, price, product selection and the reliability of wholesalers’ logistics as well as proximity to the customer's stores. We operate from a perspective that focuses heavily on flexibility and providing outstanding customer service through our distribution centers, order fulfillment rates, on-time delivery, innovative marketing solutions and merchandising support as well as competitive pricing.
Core-Mark is one of the two largest wholesale convenience distributors (measured by annual sales) serving North America. We service both convenience store chain customers and independent operators with ten or fewer stores which comprise approximately 66% of the convenience retail store market. The McLane Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., our largest competitor focuses on servicing large regional or national convenience store chains as well as our chain customers in other trade channels. There are two other large companies that cover the eastern half of the U.S: The H.T. Hackney Company and the Eby-Brown Company. In addition, there are hundreds of local distributors serving small regional chains and independent convenience retailers. In Canada, in addition to Core-Mark, several companies make-up the competitive landscape. Wallace & Carey, Inc., has national distribution capabilities. Pratts Wholesale Limited, regionally serves the Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta markets. Sobeys Inc. is a large national convenience store and grocery wholesaler. 
Beyond the traditional wholesale supply channels, we face potential competition from at least three other supply avenues. First, certain consumer product manufacturers such as Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc., MillerCoors LLC, The Coca-Cola Company, Frito-Lay, Inc., a division of PepsiCo, Inc. ("PepsiCo") and PepsiCo deliver their products directly to convenience retailers. Secondly, club wholesalers such as Costco Wholesale Corporation and Sam’s West, Inc. ("Sam's Club") provide a limited selection of products at generally competitive prices; however, they often have limited delivery options and limited services. Finally, some large convenience retail chains self-distribute products due to the geographic density of their stores and their belief that they can economically service such locations.
We face competition from the diversion into the U.S. and Canadian markets of cigarettes intended for sale outside of these markets, including the sale of cigarettes in non-taxable jurisdictions, inter-state/provincial and international smuggling of cigarettes, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, increased imports of foreign low priced brands, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes. The competitive environment has been characterized by a continued influx of cheap products and tobacco alternatives, including electronic cigarettes that challenge sales of higher priced and fully taxed cigarettes.
Working Capital Practices 
We sell products on credit terms to our customers that averaged, as measured by days sales outstanding, about nine days for each of 2017, 2016 and 2015. Credit terms may impact pricing and are competitive within our industry. Many of our customers remit payment electronically, which facilitates efficient and timely monitoring of payment risk. Canadian days sales outstanding in receivables tend to be lower as Canadian industry practice is for shorter credit terms than in the U.S.
We maintain our inventory of products based on the level of sales of the particular product and manufacturer replenishment cycles. The number of days a particular item of inventory remains in our distribution centers varies by product and is principally driven by the turnover of that product and economic order quantities. We typically order and carry in inventory additional amounts of certain critical products to assure high order fulfillment levels for these items. Periodically, we may carry higher levels of inventory to take advantage of anticipated manufacturer price increases. The number of days of cost of sales in inventory averaged about 16 days, 15 days, and 16 days, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The cigarette category averaged eleven days, nine days, and ten days, in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The food/non-food categories averaged 29 days, 27 days and 29 days in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
We obtain terms from our vendors and certain taxing jurisdictions based on industry practices, consistent with our credit standing. We take advantage of the full complement of term offerings, which may include enhanced cash discounts for earlier payment or prepayment. Terms for our accounts payable and cigarette and tobacco taxes payable range anywhere from two days prepaid to 60 days credit. Days payable outstanding for both categories, excluding the impact of prepayments, during each of 2017, 2016 and 2015 averaged 11 days.

Employees
The following chart provides a breakdown of our employees by function and geographic region (including employees at our third-party logistics facilities) as of December 31, 2017:
TOTAL EMPLOYEES BY BUSINESS FUNCTION


 | U.S. | Canada | | Total
Sales and Marketing | 1,542 | | 106 | | 1,648
Warehousing and Distribution | 5,284 | | 390 | | 5,674
Management, Administration, Finance and Purchasing | 941 | | 150 | | 1,091
Total for all categories | 7,767 | | 646 | | 8,413


Four of our distribution centers, Hayward, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Calgary, have employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Hayward, Las Vegas and Los Angeles) and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (Calgary). Approximately 400 employees, or 5% of our workforce, are unionized. There have been no disruptions in customer service, strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns as a result of union activities, and we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees.
Regulation 
As a distributor of food products in the U.S., we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ("FDA"). In Canada, similar standards related to food and over-the-counter medications are governed by Health Canada. The products we distribute are also subject to federal, state, provincial and local regulation through such measures as: the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state, provincial and local health agencies of relevant standards for the products we distribute; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are inspected periodically by federal, state, provincial and local authorities, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") under the U.S. Department of Labor, which require us to comply with certain health and safety standards to protect our employees. 
We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. and Canadian Departments of Transportation, which regulate transportation of perishable goods, and similar state, provincial and local agencies. Our distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada are subject to a broad spectrum of federal, state, provincial and local environmental protection statutes including those that govern emissions to air, soil and water, and the disposal of hazardous substances. 
Our policy is to comply with all regulatory and legal requirements, and management is not aware of any related issues that may have a material effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Registered Trademarks 
We have registered trademarks including the following: Arcadia Bay®, Arcadia Bay Coffee Company®, Cable Car®, Core-Mark®, Core Solutions Group®, EMERALD®, Java Street®, SmartStock®, Pine State Convenience®, Taco Depot® and Farner-Bocken®.
Segment and Geographic Information 
We have two operating segments which aggregate into one reportable segment. We also present certain financial information by operating segment region -- the U.S. and Canada. See Note 16 - Segment and Geographic Information to our consolidated financial statements.
Seasonality
We typically generate higher net sales and gross profits during the warm weather months (April through September) than other times of the year. We believe this occurs because the convenience store industry tends to be busier due to timing of vacations and an increase in travel during this period.
Corporate and Contact Information 
Our corporate headquarters is located at 395 Oyster Point Boulevard, Suite 415, South San Francisco, California, 94080 and our telephone number is (650) 589-9445.
