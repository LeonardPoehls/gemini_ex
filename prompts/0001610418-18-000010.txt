ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to the “Predecessor,” “we,” “our,” or “us” or like terms, when referring to period prior to September 30, 2014, refer to CNX Gathering LLC (formerly known as CONE Gathering LLC) (“CNX Gathering”) our predecessor for accounting purposes. References to the “Partnership,” “we,” “our,” “us” or similar expressions, when referring to periods since September 30, 2014, refer to CNX Midstream Partners LP (formerly known as CONE Midstream Partners LP), including its consolidated subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a growth-oriented master limited partnership focused on the ownership, operation, development and acquisition of natural gas gathering and other midstream energy assets to service our customers’ production in the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Our assets include natural gas gathering pipelines and compression and dehydration facilities, as well as condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization facilities. We are managed by our general partner, CNX Midstream GP LLC, formerly known as CONE Midstream GP LLC (our “general partner”), a wholly owned subsidiary of CNX Gathering. CNX Gathering is a wholly owned subsidiary of CNX Resources Corporation, formerly known as CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE: CNX)(“CNX”). 
We were formed in May 2014 as a joint venture between CNX and Noble Energy, Inc. (NYSE: NBL) (“Noble Energy”). On January 3, 2018, CNX Gas Company LLC (“CNX Gas”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of CNX, acquired from NBL Midstream, LLC (“NBL Midstream”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Noble Energy, NBL Midstream’s 50% interest in CNX Gathering. CNX became our sole sponsor as a result of this transaction, and we refer to CNX as our “Sponsor” throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Please read “Developments and Highlights—CNX Gas and NBL Midstream Transaction” beginning on page 6 for more information related to CNX Gas’ acquisition of NBL Midstream’s indirect interest in our general partner. 
We generate substantially all of our revenues under long-term, fixed-fee gathering agreements with CNX and HG Energy II Appalachia, LLC (“HG Energy”), to whom Noble Energy assigned its gathering agreement with us, that are intended to mitigate our direct commodity price exposure and enhance the stability of our cash flows. Please read “Developments and Highlights—Noble Energy Sale of Upstream Assets” beginning on page 6 for more information related to the assignment of the Noble Energy gathering agreement. The gathering agreements with CNX and HG Energy currently include acreage dedications of approximately 513,000 aggregate net acres, subject to the release provisions set forth therein. Although CNX and HG Energy currently account for substantially all our revenues, we intend to supplement our profitability and future growth by pursuing opportunities to perform gathering services for other unrelated third parties in the future. In addition, we also consider accretive acquisitions, which may include drop downs of additional interests in our existing consolidated assets.
Over the last five years, the Partnership has turned in line over 400 wells in our Marcellus Shale dedication area, which contributed to average combined daily gross wellhead production of approximately 1,266 BBtu/d in 2017. Please read “Our Acreage Dedication and Right of First Offer Assets” beginning on page 10 for more information. 
The following charts illustrate our production trends and well turn in line activity on our dedicated acreage for the periods indicated: 

(1) Represents gross wellhead production attributable to wells drilled on our dedicated acreage.
(2) Represents total gross wells turned in line on our dedicated acreage.

Developments and Highlights
Noble Energy Sale of Upstream Assets
On June 28, 2017, Noble Energy sold its upstream assets in northern West Virginia and southern Pennsylvania to HG Energy, a portfolio company of Quantum Energy Partners, LP, effectively making HG Energy the new shipper on the dedicated acreage that was previously owned by Noble Energy (the “Noble Energy Asset Sale”). The Partnership currently gathers the natural gas and condensate volumes produced by HG Energy on our dedicated acreage under the terms of our gathering agreement with Noble Energy, which was assigned to HG Energy by Noble Energy upon consummation of the Noble Energy Asset Sale.
In connection with the Noble Energy Asset Sale, Noble Energy provided notice to the Partnership of its release of approximately 37,000 undeveloped acres, which were primarily within the Growth and Additional Systems, from amounts dedicated to us as per the terms of our gathering agreement. The Partnership is in the process of confirming the dedication status of the acres that were released.
Conversion of Subordinated Units
On October 19, 2017, the board of directors of our general partner declared a quarterly cash distribution of $0.3025 per unit for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The distribution was paid on November 14, 2017 to unitholders of record as of the close of business on November 3, 2017. Upon payment of this distribution, the requirements for the conversion of all subordinated units were satisfied under our partnership agreement. As a result, on November 15, 2017, all 29,163,121 subordinated units, which were owned entirely by CNX and Noble Energy in the aggregate, converted into common units on a one-for-one basis and thereafter will participate on terms equal with all other common units in distributions from available cash. 
CNX Gas and NBL Midstream Transaction
On January 3, 2018, CNX Gas acquired NBL Midstream’s 50% membership interest in CNX Gathering for cash consideration of $305.0 million and the mutual release of all outstanding claims between the parties (the “Transaction”). In connection with the Transaction, CNX Gas entered into new 20-year fixed-fee gathering agreement with the Partnership. Please read “Our Gathering Agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy” beginning on page 11 for more information. As a result of the Transaction, CNX, as the sole member of CNX Gas, owns 100% of the membership interest in CNX Gathering. CNX also became our sole Sponsor.
Noble Energy continues to own 21,692,198 common units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (the “Retained Units”); however, Noble Energy has announced its intention to divest of the Retained Units over the next few years. In connection with the closing of the Transaction, we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement (the “Registration Rights Agreement”) with Noble Energy relating to the registered resale of common units that Noble acquired in connection with our initial public offering in September 2014 (our “IPO”) and upon conversion of subordinated units representing limited partner interests in the Partnership (collectively, the “Registrable Securities”). Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Partnership is required to prepare and file a registration statement, or amend an existing registration statement, for the registered resale of the Registrable Securities and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after the Partnership’s release of earnings for the year ended December 31, 2017.
In certain circumstances, and subject to customary qualifications and limitations, Noble Energy will have piggyback registration rights on offerings of common units initiated by the Partnership and other holders of common units. Noble will also have the right to request that the Partnership initiate up to four Demand Underwritten Offerings (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) of Registrable Securities, subject to certain limitations described in the Registration Rights Agreement. The Registration Rights Agreement will terminate no later than the third anniversary of the date on which the registration statement becomes effective.
In connection with the closing of the Transaction, we changed our name to CNX Midstream Partners LP and, effective January 4, 2018, our common units are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “CNXM.”

Our Midstream Assets
In order to effectively manage our business we have divided our current midstream assets among three separate operating segments that we refer to as our “Anchor Systems,” “Growth Systems” and “Additional Systems” based on their relative current cash flows, growth profiles, capital expenditure requirements and stages of their development.

• | Our Anchor Systems include our most developed midstream systems that generate the largest portion of our current cash flows, which includes our three primary midstream systems (the McQuay System, the Majorsville System and the Mamont System) and related assets.


• | Our Growth Systems are primarily located in the dry gas regions of our dedicated acreage that are generally in earlier phases of development and require substantial future expansion capital expenditures to materially increase production, which would primarily be funded by CNX in proportion to CNX Gathering’s 95% retained ownership interest.


• | Our Additional Systems include several gathering systems primarily located in the wet gas regions of our dedicated acreage that we expect will require lower levels of expansion capital investment relative to our Growth Systems. The substantial majority of capital investment on these systems would primarily be funded by CNX in proportion to CNX Gathering’s 95% retained ownership interest.

In order to maintain operational flexibility, our operations are conducted through, and our operating assets are owned by, our operating subsidiaries. However, neither we nor our operating subsidiaries have any employees. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the personnel necessary to conduct our operations, whether through directly hiring employees or by obtaining the services of personnel employed by CNX or others. All of the personnel that conduct our business are employed or contracted by our general partner and its affiliates, including CNX, but we sometimes refer to these individuals as our employees because they provide services directly to us.

Gathering Assets and Compression and Dehydration Facilities
We operated 18 facilities to provide our compression and/or dehydration services as of December 31, 2017. The following table provides information regarding our gathering assets and compression and dehydration facilities as of December 31, 2017:

System | Pipelines (in miles) | Average Daily Throughput (BBtu/d) | Maximum Interconnect Capacity(1)(2) (BBtu/d) | Compression (horsepower) | Compression Capacity (BBtu/d)
Anchor Systems | 177 | 972 | 1,429 | 77,830 | 1,262 
Growth Systems | 31 | 51 | 860 | 6,700 | 80 
Additional Systems | 52 | 243 | 445 | 9,480 | 160 
 | 260 | 1,266 | 2,734 | 94,010 | 1,502 

(1) Maximum interconnect capacity is the maximum throughput that can be delivered from the system through physical interconnections to third-party facilities or pipelines.
(2) Our midstream systems currently have interconnects with the following interstate pipelines: Columbia Gas Transmission, Texas Eastern Transmission and Dominion Transmission, Inc.
Condensate Handling Facilities
Our assets include condensate handling facilities in Majorsville, Pennsylvania (Anchor Systems) and Moundsville, West Virginia (Additional Systems) that provide condensate gathering, collection, separation and stabilization services. Each facility has nominal handling capacities of 2,500 Bbl/d. 
Our Relationship with CNX and CNX Gathering 
CNX, our sole Sponsor following the Transaction, is a Pittsburgh-based natural gas exploration and production company, focusing on the major shale formations of the Appalachian Basin, including the Marcellus Shale and Utica Shale. CNX deploys an organic growth strategy focused on developing its resource base. 
Following the Transaction, CNX owns a 100% interest in CNX Gathering, which owns our general partner as well as noncontrolling limited partner interests in two of our operating subsidiaries, which we refer to as our Growth and Additional Systems. Through our ownership of all of the outstanding general partner interests in our operating subsidiaries, the Partnership has voting control over, and the exclusive right to manage, the day-to-day operations, business and affairs of our midstream systems. CNX Gathering retained noncontrolling interests in our operating subsidiaries that are subject to our right of first offer. Following our purchase in November 2016 of the remaining 25% noncontrolling interest in the Anchor Systems, which include our most developed systems, we own a 100% controlling interest in the Anchor Systems. 
CNX Gathering continues to own 95% noncontrolling interests in each of the Growth Systems and the Additional Systems. CNX Gathering’s retention of ownership interests in the Growth Systems and the Additional Systems, combined with our right of first offer on those interests, may provide opportunities for us to grow our distributable cash flow through a series of acquisitions of these retained interests over time. However, CNX Gathering is under no obligation to offer to sell us any assets (including our right of first offer assets, unless and until it otherwise intends to dispose of such assets), and we are under no obligation to buy any assets from CNX Gathering. In addition, we do not know when or if CNX Gathering will make any offers to sell assets to us. 
Our Acreage Dedication and Right of First Offer Assets
As of January 3, 2018, the date of the Transaction, our existing dedicated acreage covered approximately 513,000 aggregate net acres, subject to the release provisions set forth in our gas gathering agreements. Our gathering agreement with CNX Gas, which was amended and restated on January 3, 2018, and our gathering agreement with Noble Energy, which became effective on December 1, 2016 and was assigned to HG Energy on June 28, 2017, provide that, in addition to our existing dedicated acreage, any future acreage covering the Marcellus Shale formation that is acquired by CNX Gas or HG Energy (or was acquired by Noble Energy prior to the effective date of the assignment to HG Energy,) in an area that covers over 7,700 square miles in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which we refer to as the “dedication area,” and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment automatically will be dedicated to us for natural gas midstream services, subject to the release provisions set forth in each agreement. 
In addition to the initial assets contributed to us in connection with our IPO, CNX Gathering has granted us a right of first offer (“ROFO”) to acquire (i) CNX Gathering’s retained interests in our Growth Systems and Additional Systems, (ii) CNX Gathering’s other ancillary midstream assets and (iii) any additional midstream assets that CNX Gathering develops, before 
10

CNX Gathering sells any of those interests to any third party during the ten-year period following the completion of our IPO (the “right of first offer period”). CNX Gathering is under no obligation to offer to sell us any assets (including our right of first offer assets, unless and until it otherwise intends to dispose of such assets), and we are under no obligation to buy any assets from CNX Gathering. In addition, we do not know when or if CNX Gathering will make any offers to sell assets to us. While we believe our rights of first offer are significant positive attributes, they may also be sources of conflicts of interest. CNX Gathering owns our general partner, and there is substantial overlap between the officers and directors of our general partner and the officers and directors of CNX. Please read “Risk Factors — Risks Inherent in an Investment in Us—We do not have any officers or employees and rely on officers of our general partner and employees of CNX.”
We have also been granted rights of first offer by each of CNX and HG Energy (as successor to Noble Energy’s obligations under the assigned gas gathering agreement) to provide midstream services on their respective ROFO acreage, which currently includes approximately 198,000 aggregate net acres of CNX Gas’ and HG Energy’s combined existing Marcellus Shale acreage that is not currently dedicated to us, along with any future acreage covering the Marcellus Shale formation that is acquired by CNX Gas or HG Energy, as applicable, in an area that covers over 18,300 square miles in West Virginia and Pennsylvania, which we refer to as the “ROFO area,” and that is not subject to a pre-existing third-party commitment. There are no restrictions under our gathering agreements (discussed below) on the ability of CNX Gas or HG Energy to transfer acreage in the ROFO area, and any such transfer of acreage in the ROFO area will not be subject to our right of first offer.  
Our Gathering Agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy
On January 3, 2018, we entered into a new 20-year, fixed-fee gathering agreement with CNX Gas that amended and restated the previous gathering agreement with CNX Gas in its entirety. Although the fees for services we provide in the Marcellus Shale for existing wells that were covered under the prior agreement remain unchanged in the new agreement, and are identical to the fees we charge to HG Energy (discussed below), the new gas gathering agreement with CNX Gas also dedicates an additional 63,000 of acreage in the Utica Shale in and around the McQuay area and Wadestown area and introduces the following gas gathering and compression rates:
•Gas Gathering:

◦ | McQuay area Utica - a fee of $0.225 per MMBtu; and


◦ | Wadestown Marcellus and Utica - a fee of $0.35 per MMBtu.


• | Compression:


◦ | For areas not benefitting from system expansion pursuant to the Second Amended and Restated gas gathering agreement, compression services are included in the base fees; and


◦ | In the McQuay and Wadestown areas, for wells turned in line beginning January 1, 2018 and beyond, we will receive additional fees of $0.065 per MMBtu for Tier 1 pressure services (maximum receipt point of pressure of 600 psi) and $0.130 per MMBtu for Tier 2 pressure services (maximum receipt point of pressure of 300 psi).

Our new gathering agreement with CNX Gas also commits CNX Gas to drill the following numbers of wells in the McQuay area, provided that if 125 wells have been drilled and completed in the Marcellus Shale, then the remainder of such planned wells must be drilled in the Utica Shale. To the extent the requisite amount of wells are not drilled by CNX Gas in a given period, we will be entitled to a deficiency payment per shortfall well as set out in the parenthetical below:

• | January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 - 30 wells (deficiency payment of $3.5 million per well)


• | January 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020 - 40 wells (deficiency payment of $3.5 million per well)


• | May 1, 2020 to April 30, 2021 - 40 wells (deficiency payment of $2.0 million per well)


• | May 1, 2021 to April 30, 2022 - 30 wells (deficiency payment of $2.0 million per well)

In the event that CNX Gas drills wells and completes a number of wells in excess of the number of wells required to be drilled and completed in such period, (i) the number of excess wells drilled and completed during such period will be applied to the minimum well requirement in the succeeding period or (ii) to the extent CNX Gas was required to make deficiency payments for shortfalls in the preceding period, CNX Gas may elect to cause the Partnership to pay a refund in an amount equal to (x) the number of excess wells drilled and completed during the period, multiplied by (y) the deficiency payment paid per well during the period in which the shortfall occurred.
On December 1, 2016, we entered into new fixed-fee gathering agreements with Noble Energy and CNX Gas that replaced the gathering agreements that had been in place since our IPO. Our gathering agreement with Noble Energy was assigned to HG Energy upon consummation of the Noble Energy Asset Sale effective June 28, 2017. The terms of the agreement remain unchanged following the assignment, except as it relates to HG Energy’s inability to, without the Partnership’s consent, release dedicated acreage in connection with a transfer of such acreage free of the dedication to us, and 
11

exercise other initial shipper rights provided under the gathering agreement. Under the gathering agreements with HG Energy and CNX Gas, we receive a fee based on the type and scope of the midstream services we provide, summarized as follows effective January 1, 2018:

• | For the services we provide with respect to natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation that does not require downstream processing, or dry gas, we receive a fee of $0.431 per MMBtu.


• | For the services we provide with respect to the natural gas that requires downstream processing, or wet gas, we receive:


◦ | a fee of $0.296 per MMBtu in the Moundsville area (Marshall County, West Virginia);


◦ | a fee of $0.296 per MMBtu in the Pittsburgh International Airport area; and


◦ | a fee of $0.593 per MMBtu for all other areas in the dedication area.


• | Our fees for condensate services were $5.38 per Bbl in the Majorsville area and $2.693 per Bbl in the Moundsville area.

Each of the foregoing fees paid by CNX Gas or HG Energy, as applicable, escalates by 2.5% on January 1 on an annual basis, through and including the final calendar year of the initial term. Commencing on January 1, 2035, and as of January 1 thereafter, each of the applicable fees will be adjusted pursuant to the percentage change in CPI-U, but such fees will never escalate or decrease by more than 3%. Notwithstanding the foregoing, from time to time, CNX Gas and HG Energy may request rate reductions under certain circumstances, which are reviewed by the board of directors of our general partner, with oversight, as our board of directors deems necessary, by our conflicts committee. No rate reduction arrangements are currently active.
We provide gas gathering services to CNX Gas and HG Energy for their dedicated natural gas in the Marcellus Shale on a first-priority basis and gather and/or stabilize and store all of CNX Gas’ and HG Energy’s dedicated condensate on a first-priority basis in the Moundsville, Majorsville and Pittsburgh International Airport areas, subject to certain exceptions described in our respective gathering agreements.
We receive ongoing updates from our customers regarding their drilling and development operations, which include detailed descriptions of the drilling plans, production details and well locations for periods that range from up to 24-48 months, as well as more general development plans that may extend as far as ten years. In addition, we regularly meet with CNX Gas and HG Energy to discuss our current plans to timely construct the necessary facilities to be able to provide midstream services to each of them on our dedicated acreage. In the event that we do not perform our obligations under a gathering agreement, CNX Gas or HG Energy, as applicable, will be entitled to certain rights and procedural remedies thereunder, including rate reductions, the temporary and/or permanent release from dedication discussed below and indemnification from us. 
In addition to the natural gas and condensate that is produced from the dedicated acreage, CNX Gas or HG Energy may each elect to dedicate non-Marcellus Shale properties located in the dedication area to us in which the shipper has an interest. If a shipper elects to dedicate any such property, then that shipper will propose a fee for the associated midstream services we would provide. So long as the proposed fee generates a rate of return consistent with the shipper’s existing gathering agreement on both incremental capital and operating expense associated with any expenditures necessary to gather gas from such property, any midstream services that we agree to provide will be on a second priority basis; second only to the first priority basis afforded to each of CNX Gas and HG Energy on their respective dedicated production. 
Our gathering agreements with HG Energy and, in the event that CNX ceases to control our general partner, CNX Gas provide that if we fail to timely complete the construction of the facilities necessary to provide midstream services as defined in our respective gathering agreements to a shipper’s dedicated acreage or have an uncured default of any of our material obligations that causes a delay or interruption in our services, we are subject to monetary penalties and/or the affected acreage may be permanently released from our dedication. Any permanent releases of CNX Gas’ or HG Energy’s acreage from our dedication could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions. 
Our gathering agreements also provide that in certain situations, such as an uncured default of any of our material obligations under the gathering agreement for more than 45 days but less than 90 days, our dedicated acreage can be temporarily released from our dedication. In addition, if we interrupt or curtail the receipt of CNX Gas’ or HG Energy’s gas under certain conditions for a period of five consecutive days or more than seven days within any consecutive two week period, then the applicable shipper can temporarily release from the dedication under its gathering agreement the affected volumes for a period lasting until the first day of the month following 30 days after our notice to the shipper that the interruption or curtailment has ended. Although there have not been any such instances to date, any temporary releases of acreage from our dedication could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make cash distributions.
12

Upon completion of their initial 20-year terms, each of our gathering agreements with CNX Gas and HG Energy will continue in effect from year to year until such time as the agreement is terminated by either us or the other party to such agreement on or before 180 days prior written notice.
Third-Party Services and Commitments
CNX Gas and HG Energy (as successor to Noble Energy’s obligations under the assigned gas gathering agreement) have entered into agreements that impact the scope of certain services we provide and the fees we charge under our gathering agreements. Although we provide all field gathering in the following areas, we do not provide compression, dehydration and condensate stabilization services with respect to (i) approximately 3,500 net acres in the Moundsville area (Marshall County, West Virginia) and (ii) approximately 9,000 net acres in the Pittsburgh International Airport area (Allegheny County, Pennsylvania). With respect to these areas, CNX Gas and HG Energy have contracted with third parties for the provision of such services. Accordingly, we charge our shippers a reduced fee for the services we provide with respect to all natural gas and condensate produced from these areas. 
Title to Our Properties
Our real property interests are acquired pursuant to easements, rights-of-way, permits, surface use agreements, deeds or licenses from landowners, lessors, easement holders, governmental authorities, or other parties controlling surface estate (collectively, “surface agreements”). These surface agreements allow us to use such land for our operations. Thus, the real estate interests on which our pipelines and facilities are located are held by us as grantee, and the party who owns or controls the surface lands, as grantor. We have acquired these surface agreements without any material challenge known to us relating to the title to the land upon which the assets are located, and we believe that we have satisfactory rights and interests to conduct our operations on such lands. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying title of any material surface agreements held by us or to our title to any material surface agreements, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our material surface agreements.
Some of the surface agreements that were transferred to us from CNX Gathering required the consent of the grantor or other holder of such rights. CNX Gathering obtained sufficient third-party consents and authorizations and provided notices required for the transfer of the assets necessary to enable us to operate our business in all material respects. With respect to any remaining consents, authorizations or notices that have not been obtained or provided, we have determined these will not have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business should the Partnership or CNX Gathering fail to obtain or provide such consents, authorizations or notices in a reasonable time frame.
Seasonality
Demand for natural gas generally decreases during the spring and fall months and increases during the summer and winter months. However, seasonal anomalies such as mild winters or mild summers sometimes lessen this fluctuation. In addition, certain natural gas users utilize natural gas storage facilities and purchase some of their anticipated winter requirements during the summer, which can also lessen seasonal demand fluctuations. These seasonal anomalies can increase demand for natural gas during the summer and winter months and decrease demand for natural gas during the spring and fall months. With respect to our completed midstream systems, we do not expect seasonal conditions to have a material impact on our throughput volumes. Severe or prolonged winters may, however, impact our ability to complete additional well connections or complete construction projects, which may impact the rate of our growth. In addition, severe winter weather may also impact or delay the execution of our customers’ drilling and development plans.
Competition
As a result of our acreage dedications from CNX Gas and HG Energy, we do not compete for the portion of the existing operations of CNX Gas’ and HG Energy’s upstream operations for which we currently provide midstream services, and other than with respect to acreage that may be released, subject to the terms of our gas gathering agreements, we will not compete for future portions of their upstream operations that are dedicated to us pursuant to our gathering agreements. Please read “Our Gathering Agreements and Rights of First Offer Assets.” Nonetheless, CNX Gas and HG Energy have entered into agreements with third parties for the provision of certain midstream services. Please read “Third-Party Services and Commitments.” In addition, we face competition in attracting third-party volumes to our midstream systems, and these third parties may develop their own midstream systems in lieu of employing our assets.
Regulation of Operations 
Regulation of pipeline gathering services may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services.
Natural Gas Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”) exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the NGA. Although FERC has not made any formal determinations with 
13

respect to any of our facilities we consider to be gathering facilities, we believe that the natural gas gathering pipelines meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish that a natural gas pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC NGA jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services, however, has been the subject of substantial litigation, and FERC determines whether facilities are gas gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of some our gas gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. If FERC were to consider the status of an individual facility and determine that the facility is not a gas gathering pipeline and the pipeline provides interstate service, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such facility would be subject to regulation by FERC under the NGA and/or the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”). Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or NGPA, this could result in the imposition of administrative and criminal remedies and civil penalties, as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the rate established by FERC.
State regulation of natural gas gathering facilities and intrastate transportation pipelines generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. States in which we operate may adopt ratable take and common purchaser statutes, which would require our gathering pipelines to take natural gas without undue discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another similarly situated source of supply. The regulations under these statutes may have the effect of imposing some restrictions on our ability as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to gather natural gas. States in which we operate may also adopt a complaint-based regulation of natural gas gathering activities, which allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to gathering access and rate discrimination. We cannot predict whether such regulation will be adopted and whether such a complaint will be filed against us in the future. Failure to comply with state regulations can result in the imposition of administrative, civil and criminal remedies. To date, our midstream systems have not been adversely affected by recent state regulations.
Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to more stringent application of state regulation of rates and services. Our gathering operations also may be or become subject to additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
Pipeline Safety Regulation
Some of our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”) pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, (“NGPSA”), as amended by the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992 (“PSA”), the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act of 1996 (“APSA”), the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (“PSIA”), the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (“PIPES Act”), and the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (the “2011 Pipeline Safety Act”). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of natural gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”).
PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to:

• | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;


• | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact a HCA;


• | improve data collection, integration and analysis;


• | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and


• | implement preventive and mitigating actions.

The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines, and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, among other things, increased the maximum civil penalty for pipeline safety violations and directed the Secretary of Transportation to promulgate rules or standards relating to expanded integrity management requirements, automatic or remote-controlled valve use, excess flow valve use, leak detection system installation and testing to confirm the material strength of pipe operating above 30% of specified minimum yield strength in HCAs. In 2017, PHMSA adopted new rules increasing the maximum administrative civil penalties for violation of the pipeline safety laws and regulations to $209,002

per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,909,022 for a related series of violations. In January 2017, in the final weeks of the Obama Administration, PHMSA released a pre-publication copy of its final hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations that would significantly extend the integrity management requirements to previously exempt pipelines and would impose additional obligations on hazardous liquid pipeline operators that are already subject to the integrity management requirements, including periodic integrity assessments and leak detecting for pipelines outside of HCAs, inspecting of pipelines after extreme weather events, expanded reporting, and more stringent integrity management repair and data collection requirements. PHMSA issued a separate regulatory proposal in July 2015 that would impose pipeline incident prevention and response measures on natural gas and hazardous liquid pipeline operators. PHMSA also issued an advisory bulletin providing guidance on the verification of records related to pipeline maximum allowable operating pressure.
The National Transportation Safety Board (“NTSB”) has recommended that PHMSA make a number of changes to its rules, including removing an exemption from most safety inspections for natural gas pipelines installed before 1970. In April 2016, PHMSA published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (“NPRM”) that would significantly modify existing regulations related to reporting, impact, design, construction, maintenance, operations and integrity management of gas transmission and gathering pipelines. The proposed rule addresses four congressional mandates and six recommendations by the NTSB to broaden the scope of safety coverage by adding new assessment and repair criteria for gas transmission pipelines, and by expanding these protocols to include pipelines not formerly regulated by the federal standards. This includes extending regulatory requirements to transmission and gathering pipelines of eight inches and greater in rural Class I areas. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. Also, compliance with the rule, as proposed, may prove challenging and costly for operators of older pipelines due to the difficulty of locating historic records. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, the ultimate impact of the rule on the Partnership remains uncertain until the rulemaking is finalized. PHMSA is expected to finalize its natural gas pipeline safety rule this year.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the Department of Transportation (“DOT”), to assume responsibility for enforcing federal intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include more stringent requirements for facility design and management in addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our natural gas pipelines have continuous inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements.
We have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity transported by our midstream systems, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs.
Regulation of Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Matters
General
Our natural gas gathering and compression activities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and worker health and safety. As an owner or operator of these facilities, we must comply with these laws and regulations at the federal, state and local levels. These laws and regulations can restrict or impact our business activities in many ways, such as:

• | requiring the installation of pollution-control equipment, imposing emission or discharge limits or otherwise restricting the way we operate;


• | limiting or prohibiting construction activities in areas, such as air quality non-attainment areas, wetlands, endangered species habitat and other protected areas;


• | delaying system modification or upgrades during review of permit applications and revisions;


• | requiring investigatory and remedial actions to mitigate discharges, releases or pollution conditions associated with our operations or attributable to former operations; and


• | enjoining operations deemed to be in non-compliance with permits issued pursuant to or regulatory requirements imposed by such environmental laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and/or criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties and natural resource damages. Certain environmental 
15

statutes impose strict or joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or solid wastes have been disposed or otherwise released. Moreover, neighboring landowners and other third parties may file common law claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances, hydrocarbons or other pollutants into the environment.
The trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. As with the midstream industry in general, complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations can increase our capital costs to construct, maintain and operate equipment and facilities. While these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income, we do not believe they will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we believe that the various activities in which we are presently engaged that are subject to environmental laws and regulations are not expected to materially interrupt or diminish our operational ability to gather natural gas. We cannot assure, however, that future events, such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions will not cause us to incur significant costs. Below is a discussion of the material environmental laws and regulations that relate to our business.
Hydraulic Fracturing Activities
Although we do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, substantially all CNX Gas and HG Energy natural gas production on our dedicated acreage is developed from unconventional sources, such as shales, that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the well completion process. Hydraulic fracturing is an essential and common practice in the oil and natural gas industry used to stimulate production of natural gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions, but the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) has asserted certain regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing and has moved forward with various regulatory actions, including the issuance of new regulations requiring green completions for hydraulically fractured wells, emission requirements for certain midstream equipment, and an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking comment on its intent to develop regulations under the Toxic Substances and Control Act to require companies to disclose information regarding the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing.
Scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing activities continues in other ways. In June 2015, the EPA issued its draft report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The draft report found no systemic negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing. In December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water. While the language was changed and included the possibility of negative impacts from hydraulic fracturing, it also included the guidance to industry and regulators on how the process can be performed safely. The Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) also published a final rule in March 2015 that regulates hydraulic fracturing on federal and Indian lands. The BLM rule was challenged in U.S. federal court, struck down, and subsequently appealed. A U.S. federal appeals court ruling in September 2017 dismissed the appeal and vacated the trial court’s decisions. The rule is currently subject to a July 2017 proposal by BLM to rescind it.
Some states, including states in which we operate have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, laws and/or regulations that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on natural gas drilling activities. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular, or otherwise seek to ban some or all of these activities.
We cannot predict whether any other legislation or regulations will be enacted and if so, what its provisions will be. Additional levels of regulation and/or permits required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal, state or local level could lead to delays, increased operating costs and prohibitions for producers who drill near our pipelines, reduce the volumes of natural gas available to move through our midstream systems and materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
Hazardous Waste
Our operations generate solid wastes, including some hazardous wastes, that are subject to the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), and comparable state laws, which impose requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous waste. RCRA currently exempts certain wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas, which we handle in the course of our operation, including produced water. However, these exploration and production wastes may still be regulated by the EPA or state agencies under RCRA’s less stringent non-hazardous solid waste provisions, state laws or other federal laws, and it is possible that certain exploration and production wastes now classified as non-hazardous could be classified as hazardous in the future.

Site Remediation
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, and comparable state laws impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons responsible for the release of hazardous substances into the environment. Under CERCLA, such classes of persons include the current and past owners or operators of sites where a hazardous substance was released, and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances at offsite locations, such as landfills. Although natural gas (and petroleum) is excluded from CERCLA’s definition of “hazardous substance,” in the course of our ordinary operations, we generate wastes that may be designated as hazardous substances. CERCLA authorizes the EPA, states, and, in some cases, third parties to take actions in response to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment and to seek to recover from the classes of responsible persons the costs they incur to address the release. Under CERCLA, we could be subject to strict joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up and restoring sites where hazardous substances have been released into the environment and for damages to natural resources, and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. In some states, including those in which we operate, site remediation of oil and natural gas facilities is regulated by state agencies with jurisdiction over oil and natural gas operations. The regulated releases and remediation activities, including the classes of persons that may be held responsible for releases of hazardous substances, may be broader than those regulated under CERCLA or RCRA.
We currently own, lease or operate, and may have in the past owned, leased or operated, properties that have been used for the gathering and compression of natural gas. Although we have used operating and disposal practices that were standard in the industry at the time, hydrocarbons or other wastes may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by us or on or under other locations where such substances have been taken for disposal. Such hydrocarbons or other wastes may have migrated to property adjacent to our owned and leased sites or the disposal sites. In addition, some of the properties may have been operated by third parties or by previous owners whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or wastes was not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes, including waste disposed of by prior owners or operators; remediate contaminated property, including groundwater contamination, whether from prior owners or operators or other historic activities or spills; or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We are not currently a potentially responsible party in any federal or state Superfund site remediation and there are no current, pending or anticipated Superfund response or remedial activities at our facilities.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act and comparable state laws, including those states in which we operate, impose various pre-construction and operational permit requirements, noise and emission limits, operational limits, and monitoring, reporting and record-keeping requirements on air emission sources, including on our compressor stations. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in monetary penalties, injunctions, conditions or restrictions on operations, and/or criminal enforcement actions. Such laws and regulations, for example, require permit limits to address the impacts of noise from our compression operations, and pre-construction permits for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities with the potential to emit air emissions above certain thresholds. Pre-construction permits generally require use of best available control technology, or BACT, to limit air pollutants. 
On August 16, 2012, the EPA published final revisions to the New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”) to regulate emissions of volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and sulfur dioxide from various oil and gas exploration, production, processing and transportation facilities. Additionally, revisions were made to the National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAPS”) to further regulate emissions from the oil and natural gas production sector and the transmission and storage of natural gas. Section 111 of the CAA authorized the EPA to develop technology-based standards which apply to specific categories of stationary sources. On September 18, 2015, the EPA proposed two new regulations. The first was to provide an update to the NSPS to create new standards for the regulation of methane and VOCs emission sources. This proposed rule includes requirements for new fugitive emission and leak detection and reporting requirements. The second was to propose the Source Determination Rule which would clarify the use of the term “adjacent” in determining Title V air permitting requirements as they apply to the oil and natural gas industry for major sources of air emissions. On June 3, 2016, the EPA finalized updates to the final NSPS, known as Subpart 0000a, that created new standards for the regulation of methane and VOC emission sources and published the final Source Determination Rule. On August 1, 2016 the updates to the NSPS were challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) by industry and state associations, and a request for administrative reconsideration was also filed. Additionally, 15 states have filed suit and asked the Court of Appeals to review the need for the changes. In April 2017, the EPA announced that it would review its June 2016 standards and initiate reconsideration proceedings to potentially revise or rescind portions of the methane rule. Subsequently, effective June 2, 2017, the EPA issued a 90-day stay of certain requirements under the rule, but such stay was vacated by a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit on July 3, 2017. On August 10, 2017, the D.C. Circuit rejected petitions for an en banc review of its July 3, 2017 
17

ruling. In the interim, on July 16, 2017, the EPA issued a proposed rule that would stay Subpart OOOOa for two years, but such rule is not yet final, is subject to public notice and comment, and may be subject to legal challenges. Legal uncertainty therefore exists at this time with respect to the future implementation of EPA’s methane rule.
In October 2015, the EPA lowered the primary and secondary National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone. This rule has resulted in additional areas being in non-attainment with federal standards, which could result in us being required to install additional control equipment and restrict operations. Several federal NSPS and NESHAP, and analogous state law requirements, also apply to our facilities and operations. These applicable federal and state standards impose emission limits and operations limits as well as detailed testing, record keeping and reporting requirements on the facilities subject to these regulations.
We may incur capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with complying with existing and recently proposed rules, or with obtaining or maintaining operating or preconstruction permits and complying with federal, state and local regulations related to air emissions (including air emission reporting requirements). However, we do not believe that such requirements will have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
Climate Change
The EPA has adopted regulations under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act that establish Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”), pre-construction permits, and Title V operating permits for greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions from certain large stationary sources. Under these regulations, facilities required to obtain PSD permits must meet BACT standards for their GHG emissions established by the states or, in some cases, by the EPA on a case-by-case basis. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including, among others, certain onshore oil and natural gas processing and fractionating facilities, which was recently amended to include gathering and boosting systems and blowdowns of natural gas transmission pipelines.
Additionally, while Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, the prospect for adoption of significant legislation at the federal level to reduce GHG emissions is perceived to be low at this time. In the absence of such federal climate legislation, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations that limit emissions of GHGs could adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas that exploration and production operators produce, some of whom are our customers, which could thereby reduce demand for our midstream services. In December 2015, the United National Climate Change Conference was held and an agreement was reached between the countries participating in the conference, including the United States, to limit global warming to less than two degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. This agreement, known as the Paris Agreement, calls for zero net anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions to be reached during the second half of the 21st century. On September 3, 2016, the United States formally joined the Paris Agreement by submitting a plan of compliance to the United Nations, which could have an adverse effect on our business. However, on June 1, 2017, President Trump announced that the United States plans to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations either to reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or to establish a new framework agreement. The Paris Agreement provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016, which would result in an effective exit date of November 2020.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act, or the Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including sediment, and spills and releases of oil, brine and other substances into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into jurisdictional waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, or a delegated state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and/or criminal penalties for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
In May 2015, the EPA released a final rule outlining its position on the federal jurisdictional reach over “waters of the United States” (the “WotUS Rule”). Nationwide implementation of the WotUS Rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in October 2015, as that appellate court and several other courts pondered lawsuits opposing the rule. In January 2017, the U.S. Supreme Court accepted review of the rule to determine whether jurisdiction to hear challenges to the rule rests with the federal district or federal appellate courts. In February 2017, President Trump issued an executive order directing the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to review and, consistent with applicable law initiate a rulemaking to rescind or revise the rule. The EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers published a notice of intent to review and rescind or revise the WotUS Rule in May 2017. In June 2017, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a rule that would initiate the first step in a two-step process intended to review and revise the definition of “waters of the United States” consistent with President Trump’s executive order. Under the proposal, the first step would be to rescind the WotUS Rule and put back into effect the narrower language defining “waters of the United States” under the Clean Water Act 
18

that existed prior to the rule. The second step would be a notice-and-comment rulemaking in which the agencies will conduct a substantive reevaluation of the definition of “waters of the United States” in accordance with the executive order. At this time, it is unclear what impact these actions will have on the implementation of the WotUS Rule.
The primary federal law related specifically to oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act (“OPA”), which amends and augments the oil spill provisions of the Clean Water Act and imposes certain duties and liabilities on certain “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills, or threatened spills, in waters of the United States or adjoining shorelines. The OPA applies joint and several liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Although defenses exist, they are limited. As such, a violation of the OPA has the potential to adversely affect our operations.
Endangered Species
The Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state laws protect species threatened with extinction restricting activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Some of our pipelines are located in areas that are or may be designated as protected habitats for endangered or threatened species, including the Northern Long-Eared and Indiana bats, which has a seasonal impact on our construction activities and operations. However, based on species that have been identified and the current application of endangered species laws and regulations, we do not believe that there are any additional species protected under the ESA or state laws that would materially and adversely affect our ability to operate. The future listing of previously unprotected species in areas where we conduct or may conduct operations, or the designation of critical habitat in these areas, could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our operating activities, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 
Occupational Safety and Health Act
We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of the health and safety of employees. In addition, OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. Certain of our operations are also subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive material.
Employees
The officers of our general partner manage our operations and activities. All of the employees required to conduct and support our operations, including our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer, are employed by CNX and are subject to the operational services agreement and omnibus agreement between us, our general partner and CNX. As of December 31, 2017, CNX employed approximately 100 people that provide direct support to our operations pursuant to the operational services agreement and omnibus agreement.
Offices
Our principal offices are located at CNX Center, 1000 CONSOL Energy Drive, Canonsburg, Pennsylvania 15317. 
Insurance
We maintain insurance policies with insurers in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. We cannot, however, assure that this insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal and property damage or that these levels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices.
Financial Information about Segments 
Please read Part II. Item 8. Note 13–Segment Information, for financial information by business segment including, but not limited to, gathering revenue–related party, net income (loss), and total assets, which information is incorporated herein by reference.
Legal Proceedings
Our operations are subject to a variety of risks and disputes normally incident to our business. As a result, we may, at any given time, be a defendant in various legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. However, we are not currently subject to any material litigation.
