Item 1. Business
 
With over 30 years of operating experience, we believe, based on our industry experience, that we are a leading operator of extreme value retail stores in the southwestern United States.  As of January 27, 2017, we operated 390 stores located in the states of California (283 stores), Texas (48 stores), Arizona (38 stores) and Nevada (21 stores).  Our stores offer everyday consumable products and other household items as well as seasonal items that are primarily priced at 99.99¢ or less.  We carry a wide assortment of regularly available products as well as a broad variety of first-quality closeout merchandise.  In addition, we carry domestic and imported fresh produce, deli, dairy and frozen and refrigerated food products, which we believe are generally of greater value than what consumers can find elsewhere.  We believe that our differentiated merchandise mix, combined with outstanding value, enables us to appeal to a broad consumer demographic, increases our overall customer traffic and frequency of customer visits, as well as strengthens our customer loyalty.  We believe that our stores are significantly larger than those of other U.S. publicly reporting dollar store chains, which enables us to offer a wider assortment of merchandise and provide our customers with a better shopping experience.
 
As of January 27, 2017, on a trailing 52-week period, our stores open for the full year averaged net sales of $5.2 million per store and $319 per estimated saleable square foot, which we believe, based on our industry experience, is the highest among U.S. publicly reporting dollar store chains.  We opened five stores in California during fiscal 2017.  We closed six underperforming stores in fiscal 2017 upon expiration of their leases, including five in California and one in Texas. In fiscal 2018, we currently intend to open three stores, all of which are expected to be opened in our existing markets.
 
We also sell merchandise through our Bargain Wholesale division to retailers, distributors and exporters.  The Bargain Wholesale division complements our retail operations by exposing us to a broader selection of opportunistic buys and generating additional sales with relatively small incremental operating expenses.  Bargain Wholesale represented 1.9% of our total sales in fiscal 2017.
 
Merger
 
On January 13, 2012, the Company was acquired through a merger (the Merger) with a subsidiary of Parent with the Company surviving.  In connection with the Merger, the Company became a subsidiary of Parent, which is controlled by affiliates of Ares Management, L.P. (Ares) and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) (together with Ares, the Sponsors).  As a result of the Merger, the Company common stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and we ceased to be a publicly held and traded equity company.
 
The total cash merger consideration paid was approximately $1.6 billion. In connection with the Merger, the Company obtained Credit Facilities (as defined below) provided by a syndicate of lenders arranged by Royal Bank of Canada as administrative agent, as well as other agents and lenders that are parties to the agreements governing these Credit Facilities.  The Credit Facilities include (a) first lien based revolving credit facility (as amended, the ABL Facility), and (b) first lien term loan facility (as amended, the First Lien Term Loan Facility and together with the ABL Facility, the Credit Facilities).  The Company also issued $250 million 11% senior unsecured notes due 2019 (the Senior Notes).  See Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsLiquidity and Capital Resources, for more information about our indebtedness.
 
Conversion to LLC
 
On October 18, 2013, 99¢ Only Stores converted (the Conversion) from a California corporation to a California limited liability company, 99 Cents Only Stores LLC (99 LLC), that is managed by its sole member, Parent.  In connection with the Conversion, each outstanding share of Class A common stock of 99¢ Only Stores, par value $0.01 per share, was converted into one membership unit of 99 LLC, and each outstanding share of Class B common stock of 99¢ Only Stores, par value $0.01 per share, was cancelled and forfeited.  Pursuant to the laws of the State of California, all rights and property of 99¢ Only Stores were vested in 99 LLC and all debts, liabilities and obligations of 99¢ Only Stores continued as debts, liabilities and obligations of 99 LLC.  99 LLC has elected to be treated as a disregarded entity for United States federal income tax purposes.  The Conversion did not have any effect on deferred tax assets or liabilities, and 99 LLC will continue to use the liability method of accounting for income taxes.  99 LLC computes its taxes on a separate return basis, but 99 LLC and Parent will continue to file consolidated or combined income tax returns with its subsidiaries in all jurisdictions.  Parent is a holding company with no active business or operations and has no holdings in any business other than 99 LLC.

Our Competitive Strengths
 
Differentiated Retail Concept
 
We believe our stores offer consumers an extreme value shopping experience that is unique in our industry due to:
 
·                  Our current average store size of approximately 16,000 saleable square feet, which we believe are significantly larger than stores of other U.S. publicly reporting dollar store chains, enabling us to carry a wide assortment of consumable, general merchandise and seasonal products in a clean, attractive and comfortable shopping environment;
 
·                  Our large selection of food and grocery items, which is approximately 57% of gross sales, and includes many of the fresh produce, deli, dairy and refrigerated and frozen food items which we believe generally provide greater value than consumers can find elsewhere.  We believe our extensive food and grocery offerings drive recurring traffic from customers who rely on us for their weekly household needs; and
 
·                  Our wide assortment of closeout merchandise, which helps create an atmosphere of treasure-hunt excitement within our stores.  We believe that our wide assortment of closeout merchandise is a competitive advantage as many of our competitors lack the vendor relationships, management expertise or logistical capabilities to handle as large a percentage of sales as we do in closeout merchandise.
 
We believe, based on our industry experience, that these competitive strengths enable us to have the most productive stores among U.S. publicly reporting dollar store chains when ranked by sales per store and average sales per square foot.
 
Attractive Industry Fundamentals
 
The U.S. dollar store industry is large and growing, and we believe benefits from a number of attractive industry fundamentals which will continue to support our growth, including:
 
·                  Historical and projected growth in dollar store revenues driven by the addition of new dollar stores and the increasing acceptance of dollar stores among consumers;
 
·                  Same store sales growth among U.S. publicly reporting dollar store chains, which are outperforming many other retail channels, particularly U.S. publicly reporting traditional grocery stores;
 
·                  Within the dollar store industry, the opportunity for larger chains, including 99 Cents, to grow faster than the overall industry, the balance of which we believe consists primarily of independent store operators; and
 
·                  Strong historical performance by dollar stores throughout economic cycles.
 
We believe that these attractive industry fundamentals, when combined with the large population size and favorable income and demographic attributes within our existing markets, represent growth opportunities for 99 Cents.
 
Attractive Store Footprint
 
We have over 30 years of experience operating our stores.  We currently operate a large network of extreme value retail stores in California and have a strong presence in three other southwestern states, Texas, Nevada and Arizona.  Our stores are typically clustered in and around densely populated areas.  We believe that many of our stores are more convenient than traditional big box retailers that typically occupy larger buildings located in less urban areas as a result of their store size requirements.  We believe that the density of our store geographic coverage is a competitive advantage and would be difficult to replicate.
 
We believe that our southwestern geographic markets have attractive attributes that support our business model.  Our markets generally have large, growing and ethnically diverse populations.  Many of the markets we serve have high proportions of low-income consumers, as well as nearby middle and upper middle income consumers, who we believe are increasingly shopping dollar stores.
 
Strong Vendor Relationships and Sourcing Expertise Both Domestically and Globally
 
We believe that our sourcing expertise and our long-standing, mutually beneficial vendor relationships are competitive advantages. Many of our vendors have been supplying products to us for over 25 years.  We are a trusted partner and a preferred buyer to our vendors, many of whom we believe contact us first when they are selling closeout inventory.  We believe we are a preferred buyer due to our ability to, among other things:
 
·                  Make immediate buying decisions;
 
·                  Acquire large volumes of inventory and take possession of goods immediately;
 
5




·                  Pay cash or accept abbreviated credit terms; and
 
·                  Purchase goods that have a shorter than normal shelf life or are off-season or near the end of a selling season.
 
We believe our vendor relationships are also strengthened by our ability to minimize channel conflict for the manufacturer as well as our ability to quickly sell products through well-maintained, attractively merchandised stores.
 
Strong Historical Financial Performance and Compelling Store Unit Economics
 
Our store base has historically demonstrated strong and consistent sales and profitability growth potential as well as compelling unit economics. Our stores have posted positive same-stores sales growth in nine of the past ten years with the same-store sales growth of 2.1% in fiscal 2017. Our newly opened stores generally ramp up quickly and typically reach near full volumes within the first 12 to 24 months.
 
Historically, our stores have demonstrated relatively consistent profitability levels as a percentage of sales. Our stores have a low cost operating model with attractive margins, low maintenance capital expenditures and low ongoing working capital needs. Furthermore, despite headwinds in selling, general and administrative expenses, nearly all stores were 4-wall cash flow positive in fiscal 2017.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
We are focused on three key strategies designed to profitably scale our business while continuing to meet the needs of our customers.
 
Enhancing the Customer Shopping Experience
 
We aim to achieve a sustainable increase in sales by enhancing the customer shopping experience, which we believe will both increase basket size with our current customers and attract new customers, including those that historically have not shopped at extreme value retailers. Key elements of the strategy include:
 
Focus on fresh
 
We believe our fresh food offerings, including produce, deli and dairy products primarily priced at 99.99¢, represent a significant point of differentiation relative to our national dollar store and discount peers and are a key driver of sales growth. Customer research studies that were recently conducted by leading market research firms show that a significant portion of our customers view us as their first or primary destination when shopping for fresh perishable items. Despite the continuing food price deflation in fiscal 2017, we achieved meaningful growth of our fresh offerings through a combination of improved quality and in-stock levels on key SKUs. This was due in part to our successful partnerships with third-party produce providers, as well as improved product availability, relative to fiscal 2016, at our traditional price point of 99.99¢. We believe the overall strength in our fresh food offerings was a key driver of positive customer traffic in fiscal 2017. We are currently testing and intend to make additional targeted investments in our fresh food strategy which includes procurement, supply chain, in-store equipment and training to further improve quality and broaden our merchandise assortment. We are also exploring the possibility of expanding our partnerships with third-party produce providers to broaden assortment and cover additional store locations.

Provide a fun, exciting treasure hunt experience
 
We believe another important component of our differentiated shopping experience is our ability to create a fun and exciting treasure hunt experience that offers a wow factor for our customers. This is accomplished through two primary channels. First, our assortment has consistently included a significant portion of closeout merchandise, with a focus on national branded consumer packaged goods and high-value merchandise priced significantly below the typical retail prices of our peers in the discount retail industry. Independent customer research suggests that a sizable portion of our shoppers specifically visit our stores to hunt for these limited-time values, which in turn drives frequency, basket size and customer loyalty. Second, we have accelerated initiatives to broaden our general merchandise assortment priced above $1 as well as our seasonal assortment. Our over $1 general merchandise assortment is primarily comprised of high-value and high-recognition products for everyday household and recreational use, nearly always priced significantly below the everyday retail price of identical or comparable merchandise at peers in the discount retail industry. Our seasonal assortment includes a broad selection of popular and high-value décor, wearables and packaging materials, as well as consumables developed specifically for each season and primarily priced at $1. We believe the improvements in these assortments positively contributed towards our average ticket growth in fiscal 2017. We also believe that these assortments, and the fun and exciting shopping experience that they create on a consistent basis, will, over time, allow us to further improve our customer loyalty as well as acquire new customers.
 
Comprehensive market refresh program
 
Beginning in fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we launched a comprehensive refresh program in one of our key markets, the city of San Diego, in order to accelerate our efforts to enhance the customer shopping experience. Key aspects of our market refresh program include:
 
1.              Upgrading our store facilities and improving cleanliness;
 2.              Broadening our merchandise assortment, in-stock and fresh grocery offerings;
 3.              Elevating our customer service; and
 4.              Implementing targeted marketing campaigns to attract and retain new customers.
 
Since the completion of the San Diego refresh program in the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we have received positive customer feedback on the overall improvements and achieved strong sales momentum. The overall sales growth of San Diego has significantly exceeded our chain average.
 
We believe a systematic and comprehensive refresh program conducted on a market-by-market basis, when completed expeditiously and in a cost-effective manner, can meaningfully improve the operating performance of each market and generate positive returns on the initial investment. Accordingly, in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we commenced our second refresh program in our Phoenix market. We expect to complete the Phoenix refresh program by early fiscal 2018. We intend to continue assessing the effectiveness of our market refresh programs in fiscal 2018 and evaluate additional potential target markets in a prudent and systematic fashion.
 
Improving Operational Efficiency and Effectiveness
 
We believe a number of opportunities exist to simplify and streamline our operational processes that will enable us to expand margins and improve profitability.  In particular, we are focused on:
 
Reducing shrink and managing scrap
 
We intend to significantly reduce our current elevated levels of shrink and scrap through initiatives designed to address all potential areas of losses, including:
 
1.              Effectively managing inventory allocation and sell-through of perishables items and establishing cold-chain management practices to minimize excess spoilage;
 2.              Maintaining supply chain integrity, such as pallet picking and shipping accuracy;
 3.              Improving execution of in-store merchandise receipts and product flow to ensure quality of store inventory and mitigate losses due to poor handling; and
 4.              Implementing preemptive loss prevention efforts to identify and eliminate theft.
 
In fiscal 2017, we achieved a meaningful reduction in our shrink and scrap expenses relative to fiscal 2016. We believe significant opportunities remain to further reduce our shrink and scrap expenses in fiscal 2018.
 
7




Improving merchandise flow
 
We have identified and are pursuing the following three key opportunities to simplify and streamline the flow of merchandise across our entire supply chain:
 
1.              Apply greater discipline to buying by actively managing and optimizing on-hand levels of both re-orderable and closeout merchandise, to reduce warehouse and in-store inventories, improve merchandise sell-through and reduce shrink;
 2.              Reduce our reliance on a manual ordering process by implementing an automated merchandise ordering and replenishment system to ensure that the right product is replenished to the right store in the right quantities at the right time; and
 3.              Improve our distribution efficiencies by ensuring on-time deliveries to our warehouses and our stores, in order to minimize disruptions to the merchandise flow.
 
These initiatives are designed to achieve lower overall inventory levels and reduce our handling costs and warehousing space requirements, which we expect will contribute to reductions in working capital investments and improved operating margins.  We also believe improving our merchandise flow will position us to achieve higher sales through a more robust allocations process, which will result in an improved in-stock position and fewer missed sales opportunities.
 
In fiscal 2017, improvements in our merchandise flow and clearance of excess inventory allowed us to significantly reduce our inventory levels, which in turn allowed us to rationalize multiple warehouse locations. The inventory reduction was accomplished even as we improved our overall in-stock levels of key, high-volume SKUs and positive same-store sales growth.  Furthermore, we have made and plan to make additional investments in systems and infrastructure to support these merchandising flow improvements.
 
In addition, we believe opportunities remain to further improve the overall merchandise flow in our Texas market, which will be an area of emphasis in fiscal 2018 and beyond.  We expect to accomplish this through a combination of improved inbound logistics to our Katy distribution center as well as refining the regional assortment through localized buying of key re-orderable and closeout merchandise.  We believe these improvements will drive customer traffic and increase margins, which will allow us to achieve profitable growth in the Texas market.
 
Supporting a culture of safety
 
We remain committed to promoting a safe and friendly operating environment and are building a culture of safety by:
 
1.              Engaging and empowering employees daily to develop a safe operating environment, through recurring huddles, hands-on training and constant communication to reinforce our safety message and instill accountability;
 2.              Expanding our comprehensive reporting and analytics to support problem identification and provide real-time visibility;
 3.              Investing in on-site treatment programs for better workplace care in the event of injuries; and
 4.              Consistently evaluating and adopting best practices in safety culture and safety initiatives through a joint corporate safety steering committee, which oversees the implementation of safety improvement measures.
 
We have made substantial progress in building a culture of safety in fiscal 2017, including an over 20% year-over-year reduction in total claims. The reduction in claims is one of the key drivers of a material reduction of our outstanding workers compensation liability reserve at the end of fiscal 2017.
 
In addition, we conduct regular evaluations of our real estate portfolio in the ordinary course of business. In fiscal 2017, as a part of the evaluation process, we closed six stores, including one in Texas and five in California. We believe a substantial portion of the volume will be absorbed into other nearby 99¢ Only stores, thereby minimizing the impact on overall sales. The relocation and closures occurred at stores with expiring leases, and did not result in any material termination charges. We may opportunistically close or relocate additional stores in the future to improve overall profitability.
 
Pursuing New Store Growth
 
We opened five new stores during fiscal 2017 and we currently intend to open three new stores in fiscal 2018.  We plan to continue to pursue a disciplined store growth plan in our existing markets over the near term, and will accelerate our store growth in a manageable fashion over the longer term with continued improvement of cash flow and capital availability.  We believe that this will strengthen our competitive advantage in our key geographic regions and enable us to take advantage of economies of scale in distribution, store logistics and marketing.
Retail Operations
 
Our stores offer customers a wide assortment of regularly available consumer goods, as well as a broad variety of quality, closeout merchandise. Merchandise sold in our 99¢ Only stores is priced primarily at or below 99.99¢ per item.

Merchandising.  All of our stores offer a broad variety of first-quality, name-brand and other closeout merchandise as well as a wide assortment of regularly available consumer goods, including a significant quantity of fresh and perishable food.  We also carry private-label consumer products made for us.  We believe that the success of our 99¢ Only stores concept arises in part from the value inherent in pricing consumable items primarily at 99.99¢ or less per item, many of which are name-brands, which generally provide greater value than consumers can find elsewhere. In addition, we offer selected items priced above 99.99¢ and we believe that we have additional opportunities to expand our selection of these items.
 
A significant amount of our gross sales are from products available for reorder, including many branded consumable items. The mix and the specific brands of merchandise frequently changes, depending primarily upon the availability of closeout merchandise at suitable prices.  A significant amount of our sales are from closeout merchandise, which we believe represents a significantly larger share of closeout merchandise than those of other U.S. publicly reporting dollars stores chains, some of whom carry few or no closeouts.  We currently expect to be able to obtain sufficient name-brand closeouts, as well as re-orderable merchandise, at attractive prices.  We believe that the frequent changes in specific name-brands and products found in our stores encourage impulse and larger volume purchases, result in customers shopping more frequently, and help to create a sense of urgency, fun and treasure hunt excitement.

We believe that we differentiate ourselves from traditional dollar stores by offering a wider assortment of food and grocery items, including frozen, dairy, deli and produce, which collectively account for approximately 57% of our revenue.  Substantially all of our stores have free-standing fresh and refrigerated produce displays as well as built-in refrigerated and frozen food wall units.  We believe that many of our customers shop at our stores weekly for their groceries and frequently shop 99¢ Only stores first before supplementing these purchases at other food stores.
 
Over the past several years, we have expanded our assortment of seasonal and general merchandise. Consistent with our overall merchandising strategy, our seasonal and general merchandise categories offer high-value and high-recognition products, typically for special occasions, recreational and everyday household use. We believe the improved assortment has allowed us a capture a greater portion of our customers overall share of wallet.
 
Substantially all of our business is transacted in U.S. dollars and, accordingly, foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not historically had a significant impact on us.
 
Our major product categories at 99¢ Only stores consist of:
 
·                  Fresh merchandise, which includes deli, bakery, dairy, produce and frozen.
 ·                  Grocery merchandise, which includes beverages, candies, cookies, grocery-breakfast, grocery-canned and other snacks.
 ·                  Consumables products, which include baby products, food storage, health & beauty, household cleaning, pet supplies, picnic supplies and soft lines.
 ·                  General merchandise and seasonal, which includes bath & bedding, electronics, hardware & audio, home décor, kitchenware, party supplies, plastics, seasonal, stationery and toys & recreation.
 
Our retail sales by major product category for fiscal 2017, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2015 are set forth below:
 

 | Year Ended | | Year Ended | | Year Ended | 
-----------------------------------+--------------------+---+--------------------+---+--------------------+--
 | January 27, 2017 | | January 29, 2016 | | January 30, 2015 | 
Product Category: | | | | | | 
Fresh | 26 | % | 25 | % | 22 | %
Grocery | 32 | % | 32 | % | 35 | %
Consumables | 22 | % | 22 | % | 23 | %
General merchandise and seasonal | 19 | % | 20 | % | 19 | %
Other | 1 | % | 1 | % | 1 | %
 | 100 | % | 100 | % | 100 | %

 
We target value-conscious consumers from a wide range of socio-economic backgrounds with diverse demographic characteristics.  Purchases are by cash, credit card, debit card or EBT (electronic benefit transfers).  Our stores currently do not accept checks or manufacturers coupons.  Our stores operating hours are designed to meet the needs of families.
 
Store Size, Layout and Locations.  We strive to provide stores that are attractively merchandised, brightly lit, clean, well-maintained, destination locations.  Our stores are typically clustered around densely populated areas where it is convenient for our customers to do their weekly household shopping.  The interior of each store is designed to reflect a generally uniform format, featuring consistent merchandise displays, bright lighting, customized check-out counters and a distinctive color scheme on its interior and exterior signage.
Marketing and Advertising.  Our marketing strategy emphasizes a customer first approach through consumer research and data gathering. We have a strategic focus on communicating the magic of closeouts, our broad assortment, seasonal offering and fresh produce to drive incremental traffic and capture additional share of wallet. Our marketing includes multi-media campaigns that include print media, digital & social media, television and billboards as well as our store grand opening program. For example, we have recently launched a new marketing campaign on multiple media platforms titled Do the 99!, which uses specially designed graphics and visuals to highlight our assortment for a variety of everyday and special occasions. We are also continuously evaluating new and innovative methods to attract customers to our stores.

Purchasing
 
A primary component of our business model is our ability to identify and take advantage of opportunities to purchase merchandise with high customer appeal at prices lower than regular wholesale.  We purchase most merchandise directly from the manufacturer.  Other sources of merchandise include wholesalers, manufacturers representatives, importers, barter companies, auctions, professional finders and other retailers, varying on the season and closeout activity.
 
We continuously seek out buying opportunities from both our existing vendors and new sources.  No single vendor accounted for more than 5% of our total purchases in fiscal 2017.  During fiscal 2017, we purchased merchandise from more than 999 vendors, many of which have been supplying us product for over 25 years.
 
A significant portion of the merchandise purchased by us in fiscal 2017 was closeout merchandise.  We have developed strong relationships with many vendors and distributors who recognize that our merchandise can be moved quickly through our retail and wholesale distribution channels.  Our buyers continuously search for closeout opportunities.
 
Our experience and expertise in buying merchandise has enabled us to develop relationships with many manufacturers that often offer some or all of their closeout merchandise to us prior to attempting to sell it through other channels.  The key elements to these vendor relationships include our (i) ability to make immediate buying decisions; (ii) experienced buying staff; (iii) willingness to take on large volume purchases and take possession of merchandise immediately; (iv) ability to pay cash or accept abbreviated credit terms; and (v) willingness to purchase goods close to a target season or out of season.  We believe our relationships with our vendors are further enhanced by our ability to minimize channel conflict for a manufacturer.
 
Our strong relationships with many manufacturers and distributors, along with our ability to purchase in large volumes, also enable us to purchase re-orderable name-brand goods at prices that we believe are below general wholesale prices.
 
We utilize and develop private label consumer products to broaden the assortment of merchandise that is consistently available and to maintain attractive margins.  We also import merchandise such as kitchen items, housewares, toys, seasonal products, party, pet-care and hardware.
 
Warehousing and Distribution
 
An important aspect of our purchasing strategy involves our ability to warehouse and distribute merchandise quickly and with flexibility.  Our warehousing and distribution facilities are strategically located next to the Long Beach, California and Los Angeles, California port systems, the rail yards in the City of Commerce and the major California interstate arteries.  This enables quick turnaround of time-sensitive products as well as provides long-term warehousing capabilities for one-time closeout purchases and seasonal or holiday items.  Our distribution center in the Houston area has both dry and cold storage capacity, and services our Texas operations.
 
We utilize both our private fleet and owner operators for our store deliveries / backhauls and vendor pick-ups in Southern California.  We have contracted with a dedicated carrier to service our Northern California, Arizona and Nevada stores.  We use two dedicated operators to service our Texas stores.
 
Our primary distribution practice is to have the majority of the merchandise delivered from our vendors to our warehouses and then shipped to our store locations.  We do, however, occasionally utilize direct store deliveries for select product categories.
 
In fiscal 2017, we established partnerships with multiple third-party produce distributors, who currently serve the majority of our store network and deliver a select number of high-volume fresh produce SKUs. We may expand our third-party produce distribution relationships in the future; however, retaining in-house expertise on cold chain distribution remains an integral part of our overall supply chain strategy.
 
Additional information pertaining to warehouse and distribution facilities is described under Item 2, Properties.
 
Information Systems
 
We currently operate all of our master data, price management, point-of-sale, merchandising, distribution center inventory, accounting and reporting systems on SAP.  In fiscal 2017, we completed the migration of our human resources and payroll data processing to Ceridian DayForce HCM.  We also operate several proprietary supply chain systems that are tightly coupled with HighJumps warehouse management solutions.  The proprietary systems include an IBM UNIX-based purchase order and inventory control system that supports store back office personal computer system the Bargain Wholesale business.

We are in the process of extending our SAP systems to support store inventory and perpetual management function that we plan to complete by the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018.  During fiscal 2017, we also integrated our proprietary store ordering and merchandising platform with an automated forecasting and replenishment package solution.
 
Competition
 
We face competition in both the acquisition of inventory and the sale of merchandise from other discount stores, single-price-point merchandisers, mass merchandisers, food markets, drug chains, club stores, wholesalers, and other retailers.  Industry competition for acquiring closeout merchandise also includes a large number of retail and wholesale companies and individuals.  In some instances, these competitors are also customers of our Bargain Wholesale division.  There is increasing competition with other wholesalers and retailers, including other extreme value retailers, for the purchase of quality closeout merchandise. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources and buying power than us.  Our ability to compete will depend on many factors, including the success of our purchase and resale of such merchandise at lower prices than our competitors.  In addition, we may face intense competition in the future from new entrants in the extreme value retail industry that could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.
 
We believe that we are able to compete effectively against other dollar stores as a result of our differentiated retail format, the larger size and more convenient location of our stores, our economies of scale in our operations and more than three decades of experience operating in the industry.  For products where we compete with traditional grocery stores, such as fresh produce, deli, dairy and frozen food items, we believe that we offer greater value than our grocery competitors and our stores are often more convenient. For products where we compete with warehouse clubs and mass merchandisers, we believe we compete effectively on the basis of greater value, no membership fees, more convenient store locations and smaller, easier to navigate stores.
 
We believe we do not currently face significant competition from e-commerce retailers. We believe our low price points, significant mix of fresh food and perishables and relatively low e-commerce adoption rates of our core shoppers serve as barriers against direct competition with major e-commerce retailers.
 
Employees
 
As of January 27, 2017, we had approximately 17,200 employees.  None of our employees are party to a collective bargaining agreement and none are represented by a labor union.
Trademarks
 
99¢ Only Stores, Bargain Wholesale and multiple other product trademarks are listed on the United States Patent and Trademark Office Principal Register.  We believe that our trademarks are an important but not critical element of our merchandising strategy.  We routinely undertake enforcement efforts against certain parties whom we believe are infringing upon our 99¢ family of marks and our other intellectual property rights, although we believe that simultaneous litigation against all persons everywhere whom we believe to be infringing upon these marks is not feasible.
Seasonality
 
For information regarding the seasonality of our business, see Item 7, Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsSeasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations, which is incorporated by reference in this Item 1.
Environmental Matters
 
In the ordinary course of business, we handle or dispose of commonplace household products that are classified as hazardous materials under various environmental laws and regulations.  Under various federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations, current or previous owners or occupants of property may face liability associated with hazardous substances.  These laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault. In the future we may be required to incur substantial costs for preventive or remedial measures associated with hazardous materials.  We have several storage tanks at our distribution and warehouse facilities, including: an aboveground and underground diesel storage tank at one of our City of Commerce, California distribution centers, a compressed natural gas tank at one of our City of Commerce, California distribution centers; an aboveground propane storage tank at one of our City of Commerce, California distribution centers; an ammonia storage at our Texas warehouse; aboveground diesel storage tank at our Texas warehouse; an aboveground propane storage tank at our leased Slauson warehouse in City of Commerce, California; and an aboveground propane storage tank at our leased Los Palos warehouse in Los Angeles, California. Except as disclosed in Item 3, Legal Proceedings, we have not been notified of, and are not aware of, any potentially material current environmental liability, claim or non-compliance, concerning our owned or leased real estate.
