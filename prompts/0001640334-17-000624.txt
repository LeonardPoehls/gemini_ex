Trademarks
 
We do not have any trademarks. We do not consider the protection of our trademarks to be important to our business. 
 
Customers
 
Power Production Segment. We operate two power plants within this segment. The Jiema hydroelectric station and the Jiesigou II hydropower station sells their electricity to a single customer, National Sichuan Xiaojin County Electricity Supply Company Ltd., an unrelated third party. Please refer to “Risk Factors” below for a discussion of the risks inherent with providing electricity to a single customer.
Hospitality Segment. The Enze Hotel and Mt. Four Sisters Hotel (together, the “Hotel Brands”) intend to target the domestic and international tourism consumer market and corporate and government travel and retreat market. We plan to position the Enze Hotel as a modern international-standard luxury hotel, offering 178 luxury suites and 12 deluxe suites for lodging, a high end Tibetan style restaurant capable of seating 600 guests, a high-end tea house and a karaoke (KTV) house with ten private rooms. The Mt. Four Sisters Hotel is expected to be positioned to offer guests with a lower price point option in exchange for an authentic indigenous living experience, including 90 guest rooms at 45 square meters each, a 120seat restaurant with two VIP rooms, a tea house with four private rooms and one conference room which will seat 120 conference attendees. 
Sales and Marketing
 
Power Production Segment. Power generation stations often sell all electricity output to a single customer as noted above. We do not engage in direct marketing activities, and we believe that direct marketing activities are not necessary in the power generation and electricity sales industry, due to the increased weight given to reliable and consistent operation of power stations.
Hospitality Segment. The Enze Hotel and the Mt. Four Sisters Hotel currently under construction are expected to be completed and open for business in June 2017. Accordingly, the Hospitality Segment does not have any revenues as of the date of this report. The Hospitality Segment is expected to target the domestic and international consumer tourism market through marketing campaigns leveraging internet-based third-party travel companies and other internet-based advertising. We may also implement marketing campaigns using print media, product placement techniques, radio (including internet-based radio such as XimalayaFM), television, trade shows and physical display marketing techniques such as subway advertisements. We may seek partnerships with local and provincial level government tourism agencies. We intend to hire in-house sales and marketing staff to target both the consumer tourism market and the corporate and government retreat market. 
Suppliers 
 
Power Production Segment. Our Jiema hydroelectric station, operated by Jitai Power Investment, is a hydroelectric station which uses the flow of water from the Wori River to power its electricity production. Our Jiesigou II station, operated by Xin Hong Power Development, uses the flow of water from the Jiesigou River to power its electricity production. Our Jiesigou I and Jiesigou III stations which are under construction, are expected to use the flow of water from the Jiesigou River to power their electricity production. 
Hospitality Segment. The Enze Hotel and the Mt. Four Sisters Hotel are still under construction as of the date of this report. Construction materials are sourced from a variety of regions. We believe we will have access to a sufficient supply of construction materials to complete the construction of the hotels we plan to open.
Government Approvals 
 
Power Production Segment
 
All of our hydroelectric power stations are subject to extensive regulation by the PRC governmental authorities, including central governmental authorities such as the Ministry of Commerce, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the National Development and Reform Commission, the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, the State Administration of Taxation, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Communications and Transportation, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Land and Resources and the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, as well as their provincial and local counterparts. Government regulations address virtually all aspects of our operations, including, among others, the following:

5


· | planning and construction of new power projects; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the granting of power generation, dispatch and supply permits; 
· | the amount and timing of power generation; 
· | the setting of on-grid tariffs paid to power producers and power tariffs paid by consumers of electricity; 
· | power grid control and power dispatch, including the setting of preferential policies for the dispatch of renewable energy generated power;
· | allocation of water resources and control of water flows; 
· | environmental protection and safety standards; 
· | acquisitions by foreign investors; and 
· | taxes, in particular Enterprise Income Tax and Value Added Tax. 

 
Lastly, in accordance with relevant PRC laws and regulations, hydroelectric power projects are required to pass a completion acceptance procedure. Jitai Power has obtained the required permit to operate the Jiema hydroelectric power station. Xin Hong Power Development has applied for the required permits and received the approvals required to develop and operate the Jiesigou II hydroelectric power station that went into production in September 2016. We plan to obtain all further government approvals required to operate the Jiesigou I and III hydroelectric power stations that are currently under construction. Further, we believe our hydroelectric power stations have the necessary government approvals to operate.
 
Hospitality Segment
 
The Chinese hospitality sector, including hotel owners and operators, is subject to regulation at the national level by the China National Tourism Administration, and at the local level by the local tourism administrations. 
 
Construction of our hotel properties is subject to regulation in the PRC. prior to the start of construction projects, project owners must, in accordance with relevant provisions of the State. We are required to apply to local governmental authorities where the project is located for construction permits, except for small projects below a certain value set government regulators. We believe the construction of our two hotel properties comply with the current government regulations. In addition, upon completion of construction, we plan to obtain all required government approvals to operate the hotels. 
 
Research and Development
 
Power Production Segment. We conduct research and development within our Power Production Segment related to the efficient generation of hydroelectric power, efficient storage of electricity and electricity distribution and transfer practices. Since the price of our electricity is set by contract and subject to negotiation with our customers, who have substantial negotiating leverage, we are limited in our ability to charge our customers a higher price to finance research and development activities. 
Hospitality Segment. Both of our hotel properties are under construction and not operational, and management devotes substantially all of its time on completion of construction of the hotel properties. We anticipate significant resources being required for research and development activities in the area of sales and marketing, commercial leasing and the selection of shopping brands to lease our commercial spaces, and evolving trends in the regional tourism sector. If we are capable of building significant brand value, we will have the ability to finance increased research and development activities through increased pricing to the customer. 
Industry and Competitive Advantages
 
Power Production Segment
 
Competition within the electric power industry has only been introduced recently in China, as energy producers were historically controlled by the government. China has experienced significant capacity shortages, and suppliers have often been unable to meet the surging demand for electricity. We believe that competition between power projects to sell electricity is lessened due to prevalent supply shortages. Nonetheless, we believe that competition will increase in the long run.
 
All hydroelectric power projects in China are subject to dispatch conducted by various dispatch centers. A dispatch center is required to dispatch electricity pursuant to the Regulations on the Administration of Electric Power Dispatch Networks and Grids, issued by the State Council with effect from November 1, 1993, and in accordance with its agreements with hydroelectric power projects subject to its dispatch. Power generation companies are also required to enter into on-grid dispatch agreements with power grid companies. As a result, there is competition for favorable dispatch treatment in China’s electric power industry, especially during the off-peak periods. Our ability to sell electricity depends on the dispatch and allocation determined by the dispatch requirements of the local grids to which we sell our electricity. We therefore do not compete directly with other power producers to sell the electricity we generate, but instead, to sell the electricity solely through the local grids. As a generator of renewable energy, hydroelectric power projects are technically entitled to preferential treatment in dispatchment over thermal power projects. This factor has led to increased interest in and support to hydropower in China. 
 


6

 
Competition may come from China’s five biggest power generating companies, which are all state-owned enterprises and currently operate primarily coal-fired power projects but have become increasingly interested in hydroelectric power projects and other forms of renewable energy. These companies have excellent relationships with the power grids, which provide them an advantage when introducing new plants to a grid. Certain smaller China-based and overseas listed power companies are also seeking to acquire hydroelectric power projects in China. Hydroelectric power projects in China are also attractive investments for international investors seeking to generate and trade certified emissions reduction credits. We believe these local and foreign companies are acquiring hydroelectric power projects along with other renewable energy operations and lack the segment focus that our Company has. While we are aware of their activities in the market, we have not experienced direct competition with them to date for project acquisition. We may also encounter some competition from venture capital and private equity funds, leveraged buyout funds and other foreign funded entities interested in acquiring hydropower assets in China. We believe we have the expertise and experience in the hydropower sector to compete effectively with these players.
 
Hospitality Segment
 
Our Hospitality Segment will operate hotels which will seek to attract customers largely on the basis of the location of the Hotel Brands in regions of superior natural scenery. Domestic and international tourists traveling within the PRC have many choices for destinations that offer similar benefits, including Guilin, Tibet, Gansu and Ningxia, and Yunnan Province. Our competitive advantage in the tourism market in the PRC is linked to Xiaojin County and Sichuan Province maintaining their appeal to domestic and international tourists. We believe that our main competitive advantage will be enhanced brand value and attention to high quality service. Chinese online travel companies and mobile applications rank hotels by customer feedback, and we are committed to maintaining a top quality online presence with regard to customer satisfaction. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
 
This section sets forth a summary of the most significant PRC regulations that affect our business and the industry in which we operate.
 
We operate our business in China under a legal regime consisting of the State Council, or China central government, and several ministries and agencies under its authority, including the Ministry of Commerce, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, the National Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Water Resources, the Ministry of Environmental Protection, the Ministry of Land and Resources, the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development, the State Administration of Taxation, and the State Electricity Regulatory Commission. From time to time, these authorities issue regulations that apply to our business.
Regulations Relating to Foreign Investment
 
On December 27, 2011, the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce jointly promulgated a revised Catalogue for the Guidance of Foreign Investment Industries, or the Catalogue, which came into effect on January 30, 2012. The Catalogue lists those industries and economic activities in which foreign investment in China is encouraged, restricted or prohibited. Pursuant to the Catalogue, construction and operation of hydroelectric power projects with the main purpose of power generation fall within the encouraged category.
 
The principal PRC regulations in connection with foreign investment include:
 

· | The Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law (1979), as amended; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The Regulations of Implementation of the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law (1983), as amended; 
· | The Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law (1986), as amended; 
· | The Detailed Rules of the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law (1990), as amended; 
· | The Company Law of the PRC (1993), as amended; 
· | The Provisions on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors (2009); 
· | The Interim Administrative Measures on Foreign Investment (2004); 
· | The Circular Regarding Further Strengthening and Regulating the Administration of Foreign Invested Projects issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (2008).
· | Circular of the General Office of the State Council on the Establishment of Security Review System Regarding Mergers and Acquisitions in China by Foreign Investors (2011)

Generally, the acquisitions of domestic enterprises by foreign investors in China are subject to the prior approvals of the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce, or their local counterparts. After obtaining the approvals from the National Development and Reform Commission and the Ministry of Commerce, the change of shareholders must be registered with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce or its local counterparts and other alteration registrations shall be filed with the government authorities in charge of foreign exchange, customs, tax, land, etc. The acquisition of hydropower plants may also be subject to security review.
 
Environmental Protection Regulations
 
Pollution and Pollutants 
 
In accordance with the China Environmental Protection Law adopted on December 26, 1989, the Administration Supervisory Department of Environmental Protection of the State Council sets the national guidelines for the discharge of pollutants. The PRC’s provincial governments, autonomous regions and municipalities may also set their own guidelines for the discharge of pollutants within their own provinces or districts in the event that the national guidelines are inadequate. A company which causes environmental pollution and discharges other polluting materials which endanger the public should implement environmental protection methods and procedures into their business operations. This may be achieved by setting up a system of accountability within the company’s business structure for environmental protection, adopting effective procedures to prevent environmental hazards such as waste gases, water and residues, dust powder, radioactive materials and noise arising from production, construction and other activities from polluting and endangering the environment. The environmental protection system and procedures should be implemented simultaneously with the commencement of and during the operation of construction, production and other activities undertaken by the company. Any company which discharges environmental pollutants should report and register such discharge with the Administration Supervisory Department of Environmental Protection and pay any fines imposed for the discharge. A fee may also be imposed on the company for the cost of any work required to restore the environment to its original state. Companies which have caused severe pollution to the environment are required to restore the environment or remedy the effects of the pollution within a prescribed time limit. If a company fails to report and/or register the environmental pollution it caused, it will receive a warning or be penalized. Companies that fail to restore the environment or remedy the effects of the pollution within the prescribed time will be penalized or have their business licenses terminated. Companies that have polluted and endangered the environment must bear the responsibility for remedying the danger and effects of the pollution, as well as to compensate any losses or damages suffered as a result of such environmental pollution.
 
We believe that our operations in the PRC comply with the current environmental protection requirements and will continue to evaluate the proposed environmental regulations. We are not subject to any admonition, penalty, investigations or inquiries imposed by the environmental regulators, nor are we subject to any claims or legal proceedings to which we were named as a defendant for violation of any environmental laws and regulations.
 
Regulation of Foreign Exchange
 
The PRC government imposes restrictions on the convertibility of the CNY and on the collection and use of foreign currency by PRC entities. Under current regulations, the CNY is convertible for current account transactions, which include dividend distributions, and the import and export of goods and services. Conversion of CNY into foreign currency and foreign currency into CNY for capital account transactions, such as direct investment, portfolio investment and loans, however, is still generally subject to the prior approval of or registration with SAFE.
 
Under current PRC regulations, foreign-invested enterprises such as our PRC subsidiaries are required to apply to SAFE for a Foreign Exchange Registration Certificate for Foreign-Invested Enterprise. With such a certificate (which is subject to review and renewal by SAFE on an annual basis), a foreign-invested enterprise may open foreign exchange bank accounts at banks authorized to conduct foreign exchange business by SAFE and may buy, sell and remit foreign exchange through such banks, subject to documentation and approval requirements. Foreign-invested enterprises are required to open and maintain separate foreign exchange accounts for capital account transactions and current account transactions. In addition, there are restrictions on the amount of foreign currency that foreign-invested enterprises may retain in such accounts.

Regulation of Foreign Exchange in Certain Onshore and Offshore Transactions
 
SAFE issued a public notice, or SAFE Circular 75, in October 2005 requiring PRC residents to register with the local SAFE branch before establishing or controlling any company outside of China for the purpose of capital financing with assets or equity interests in any onshore enterprise located in China, referred to in the notice as a “special purpose company.” On July 4, 2014, SAFE issued the SAFE’s Notice on Relevant Issues Concerning Foreign Exchange Administration for PRC Residents to Engage in Outbound Investment and Financing and Inbound Investment via Special Purpose Vehicles, or SAFE Circular 37, which has superseded SAFE Circular 75. Under SAFE Circular 75, SAFE Circular 37 and other relevant foreign exchange regulations, PRC residents who make, or have previously made, prior to the implementation of these foreign exchange regulations, direct or indirect investments in offshore companies will be required to register those investments. In addition, any PRC resident who is a direct or indirect shareholder of an offshore company is also required to file or update the registration with the local branch of SAFE, with respect to that offshore company for any material change involving its round-trip investment, capital variation, such as an increase or decrease in capital, transfer or swap of shares, merger, division, long-term equity or debt investment or the creation of any security interest. If any PRC shareholder fails to make the required registration or update the previously filed registration, the PRC subsidiary of that offshore parent company may be prohibited from distributing their profits and the proceeds from any reduction in capital, share transfer or liquidation to their offshore parent company, and the offshore parent company may also be prohibited from injecting additional capital into its PRC subsidiary. 
 
In addition, on August 8, 2006, six PRC regulatory authorities, including the Ministry of Commerce, the State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, the State Administration for Taxation, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the CSRC and SAFE, jointly issued the Regulations on Mergers and Acquisitions of Domestic Enterprises by Foreign Investors, or the New M&A Rules, which became effective on September 8, 2006. This regulation, among other things, includes provisions that purport to require that an offshore special purpose vehicle formed for purposes of overseas listing of equity interests in PRC companies and controlled directly or indirectly by PRC companies or individuals obtain the approval of the CSRC prior to the listing and trading of such special purpose vehicle’s securities on an overseas stock exchange. On September 21, 2006, the CSRC published on its official website procedures regarding its approval of overseas listings by special purpose vehicles. The CSRC approval procedures require the filing of a number of documents with the CSRC and it would take several months to complete the approval process.
 
Regulations on Dividend Distribution
 
The principal PRC regulations governing the distribution of dividends by foreign-invested enterprises include:
 

· | The Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law (1979), as amended; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | The Regulations of Implementation of the Sino-foreign Equity Joint Venture Law (1983), as amended;
· | The Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law (1986), as amended; 
· | The Detailed Rules of the Wholly Foreign-owned Enterprise Law (1990), as amended; 
· | Foreign Currency Administration Rules (1996), as amended; 
· | The Company Law of China (1993), as amended; 
· | The Enterprise Income Tax Law of China; and 
· | The Implementation Regulations of Enterprise Income Tax Law of China. 

 
Under the above-mentioned regulations, foreign-invested enterprises in China may pay dividends only out of their accumulated profits, if any, determined in accordance with PRC accounting standards and regulations. In addition, wholly foreign-owned enterprises in China are required to set aside at least 10.0% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund the reserve fund unless such reserve fund has reached 50.0% of their respective registered capital and to set aside a percentage of their after-tax profits to their employee bonus and welfare fund which is decided by their respective board of directors. Sino-foreign equity joint ventures are required to set aside their reserve fund, enterprise development fund and employee bonus and welfare fund at percentages that are decided by their respective board of directors. PRC domestic companies are required to set aside at least 10.0% of their after-tax profits each year, if any, to fund their respective statutory reserve fund unless such fund has reached 50.0% of their respective registered capital. These reserves are not distributable as cash dividends.

SAFE Regulations on Employee Share Options
 
In December 2006, the People’s Bank of China promulgated the Administrative Measures of Foreign Exchange Matters for Individuals or the People’s Bank of China Regulation. In January 2007, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange issued implementing rules for the People’s Bank of China Regulation, which, among other things, specified approval requirements for certain capital account transactions such as a PRC citizen’s participation in the equity incentive plan of an overseas publicly listed company. On March 28, 2007, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange issued the Operating Procedures on Administration of Foreign Exchange regarding PRC Individuals’ Participation in Employee Share Ownership Plans and Employee Stock Option Plans of Overseas Listed Companies, or the Stock Option Rule. The purpose of the Stock Option Rule is to regulate foreign exchange administration of PRC citizens who participate in equity incentive plans of overseas-listed companies. The Stock Option Rule was replaced by the Notice of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange on Issues Related to Foreign Exchange Administration in Domestic Individuals’ Participation in Equity Incentive Plans of Companies Listed Abroad, or the New Stock Option Rule, which was issued on February 15, 2012.
 
According to the New Stock Option Rule, PRC residents who are granted shares or stock options by companies listed on overseas stock exchanges based on the stock incentive plans are required to register with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local branches. Pursuant to the New Stock Option Rule, PRC residents participating in the stock incentive plans of overseas listed companies shall retain a qualified PRC agent, which could be a PRC subsidiary of such overseas publicly-listed company or another qualified institution selected by such PRC subsidiary, to conduct the registration with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and other procedures with respect to the stock incentive plans on behalf of these participants. Such participants must also retain an overseas entrusted institution to handle matters in connection with their exercise of stock options, purchase and sale of corresponding stocks or interests, and fund transfer. In addition, the PRC agents are required to amend the registration the State Administration of Foreign Exchange with respect to the stock incentive plan if there is any material change to the stock incentive plan, the PRC agents or the overseas entrusted institution or other material changes. The PRC agents shall, on behalf of the PRC residents who have the right to exercise the employee share options, apply to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local branches for an annual quota for the payment of foreign currencies in connection with the PRC residents’ exercise of the employee share options. The foreign exchange proceeds received by the PRC residents from the sale of shares under the stock incentive plans granted and dividends distributed by the overseas listed companies must be remitted into the bank accounts in the PRC opened by the PRC agents before distribution to such PRC residents. In addition, the PRC agents shall file each quarter the form for record-filing of information of the Domestic Individuals Participating in the Stock Incentive Plans of Overseas Listed Companies with the State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local branches.
 
In addition, the State Administration for Taxation has issued circulars concerning employee stock options. Under these circulars, our employees working in China who exercise stock options will be subject to PRC individual income tax. Our PRC subsidiary has obligations to file documents related to employee stock options with relevant tax authorities and to withhold individual income taxes of those employees who exercise their stock options. If our employees fail to pay their income taxes, or we fail to withhold them, we may face sanctions imposed by the tax authorities or other PRC government authorities.
 
We do not currently have any share option plans. Although further clarification is required as to how the Share Option Rule will be interpreted or implemented, we believe that if we were to adopt such a plan, we and our PRC employees who have been granted share options will be subject to the Share Option Rule when our company becomes an overseas listed company. If we or our PRC employees fail to comply with the Share Option Rule, we and/or our PRC employees may face sanctions imposed by foreign exchange authority or any other PRC government authorities.
 
Regulations Relating to Labor and Social Insurance
 
We are subject to various labor laws and regulations in the PRC including but not limited to the PRC Labor Law, the PRC Labor Contract Law, the Implementation Regulations of the PRC Labor Contract Law, the PRC Social Insurance Law (promulgated on October 28, 2010 with effect from July 1, 2011), the Regulations of Insurance for Work-related Injury, the Interim Provisions on Registration of Social Insurance and the Interim Regulations on the Collection and Payment of Social Insurance Premiums.

Pursuant to the Social Insurance Law, the government will establish a social insurance system including basic endowment insurance, basic medical insurance, employment injury insurance, unemployment insurance and maternity insurance. An employer must, within 30 days from the date of its formation, apply to local social insurance agency for social insurance registration. Where an employer fails to apply for social insurance registration, the social insurance administrative department will order it to take remedial measures within a prescribed time limit. Failure to implement these measures within the prescribed time limit will lead to a fine of 1 to 3 times the amount of the social insurance premiums due and payable. The social insurance administrative department may also impose a fine of not less than CNY500 but not more than CNY3,000 upon persons primarily responsible for such failure.
 
According to the Interim Measures for Participation in the Social Insurance System by Foreign Nationals Working within the Territory of China, effective on October 15, 2011, foreigner nationals legally recruited and employed by enterprises duly registered within the territory of China must participate in basic social insurance, with social insurance premiums to be contributed respectively by themselves and their employer as required.
 
Value-added Tax

Small hydropower generation units are defined as hydropower generation units with the installed capacity of no greater than 50 MW. The value-added tax payers using simplified method cannot claim the input value-added tax credits on their purchases.
 
Regulation in Relation to Land
 
All land in China is either state owned or collectively owned, depending on the location of the land. All land in the urban areas of a city or town is state owned, and all land in the suburban areas of a city or town and all rural land are, unless otherwise specified by law, collectively owned. The State has the right to expropriate or requisition with compensations land in accordance with law if required for the benefit of the public.
 
In April 1988, the Constitution of China, or the Constitution, was amended by the National People’s Congress to allow for the transfer of land use rights for value. In December 1988, the Land Administration Law was amended to permit the transfer of land use rights for value.
 
In accordance with the Land Administration Law amended in 2004, the construction unit shall obtain the state-owned land use rights through grant or by other means with consideration. But the following land may be obtained through governmental allocation with the approval of the people’s governments at and above the county level according to law:
 
Under the Provisional Regulations of China concerning the Grant and Assignment of the Land Use Right of State-owned Land in Urban Areas, or the Urban Land Regulations, promulgated in May 1990, local governments at or above county level have the power to grant land use rights for specific purposes and for a definite period to a land user pursuant to a contract for the grant of land use rights against payment of a grant premium.
 
Under the Urban Land Regulations, all local and foreign enterprises are permitted to acquire land use rights unless the law provides otherwise. The State may not resume possession of lawfully granted land use rights prior to expiration of the term of grant. If public interest requires the resumption of possession by the State under special circumstances during the term of grant, compensation must be paid by the State. A land user may lawfully assign, mortgage or lease its granted land use rights to a third party for the remainder of the term of grant. Under the Urban Land Regulations, there are different maximum periods of grant for different uses of land: 70 years for residential purposes; 40 years for commercial, tourism and entertainment purposes; 50 years for industrial, public utilities, comprehensive or other purposes.

On October 22, 2001, the Ministry of Land and Resources promulgated the Catalogue of Allocated Land, according to which, for infrastructure facilities projects, such as energy, transportation and water resources heavily supported by the State, the land use rights may be allocated; for the infrastructure facilities projects, such as energy, transportation and water resources which are aimed at profit-making and not heavily supported by the State, land use rights shall be supplied for value.
 
On March 16, 2007, the National People’s Congress promulgated the Properties Rights Law of China effective from October 1, 2007, which stipulates that the construction land use rights may only be created through grant or allocation. For land used for industrial, business, entertainment or commercial residential purposes, the construction land use rights must be granted by means of public tender, auction or listing-for-sale. To create the construction land rights through allocation is stringently restrained. For adopting such means of allocation, the provisions on land uses in the laws and administrative regulations must be observed.
 
On January 3, 2008, the State Council promulgated the Notice of the State Council Regarding Promoting Saving and Intensive Use of Land, according to which, except for the lands used for military, social security housing and special purposes, it is promoted that the use of land for governmental offices, transportation, energy, water resources and other infrastructures (industries) shall be compensated. In particular, the compensated use of land should be applied to those lands used for commercial purposes firstly. As a result, we expect to be required to pay compensation for some or all of the allocated land occupied by our hydroelectric power projects.
 
On March 5, 2011, the State Council issued the Regulations on Land Reclamation, which was effective on the same date. On December 27, 2012, the Ministry of Land and Resources promulgated Measures for the Implementation of the Regulation on Land Reclamation, which is effective from March 1, 2013. According to the regulations and its implementation measures, “land reclamation” means the activities of adopting rectification measures on land damaged by production or construction activities or natural disasters to restore the land to usable condition. With respect to reclaiming the land, the land damaged by production or construction activities shall be reclaimed by the production or construction entity according to the principle of “reclamation by the party causing the damage”. The party responsible for rehabilitating the land shall submit the land reclamation plan together with the other relevant materials when filing an application for construction land or mining rights. If such party fails to prepare the land reclamation plan or the land reclamation plan fails to meet the relevant requirements, the application will be denied.
 
Regulations on Construction
 
Pursuant to the Construction Law, effective from March 1, 1998 and amended on April 22, 2011 with effect from July 1, 2011, prior to the start of construction projects, project owners must, in accordance with relevant provisions of the State, apply to competent construction administrations at or above the county level of the place where the project is to be located for construction permits, except for small projects below a value set by the competent construction administration of the State Council.

The Electric Power Law, effective from April 1, 1996, provides the general principles for determining tariffs, which are intended to include reasonable compensation for costs, a reasonable profit and tax, to share expenses fairly and to promote the construction of power projects.
 
In April 23, 2001, the former State Development and Planning Commission, the predecessor to the National Development and Reform Commission, issued a notice containing guidelines for tariff administration. Pursuant to the notice, a new on-grid tariff-setting mechanism, based on the operating term of power stations as well as the average costs of comparable advanced power stations adopting the same type of techniques that were constructed during the same period within the same provincial power grid, was gradually implemented.
 
On July 9, 2003, the State Council promulgated the Tariff Reform Scheme. In accordance with the Tariff Reform Scheme, the direction of the reform of the on-grid tariff is to introduce a competitive mechanism in all respects and the tariff shall be set through the competition of supplying and demanding parties. During the transition period, the on-grid tariff is mainly implemented by a two-part tariff system, among which, capacity tariff shall be set by the government and the energy tariff shall be set by market competition. Competitive bidding for a portion of the energy tariff and other transition methods may also be adopted according to actual situations.
 
On March 28, 2005, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the Interim Measures on Regulation of On-grid Tariff, the Interim Measures on Regulation of Transmission and Distribution Tariff, and the Interim Measures on Regulation of End-user Tariff, to provide guidance for the reform of the tariff-setting mechanism in the transition period.
 
The National Development and Reform Commission issued the Trial Measures for the Administration of the Tariff of, and the Sharing of Costs in Connection with, Power Generation Using Renewable Energy Resources, or the Trial Measures, on January 4, 2006, however, the Trial Measures explicitly stipulate that the mechanism for setting the tariff after tax for hydroelectricity be in accordance with prevailing regulations for the time being.
 
On July 25, 2007, the State Electricity Regulatory Commission promulgated the Supervision and Administration Measures on the Full Purchase of Electricity of Renewable Energy Resources by Grid Enterprises effective from September 1, 2007. The Measures provide that except for large or medium hydroelectric power projects, renewable energy power generators will not participate in competitive bidding for on-grid tariffs. If hydropower generators with the electricity fully purchased by grid companies are engaged in any transaction in the power market, they shall comply with relevant rules and regulations of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission.
 
Regulation of Distributed Power Generation
 
On July 18, 2013, the Interim Measures on Distributed Power Generation (“the Interim Measures”) was issued by the National Development and Reform Commission for the purpose of encouraging enterprises, professional resource service companies and individuals to invest in and to operate distributed power generation projects by exempting the electric power business permits of the distributed power generation projects. The distributed power generation applies to the small-size hydroelectric power plants with total installed capacity of no more than 50 MW. In accordance with the Interim Measures, power grid enterprises shall simplify the procedures of grid-connected application and provide consulting, moderating and grid-connected testing service for the distributed power generation connected with the distribution network of no more than 35KV. As for the small-size hydroelectric power plants and other distributed power generation connected with the distribution network of no more than 35KV, the power grid enterprises shall manage the grid connection work based on the principle of convenience and efficiency.
Regulation of Power Dispatch
 
On November 1, 1993, the Regulations on the Administration of Electric Power Dispatch to Networks and Grids, or the Dispatch Regulations, became effective. The Dispatch Regulations apply to all power projects in China and require them to generate power in accordance with their grid connection agreements.
 
On August 2, 2007, the State Council approved the Measures on Dispatch of Energy Saving Power Generation (For Trial Implementation), or the Trial Dispatch Measures, jointly issued by the National Development and Reform Commission, the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, the former State Environmental Protection Bureau, the predecessor of the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Office of the National Energy Leading Group.

Regulations on Renewable Energy Resources
 
The Law of Renewable Energy Resources of China
 
On February 28, 2005, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress adopted the Law of Renewable Energy Resources, or the Renewable Energy Law, effective from January 1, 2006. On December 26, 2009, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress adopted an amendment to the Renewable Energy Law, which has come into effect on April 1, 2010. Pursuant to the Renewable Energy Law, the PRC government encourages the development and utilization of renewable energy resources, including the connection of renewable energy power generators to local power grids. Pursuant to the Renewable Energy Law, the PRC government implements the development and utilization of renewable energy resources by encouraging the purchase of all renewable energy generated. The State Council energy department, in conjunction with the national power regulatory agency and the State Council finance department, determines, in accordance with the national renewable energy development and utilization plan, the proportion of renewable energy power generation with respect to the overall generating capacity for the planning period. The grid enterprises must enter into grid connection agreements with renewable energy power generation enterprises which have procured administrative permits or have submitted filings and must purchase all hydro-produced power meeting the technical standards for grid connection within their grid coverage. Grid enterprises refusing to purchase power produced by renewable energy generators may be fined in an amount up to double the economic loss suffered by the renewable energy generator. The Renewable Energy Law also authorizes the relevant pricing authorities to set on grid tariffs based on the principles in favor of promoting the utilization of renewable energy and being economically reasonable, and to adjust the tariffs in accordance with the improvement of the renewable energy development and utilization technologies. However, the Renewable Energy Law also stipulates that the application of the Renewable Energy Law to hydroelectric power is guided by the department in charge of energy of the State Council and subject to the approval of the State Council. Such guidance has yet to be provided by the State Council, and in practice the local grids or relevant pricing authorities may not always follow the Renewable Energy Law when purchasing power or setting tariffs.
The Medium and Long Term Development Plan of Renewable Energy Resources
 
In light of the rapid growth of China economy and rising consumption of energy, China government increasingly encourages the development and use of renewable energy resources. On August 31, 2007, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the Medium and Long Term Development Plan of Renewable Energy Resources, or the Medium and Long Term Development Plan. According to the Medium and Long Term Development Plan, the share of the development and use of renewable energy accounted for 7.5% of the primary energy consumption in 2005. It aims to have the consumption of renewable energy reach 10.0% of the total energy consumption by 2010, and 15.0% by 2020.
The Guiding Catalogue for the Development of Renewable Energy Resources Industry
 
On November 29, 2005, in accordance with the Renewable Energy Law, the National Development and Reform Commission promulgated the Guiding Catalogue for the Development of Renewable Energy Resources Industry, or the Guiding Catalogue. Grid-connected hydroelectric power projects are included in the Guiding Catalogue. In accordance with relevant provisions of the Renewable Energy Law, financial institutions may provide preferential loans with interest subsidies to the development and utilization projects relating to renewable energy resources which are included in the Guiding Catalogue and satisfy the credit requirements. In addition, the Guiding Catalogue contains two categories of hydropower and four categories of relevant equipment manufacturing which are encouraged and shall be entitled to a series of preferential policies in the area of technology research/development, taxation, pricing, marketing/sales and import/export, the details of which shall be promulgated by the State Council. To date, the State Council has not issued any regulatory guidance to provide relevant details regarding these preferential policies. Business activities conducted by us in the development and use of hydroelectric power are encouraged by the government and we may be entitled to benefit from these preferential policies once the State Council issues detailed implementation rules.
The Administrative Regulations on Power Generation of Renewable Energy Resources
 
On January 5, 2006, the National Development and Reform Commission promulgated the Administrative Regulations on Power Generation of Renewable Energy Resources. Pursuant to this regulation, grid operators are required to ensure renewable energy power generators are connected to their power grid.

Having identified Axiom Holdings, Inc. as the preferred public company to acquire, and CJC having consolidated its acquisitions of the operating companies listed above, CJC and the CJC Shareholders entered into the Share Exchange Agreement, as amended with Axiom and Horizon, and the transactions set forth in that agreement were completed on December 21, 2016. 
 
The Share Exchange Transaction
 
On October 10, 2016, we entered into the Share Exchange Agreement with CJC, together with its subsidiaries, JBX, Jitai Power Investment, Xin Hong Power Development, JTH, EnZe Hotel Management and SiGuNiang Mountain Hotel Management and the two shareholders of CJC, Hu Dengyang and Yang Chuan (the “CJC Shareholders”).Pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of CJC from the CJC Shareholders in exchange for the issuance to the CJC Shareholders of 200,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the “Common Stock”). In connection with the transactions contemplated under the Share Exchange Agreement, we agreed to cancel 200,000,000 shares of our Common Stock currently outstanding prior to the closing of the transactions, and therefore the shares of Common Stock issued to the CJC Shareholders in the transactions pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement will represent approximately 58.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of the Company’s Common Stock at the closing of such transactions. 
 
On December 21, 2016, the Company, Horizon, CJC(Hong Kong), Ltd. (“CJC”) and the CJC Shareholders entered into an amendment to the Share Exchange Agreement (the “SEC Amendment”) in which Horizon agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding CJC Shares from the CJC Shareholders in exchange for the issuance by the Company to the CJC Shareholders of 200,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The Share Exchange Agreement as amended by the SEA Amendment is collectively referred to as the “Share Exchange Agreement, as amended”. The SEA Amendment also provides for the addition of Xing Tie Electric which is an additional subsidiary of CJC to be acquired as part of the transaction. The Share Exchange Agreement as originally drafted provided for the direct acquisition by the Company of the CJC Shares, and the SEA Amendment accomplishes this through the transfer of the CJC Shares to Horizon, resulting in indirect ownership by the Company of the CJC Shares through its wholly owned subsidiary Horizon. The SEA Amendment also corrects the name of CJC which was incorrectly written in the Share Exchange Agreement as CJC Holdings, Ltd. rather than the correct name of CJC(Hong Kong), Ltd. 
 
On December 21, 2016, our wholly owned subsidiary Horizon completed the acquisition of the CJC Shares as provided for in the Share Exchange Agreement as amended by the SEA Amendment. Pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Share Exchange Agreement, as amended, the CJC Shareholders who collectively own 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of CJC exchanged their CJC Shares for an aggregate of 200,00,000 shares of our common stock. Pursuant to terms of the Share Exchange Agreement and immediately prior to the completion of the acquisition of CJC, Low Tuan Lee, Lim Wei and Chua Seong cancelled an aggregate of 200,000,000 shares of our common stock. Upon completion of the closing, CJC will become a subsidiary of our company and the CJC Shareholders as a group will hold approximately 58.8% of our pro-forma shares of Common Stock outstanding which is expected to be approximately 340,000,000 shares giving effect to the issuance of the shares to acquire CJC and the share cancellation.
