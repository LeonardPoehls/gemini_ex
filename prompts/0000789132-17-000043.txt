ITEM 1.    Business 
The Company
We develop, manufacture, market and distribute single-use medical devices used in minimally invasive procedures within the cardiovascular system. Our products are used to cross, prepare, and treat arterial blockages in the legs and heart and to remove pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads. We believe that the diversified nature of our business allows us to respond to a wide range of physician and patient needs. The innovative products and services we offer are divided into three categories:

• | Vascular Intervention (“VI”): Our broad portfolio of VI devices consists of laser and aspiration catheters, AngioSculpt® scoring balloon catheters, which are a specialty balloon market leader, support catheters, and drug coated balloon (“DCB”) catheters including our Stellarex™ and AngioSculptX™ products.


• | Lead Management (“LM”): We are a global leader in devices for the removal of pacemaker and defibrillator cardiac leads. Our primary LM devices consist of our excimer laser sheaths, non-laser mechanical sheaths, our Bridge™ Occlusion Balloon, and cardiac lead management accessories. 


• | Laser, service, and other: Our proprietary excimer laser system, the CVX-300®, is the only laser system approved in the United States (“U.S.”), Europe, Japan, China and select other major global markets for use in multiple minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures. We sell, rent and service our CVX-300 laser systems. 

In January 2015, we acquired certain assets and liabilities related to Covidien LP’s Stellarex (“Stellarex”) over the wire percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter with a paclitaxel coated balloon. The Stellarex DCB platform is designed to treat peripheral arterial disease. Stellarex uses EnduraCoat™ technology, a durable, uniform coating designed to prevent drug loss during transit and facilitate controlled, efficient drug delivery to the treatment site. Stellarex products currently are approved for use in Europe but currently are not approved in the U.S. except for investigational purposes.

In June 2014, we acquired AngioScore Inc., a U.S. market leader in specialty scoring balloon catheters. AngioScore develops, manufactures and markets the AngioSculpt scoring balloon catheter for the treatment of peripheral and coronary disease. The AngioSculpt catheter combines a semi-compliant balloon with a nitinol scoring element to address specific limitations of conventional balloon angioplasty catheters and rotational atherectomy. In August 2016, the Company received Conformité Européene (CE) mark approval of AngioSculptX, which is the world’s first drug-coated scoring balloon to treat coronary disease.
Our disposable devices include VI and LM products. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our disposable products generated 94%, 94% and 90%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue, of which VI accounted for 67%, 66% and 58%, respectively, and LM accounted for 27%, 28%, and 32%, respectively. The remainder of our revenue is derived from sales and rental of our laser systems and related service.
Our two operating segments are U.S. Medical and International Medical. U.S. Medical includes direct sales operations in the U.S. and Canada. International Medical includes product availability in over 65 countries outside of the U.S. and Canada, including our direct sales operations in certain countries in Europe and Puerto Rico and a network of approximately 60 distributors throughout Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Total international revenue in 2016 was 17% of our consolidated revenue. For financial information about our segments and by geographic area for each of the last three fiscal years, please see Note 10, “Segment and Geographic Reporting,” of the consolidated financial statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this annual report

Our business strategy emphasizes:

• | Saving lives and limbs: We focus on inventing and delivering technology that allow patients to live life fully, free from health conditions that stand in the way. Our technology enables physicians to complete procedures confidently and successfully, as they treat cardiovascular disease and its complications. 


• | Proven solutions: We focus on proven algorithms of treatment for the most complex and challenging cardiovascular cases. 


• | Expanding our reach: We invest to broaden our solutions portfolio and deliver treatment options for complex diseases through: 


▪ | organic growth via new product development;

Vascular Intervention Products 
We are focused on the most complex challenges in peripheral (PAD) and coronary (CAD) artery disease with a vision to eradicate restenosis and reduce amputations. We partner with our customers to deliver meaningful solutions to solve the challenges of chronic total occlusions, in-stent restenosis, critical limb ischemia and complex coronary disease. 
PAD is a global pandemic estimated to impact over 200 million people in the world, growing 25% from 2000 to 2010. In the U.S. and Europe alone, approximately 25 million people are afflicted with PAD; however, only approximately 10 million of these patients suffer from typical symptoms such as leg pain while walking or resting. PAD patients are often underdiagnosed and undertreated with one million patients receiving endovascular treatment each year, according to internal estimates using leading market research data. 
CAD is a very large market with over two million interventions in the US and Europe. With advancements in medical therapy, total CAD procedures are flat, yet complex coronary revascularization interventions are growing rapidly with aging population and increased comorbidities of diabetes, obesity and renal disease. 
Peripheral Vascular Intervention Products
Our portfolio is aligned with how physicians treat PAD: crossing the lesion, preparing the vessel, and finally treating the lesion. 
In crossing, we are a U.S. market leader in support catheters, according to IMS Health data. Our crossing solutions products support vascular access in the arterial system to enable both coronary and peripheral interventions. Our primary crossing products include the Quick-Cross™, Quick-Cross Select, and Quick-Cross Extreme support catheters. 
Vessel preparation is the core of our business driven by our laser atherectomy and AngioSculpt specialty scoring balloon catheter platforms. Our Turbo-Elite™, Turbo-Tandem™ and Turbo-Power™ laser atherectomy catheters treat stenoses and occlusions both above and below the knee. Our Turbo-Tandem and Turbo-Power laser catheters are the only atherectomy devices indicated to treat in-stent restenosis that are backed by level one clinical data (EXCITE) showing superior safety and effectiveness over PTA alone. We also are a U.S. market leader in the specialty balloon category. Our AngioSculpt products provide benefits to our patients in vessel preparation of complex lesions, combining a semi-compliant balloon with a nitinol scoring element to address specific limitations of conventional balloon angioplasty catheters, including a lower occurrence of flow-limiting dissections and balloon slippage.
Physicians typically treat PAD by using balloon angioplasty (either a scoring balloon, DCB or PTA), or by placing a stent (either drug-coated, bare metal or covered) in the artery. AngioSculpt peripheral scoring balloon catheters can be used for treatment of many lesion types, including highly calcified lesions, non-stent zones, and in-stent or native-vessel restenotic disease.
The acquisition of the Stellarex DCB in January 2015 further complemented our portfolio of products to treat PAD. The Stellarex DCB has been thoroughly evaluated in five significant clinical studies enrolling over 1,100 patients, including two randomized controlled trials. It has shown top tier results in patient groups comparable to randomized controlled trials of competitive products as well as in patient populations with a high percentage of severe calcium (>40%). For more information, refer to “Clinical Trials”, in Part 1 of this annual report. Stellarex DCB received CE mark in the European Union in December 2014, and we launched the product in Europe in late January 2015. We expect to attain U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) premarket approval of the Stellarex DCB in 2017. 
 3

Coronary Vascular Intervention Products
In the coronary market, our disposable catheters are used to cross, prepare and treat complex CAD as an adjunctive treatment to traditional percutaneous coronary interventions using balloons and stents. For crossing and vessel preparation, we offer the ELCA™ laser ablation catheter and AngioSculpt scoring balloon catheters. For treatment, we launched AngioSculptX in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2016. AngioSculptX is a paclitaxel coated DCB on the AngioSculpt platform. In the coronary thrombus management market, we offer aspiration catheters, such as our QuickCat™ aspiration catheter, designed for quick deliverability and efficient thrombus removal from vessels in the arterial system.
Lead Management Products 
We are a global leader in devices for the removal of pacemaker and defibrillation cardiac leads. The Heart Rhythm Society’s list of indications for lead extraction includes several well-defined scenarios involving non-functional leads, functional leads and venous occlusion. We believe that more than 300,000 patients worldwide are indicated every year for a potential lead extraction as a result of an infection, which is classified by the Heart Rhythm Society as a Class I Indication for Extraction of Cardiac Leads. In addition, Heart Rhythm Society recommends lead extraction in the event of malfunction, system upgrade, venous occlusion, and other less common reasons, which are classified as Class II Indications for Extraction of Cardiac Leads. We believe that this results in a market potential of over $700 million with approximately 25% from Class I indications and approximately 75% from Class II indications. Although infection is a Class I indication for lead extraction, we believe that a majority of patients with cardiac device infections are not being treated. The near-term consequence of delayed device removal for infection is an increase in the mortality rate of such patients. Recognizing this, in 2009, the Heart Rhythm Society strengthened recommendations for extraction of infected leads.
We also believe that the majority of the Class II non-infected leads are capped and left in the body as a predominant mode of practice, based on physician perception of risk associated with removal and perception that abandoned leads are benign. The long-term consequences associated with abandoned leads may be more significant than currently perceived and clinical data supporting the safety of lead removal, will be instrumental in reshaping perceptions around this procedure as a mainstream treatment option for patients with devices. 
Our primary LM products include the GlideLight™ and SLS™ II; laser sheaths; Lead Locking Devices; and our mechanical tools, including the TightRail™ Rotating Dilator Sheath and SightRail™ Manual Dilator Sheath; and our Bridge Occlusion Balloon catheter.
We received 510(k) regulatory clearance and CE Mark for our Bridge Occlusion Balloon product in the first half of 2016. Bridge is designed to dramatically reduce blood loss, helping the physician maintain control, in the rare event of a tear in the superior vena cava during a lead extraction procedure. The device is designed to give the physician adequate time to stabilize and safely transition the patient to surgical repair and to give the surgeon the benefit of a clear field of view to repair the tear. By the end of 2016, Bridge was credited with providing beneficial results during a number of patient procedures, four of which were published in the Heart Rhythm Journal. Physicians who have incorporated Bridge into their procedural workflows report higher levels of confidence and control in approaching lead extraction procedures. Although a superior vena cava tear is a rare occurrence, we believe that this product is an important innovation that affirms our commitment to our goal of eliminating mortality as a risk during lead extraction procedures.

Laser Equipment and Service
We sell or rent our CVX-300 excimer laser systems to hospitals and physicians’ offices, and our field service engineers service the laser systems on a periodic basis. 
Corporate Information 

The Spectranetics Corporation is a Delaware corporation formed in 1984. Our principal executive offices are located at 9965 Federal Drive, Colorado Springs, Colorado 80921. Our telephone number is (719) 633-8333. 

Our corporate website is www.spnc.com. A link to a third-party website is provided at our corporate website to access our SEC filings free of charge promptly after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. We do not intend for information found on our website to be part of this document. 
Research and Development 

We believe research and development investments are critical to increasing our revenue and revenue growth rate. Our product development and technology teams are engaged in developing additional disposable devices addressing the VI and LM markets, and further developing our laser system. Our team of research scientists, engineers and technicians, supported by third-party research and engineering organizations, performs substantially all of our research and development activities. We believe in the near-term our primary pipeline research and development effort and expense will be within our DCB programs. 
Our research and development expense, which also includes clinical studies costs, regulatory costs, and royalty costs, totaled $67.5 million in 2016, $64.4 million in 2015 and $28.7 million in 2014. In 2016, research and development expense also included costs we incurred in response to a warning letter from the FDA related to observed non-conformities with current Good Manufacturing Practice (“GMP”), as defined by the FDA, at our Colorado Springs, Colorado facility. We plan to continue to respond timely and fully to the FDA’s requests and we are working diligently to fully remediate the FDA’s observations. We anticipate that we will incur incremental expenses ranging from approximately $10 million to approximately $15 million in 2017 in connection with remediating the warning letter. 
Clinical Trials 

Clinical studies or trials often are required in order for us to obtain regulatory approval or clearance for new products, and expanded indications for our existing products under development. The goal of a clinical trial is to meet the primary endpoint or endpoints, which measure effectiveness and/or safety of a device based on the product’s ability to achieve a pre-specified outcome or outcomes. Primary endpoints for clinical trials are selected based on the proposed intended use of the medical device. A medical device pivotal study (or pivotal trial) is a definitive study designed to gather evidence to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a product prior to its marketing. While results in clinical trials form the basis for approval or clearance of the product, results in clinical practice may be more or less favorable than in trials, because there may be variables in clinical practice that are controlled in the clinical trial setting. 
Current and Recent Clinical Trials
The trials listed below represent the significant clinical work we are currently conducting or have recently conducted. This is not a complete listing of every trial conducted or underway. We may not complete some or all of the trials underway, and the clinical results of the completed trials may not be favorable, or even if favorable, they may not be sufficient to support approval or clearance of a new device or a new indication for a currently approved or cleared device.

Stellarex DCB ILLUMENATE clinical trials
There are five ILLUMENATE clinical studies evaluating the safety and effectiveness of the Stellarex DCB platform to support U.S., Canadian, and other foreign regulatory filings. These clinical data represent over 1,100 patients worth of rigorous clinical evidence.

• | The ILLUMENATE First-In-Human (FIH) Study was a non-randomized, multi-center study that enrolled 80 patients. In the pre-dilatation arm (n=50), the primary patency rate at was 89.5% at 12 months and 80.3% at 24 months.


• | The ILLUMENATE Pharmacokinetic Study measured the paclitaxel drug levels in the blood of 25 patients enrolled at two sites. Results demonstrated low and limited systemic exposure to paclitaxel.


• | The ILLUMENATE European Randomized Clinical Trial (“EU RCT”) is a prospective, randomized controlled, multi-center trial with 328 patients enrolled at 18 European sites. The primary safety and effectiveness endpoints were met and superiority over PTA was demonstrated in both. The 12-month primary patency rate was 89.0% vs. 65.0% in the PTA arm. 


• | The ILLUMENATE Pivotal Trial is a prospective, randomized controlled, multicenter trial with 300 patients enrolled at 43 U.S. sites to support U.S. FDA approval. The primary safety and effectiveness endpoints were met and superiority over PTA was demonstrated in both. With the most complex patient population ever studied in a DCB Superficial Femoral Artery (“SFA”) Investigational Device Exemption (“IDE”) trial, the 12-month primary patency rate was 82.3% at 12 months. Co-morbidities for the DCB arm included high rates of severe calcification (43.9%), diabetes (49.5%), renal insufficiency (18.0%), and cardiovascular disease (45.0%). 


• | The ILLUMENATE Global Study is a prospective, single arm, multi-center trial which enrolled 371 patients. The treated lesions were highly complex, including a high proportion of chronic total occlusions (31%) and severe calcification (41%), as reported by an independent angiographic core-laboratory. The 12-month primary patency rate was 81.4% 

Stellarex DCB Future Studies
We began sponsorship of a large, multicenter, multi-year registry in Europe in 2016, referred to as the Stellarex Vascular e-Registry (“SAVER”). The purpose of SAVER is to continue to assess the Stellarex DCB in femoral-popliteal arteries according to the instructions for use in a broad, real-world, claudicant or ischemic rest pain patient population per the institution’s standard practice. SAVER has 169 patients enrolled. In addition, we will continue to advance physician-initiated studies to evaluate long and calcified lesions.
EXCITE ISR
The EXCImer Laser Randomized Controlled Study for the Treatment of Femoropopliteal arteries (above and behind the knee) ISR (“EXCITE ISR”) study, conducted under an IDE granted by the FDA in 2011, was designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of treatment with laser atherectomy in subjects with ISR. The EXCITE ISR study incorporated a 2:1 randomization plan, in which one group of patients was treated with laser ablation using our Turbo-Tandem and Turbo-Elite laser ablation devices followed by adjunctive balloon angioplasty and a second control group was treated only with balloon angioplasty. The primary efficacy endpoint was freedom from TLR through six months following the procedure. The primary safety endpoint is freedom from major adverse events (“MAE”), such as death, major amputation, or TLR, at 30 days following the procedure. We announced early termination of the EXCITE ISR study in March 2014, having achieved statistically significant results in both safety and efficacy and meeting the endpoints of the study. In January 2015, the complete six month results of the EXCITE ISR trial were presented at the Leipzig Interventional Course (LINC) conference.

In July 2014, we announced FDA 510(k) clearance of Turbo-Tandem and Turbo-Elite for the treatment of peripheral ISR in bare nitinol stents, when used in conjunction with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. FDA clearance was based on the EXCITE ISR clinical findings. In December 2015, FDA clearance was granted for the 7Fr Turbo-Power atherectomy device, which includes usage for the treatment of ISR. This product line was expanded to include a 6 Fr Turbo-Power atherectomy device in January 2017. These products are now the only devices cleared by the FDA for the treatment of ISR. 
Sales and Marketing 

Our primary goal is to increase the global use of our vascular and cardiovascular products in new and existing accounts. We seek to educate and train physicians and institutions regarding the safety, efficacy, and ease of use of our VI and LM product portfolios. Through published studies of clinical applications and training initiatives, we share clinical outcomes with customers and potential customers to demonstrate that our products are proven safe and effective.
Our marketing team supports our VI and LM sales organizations, the Stellarex DCB program and global product development initiatives. Our team includes marketing and product managers responsible for all marketing activities for each of our core businesses. Our marketing activities are designed to support our direct sales teams and include branding, sales enablement tools, advertising and product publicity in trade journals, newsletters, continuing education programs, public relations and attendance at trade shows and professional association meetings.
 We are dedicated to helping physicians cross, prepare and treat complex clinical challenges of peripheral and coronary artery disease. Throughout much of 2016, we have had a dedicated cross-functional team preparing for the launch of Stellarex in the U.S. and we are continuing to expand our sales force to address the DCB market opportunity competitively.
U.S. Sales and Marketing

Due to differentiated selling strategies and physician specialties, our U.S. sales organization is divided into two strategic groups, one focusing on VI and the other on LM. This strategic segmentation allows our sales teammates to better understand the needs of the customers within their respective product lines. Our VI commercial team works with interventional cardiologists, vascular surgeons and interventional radiologists who perform vascular procedures. Our LM commercial team works with electrophysiologists and cardiac surgeons who perform lead extraction procedures.

Our VI and LM educational sessions include hands-on training with a unique simulation system. The simulation technology augments traditional procedural training for physicians on the use of our products by permitting hands-on practice with extraction tools, catheter navigation and laser techniques in multiple case scenarios in a virtual operating environment.
International Sales and Marketing 
International Medical includes product availability in over 65 countries outside of the U.S. and Canada, including our direct sales operations in certain countries in Europe and Puerto Rico and a network of approximately 60 distributors throughout Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America. We also have a global marketing presence in key markets internationally that drives commercial execution of our full line of products to our direct international sales force and distributor partners. We sell substantially all of our products internationally, including Stellarex, which we sell in Europe; however, Stellarex is not approved in the U.S., where it is currently limited to investigational use. 
We sell our products through direct sales and distributors in Japan, China and an expanding set of countries in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. We market and sell our products in Europe, the Middle East and 
 7

Russia through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Spectranetics International, B.V., and its wholly-owned international subsidiaries and through distributors. 
Competition

The medical device industry is highly competitive, subject to rapid change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Our primary competitors are manufacturers of products used in competing therapies to cross, prepare and treat disease within the peripheral and coronary markets, such as mechanical methods to remove arterial blockages, balloon angioplasty and stents, specialty balloon angioplasty alternatives to our specialty scoring balloons, bypass surgery and amputation. Principal competitive factors in our markets include the ability to treat a variety of lesions safely and effectively as demonstrated by credible clinical data; ease of use of products; the impact of managed care practices, related reimbursement to the healthcare provider and procedure costs; the size and effectiveness of sales forces; and research and development capabilities. Primary competitors in the vascular intervention market include, but are not limited to, Medtronic, Boston Scientific Corporation, C.R. Bard, Inc., Cook Medical, Inc., QT Vascular, Biotronik and Cardiovascular Systems, Inc. In the lead management market our competitors include, but are not limited to, Cook Medical, Inc. and Biotronik internationally. 
Manufacturing 

We manufacture substantially all of our products and have vertically integrated a number of manufacturing processes in an effort to provide increased quality and reliability. We believe that our level of manufacturing integration allows us to better control lead time, costs, quality and process advancements, to accelerate new product development cycle time, to provide greater design flexibility, and to scale manufacturing, should market demand increase. Many of our manufacturing processes are proprietary. 
We manufacture a significant number of our disposable products and all of our CVX-300 laser systems at our corporate headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. We maintain manufacturing capabilities at another location in Colorado Springs for business continuity contingency planning purposes. We manufacture AngioSculpt products at our facility in Fremont, California. The Stellarex products are manufactured in a separate facility, also located in Fremont, California.
Our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspections and audits by federal, state, international, and other regulatory authorities, including inspections by the FDA and audits by our Notified Body (currently the British Standards Institution (“BSI”)), which is authorized by the European Commission (“EC”) to conduct such audits on behalf of the European Union (“EU”). Most raw materials, components and subassemblies used in our laser and disposable products are purchased from outside suppliers and are generally readily available from multiple sources. We purchase certain components of our CVX-300 laser system and select disposable products from several sole source suppliers. We do not have guaranteed commitments from these suppliers.
Patents and Proprietary Rights

We hold numerous issued U.S. patents and trademarks and have rights to additional U.S. patents under license agreements in the name of The Spectranetics Corporation and AngioScore, Inc. We also hold issued patents and trademarks in other countries. In addition, we also have pending U.S. and international patent applications that cover numerous inventions, including general features of the laser system, our catheters, our scoring balloon technology platform, the coatings of our DCB platform, and other technologies. We also maintain trademarks in the U.S. and other countries as well as pending trademark applications in the U.S. and other countries.
It is our policy to require our employees and consultants to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us. Each agreement provides that all confidential 
 8

information developed or made known to the individual during the relationship will be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specified circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions developed by the individual pursuant to their employment are our exclusive property. In the case of consultants, those agreements often provide that inventions developed by the consultant under the agreement are either our exclusive property or provide us a license thereto. These agreements may not provide meaningful protection if unauthorized use or disclosure of such information occurs.
We also rely on trade secrets and unpatented know how to protect our proprietary technology and may be vulnerable to competitors who attempt to copy our products or gain access to our trade secrets and know how.
We are party to license agreements under which we license patents and technology covering certain aspects of our products. For example, we have an amended vascular laser angioplasty catheter license agreement with SurModics, Inc., under which SurModics has granted us a worldwide non-exclusive license to use a lubricious coating that is applied to our products using certain SurModics patents. We currently pay SurModics royalties as a specified percentage of net sales of products using its patents, subject to a quarterly minimum royalty. The license agreement expires on the later of the expiration of the last licensed patent or the fifteenth anniversary of the date a licensed product is first sold unless terminated earlier under certain circumstances, including if the royalties we pay SurModics are not greater than specified levels. In 2016, we incurred royalties of approximately $1.4 million to SurModics under this license agreement.
In December 2009, we entered into a license agreement with Peter Rentrop, M.D. As part of the agreement, we received a worldwide, exclusive license to certain patents and patent applications owned by Dr. Rentrop, which, in general, apply to laser catheters with a tip diameter less than one millimeter. We pay Dr. Rentrop royalties of a specified percentage of net sales of products using his patents subject to a quarterly minimum royalty. The license agreement expires in January 2020, unless terminated earlier in accordance with its terms. In 2016, we incurred royalties of approximately $3.0 million to Dr. Rentrop under this license agreement.
In March 2010, AngioScore entered into a development and license agreement with InnoRa GmbH, Ulrich Speck and Bruno Scheller. As part of the agreement, AngioScore received an exclusive license to certain InnoRa intellectual property related to drug coatings of certain balloon catheters in the field of the treatment of coronary artery disease and peripheral arterial disease, and AngioScore obtained ownership of any new technology developed under the agreement. AngioScore pays InnoRa royalties of a specified percentage of net sales of products developed under the agreement. The exclusive rights granted by InnoRa are subject to AngioScore meeting certain milestones. If AngioScore does not satisfy the milestones, then the exclusive license rights will convert to a non-exclusive license, and AngioScore will license certain new technology developed under the agreement to InnoRa. In 2016, AngioScore incurred an immaterial amount in royalties under this license agreement.
Third-Party Reimbursement
U.S. Third-Party Reimbursement
Reimbursement remains an important strategic consideration in the development and marketing of medical devices and procedures. We rely on appropriate insurance reimbursement to create favorable markets for our products, while providers depend on this reimbursement to incorporate new products into their medical practices. Failure to obtain insurance coverage or appropriate reimbursement can be significant barriers to the commercial success of a new product or procedure. The consequences can include slow adoption in the marketplace and inadequate payment levels that can continue over periods of time. 
Our products are purchased principally by hospitals or physicians, which typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care 
 9

plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. Most third-party payers cover and reimburse for procedures using our products.
Our customers are typically reimbursed on a fixed fee, or prospective payment basis rather than at cost. This incentivizes customers to purchase the least costly device, though quality and efficacy are usually factors in the purchasing decision. Additional reimbursement is sometimes available for higher cost, newer technology, for a period of time.
International Third-Party Reimbursement
Market acceptance of our products in international markets is dependent in part upon the availability of reimbursement from healthcare payment systems.  Reimbursement and healthcare payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country.  The main types of healthcare payment systems in international markets are government-sponsored healthcare and private insurance.  Countries with government-sponsored healthcare, such as the United Kingdom, have a centralized, nationalized healthcare system.  New devices are brought into the system through negotiations between departments at individual hospitals at the time of budgeting.  In many foreign countries, there are also private insurance systems that may offer payments for alternative therapies.
Government Regulation 
Overview of Medical Device Regulation. Our products are medical devices subject to extensive regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”). FDA regulations govern, among other things, the following activities related to our products: 

• | product design, development, manufacture and testing;


• | pre-clinical and clinical studies;


• | product labeling;


• | product storage;


• | premarket clearance or approval;


• | recordkeeping;


• | marketing, advertising and promotion;


• | product sales and distribution; and


• | post-market safety reporting.


The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III-based on the degree of risk the FDA determines to be associated with a device and the level of regulatory control deemed necessary to ensure the device’s safety and effectiveness. Most Class I devices and some Class II devices are exempt from pre-market review and can be marketed without prior authorization from the FDA. Most of our products are Class II non-exempt medical devices and must either be approved through an application for Premarket Approval (“PMA”) or be found “substantially equivalent” by the FDA (following the agency’s review pursuant to Section 510(k) of the FDCA) to a legally marketed medical device not subject to a PMA. The PMA pathway is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the 510(k) process.
After a device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply, such as FDA labeling regulations and Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) regulations, that prohibit promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses, the Medical Device Reporting regulation that requires reporting to the FDA of devices that may have malfunctioned or contributed to a death or serious injury, and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation that requires the reporting of recalls and field actions to the FDA.
 10

The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from a public untitled, “it has come to our attention” letter, or warning letter to more severe sanctions such as:

• | fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;


• | recall or seizure of products;


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;


• | refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA of new products;


• | withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMAs already granted; and


• | criminal prosecution.

International Regulations.   International sales of our products are subject to foreign regulations, including health and medical safety regulations. The regulatory review process varies from country to country. Many countries also impose product standards, packaging and labeling requirements and import restrictions on devices. 
The Medical Device Directive (“MDD”) is a directive that covers the regulatory requirements for medical devices in the European Union and, upon successful completion, the MDD process results in the approval to apply for a CE mark. We have received CE mark registration for the majority of our current products. The CE mark indicates a product is certified for sale throughout the European Union and that the manufacturer of the product complies with applicable safety and quality standards. 

Environmental Regulations.   We are also subject to certain federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous substance controls, among others. Compliance with such environmental regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures or competitive position. 
Corporate Compliance and Corporate Integrity Agreement. We have processes, policies and procedures designed to maintain compliance with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations governing our operations. We entered a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the Office of Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“OIG”) in December 2009 to resolve a federal investigation. The CIA was completed in April 2015.
Product Liability Insurance 

Our business entails the risk of product liability claims. We maintain product liability insurance for $25 million per occurrence with an annual aggregate maximum of $25 million. 
Employees 

As of December 31, 2016, we had 960 full time employees worldwide, an increase from 892 at December 31, 2015, primarily due to continued overall growth.
