ITEM 1: Business
General

Shire plc and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as either “Shire” or the “Company”) is the leading global biotechnology company focused on serving people with rare diseases and other highly specialized conditions.
The Company has grown both organically and through acquisition, completing a series of major transactions that have brought therapeutic, geographic and pipeline growth and diversification. The Company will continue to conduct its own research and development (R&D) focused on rare diseases, as well as evaluate companies, products and pipeline opportunities that offer a strategic fit and have the potential to deliver value to all of the Company’s stakeholders, including patients, physicians, policy makers, payers, partners, investors and employees.
Strategy 
Shire's mission is to develop and deliver breakthrough therapies for people around the world affected by rare diseases, and those with highly specialized conditions, who lack effective therapies to live their lives to the fullest.
With the acquisition and integration of Baxalta, Shire has solidified its leadership position in rare diseases with a robust inline portfolio, innovative pipeline and global commercial infrastructure. 
Business Model
The Company strives to develop best-in-class products, many of which are available in more than 100 countries, across core therapeutic areas including Immunology, Hematology, Neuroscience, Internal Medicine, Genetic Diseases, Oncology and Ophthalmics.
Shire's business is managed through guidance from the Board of Directors (Board), the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and the Executive Committee, with support from its Inline Committee, Pipeline Committee and Corporate Committee, which comprise senior management from across functions to support the inline products, pipeline activities and other corporate related activities, respectively. 
The principal purpose of the Board is to provide leadership to the Company in a manner that promotes its long-term success, creating sustainable value for the benefit of shareholders and other stakeholders. The Board, with input from management, determines the strategy and the Board is responsible for overseeing its implementation by management. In doing so, the Board works closely with management to ensure that a culture of integrity, responsibility and patient focus exists throughout the organization. In addition, the Board has oversight of all material matters impacting the Company and its operations including key policies, significant financial matters, mergers and acquisitions, risk management and succession planning. 
The Executive Committee assists the CEO in managing Shire’s business operations, ensuring that they are run within the governance framework established by the Board. In doing so, the Executive Committee supports the implementation of the Company’s strategy and deliberates matters that are material from a risk, financial, reputational and strategic perspective. 
Shire's Inline Committee focuses exclusively on the commercial execution of its marketed products to ensure that the Company services the needs of its customers and patients, as efficiently as possible; while Shire’s Pipeline Committee focuses on advancing the pre-clinical and clinical development pipeline, targeting rare diseases and highly specialized conditions with high unmet need. These cross-functional committees ensure Shire explores and develops opportunities built upon its core capabilities, priority commercial franchises and also seeks to explore related and emerging areas.
Shire's Corporate Committee provides oversight, input and decision-making for corporate cross-functional matters not covered by the Inline Committee and Pipeline Committee.

Shire drives growth by investing in internal research and development and through acquisitions, in-licensing and new product development opportunities. Shire’s global corporate development team searches for new technologies, innovative products and strategic partnerships. The team engages in conversations with scientists and entrepreneurs on a global basis, while collaborating with commercial and R&D experts throughout the Company.
In 2018, the Company announced the Board concluded that the Neuroscience franchise warrants additional focus and investment and that there is a strong rationale for creating two distinct divisions within Shire: a Rare Disease division and a Neuroscience division.  The Company will implement the new divisional structure with effect from January 1, 2018.

HEMATOLOGY PRODUCTS
Treatments for Bleeding Disorders
Bleeding disorders affect the blood clotting (coagulation) process so that it does not work properly. As a result, people with bleeding disorders can bleed for longer than normal, and some may experience spontaneous bleeding into joints, muscles, or other parts of their bodies. Bleeding disorders range in severity from mild to severe and are usually inherited, though some can be acquired. The coagulation process involves blood platelets and a variety of proteins known as clotting factors. For individuals with bleeding disorders, these factors are produced at a lower level or can even be missing.
There are two forms of hemophilia, the most common type being hemophilia A. This occurs when a person does not have enough clotting Factor VIII (factor eight). Hemophilia B is less common. A person with hemophilia B does not have enough Factor IX (factor nine). The result is the same for people with hemophilia A and B; that is, they bleed for a longer time than normal. Hemophilia is usually congenital but can be acquired. Acquired hemophilia is an autoimmune disorder. It occurs when the immune system produces antibodies that mistakenly attack clotting factors.
10

ADVATE
ADVATE [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)] is a recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII) therapy. ADVATE is a recombinant antihemophilic factor indicated for use in adults and children with hemophilia A (congenital Factor VIII deficiency) for control and prevention of bleeding episodes, perioperative management and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. It was approved in the U.S. in 2003 and the EU in 2004. As of December 31, 2017, it was approved in 69 countries worldwide.
ADYNOVATE/ADYNOVI
ADYNOVATE/ADYNOVI is an extended half­life rFVIII treatment for hemophilia A based on ADVATE. ADYNOVATE/ADYNOVI uses the same manufacturing process as ADVATE and adds a proven technology, PEGylation (a chemical process that prolongs the amount of time a compound remains in circulation, potentially allowing for fewer injections), which Shire has exclusively licensed from Nektar Therapeutics. ADYNOVATE was approved in the U.S. in November 2015 and in Japan in April 2016. It was approved under the name ADYNOVI in the EU in January 2018 and in Switzerland in September 2016. 
RIXUBIS
RIXUBIS [Coagulation Factor IX (Recombinant)] was launched in the U.S. in 2013 for the treatment of hemophilia B. RIXUBIS is an injectable medicine used to replace clotting Factor IX that is missing in people with hemophilia B. RIXUBIS was approved in the EU in December 2014 and Japan in February 2016. As of December 31, 2017, RIXUBIS was approved in 46 countries.
Inhibitor Therapies
Inhibitors cause serious medical problems that can occur when a person with hemophilia has an immune response to treatment with clotting factor concentrates. The immune system defends the body from harmful germs and viruses. Sometimes in the case of an inhibitor, a person's immune system reacts to proteins in factor concentrates as if they were harmful foreign substances because the body has never seen them before. When this happens, inhibitors (also called antibodies) form in the blood to fight against the foreign factor proteins. This stops the factor concentrates from being able to fix the bleeding problem.
Bleeding is very hard to control in someone with hemophilia who develops inhibitors. A person with inhibitors faces more bleeding and pain because treatment with factor concentrates is ineffective. In patients with persistent inhibitors, if bleeding into the muscles and joints is not controlled, permanent joint damage is likely.
Treatment of inhibitors is one of the biggest challenges in hemophilia today. It is possible to get rid of inhibitors using a technique called immune tolerance induction, which has become the standard of care in medically advanced countries. However, this type of treatment requires specialized medical expertise, is expensive and can take a long time. Drugs called bypassing agents can be used to work around inhibitors and help blood clot.
FEIBA
FEIBA (Activated Prothrombin Complex Concentrate - aPCC) is a plasma­ based inhibitor bypass therapy, currently FEIBA is the only agent indicated for use in all three settings; on demand, prophylaxis and surgery. FEIBA can be used in both hemophilia A and hemophilia B patients with inhibitors for control of spontaneous bleeding episodes, to cover surgical interventions and routine prophylaxis to prevent or reduce the frequency of bleeding episodes. FEIBA was first approved in the U.S. in 1986, and as of December 31, 2017 was approved in 73 countries. In a number of markets (not the U.S.), FEIBA is also approved for acquired hemophilia.
Treatments for von Willebrand Disease
Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a hereditary bleeding disorder that is caused by deficiency or dysfunction of von Willebrand factor (VWF), a plasma protein that mediates the initial adhesion of platelets at sites of vascular injury and also carries and protects Factor VIII from premature proteolysis. Because of this, the blood does not clot properly, resulting in heavy menstrual periods, easy bruising, or frequent nose bleeds.
11

VONVENDI
VONVENDI/VEYVONDI is a recombinant von Willebrand factor (VWF) and is used to replace the VWF the body is missing in von Willebrand disease. VONVENDI is a first in class recombinant factor and was approved by the FDA in December 2015, for on-demand treatment and control of bleeding episodes in adults 18 years and above with VWD. VONVENDI/VEYVONDI can also be given independent of recombinant Factor VIII (rFVIII), based on patient need. This attribute allows for tailored treatment for patients who may not require additional FVIII. Veyvondi is under regulatory review in EU.
Other Hematology Products
The Company has a number of other marketed products in its Hematology portfolio (e.g., HEMOFIL M, RECOMBINATE and IMMUNATE for hemophilia A, OBIZUR for acquired hemophilia A, PROTHROMPLEX TOTAL for acquired deficiency and congenital deficiency of coagulation factors, IMMUNINE for hemophilia B).
GENETIC DISEASES PRODUCTS
Treatments for Lysosomal Storage Diseases
Lysosomal storage diseases (LSD) are a group of approximately 50 inherited metabolic diseases that are characterized by an abnormal build-up of various toxic materials in the body's cells.
A lysosome is a subcellular organelle found in nearly all types of cells that is responsible for the enzymatic digestion of macromolecules (e.g. lipids, glycoproteins and mucopolysaccharides). Lysosomal disorders are usually triggered when a particular enzyme is missing or exists in too small an amount to enable the complete breakdown of the macromolecules. When this happens, waste substances accumulate in the cell. Each LSD is characterized by the nature of the substances that accumulate and their effects on the body.
Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) is an approach to treating LSDs whereby patients are given the particular enzyme that is deficient or absent.
REPLAGAL
REPLAGAL is an enzyme replacement marketed for the treatment of Fabry disease outside of the U.S. Fabry disease is a rare, inherited genetic disorder resulting from a deficiency in the activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-galactosidase A, which is involved in the breakdown of fats. Although the signs and symptoms of Fabry disease vary widely from patient to patient, the most common include severe pain of the extremities, impaired kidney function which often progresses to kidney failure, early heart disease, stroke and disabling gastrointestinal symptoms.
REPLAGAL is a fully human alpha-galactosidase A protein made in a human cell line which is designed to replace the deficient alpha-galactosidase A with an active enzyme to ameliorate certain clinical manifestations of Fabry disease.
In August 2001, REPLAGAL was granted marketing authorization in the EU. As of December 31, 2017, REPLAGAL was approved in 58 countries, excluding the U.S.
VPRIV
VPRIV is an enzyme replacement treatment for Type 1 Gaucher disease. Gaucher disease is a rare, inherited genetic disorder which results in a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme beta-glucocerebrosidase. This enzymatic deficiency causes an accumulation of glucocerebroside, primarily in macrophages called Gaucher cells in the liver, spleen, bone marrow and other organs. The accumulation of glucocerebrosidase in Gaucher cells in the liver and spleen leads to organomegaly. Presence of Gaucher cells in the bone marrow and spleen leads to clinically significant anemia and thrombocytopenia.
VPRIV was approved by the FDA in February 2010, for long term enzyme replacement therapy for patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved the marketing authorization for the use of VPRIV in August 2010. VPRIV has been granted orphan drug status in the EU with up to 12 years of market exclusivity from August 2010. As of December 31, 2017, VPRIV was approved in 54 countries.
12

ELAPRASE
ELAPRASE is an enzyme replacement treatment for Hunter syndrome (also known as Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II or MPS II). Hunter syndrome is a rare, inherited genetic disorder mainly affecting males that interferes with the body's ability to break down and recycle waste substances. In patients with Hunter syndrome, cumulative build-up of GAGs in cells throughout the body interferes with the way certain tissues and organs function, leading to severe clinical complications and early mortality. 
ELAPRASE was approved by the FDA in July 2006 and granted marketing authorization by the EMA in January 2007 for the long term treatment of patients with Hunter syndrome. ELAPRASE benefits from the 12 years of data exclusivity from the date of grant of registration given to innovator biologics in the U.S. under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).
ELAPRASE received approval from the Ministry of Health Labour and Welfare (MHLW) in Japan in October 2007. As part of an agreement with Genzyme, Genzyme manages the sales and distribution of ELAPRASE in Japan as well as certain other countries in the Asia Pacific region. As of December 31, 2017, ELAPRASE was approved in 71 countries.
Information about litigation related to ELAPRASE can be found in ITEM 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 25, Legal and Other Proceedings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
NEUROSCIENCE PRODUCTS
Treatments for ADHD
ADHD is a chronic neurobehavioral disorder that manifests as a persistent pattern of inattention and/or hyperactivity-impulsivity that is more frequent and severe than is typically observed in individuals at a comparable level of development. Although there is no cure for ADHD, there are accepted treatments that have been demonstrated to improve symptoms. Standard treatments include educational approaches, psychological therapies that may include behavior modification, and/or medication.
VYVANSE
VYVANSE is a stimulant for the treatment of ADHD, where the amino acid l-lysine is linked to d-amphetamine. VYVANSE is therapeutically inactive until metabolized in the body.
The FDA approved VYVANSE as a once-daily treatment for children aged 6 to 12 with ADHD in February 2007, for adults in April 2008 and for adolescents aged 13 to 17 in November 2010. In addition, VYVANSE became the first drug in its class to be approved by the FDA for maintenance treatment, having been approved both as a maintenance treatment in adults with ADHD in January 2012, and for maintenance treatment in pediatrics and adolescents aged 6 to 17 in April 2013. VYVANSE is available in the U.S. in seven dosage strengths and in two different formulations capsules and chewable.
The product is approved and marketed in selected European countries, Australia, Canada and Latin America under a variety of trade names VYVANSE/VENVANSE/ELVANSE/TYVENSE/VUXEN/ADUVANZ.
VYVANSE was also approved in the U.S. in January 2015 as the first and only treatment of moderate to severe binge eating disorder (BED) in adults. BED is defined as recurring episodes (more than once weekly), for at least three months, of consuming a large amount of food in a short time, compared with others. VYVANSE was approved for the treatment of BED in Canada in October 2016.
ADDERALL XR
ADDERALL XR is an extended release treatment for ADHD and is designed to provide once-daily dosing. The FDA approved ADDERALL XR as a once-daily treatment for children aged 6 to 12 with ADHD in October 2001, for adults in August 2004 and for adolescents aged 13 to 17 in July 2005.
13

MYDAYIS
MYDAYIS (mixed salts of a single-entity amphetamine product), a once-daily, extended-release treatment comprised of three types of drug-releasing beads, is now available for prescription in the United States. The FDA approved MYDAYIS on June 20, 2017 for patients 13 years and older with ADHD. MYDAYIS is not for use in children 12 years and younger.
Information about litigation related to MYDAYIS can be found in ITEM 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 25, Legal and Other Proceedings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Other Neuroscience Products
The Company has a number of other products for the treatment of Neuroscience conditions (e.g., INTUNIV and EQUASYM for ADHD and BUCCOLAM for convulsive seizures).
IMMUNOLOGY PRODUCTS
Treatments for Primary Immunodeficiency
Primary immunodeficiencies (PID) are a group of more than 300 disorders in which part of the body's immune system is missing or does not function properly. Normally, the immune system protects the body from pathogenic microorganisms like bacteria, viruses, and fungi, which can cause infectious diseases. When any part of a person's immune system is absent or dysfunctional, the individuals are susceptible to infections, and it may take longer to recover from infections. When a defect in the immune system is inherited and genetically determined, it is called primary immunodeficiency. 
GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG
GAMMAGARD LIQUID [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human) 10%] is a liquid formulation of the antibody­replacement therapy immunoglobulin product. It was originally approved by the FDA in September 2005. GAMMAGARD LIQUID is used to treat adult and pediatric patients two years of age or older with PID and can be administered either intravenously or subcutaneously. GAMMAGARD LIQUID is also used to treat adult patients with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) administered intravenously. It can be administered either intravenously or subcutaneously. KIOVIG is the brand name used for GAMMAGARD LIQUID outside of the U.S. KIOVIG is approved in Europe for use by patients with PID and certain secondary immunodeficiencies, and for adults with MMN. As of December 31, 2017, GAMMAGARD LIQUID/KIOVIG was approved in 72 countries.
GAMMAGARD S/D
GAMMAGARD S/D [Immune Globulin Intravenous (Human)] IgA less than 1 µg/mL in a 5% solution is indicated for the treatment of PID in patients two years old and older. GAMMAGARD S/D is also indicated for prevention of bacterial infections in hypogammaglobulinemia and/or recurrent bacterial infections associated with B­cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), treatment of adult patients with chronic idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) to increase platelet count and to prevent and/or control bleeding, and prevention of coronary artery aneurysms associated with Kawasaki Syndrome in pediatric patients. GAMMAGARD S/D is provided for patients who require a low IgA content in their IV treatment (IgA less than 1 µg/mL in a 5% solution). GAMMAGARD S/D was initially approved in the U.S. in 1994. As of December 31, 2017, GAMMAGARD S/D was approved in 22 countries.

HYQVIA
HYQVIA [Immune Globulin Infusion 10% (Human) with Recombinant Human Hyaluronidase] is a product consisting of human normal immunoglobulin (IG) and recombinant human hyaluronidase (licensed from Halozyme). The IG provides the therapeutic effect and the recombinant human hyaluronidase facilitates the dispersion and absorption of the IG administered subcutaneously, increasing its bioavailability. The IG is a 10% solution that is prepared from human plasma consisting of at least 98% immunoglobulin G, which contains a broad spectrum of antibodies. HYQVIA is the only subcutaneous IG treatment for PID patients with a dosing regimen requiring only one infusion up to once per month and one injection site per infusion to deliver a full therapeutic dose of IG. HYQVIA is approved in Europe for use by patients with PID syndromes and myeloma or CLL with severe secondary hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections, and in the United States for adults with PID. HYQVIA was approved in Europe in May 2013 and the U.S. in September 2014. As of December 31, 2017, HYQVIA was approved in 26 countries.

CUVITRU is the only 20% subcutaneous IG treatment option without proline and with the ability to infuse up to 60 mL (12 grams) per site and 60 mL per hour, per site as tolerated, resulting in fewer infusion sites and shorter infusion durations compared to other conventional subcutaneous IG treatments. CUVITRU was approved in the U.S. in September 2016. A decentralized procedure (DCP) to support approval by 17 authorities in Europe was successfully completed in June 2016. As of December 31, 2017, CUVITRU was approved in 21 countries.
Biotherapeutic Products
Albumin Products
Human albumin, produced in the liver, is an essential protein found in human plasma and accounts for about 50% to 60% of plasma proteins. The primary functions of albumin are to maintain intravascular oncotic pressure, serve as a free radical scavenger and to facilitate transportation of substances such as fatty acids, hormones, bile salt, bilirubin, metals and therapeutic drugs. When plasma volume is drastically reduced, serum albumin supplementation can help restore the losses. The key indication of albumin is the restoration and maintenance of circulating blood volume in situations such as trauma, surgery, blood loss, hypoalbuminemia and burn management.
FLEXBUMIN/Human Albumin
FLEXBUMIN (Human Albumin in a bag) and Human Albumin (glass) are available as 5% and 25% solutions. Both products are indicated for hypovolemia, hypoalbuminemia due to general causes and burns, and for use during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery as a component of the pump prime. FLEXBUMIN 25% is also indicated for hypoalbuminemia associated with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and nephrosis, and hemolytic disease of the newborn (HDN). FLEXBUMIN was first approved in the U.S. in 2005. As of December 31, 2017, FLEXBUMIN was approved in 51 countries.
Treatments for Hereditary Angioedema (HAE)
Hereditary Angioedema is a rare, debilitating genetic inflammatory condition, which causes episodes of swelling in the face, extremities, and gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can be life threatening. 
15

CINRYZE
CINRYZE (C1 esterase inhibitor (human)) is a C1 esterase inhibitor therapy for routine prophylaxis against HAE attacks. CINRYZE is marketed and sold in the U.S. for routine prophylaxis against HAE attacks in adolescent and adult patients with HAE. CINRYZE enjoys U.S. biological data exclusivity until October 2020. CINRYZE includes a self-administration option for appropriately trained patients. In June 2011, marketing authorization in the EU was granted for CINRYZE in adults and adolescents with HAE for routine prevention, pre-procedure prevention and acute treatment of angioedema attacks. In March 2017, the European Commission approved a label extension for routine prevention of angioedema attacks in children (ages six years and above) with severe and recurrent attacks of HAE who are intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral preventions treatments, or patients who are inadequately managed with repeated acute treatment. The EC also approved CINRYZE for the treatment and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks in children (ages two years and above) with HAE. As of December 31, 2017, CINRYZE was approved in 36 countries.
FIRAZYR
FIRAZYR (icatibant injection) is a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist developed for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE. In July 2008, the EC granted marketing authorization throughout the EU for the use of FIRAZYR for the symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of HAE in adults, and in March 2011 approved FIRAZYR for self-administration after training in subcutaneous injection technique by a healthcare professional. In August 2011, the FDA granted marketing approval for FIRAZYR in the U.S. for treatment of acute attacks of HAE in adults aged 18 and older and, after injection training, patients may self-administer FIRAZYR. FIRAZYR has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by both the FDA and the EMA, providing it with up to seven and ten years market exclusivity in the U.S. and EU, respectively, from the date of the grant of the relevant marketing authorization. On October 26, 2017, Shire announced that the EC approved a label extension for FIRAZYR (icatibant injection), broadening its use to adolescents and children aged 2 years and older, with HAE caused by C1-esterase-inhibitor (C1-INH) deficiency. As of December 31, 2017, FIRAZYR was approved in 45 countries.

INTERNAL MEDICINE PRODUCTS
GATTEX/REVESTIVE
SBS results from a significant resection of the intestine that may have been caused by Crohn’s Disease, vascular thrombosis, cancer and/or other conditions. Most SBS patients have to rely on parenteral support to survive (up to six days per week and 8 to 12 hours per day). Parenteral support does not address the issue of malabsorption and is associated with serious life-threatening complications including infections, blood clots, and liver damage. Gattex/Revestive enables patients with SBS to increase absorption and thereby reduce their need for parenteral nutrition with the opportunity to wean off it.
GATTEX/REVESTIVE (teduglutide [rDNA origin]) for injection is the first prescription medicine for the long-term treatment of adults with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support. SBS is an ultra rare condition in which a large portion of the intestine has been removed by surgery. As a result, people cannot absorb enough nutrients or fluids from food and liquids to maintain good health. SBS can also be caused by disease or injury that prevents the small intestine from functioning properly despite normal length. To make up for the inadequate absorption, intravenous (IV) feeding (parenteral support) may be prescribed to help the patient stay healthy. GATTEX/REVESTIVE may help the remaining intestine absorb more fluids and reduce the need for parenteral support. GATTEX was approved by the FDA in December 2012. REVESTIVE was approved in the EU in August 2012. As of December 31, 2017, GATTEX/REVESTIVE was launched in the U.S., Canada, Sweden, Germany, Norway, France, Austria, Finland, Spain and Switzerland.
16

NATPARA/NATPAR
NATPARA (parathyroid hormone) for injection is indicated as an adjunct to calcium and vitamin D to control hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism (HPT). HPT is a rare condition in which the parathyroid glands fail to produce sufficient amounts of parathyroid hormone (PTH) or where the PTH lacks biologic activity. In patients with HPT, insufficient levels of PTH lead to many physiological abnormalities, including low serum calcium and an inability to convert native vitamin D into its active state to properly absorb dietary calcium. Acute symptoms of HPT are largely due to low serum calcium and range from muscle pain and tingling, to lack of focus or ability to concentrate, and anxiety and depression. In extreme cases, life-threatening events, such as arrhythmias and seizures, may occur. 
NATPARA was approved by the FDA in January 2015. NATPARA has been granted orphan drug exclusivity by the FDA. NATPARA also benefits from the 12 years of data exclusivity from the date of registration given to innovator biologics in the U.S. under the ACA. NATPAR was granted conditional marketing authorization in Europe by CHMP in April 2017. As of December 31, 2017, NATPAR/A was launched in the U.S., Germany, Norway, Denmark, Austria and Sweden. 
LIALDA/MEZAVANT
Ulcerative Colitis (UC) is a serious chronic inflammatory disease of the colon in which part or all of the large intestine becomes inflamed and often ulcerated. 
LIALDA is approved for the induction of remission in patients with active mild to moderate UC and for the maintenance of remission of UC. LIALDA is marketed in certain territories outside the U.S. by Shire under the trade name MEZAVANT and MEZAVANT XL. As of December 31, 2017, LIALDA/MEZAVANT was commercially available in 31 countries either directly or through distributor arrangements. A generic version of LIALDA is now available in the U.S.

SHP677 (VONVENDI) for the treatment of von Willebrand disease
VONVENDI is the first recombinant therapy providing a pure von Willebrand disease factor with customized dosing. The Company received U.S. regulatory approval in December 2015 and the product was broadly available in the U.S. in late 2016. A surgery clinical study, which is required for filing in Europe, was completed in the fourth quarter of 2016. In June 2017, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for VEYVONDI to prevent and treat bleeding episodes and peri-operative bleeding in adults (age 18 and older) diagnosed with von Willebrand Disease. The product is currently under regulatory review in the EU.
Immunology
SHP643 for the treatment of HAE
SHP643 is a Phase 3 novel long-acting human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of plasma kallikrein (pKal). SHP643 has received Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, and Orphan Drug Designations by the FDA and received Orphan Drug Designation in the EU. On May 18, 2017 Shire announced positive topline data from the Phase 3 HELP study of SHP643 in patients with HAE. The HELP study met all primary and secondary efficacy endpoints for all SHP643 treatment arms vs. placebo (on demand therapy allowed) with a favorable safety profile. The program has completed Phase 3 / pivotal trials and is awaiting further regulatory action. 
SHP667 (FIRAZYR) for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE in Japan
The final results of the Phase 3 Japan study demonstrated that the efficacy and safety profile of FIRAZYR for the acute treatment of HAE attacks was similar between Japanese patients and those patients who participated in Shire’s previously conducted Phase 3 program. Shire filed a JNDA for the treatment of acute attacks of HAE in July 2017.
Internal Medicine
SHP555 prucalopride; marketed as RESOLOR in the EU for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation (CIC) in the U.S.
RESOLOR was approved in 2009 in Europe for use in women for the symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief. In June 2015, Shire announced that prucalopride has been approved by the EC for use in adults (men and women) for the symptomatic treatment of chronic constipation in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate relief. Shire has discussed with the FDA the requirements for filing an NDA for prucalopride. The program has completed Phase 3 / pivotal trials and is awaiting further regulatory action. 
Neuroscience
SHP489 (VYVANSE) for the treatment of ADHD in Japan
LDX is currently marketed as VYVANSE in the U.S. and ELVANSE in certain countries in the EU for the treatment of ADHD. Shionogi and Shire are co-developing and will sell ADHD products in Japan, including LDX.

Phase 3
Hematology
SHP672 (OBIZUR) CHAWI SURGERY for patients with congenital hemophilia A with inhibitors undergoing surgery
OBIZUR is a recombinant porcine sequence FVIII (rpFVIII), from which major parts of the B-domain have been deleted (BDD). OBIZUR is sufficiently similar to human FVIII in promoting hemostasis and for monitoring the FVIII levels and different enough in structure to render it less susceptible to inactivation by circulating inhibitory antibodies to human FVIII. Patients with inhibitors are at risk of perioperative bleeding complications, presenting therapeutic challenges in elective or emergency surgery. The CHAWI surgery study was initiated in July 2016 and enrollment is ongoing. This is an important trial as patients with inhibitors are at risk of perioperative bleeding complications, presenting therapeutic challenges in elective or emergency surgery. Additionally, some patients do not respond well to bypassing agents and the inability to measure FVIII levels in Acquired Hemophilia A (AHA) patients continues to be a clinical challenge in treating AHA patients. When OBIZUR is used, the clinician can measure FVIII levels.
SHP655 rADAMTS13 for the acute treatment and long-term prophylaxis of cTTP
SHP655 is a recombinant human ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) protein for the acute treatment and long-term prophylaxis of cTTP, a rare, ultra-orphan condition. SHP655 will be assessed as a replacement therapy for cTTP. Phase 1/2 has been completed, and Phase 3 has been initiated and the first patient enrolled in the fourth quarter of 2017. 
Genetic Diseases
SHP609 for the treatment of Hunter syndrome with CNS symptoms
SHP609 is in development as an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) delivered intrathecally for the treatment of Hunter syndrome patients with early cognitive impairment. Hunter syndrome is a Lysosomal Storage Disorder.  In December 2014, the FDA granted SHP609 Fast Track Designation. In addition, this product has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. The Company has initiated a pivotal Phase 2/3 clinical trial which completed enrollment in September 2016. Topline data were received in December 2017 and the study did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints. The extension study is ongoing.
22

Immunology
SHP616 SC life cycle management for CINRYZE
Shire is pursuing a subcutaneous formulation of C1 esterase inhibitor for routine prophylaxis against HAE attacks in adolescent and adult patients. On September 11, 2017, Shire announced positive topline Phase 3 results for the SAHARA study, a trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered C1 esterase inhibitor [human] Liquid for Injection in patients with HAE. The SAHARA study met its primary and all key secondary endpoints with a favorable safety profile, significantly reducing Hereditary Angioedema monthly attack rate versus placebo.
SHP616 (CINRYZE) for routine prophylaxis and treatment of acute attacks in adolescent and adult patients with HAE in Japan
CINRYZE is indicated in the U.S. for prophylaxis and in the EU for both prophylaxis and acute treatment of angioedema attacks in adolescent and adult patients with HAE. Based on feedback from the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA), a Clinical Trial Notification (CTN) was resubmitted with inclusion of self-administration in 2016 and the Phase 3 clinical trial is being completed.
SHP671 CIDP (HYQVIA) for patients with Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and PID in pediatric patients
Shire is undertaking efforts to expand indications for HYQVIA, including for the treatment of CIDP, a neurological disorder characterized by progressive weakness and impaired sensory function in the legs and arms. A Phase 3 clinical trial is currently enrolling. A Phase 3 clinical trial in pediatric patients with PID is ongoing. 
SHP616 for the treatment of Antibody Mediated Rejection
A Phase 2 study for the treatment of Antibody Mediated Rejection (AMR) with SHP616 has been completed. Shire has received FDA and EMA feedback and submitted an IND in the second quarter of 2015. The FDA granted Fast Track Designation for SHP616 in October 2015, and Shire is currently enrolling a Phase 3 study for the treatment of acute AMR in kidney transplant patients.
SHP620 maribavir for the treatment of CMV infection in transplant patients
Shire has completed two Phase 2 studies of maribavir in transplant recipients with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Maribavir has been granted Orphan Drug Designation in the U.S. In June 2015, Shire met with the FDA and received feedback on a proposed path forward. Shire is currently enrolling two Phase 3 studies, one for the treatment of CMV infection in bone marrow transplant recipients and a second study for the treatment of transplant recipients (bone marrow or solid organ transplant) with CMV infection refractory or resistant to currently available anti-CMV therapies.
Internal Medicine
SHP621 Budesonide Oral Suspension (BOS), for the treatment of adolescents and adults with Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)
BOS is a proprietary viscous oral formulation of budesonide that is designed to coat the esophagus where the drug can act locally. The FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation to BOS for the treatment of patients with EoE. In addition, in May 2016, the FDA granted SHP621 Breakthrough Therapy Designation. Shire initiated a Phase 3 program for the treatment of adolescents and adults with EoE in the first quarter of 2016 and enrollment is ongoing in both induction and extension studies.
SHP633 (REVESTIVE) for the treatment of SBS
In the U.S., SHP633 is approved and marketed as GATTEX to treat adult patients with SBS who are dependent on parenteral support; Shire is also preparing for a U.S. pediatric submission in 2018. In Canada and Europe, SHP633 is approved and marketed as REVESTIVE to treat adults with SBS who depend on parenteral support; in Europe, REVESTIVE has also a pediatric indication for children aged one year and above. In Japan, SHP633 is currently being investigated in a Phase 3 bridging study in adults and in children in a pediatric study.
23

SHP647 for the treatment of moderate-to-severe inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
SHP647 is a fully human IgG2k anti-monoclonal antibody that binds to human mucosal addressing cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM) and SHP647 is being evaluated as a once-monthly, selective inhibitor of the gut-specific leukocyte adhesion process delivered by subcutaneous injection. By targeting a unique, gut-specific endothelial adhesion molecule the asset should provide a more selective and potentially safer approach to reducing inflammation associated with IBD. Phase 2 studies in Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and Crohn’s disease (CD) were completed and showed, strong signs of efficacy in UC. Clinical development plans have been discussed with the FDA and EMA, and Shire initiated Phase 3 trials in UC in November 2017 and is working towards initiation of a global clinical Phase 3 development program for CD (expected first half of 2018). 
Neuroscience
SHP615 (BUCCOLAM) Convulsive Seizures Japan
BUCCOLAM is the first and only licensed (EU) buccally administered midazolam for treatment of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in infants, toddlers, children and adolescents (three months to 18 years). In Japan, this product will be developed for the treatment of Status Epilepticus by caregivers or HCPs in hospital and community settings. The decision to bring Buccolam to Japan is a consequence of the “unapproved drug request” from MHLW to Shire on behalf of advocacy groups requesting for the drug to be provided in Japan. A Phase 3 study started in 2017 and is ongoing. 
Ophthalmics
SHP640 for the treatment of infectious conjunctivitis 
SHP640 is a therapy in late-stage development for the treatment of infectious conjunctivitis, an ocular surface condition commonly referred to as pink eye. Shire met with the FDA in the second quarter of 2016 to discuss a program in bacterial conjunctivitis, and has adapted the program plan based on FDA feedback. Based on the feedback from the FDA meeting, Shire initiated the Phase 3 program in both adenoviral and bacterial conjunctivitis in the first quarter of 2017 with enrollment ongoing. 
Phase 2
Immunology
SHP652 for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus
SHP652 is an investigational immunoregulatory treatment that has completed Phase 2a studies for systemic lupus erythematosus, a disorder in which the immune system attacks healthy tissue. Additional non-clinical work to address FDA’s clinical hold questions on the IND is ongoing. 
Internal Medicine
SHP607 for the prevention of certain complications of prematurity
SHP607 is a 1:1 complex of two recombinant human proteins: insulin-like growth factor 1 (rhIGF-1) and IGF binding protein 3 (rhIGFBP-3). Through continuous IV infusion, SHP607 is designed to replace low endogenous levels of IGF-1 due to premature birth. The program completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in early 2016, in which it assessed the safety and efficacy of the drug product in infants born before 28 weeks. SHP607 did not meet its primary endpoint of reducing the severity of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), a rare eye condition. The study, however, demonstrated clinically relevant effects in secondary endpoints related to the development of severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a chronic lung disease, and severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), a type of brain injury, both of which have lifelong negative implications for normal development. Shire is working with regulatory authorities on the design of the Phase 2b program expected to be initiated in the first half of 2018.

29

Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
Shire purchases, in the ordinary course of business, raw materials and supplies essential to its operations from numerous suppliers around the world, including in the U.S. While efforts are made to diversify Shire’s sources of components and materials, in certain instances Shire acquires components and materials from a sole supplier.
Human plasma is a critical raw material in Shire’s business. The Company believes that its ability to internally and externally source plasma represents a distinctive and flexible infrastructure, which provides the Company a unique capability with respect to the consistent delivery of high quality plasma-based products. Shire owns and operates plasma collection facilities in the U.S. and Austria through its wholly owned subsidiary BioLife Plasma Services L.P. (BioLife). BioLife operates and maintains more than 90 plasma collection facilities in 24 states throughout the U.S. and at seven locations in Austria. Shire also maintains relationships with other plasma suppliers to ensure that it retains the flexibility to meet market demand for its plasma based therapies.
Material Customers

Shire’s three largest trade customers are AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corp and Cardinal Health, Inc., which are based in the U.S. In 2017, these wholesale customers accounted for approximately 10%, 9% and 7% of Product sales, respectively.
Intellectual Property
An important part of the Company’s business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents and trademarks, to the extent available. The Company also relies on trade secrets, proprietary know-how, technological innovations and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain and enhance its competitive position. The Company’s commercial success will depend, in part, upon its ability to obtain and enforce strong patents, to maintain trade secret protection, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others and to comply with the terms of licenses granted to it. The Company’s policy is to seek patent protection for proprietary technology whenever possible in the U.S., Canada, major European countries and Japan. Where practicable, the Company seeks patent protection in other countries on a selective basis. In all cases, the Company endeavors to either obtain patent protection itself or support patent applications by its licensors.
Regulatory exclusivity can also provide meaningful protection for the Company’s products. Although the World Trade Organization's agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights (TRIPS) requires signatory countries to provide regulatory exclusivity to innovative pharmaceutical products, implementation and enforcement varies widely from country to country. The markets for some of the Company’s currently marketed and potential future products, such as those for rare diseases, are small and where possible the Company has sought and will seek orphan drug designation for products directed to these markets which, if granted, provides regulatory exclusivity for seven years in the U.S. and ten years in the EU from the date of product approval (see Government Regulation below).
In the regular course of business, the Company’s patents may be challenged by third parties. The Company is a party to litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights. Details of material ongoing litigation are provided in ITEM 3: Legal Proceedings and Note 25, Legal and Other Proceedings, to the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
The degree of patent protection afforded to pharmaceutical inventions around the world is uncertain. If patents are granted to other parties that contain claims having a scope that is interpreted by the relevant authorities to cover any of the Company’s products or technologies, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to obtain licenses to such patents or make other arrangements at reasonable cost, if at all.
30

The existence, scope and duration of patent protection varies among the Company’s products and among the different countries where the Company’s products may be sold. They may also change over the course of time as patents are granted or expire, or become extended, modified or revoked. The following table shows the patent numbers that are listed in the Patent and Exclusivity Information Addendum of the FDA’s publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (Orange Book), for some of the Company’s more significant, revenue-generating products approved via an NDA or an NDA under Section 505(b)(2) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act that references a previously approved drug, which are owned by or licensed to the Company and relevant to an understanding of the Company’s business taken as a whole. There may be other patents related to these products, methods of manufacturing, or use of the products in the treatment of particular diseases or conditions that are not listed in the Orange Book. Some of the Company’s other products are biologics which are protected by patents and forms of unpatented confidential information, including manufacturing trade secrets and proprietary know-how, that are not listed in the Orange Book. In addition, expiration dates set forth below do not necessarily reflect possible changes to the patent term afforded by, among other things, patent term extensions in the U.S. or other territories or changes that may result as a consequence of the outcome of litigation or other proceedings. The Company also holds patents in other jurisdictions, such as the EU, Canada and Japan, and has patent applications pending in such jurisdictions, as well as in the U.S.

Potential future competitors include T-1580 from Laboratoire Thea, SECIERA from Sun Pharma, KP-121 from Kala, RGN-259 from RegeneRx and SYL1001 from Sylentis.
Government Regulation

The clinical development, manufacturing and marketing of Shire’s products is subject to significant governmental regulation in the U.S., the EU and other territories. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, the Public Health Service Act and other laws and regulations in the U.S., as well as numerous directives and guidelines in the EU, govern the development, design, non-clinical and clinical research, testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, premarket clearance or approval, adverse event reporting, advertising and promotion of the Company’s products. Product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources. Pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers are also inspected regularly by the FDA.
35

In general, pharmaceutical and biotechnology products must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. Clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the product into healthy human volunteers, the emphasis is on testing for safety (adverse effects), dosage tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. Phase 2 involves studies in a limited patient population to determine the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Once a product is found to be effective and to have an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken with a larger number of patients to provide enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product and to evaluate more fully clinical outcomes. The failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a product under development can delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product.
In order to gain marketing approval the Company must submit to the relevant regulatory authority for review information on the quality (chemistry, manufacturing and pharmaceutical) aspects of the product as well as the non-clinical and clinical data. The FDA undertakes this review for the U.S. In the EU, the review may be undertaken by the following: (i) members of the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use as part of a centralized procedure; (ii) an individual country's regulatory agency, followed by “mutual recognition” of this review by a number of other countries' agencies, depending on the process applicable to the product in question; or (iii) a competent member state’s regulatory agency through a decentralized procedure, an alternative authorization procedure to the “mutual recognition” procedure.
Approval can take several months to several years, or be denied. The approval process can be affected by a number of factors. For example, additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review and may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs. After approval for the initial indication, further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for any additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labelling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect the marketability of a product.
As a condition of approval, the regulatory agency will require that the product continues to meet regulatory requirements as to quality, safety and efficacy and will require strict procedures to monitor and report any adverse effects. Where adverse effects occur or may occur, the regulatory agency may require additional studies or changes to the labelling (for example, application of a “black box” warning). Compelling new “adverse” data may result in a product approval being withdrawn at any stage following review by an agency and discussion with the Company.
Some jurisdictions, including the EU and the U.S., may designate products for disease treatment within a relatively small patient population as orphan drugs. Generally, if a product that has an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity means that applications to market the same product for the same indication may not be approved, except in limited circumstances, for a period of up to ten years in the EU and for up to seven years in the U.S. A key provision of 21st Century Cures initiative, as specifically codified in the 21st Century Cures Act, is the Rare Pediatric Disease (RPD) Priority Review Voucher (PRV). The RPD PRV program provides a voucher for a six-month FDA priority review for any product that receives successful approval as an orphan drug to treat a rare pediatric disease. These laws are particularly pertinent to Shire’s rare disease products and are constantly being scrutinized by Congress, with no guarantee that they will continue.
36

In the U.S., the Drug Price Competition and Patent Restoration Term Act of 1984, known as the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act, established a period of marketing exclusivity for brand-name drugs as well as abbreviated application procedures for generic versions of those drugs. Once the applicable exclusivity period for the brand-name drug has expired (which may range from three to five years), generic manufacturers may file with the FDA for approval to manufacture and market generic versions of the brand-name drug. Approval is sought by filing an Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA). As a substitute for conducting full-scale pre-clinical and clinical studies, the FDA can accept data establishing that the drug formulation, which is the subject of an abbreviated application, is bio-equivalent and has the same therapeutic effect as the previously approved drug, among other requirements. EU legislation also contains data exclusivity provisions. All medicinal products will be subject to an “8+2+1” exclusivity regime. A generic company may file a marketing authorization application for that product with the health authorities referencing the innovator’s data eight years after the innovator has received its first community authorization for a medicinal product. The generic company may not commercialize the product until after either 10 (8+2) or 11 years (8+2+1) have elapsed from the date of grant of the initial marketing authorization. The one-year extension is available if the innovator obtains an additional indication during the first eight years of the marketing authorization that is of significant advancement in clinical benefit. While the U.S. Hatch-Waxman Act addresses the development and entrance of generic products, the ACA amended the Public Health Service Act to create an abbreviated licensure pathway for biological products that are demonstrated to be “biosimilar” to or “interchangeable” with an FDA-licensed biological product. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 allow for approval of a biosimilar if data substantiates that the product is “highly similar” to an approved and existing biological product. Furthermore, as codified in the 2016 Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule, effective January 1, 2016, the physician reimbursement amount for a biosimilar is based on the average sales price (ASP) of all NDCs assigned to the biosimilars included within the same billing and payment code. Similar to a non-biologic product, an interchangeable biological product may be substituted for the reference product by a pharmacist without the intervention of the health care provider who prescribed the reference product. Generally, there will be a common physician reimbursement limit and HCPCS code for those biosimilars referenced to the original product filed under the BLA.
In the U.S., the DEA regulates the national production and distribution of scheduled drugs (i.e. those drugs containing controlled substances) by allocating production quotas based, in part, upon the DEA’s view of national demand. As scheduled drugs, the production and distribution of Shire’s stimulant ADHD products (ADDERALL XR, VYVANSE, MYDAYIS and EQUASYM) are strictly controlled and supply of active ingredient is dependent on the DEA’s permitted annual quotas and its willingness to update those quotas to meet any shortage of drugs.
The branch of the FDA responsible for product marketing oversight routinely reviews company marketing practices and also may impose pre-clearance requirements on materials intended for use in marketing of approved drug products. Shire is subject to various U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Similar review and regulation of advertising and marketing practices exists in the other geographic areas where the company operates.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a company failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements and current good manufacturing procedures (cGMPs), it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, such as issuing an FDA Form 483 notice of inspectional observations, a warning letter, an untitled letter, imposing civil money penalties, suspending or delaying issuance of approvals, requiring product recall, imposing a total or partial shutdown of production, withdrawal of approvals or clearances already granted, pursuing product seizures, consent decrees or other injunctive relief, or criminal prosecution through the Department of Justice. The FDA can require a Company to repair, replace or refund the cost of products that the Company manufactured or distributed. Outside the U.S., regulatory agencies may exert a range of similar powers.
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) administers the Medicare and Medicaid programs, major government payers for the elderly, disabled and poor in the U.S., respectively. Shire is subject to various mandated discounts and rebates, as well as compliance requirements, in order to participate in these programs. HHS will be interpreting, implementing and enforcing manufacturers’ compliance with rebate payments, discounts and mandated price reporting changes under the PPACA.

Regulatory Developments

In the U.S., Executive Orders and various legislative proposals at the federal and state levels could bring about major changes in the affected health care systems. Some states have passed such legislation, and further federal and state proposals are possible. Such proposals and legislation include, and future proposals could include, price controls, patient access constraints to medicines, cost sharing through improved patient health outcomes, abbreviated licensure pathway for biosimilars and increases in required rebates or discounts. Similar initiatives exist in the EU. The Company cannot predict the outcome of such initiatives, but will work to maintain patient access to its products and to oppose price constraints. Additionally, legislation is being debated at the federal and state level in the U.S. that could allow patient access to drugs approved in other countries, most notably Canada. This is generally referred to as drug importation. Although there is substantial opposition to this potential legislation within areas of the federal government, including the FDA, the Company cannot predict the outcome of such legislative activities. Several local U.S. jurisdictions, including the King County of Washington State and Alameda, San Francisco and San Mateo Counties in California, have imposed drug-disposal responsibilities and fees on drug manufacturers, with other municipalities and localities passing similar ordinances.
Furthermore, several agencies in the U.S., including the Office of Inspector General, Department of Justice and DEA have been stepping up their enforcement activities as part of the ACA, leading to the imposition of an increasing number of Corporate Integrity Agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as part of ultimate settlements.
Aggressive drug price actions taken in the U.S. by various manufacturers over the last several years has precipitated a media maelstrom and reinvigorated a hypersensitive atmosphere regarding the cost of drugs charged by manufacturers. While it is uncertain whether the U.S. Federal government will implement price controls in the near or midterm time frame, multiple states have proposed price control legislation and transparency initiatives. Though several states have been unsuccessful with passing legislation (e.g., North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania), California and Maryland have both passed similar laws to Vermont’s S. 216, which is designed to enable prescription drug cost transparency for the state and codifies an inquiry to manufacturers when there is an excessive increases to the lists price of drugs. In addition, New York has passed a Medicaid drug spending cap that may require additional rebates from manufacturers, while Massachusetts is attempting to legislate and create a closed formulary in Medicaid in order to obtain lower drug prices and enhanced rebates. There is a high probability that other states will pass new price constraint or price transparency laws in 2018. Despite the attention on price increases, historically Shire has taken a responsible approach to price increases.
Similar regulatory and legislative considerations are encountered in Europe and other international markets where governments regulate pharmaceutical prices and patient reimbursement levels. The differing approach to price regulation has led to some parallel trade within the EU where Shire’s products are imported into markets with higher prices from markets with lower prices. Exploitation of price differences between countries in this way can adversely impact domestic sales in those markets with higher prices.
Ethics and Compliance
In order to maintain compliance with the laws and regulations mentioned above, as well as other healthcare related laws and regulations, Shire has established a comprehensive global ethics and compliance program. The program is intended to prevent, detect and mitigate risk across the organization and throughout the lifecycle of Shire’s products. Shire’s program is founded on a culture and expectation of compliance at all levels of the organization. It also includes, among other things, resources to address compliance globally; formal compliance governance; mechanisms to intake and address questions and concerns; policies, processes and procedures; communications; training; various forms of risk-based auditing and monitoring; review of alleged misconduct; and, when necessary, disciplinary action for failure to comply. All of these actions are intended to protect Shire from conduct by individual employees and agents that may be in violation of legal and regulatory requirements and the Company’s compliance expectations.
38

Compliance with applicable laws and regulations is costly and materially affects Shire’s business. Shire expects that compliance with laws and regulations around the globe increasingly will require significant technical expertise and capital investment. Healthcare regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining approval to market and promote products, and Shire’s potential failure to meet its compliance obligations may result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of products, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for product production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. The Company expects to continuously devote substantial resources to proactively maintain, administer and expand its ethics and compliance program globally.
Third Party Reimbursement and Pricing
The Company’s revenue depends, in part, upon the price that third parties, such as health care providers and governmental organizations, reimburse on behalf of patients and physicians for the cost of the Company’s products or competitive products and treatments. These third party payers increasingly are challenging the pricing of drugs and medical devices through tougher contracting and seeking increased pharmaco-economic data in order to justify the pricing of products. In some states, Medicaid is changing its reimbursement for retail and specialty drugs from Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) or ASP based reimbursement to either Actual Acquisition Cost (AAC) or National Average Drug Acquisition Cost (NADAC). Alternatives to how Medicaid rebates are divided by the state and federal government are also occurring. All of these factors can affect the access to Shire's drugs.
In the U.S.
Commercial Managed Care
Commercial payers negotiate the pricing of products to control their costs, including the use of formularies to encourage members to utilize preferred products with favorable terms. Exclusion from a formulary, or a disfavored formulary position, can directly reduce product usage in the payer’s patient population and may negatively impact utilization in other payer plans as well. The consolidation of Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBMs) may result in increased pricing pressure from the larger purchasing power of such consolidated entities. Whether manufacturers can continue to issue coupons for managed care members, without being removed from the plan’s formulary, will also affect utilization of a manufacturer’s drugs. California recently passed legislation, joining Massachusetts, banning the use of manufacturer sponsored copay assistance programs. Where copay assistance was provided, several commercial payers will not allow the cost of drugs to count towards a patient’s deductible. Although the Secretary of HHS has approved the use of coupons for health exchange (HIX) plans, several groups are fighting the implementation of the guidance. Overall drug usage could increase due to the expansion of covered lives under the ACA albeit with greater rebate liability.
Medicaid
Many of the Company’s products are reimbursed by Medicaid, a joint federal and state health insurance plan for low-income individuals and people with disabilities in the U.S. Medicaid mandates federal rebates from manufacturers for participation in the program. Many states outsource management of Medicaid benefits to third parties (Managed Medicaid or MMC), leaving it to them to negotiate commercial rebates and formulary position with manufacturers. Due to changes within the ACA, utilization adjudicated by commercial Managed Medicaid payers is also eligible for the mandated federal rebates, which were traditionally paid only on fee-for-service utilization. Other states manage their own formulary and require manufacturers to pay additional “state supplemental” rebates for positioning on its preferred drug list (PDL). In addition, several states have started actively managing hemophilia and other specialty drug costs, either through first-time PDLs or through adjustments in their reimbursement rates to providers.
Medicare
As specified by the 21st Century Cures Act, passed into law in December 2016, Medicare reimbursement for durable medical equipment (DME) infused drugs and biologics (e.g., subcutaneous administration delivered via a pump) changed from average wholesale price (AWP) minus 5% to average sales price (ASP) plus 6% (AWP - 5% to ASP +6%) effective January 1, 2017. In addition, beginning January 1, 2017, DME infused drugs may not be included in the DME competitive acquisition program (DME competitive bidding).
39

Medicare reimbursement rates for physician infused drugs, including some of Shire’s orphan drugs, have been reduced from 106% of ASP to approximately 104% of ASP as a result of the so-called "sequestration" passed into law several years ago. CMS recently finalized regulation reducing Medicare reimbursement to hospitals for Part B drugs purchased under the 340b program from 104% ASP to ASP-22%. CMS is also increasingly bundling drug reimbursement into procedure costs, which can severely decrease the reimbursement rates to physicians for some manufacturers’ drugs, biologicals and medical devices. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), Medicare reimbursement payments to eligible professionals who are not meaningful users of Certified Electronic Health Record (EHR) Technology will be reduced. CMS had proposed further reductions in ASP-based reimbursement as part of its Medicare Part B drug demonstration project, but has since withdrawn the proposal.
ACA
At this time, it is not possible to predict the impact of the new U.S. administration’s proposed repeal of the ACA or propensity to apply changes in funding for key provisions or to determine what might replace the current legislation. The uncertainty in funding for health exchanges has led to significant rises in premiums, which may in turn reduce covered lives without there even being an official ACA repeal. Any regulatory or legislative changes to definitions of line extensions or calculations of Medicaid rebate calculations could also affect costs to Shire. In December 2017, President Trump signed tax reform legislation into law, which included removal of the so-called individual mandate, which required individuals to carry health insurance or pay a tax penalty. Official estimates indicate that this policy change will result in approximately 10 million Americans losing health insurance coverage. If the estimates come to fruition, this could have implications to patient access to the Company's products.
On February 1, 2016, CMS issued regulations implementing the Medicaid rebate provisions of the ACA (Final Rule). CMS’ interpretation of the rebates related to line extensions, and the Average Manufacturer Price (AMP) aspects of the Final Rule, could increase rebate costs. CMS’ 2020 proposed expansion of the Medicaid rebate program to U.S. Territories (including Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, Northern Mariana Islands and Samoa) could also impact both the Company’s contracting strategies to some of these Territories and increase Shire’s Medicaid rebate and operational costs. CMS’ publication of its own pricing compendium, (NADAC), as well as AMP-based Federal Upper Limits (FUL) could affect reimbursement to pharmacists for drugs and the state’s ability to continue providing access to brands that have generic versions, depending on the rate of each state’s adoption.
“Dual-eligibles”
Individuals that qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid are deemed "dual-eligible." Dual-eligibles receive their retail pharmaceutical coverage under the Medicare Part D program. There are several initiatives aimed at requiring manufacturers to provide Medicaid level rebates under Medicare Part D for the low-income subsidy eligible, including the dual-eligible population.
The tax revenue aspects of the fiscal cliff in the Budget Control Act were not fully resolved via the Taxpayers Relief Act of 2012, and because of this and due to the budget climate in the U.S., government programs like Medicare, Medicaid and others could face additional spending cuts or changes which could affect government payer utilization or payment of Shire’s products.
Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER)
In the U.S., ICER delivers recommendations based on its own analyses of clinical effectiveness and economic value. While ICER’s recommendations are non-binding, they can influence payer thinking around coverage and access criteria. ICER has decided to engage in a new study in the hemophilia therapeutic class that may or may not effect Shire’s drugs in this class.
40

Outside of the U.S.
In the EU and certain other territories, price controls and Health Technology Assessments for new, highly priced medicines are expected. Uncertainty exists about the pricing and reimbursement status of newly approved products in the EU. Germany, for example, has implemented the Act for the Restructuring of the Pharmaceutical Market in Statutory Health Insurance. This law essentially maintains free pricing for new chemical entities for one year, but assesses the patient relative benefit of new drugs within six months of commercialization in order to inform subsequent price negotiations. Prices of drugs bringing added patient benefit will qualify for price negotiation, while those with no added benefit will be subject to reference pricing, where price is determined by taking the lowest and/or average price of similar medicines in Germany. Criteria required to prove a drug’s benefit in Germany include an improvement of health, reduction of illness duration, extension of survival, reduction of side effects or improvement of the quality of life. Third party reimbursement limits may reduce the demand for the Company’s products. The slow pace of the price applications process in some countries has delayed and, occasionally, prevented product launches. In some countries regional authorities are seeking to constrain drug prices and uptake. As such, the Company’s estimated product launches may be delayed. Furthermore, ADHD and behavioral drugs in the EU and other markets require strong education and promotion efforts in order to gain acceptance and an economically viable reimbursement profile.

Agreements with Baxter
Prior to their separation in July 2015, Baxalta and Baxter entered into several agreements to effect the separation and provide a framework for Baxalta’s relationship with Baxter after the separation. These agreements, some of which are summarized below, govern the relationship between Baxter and Baxalta subsequent to the separation and provide for the separation of the assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including investments, property and employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after the separation.
Separation and Distribution Agreement
Baxter and Baxalta entered into a separation and distribution agreement which sets forth the agreements between Baxter and Baxalta regarding the principal transactions required to effect Baxalta’s separation from Baxter and other agreements governing Baxalta’s relationship with Baxter. It also identified assets transferred, liabilities assumed and contracts assigned to each of Baxalta and Baxter as part of the separation, and provided for when and how these transfers, assumptions and assignments were to occur.
Transition Services Agreement
Baxter and Baxalta entered into a transition services agreement prior to the separation pursuant to which Baxalta and Baxter and their respective subsidiaries provided various services to each other on an interim, transitional basis. The services provided by Baxter include finance, information technology, human resources, quality, supply chain and certain other administrative services. The majority of the services previously provided under the transition services agreement have ended by December 31, 2017 with certain information technology related services extending into 2018. 
Tax Matters Agreement
Baxter and Baxalta entered into a tax matters agreement prior to the distribution which generally governs their respective rights, responsibilities and obligations after the distribution with respect to taxes for any tax period ending on or before the separation date, as well as tax periods beginning before and ending after the separation. In addition, the tax matters agreement addresses the allocation of liability for taxes that were incurred as a result of restructuring activities undertaken to effectuate the distribution and provides for Baxalta to indemnify Baxter against any tax liabilities resulting from Baxalta’s action or inaction that causes the merger-related transactions to be taxable. For a description of the potential effect of the combination on the tax status of the separation and related transactions, see section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to the Combination with Baxalta Incorporated.” 
Manufacturing and Supply Agreement
Baxalta entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement with Baxter prior to the separation pursuant to which Baxalta or Baxter, as the case may be, manufacture, label, and package products for the other party. Baxalta’s rights to such technology are limited by the terms of the Galaxy license agreement described herein, including with respect to the use of such technology and the physical location and ownership of any such equipment.
41

Galaxy License Agreement
Baxalta entered into an intellectual property license agreement with Baxter, which is referred to as the Galaxy license agreement, pursuant to which Baxalta received a perpetual, non-transferrable, non-sublicenseable, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide license to certain intellectual property known as the Galaxy technology in order to allow Baxalta to continue using such technology in its plasma-derived products. This license primarily provides Baxalta with the right to Galaxy trademarks, as well as know-how and trade secrets necessary to operate and maintain (but not to manufacture) equipment using the Galaxy technology.
Transitional Trademark License Agreement
Baxalta and Baxter entered into a transitional trademark license agreement pursuant to which each granted the other a non-exclusive, royalty-free and worldwide license to use certain of each other’s trademarks following the separation, with the license granted to Baxter limited to use by Baxter in its performance of its obligations under the separation transaction agreements. The license to Baxalta allows it to continue using certain of Baxter’s trademarks (including the Baxter name) in order to provide sufficient time for Baxalta to rebrand or phase out its use of the licensed marks.
Letter Agreement with Baxter and Shire
On January 11, 2016, Baxter, Shire and Baxalta entered into a letter agreement (Letter Agreement) in connection with the acquisition, which, among other things, addresses certain aspects of the tax matters agreement and modified certain aspects of the shareholder’s and registration rights agreement.
Under the Letter Agreement, from and after the closing of the acquisition, Baxalta agreed to indemnify, and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees against certain tax-related losses resulting from the acquisition (other than losses resulting from any disposition of Baxalta common stock by Baxter (i) that are not attributable to the acquisition and (ii) other than in the initial distribution on July 1, 2015 and certain debt-for-equity exchanges, exchange offers, contribution of Baxalta shares to Baxter’s U.S. pension fund or a dividend distribution to Baxter’s stockholders (in each case as contemplated by the Letter Agreement)).
In addition, under the Letter Agreement, Shire agreed to cooperate with Baxalta and Baxter to enable Baxalta to comply with its obligations under the shareholder’s and registration rights agreement and to use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate Baxter’s disposition of Baxalta common stock in certain SEC-registered offerings. Each of Shire and Baxalta agreed in the Letter Agreement not to hold their respective stockholder meetings to approve, and not to consummate, the acquisition before the earliest of (a) the date that Baxter completed marketing periods for two debt-for-equity exchanges and one equity exchange offer with respect to its Baxalta common stock, (b) the date on which Baxter disposed of all its Baxalta common stock, or (c) June 17, 2016 (subject to tolling or extension (generally to no later than June 25, 2016) under certain circumstances). Prior to Shire’s acquisition of Baxalta, Baxter had disposed of all remaining shares of Baxalta’s common stock retained in connection with the separation.
Responsibility

Corporate Responsibility (Responsibility) matters to Shire's business. Responsibility helps the Company have the greatest impact on the lives of patients, employees and local and global communities. It is a core value that has long been embedded across the Company and ensures accountability for social, economic and environmental impacts. This commitment to Responsibility is supported by Shire’s Board of Directors, championed by the Chief Executive Officer and driven forward by Shire’s senior leaders.
In 2017, Shire developed its new Responsibility strategy with commitments and long-term goals to be achieved by 2025 aimed at enhancing the Company’s Responsibility, ambition and performance. The strategy was created by the Company’s Responsibility Sponsor Network, comprised of senior leaders that play a fundamental role in reviewing and directing Shire’s Responsibility activities and policies to ensure the Company maintains high standards. The strategy was based on the findings of Shire’s Responsibility materiality assessment, conducted in 2016, that identified and prioritized key Responsibility issues of greatest significance to Shire and its key stakeholders (including patient groups, investors, suppliers, nongovernmental organizations and employees). 
42

Shire’s Responsibility strategy of nine commitments is aligned to three strategic Responsibility pillars: Supporting Patients, People and Culture and Sustainable Operations. The Responsibility strategy is focused on patients and those who care for them, and is explicitly linked to Shire’s strategic drivers, with ethics and integrity permeating throughout. 
Employees

The Company’s employees are vital to its success. As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 23,044 employees.
