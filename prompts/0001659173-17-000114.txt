ITEM 1.   DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
 The Company
 
The Company was formed on June 21, 2007 as a Nevada corporation. The Company has a June 30 year end. During the period of 2015, the Company experienced a change of control. This event was disclosed on its Form 8-K filed on January 27, 2017. The Company has no current operations or revenue; therefore, as defined within the Securities Act Rule 405, and the Exchange Act Rule 12b-2, it is other than an asset-backed issuer, with no nominal operations; either no or nominal assets, assets consisting of cash and cash equivalents; or assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal other assets. Thus, we reverted to shell company status on June 18, 2015. From the period of June 18, 2015 to the date of this filing, we have had no activities. We also failed to maintain our Exchange Act filing obligations and began being quoted on OTC Pink Sheets during 2015 and throughout our fiscal year 2016. The information below outlines the activities and events of the Company prior to becoming a shell company.
 
On March 11, 2013, EZ Recycling, Inc. was formed and incorporated to serve as a wholly owned subsidiary of Highlight Networks, Inc. EZ Recycling, Inc. is incorporated in the State of Nevada. All inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.
 
On June 5, 2015, Legacy International Holdings Group, LLC., and Allied Crown Enterprises Limited, entered into a share purchase agreement (the "SPA") to purchase 98% of the outstanding capital stock of Highlight Networks, Inc., from Infanto Holding Corp. for an aggregate purchase price of $315,000. The purchase represented 98% of Highlight Networks, Inc., or 57,000,000 shares of restricted common stock. The Company has 58,167,600 shares issued and outstanding as of the date of this filing.
 
From the date of its change of control on June 18, 2015, the Company has conducted no business operations and has been in the developmental stage. We intend to either retain an equity interest in any private company we engage in a business combination or we may receive cash and/or a combination of cash and common stock from any private company we complete a business combination with. Our desire is that the value of such consideration paid to us would be beneficial economically to our shareholders though there is no assurance of that happening.

Business
 
We currently have no operations. We are a shell company. Upon our Change of Control in June 18, 2015, our operating asset, EZ Recycling, Inc. was removed and we reverted to shell company status. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) defines those companies as “any development stage company within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the “Exchange Act”) and that has no specific business plan or purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies.” Under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a “shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. 
Our Plan 
 
The Company plans on identifying a business entity, if any, which may be interested in a business combination with the Company, may include the following:
 

• | a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | a company which is unable to find an underwriter of its securities or is unable to find an underwriter of securities on terms acceptable to it; 
• | a company which wishes to become public with less dilution of its common stock than would occur upon an underwriting; 
• | a company which believes that it will be able to obtain investment capital on more favorable terms after it has become public; 
• | a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the United States securities market; 
• | a special situation company, such as a company seeking a public market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified Employee Stock Option Plan; and
• | a company seeking one or more of the other perceived benefits of becoming a public company. 

 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the sole officer and director of the Company. The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following kinds of factors:
 

• | Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment; 
• | Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;
• | The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials; 
• | The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced; 
• | The accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw materials, services, professional assistance and other required items.

In applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. Additionally, management will investigate an entity to engage a potential acquisition through reviewing available financial statements, interviewing a potential acquisition’s primary vendors and customers as well as financial advisors.
 
Potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the Company’s limited capital available for investigation, the Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about the opportunity to be acquired.
 
Any private company could seek to become public by filing their own registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission and avoid compensating us in any manner and therefore there may be no perceived benefit to any private company seeking a business combination with us as we are obligated under SEC Rules to file a Form 8-K with the SEC within four (4) days of completing a business combination which would include information required by Form 10 on the private company. It is possible that, prior to the Company successfully consummating a business combination with an unaffiliated entity, that entity may desire to employ or retain one or a number of members of our management for the purposes of providing services to the surviving entity. However, the offer of any post-transaction employment to members of management will not be a consideration in our decision whether to undertake any proposed transaction. As a result we may not be able to complete a business combination.
 
No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to enter into a business combination, as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.
 
Form of Acquisition 
 
The manner in which the Company participates in an opportunity will depend upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and desires of the Company, such as the need to become a public company in order to use its security to acquire assets or a business, provide stock to retain key employees as incentive, and the desire to become public due to these perceived benefits, and the promoters of the opportunity, and the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such promoters.
 
It is likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended depends upon whether the owners of the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the total issued and outstanding shares. Under other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of the Company prior to such reorganization.
 
The present stockholder of the Company will likely not have control of a majority of the voting shares of the Company following a reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all or a majority of the Company’s director may resign and new directors may be appointed without any vote by stockholders.

In the case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon the determination of management with a vote or approval by our stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the holder of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity to obtain such stockholder’s approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting stockholders.
 
The analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of Jose R. Mayorquin, the Company's sole officer and director. As the Company has no capital, the Company is largely dependent on Mr. Mayorquin in providing the Company with the necessary funds to implement its business plan, which Mr. Mayorquin has agreed to provide until the Company completes a business combination. Mr. Mayorquin will seek to devote (25) twenty five hours per week of his time to our operations, and, accordingly, consummation of a business combination may require a greater period of time than if he devoted his full time to our affairs. Mr. Mayorquin will seek to locate a target company for the Company through solicitation. Such solicitation may include, but is not limited to; newspaper or magazine advertisements, mailings and other distributions to accounting firms, law firms, investment bankers, financial advisors, venture capitalists, private equity firms, and similar persons, the use of one or more web sites and/or similar methods. We also expect that many prospective Target Businesses will be brought to our sole officer and director’s attention from various other non-affiliated sources, including securities broker-dealers, investment bankers, venture capitalists, bankers, and other members of the financial community and others who may present unsolicited proposals. The Company has no plans, understanding, agreements, or commitments with any individual for such person to act as a finder of opportunities to the Company. The Company can give no assurances that it will be successful in finding or acquiring a desirable business opportunity, given the limited funds that are expected to be available to the Company for implementation of its business plan. Furthermore, the Company can give no assurances that any acquisition, if it occurs, will be on terms that are favorable to the Company or its current stockholders.
 
It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in the loss to the Company of the related costs incurred.
 
All such costs for the next twelve (12) months and beyond will be paid with money contributed by Jose R. Mayorquin, our sole director, and officer. Mr. Mayorquin’s agreement to contribute resources to the company is limited as his resources allow.
 
We presently have no employees apart from our management. Additionally, Mr. Mayorquin is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates he will devote to our business limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.
