 Item 1.  Business.
 ﻿
 References to “we,” “our,” “us” or the “partnership” used in present tense for periods beginning on or after July 1, 2015, refer to Green Plains Partners LP and its subsidiaries. References to the “MLP predecessor” used in a historical context for periods ended on or before June 30, 2015, refer to BlendStar LLC and its subsidiaries, the partnership’s predecessor for accounting purposes, and the assets, liabilities and results of operations of the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets contributed by Green Plains in connection with the IPO on July 1, 2015. References to our “sponsor” in transactions subsequent to the IPO refer to Green Plains.     ﻿ Formation and Initial Public Offering and Subsequent Drop Downs
 ﻿
 We are a master limited partnership formed by our parent on March 2, 2015. On July 1, 2015, we completed our IPO of 11,500,000 common units representing limited partner interests. Our common units are traded under the symbol “GPP” on Nasdaq. After completing the IPO, in addition to the interests of BlendStar, we obtained the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets and liabilities, previously owned and operated by our parent, in a transfer between entities under common control.
 ﻿
 On January 1, 2016, we acquired the ethanol storage and leased railcar assets of the Hereford, Texas and Hopewell, Virginia ethanol production facilities from our sponsor in a transfer between entities under common control. The assets were recognized at historical cost and reflected retroactively along with related expenses for periods prior to the effective date of the acquisition, subsequent to the initial dates the assets were acquired by our sponsor, on October 23, 2015, and November 12, 2015, for Hopewell and Hereford, respectively. There were no revenues related to these assets for periods before January 1, 2016, when the amendments to our commercial agreements related to the drop down became effective.
 ﻿
 On September 23, 2016, we acquired the ethanol storage assets located in Madison, Illinois, Mount Vernon, Indiana and York, Nebraska related to three ethanol plants, which occurred concurrently with the acquisition of these facilities by Green Plains from subsidiaries of Abengoa S.A. The transaction was accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control and the assets were recognized at the preliminary value recorded in Green Plains’ purchase accounting. No retroactive adjustments were required.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Green Plains Partners provides fuel storage and transportation services by owning, operating, developing and acquiring ethanol and fuel storage facilities, terminals, transportation assets and other related assets and businesses. We were formed by Green Plains, a vertically integrated ethanol producer, to support its marketing and distribution activities as its primary downstream logistics provider.
 ﻿
 We generate a substantial portion of our revenues under fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade for receiving, storing, transferring and transporting ethanol and other fuels, which are supported by minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. We do not take ownership or receive any payments based on the value of ethanol or other fuels we handle. As a result, we do not have direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices.

 Our parent owns a 62.5% limited partner interest in us, consisting of 4,389,642 common units and 15,889,642 subordinated units, a 2.0% general partner interest and all of our incentive distribution rights. The public owns the remaining 35.5% limited partner interest. The following diagram depicts our simplified organizational structure at December 31, 2017:

 Our Assets and Operations
 ﻿
 Ethanol Storage.  Our ethanol storage assets are the principal method of storing ethanol produced at our parent’s ethanol production plants. Most of our parent’s ethanol production plants are located near major rail lines. Ethanol can be distributed from our storage facilities to bulk terminals via truck, railcar or barge.
 ﻿
 We own or lease 39 ethanol storage facilities and approximately 61 acres of land. Our storage tanks are located at or near our parent’s 17 ethanol production plants in Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. 
 ﻿

  Terminal and Distribution Services. We own and operate eight fuel terminals in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Kentucky, Tennessee and Oklahoma with combined total storage capacity of approximately 7.4 mmg and access to major rail lines. We also own approximately five acres of land and lease approximately 19 acres of land where our fuel terminals are located. Ethanol and other products are transported to our terminals primarily by rail, and shipped from our terminals by truck to third parties, including refiners, blenders and other obligated and non-obligated parties. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the aggregate throughput at these facilities was approximately 293.3 mmg.    ﻿
 The following table presents additional fuel terminal details by location:

  ﻿
 (1) Access to our seven other fuel terminal facilities is available from BNSF, KCS, Canadian National, Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and CSX.
 ﻿
 Transportation and Delivery. Ethanol deliveries to distant markets are shipped using major U.S. rail carriers that can switch cars to other major railroads or barge delivery to national or international ports. Our railcar volumetric capacity is used to transport product primarily from our ethanol storage facilities and third-party production facilities to other fuel terminals, including our own, international export terminals and refineries located throughout the United States. Currently, our leased railcar fleet consists of approximately 3,500 railcars with an aggregate capacity of 105.0 mmg. We expect our railcar volumetric capacity to fluctuate over the normal course of business as our existing railcar leases expire and we enter into or acquire new railcar leases.
     We also own and operate a fleet of 14 trucks and tankers that transport ethanol and other products. Five additional trucks and tankers are on order and expected to be operational in the second quarter of 2018.    ﻿
 Segments 
 ﻿
 Our operations consist of one reportable segment and are conducted solely in the U.S. See Item 8 - Financial Statements

and Supplementary Data for financial information about our operations and assets.
 ﻿
 Our Relationship with Green Plains
 ﻿
 Our parent is a diversified commodity processor with operations related to ethanol production, grain handling and storage, cattle feedlots, food ingredients, and commodity marketing and logistics services. The company is the second largest consolidated owner of ethanol production facilities in North America with 17 dry mill plants, with the capacity to produce approximately 1.5 billion gallons of ethanol per year.
 ﻿
 We benefit significantly from our relationship with our parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces. Our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade account for a substantial portion of our revenues.
 ﻿
 Our parent has a majority interest in us through the ownership of our general partner and a 62.5% limited partner interest, as well as all of our incentive distribution rights. We believe our parent will continue to support the successful execution of our business strategies given its significant ownership in us and the importance of our assets to Green Plains’ operations.
 ﻿
 We have entered into several agreements with our parent, which were established in conjunction with the IPO, including: an omnibus agreement; a contribution, conveyance and assumption agreement; an operational services and secondment agreement; and various commercial agreements described below. For additional information, please refer to Note 3 – Initial Public Offering to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. For all material agreements and subsequent amendments required to be filed, please refer to Item 15 – Exhibits, Financial Statement Schedules.
 ﻿
 Commercial Agreements with Affiliate
 ﻿
 A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, our primary customer, including a (1) fee-based storage and throughput agreement, (2) Birmingham terminal services agreement, (3) fee-based rail transportation services agreement and (4) various other transportation and terminal services agreements. 
 ﻿
 Minimum Volume Commitments. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade are supported by minimum volume commitments. Our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is required to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput volume, capacity used, or the amount of product tendered for transport, which is intended to provide some assurance that we will receive a certain amount of revenue during the terms of these agreements. These arrangements are intended to provide stable and predictable cash flows over time.
 ﻿
 Storage and Throughput Agreement. Under our storage and throughput agreement, as amended, Green Plains Trade is obligated to throughput a minimum of 296.6 mmg of product per calendar quarter at our storage facilities. In addition, Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay $0.05 per gallon on all throughput volumes, subject to an inflation escalator based on the producer price index following the last day of the primary term’s fifth year. If Green Plains Trade fails to meet its minimum volume commitment during any quarter, the partnership will charge Green Plains Trade a deficiency payment equal to the deficient volume multiplied by the applicable fee. The deficiency payment may be applied as a credit toward volumes throughput by Green Plains Trade in excess of the minimum volume commitment during the next four quarters, after which time any unused credits will expire. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, the partnership charged Green Plains Trade a deficiency payment of $1.0 million related to the minimum volume commitment, which was recorded as unearned revenue as of June 30, 2017.  During the period July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017, Green Plains Trade exceeded the minimum volume commitments and recovered the entire credit of $1.0 million. At December 31, 2017, the remaining primary term of our storage and throughput agreement was 7.5 years. The storage and throughput agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term.    ﻿
 ﻿

 Terminal Services Agreement. Under our terminal services agreement for the Birmingham facility, effective January 1, 2017 through December 31, 2019, Green Plains Trade is obligated to throughput a minimum volume commitment of approximately 2.8 mmg per month of ethanol and other fuels, equivalent to 33.2 mmgy, and pay associated throughput fees, as well as fees for ancillary services. The agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 90 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term. Several of our other terminal services agreements with Green Plains Trade and third parties also contain minimum volume commitments with various remaining terms.    ﻿
 Rail Transportation Service Agreement. Under our rail transportation services agreement, as amended, Green Plains Trade is obligated to use the partnership to transport ethanol and other fuels from receipt points identified by Green Plains Trade to nominated delivery points and pay an average monthly fee of approximately $ 0.0205 per gallon for all railcar volumetric capacity provided over the remaining life of the agreement. The minimum railcar capacity commitment we provide to Green Plains Trade for our leased railcar fleet is currently 105.0 mmg and the weighted average remaining term of all railcar lease agreements is 3.8 years. At December 31, 2017, the remaining term of our rail transportation services agreement was 7.5 years. The rail transportation services agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 360 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term.     ﻿
 Green Plains Trade is also obligated to use the partnership for logistical operations management and other services related to railcar volumetric capacity provided by Green Plains Trade and pay a monthly fee of approximately $0.0013 per gallon for these services. In addition, Green Plains Trade reimburses the partnership for costs related to: (1) railcar switching and unloading fees; (2) increased costs related to changes in law or governmental regulation related to the specification, operation or maintenance of railcars; (3) demurrage charges, except when the charges are due to the partnership’s gross negligence or willful misconduct; and (4) fees related to rail transportation services under transportation contracts with third-party common carriers. Green Plains Trade frequently contracts with the partnership for additional railcar volumetric capacity during the normal course of business at comparable margins.
 ﻿
 We lease our railcars from third parties under multiple operating lease agreements with various terms. The minimum take-or-pay capacity commitment under the rail transportation services agreement is closely aligned with our existing railcar lease agreements. As a result, when current railcar lease agreements expire, the volumetric capacity provided under the rail transportation services agreement declines accordingly. We enter new lease agreements to replace scheduled capacity reductions under the rail transportation services agreement or provide incremental capacity as requested by Green Plains Trade. We do not speculate on capacity by leasing additional railcars that are not covered by the rail transportation services agreement.    ﻿
 Trucking Transportation Agreement. Under our trucking transportation agreement, Green Plains Trade pays us to transport ethanol and other fuels by truck from identified receipt points to various delivery points. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay a monthly trucking transportation services fee equal to the aggregate amount of product volume transported in a calendar month multiplied by the applicable rate for each truck lane, which is defined as a specific route between point of origin and point of destination. Rates for each truck lane are negotiated based on product, location, mileage and other factors, including competitive factors. At December 31, 2017, the remaining term of our trucking transportation agreement was five months. The trucking transportation agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year renewal terms unless either party provides written notice of its intent to terminate the agreement at least 30 days prior to the end of the remaining primary or renewal term.    ﻿
 Competitive Strengths
 ﻿
 We believe that the following competitive strengths position us to successfully execute our business strategies:
 ﻿
 Stable and Predictable Cash Flows. A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from long-term, fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, including a storage and throughput agreement, rail transportation services agreement, terminal services agreement and other transportation agreements. Our storage and throughput agreement and certain terminal services agreements are supported by minimum volume commitments, and our rail transportation services agreement is supported by minimum take-or-pay capacity commitments. Green Plains Trade is obligated to pay us fees for these minimum commitments regardless of actual throughput or volume, capacity used or the amount of product tendered for transport.

Advantageous Relationship with Our Parent. Our assets are the principal method of storing and delivering the ethanol our parent produces, and the related agreements with Green Plains Trade include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments. Furthermore, as general partner and owner of a 62.5% limited partner interest in us, as well as all of our incentive distribution rights, our parent directly benefits from our growth, which provides an incentive to pursue projects that directly or indirectly enhance the value of our business and assets. This can be accomplished through organic expansion, accretive acquisitions or the development of downstream distribution services. Under the omnibus agreement, we are granted the right of first offer, for a period of five years from the date of the IPO, on any ethanol storage asset, fuel terminal facility or transportation asset our parent owns, constructs, acquires or decides to sell.
 ﻿
 Quality Assets. Our portfolio of assets has an expected remaining weighted average useful life of over 20 years. Our ethanol storage and fuel terminal assets are strategically located in fifteen states near major rail lines and barge service, which minimizes our exposure to weather-related downtime and transportation congestion and enables access to markets across the United States. Given the nature of our assets, we expect to incur only modest maintenance-related expenses and capital expenditures in the near future.    ﻿
 Financial Strength and Flexibility. Our borrowing capacity and ability to access debt and equity capital markets provide financial flexibility necessary to achieve our organic and acquisition growth strategies.
 ﻿
 Proven Management Team.  Each member of our senior management team is an employee of our parent who also devotes time to manage our business affairs. We believe the commercial, operational and financial expertise of our senior management team, which averages approximately 25 years of industry experience, allows us to successfully execute our business strategies.
 ﻿
 Business Strategy
 ﻿
 We believe ethanol could become an increasingly larger portion of the global fuel supply driven by volatile oil prices, heightened environmental concerns, energy independence and national security concerns. We intend to further develop and strengthen our business by pursuing the following growth strategies:    ﻿
 Generate Stable, Fee-Based Cash Flows.  A substantial portion of our revenues and cash flows are derived from our commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade. Under these agreements, we do not have direct exposure to fluctuating commodity prices. We intend to continue to establish fee-based contracts with our parent and third parties that generate stable and predictable cash flows.
 ﻿
 Grow Organically.  We will collaborate with our parent and other potential third parties to identify opportunities to develop and construct assets that provide us long-term returns on our investments. Plant expansion that increases our parent’s production capacity also increases the annual throughput volumes at our facilities. Capital expenditures associated with expansion are minimal since our ethanol storage facilities have available capacity to accommodate volume growth. 
 ﻿
 Acquire Strategic Assets.  We intend to pursue strategic acquisitions independently and jointly with our parent to grow our business. Our parent has a proven history of identifying, acquiring and integrating assets that are accretive to its business. Under the omnibus agreement, we have a right of first offer, for a period of five years from the date of the IPO, on any fuel storage, terminal or transportation asset our parent owns, constructs, acquires or decides to sell. In addition, we intend to continually monitor the marketplace to identify and pursue assets that complement or diversify our existing operations, including fuel storage and terminal assets in close proximity to our existing asset base.
 ﻿
 Development of Downstream Distribution Services.  We will continue to use our logistical capabilities and expertise to further develop downstream ethanol distribution services that leverage the strategic locations of our ethanol storage and fuel terminal facilities.
 ﻿
 Conduct Safe, Reliable and Efficient Operations. We are committed to maintaining safe, reliable and environmentally compliant operations and conduct routine inspections of our assets in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. We seek to improve our operating performance through preventive maintenance, employee training, and safety and development programs.

Recent Developments
 ﻿
 The following is a summary of our significant developments during 2017. Additional information about these items can be found elsewhere in this report or in previous reports filed with the SEC.
 ﻿
 In February 2017, the partnership formed NLR Energy Logistics LLC, a 50/50 joint venture with Delek Renewables LLC, to build an ethanol unit train terminal in the Little Rock, Arkansas area with capacity to unload 110-car unit trains and provide approximately 100,000 barrels of storage. The partnership and Delek Renewables LLC have equal board representation and voting rights in the joint venture. During the second half of 2017, the partnership contributed a total of $2.2 million to the joint venture. Construction of the terminal is expected to be completed during the first quarter of 2018 at a total cost of approximately $7.0 million. 
 ﻿
 On October 27, 2017, the partnership upsized its revolving credit facility by $40.0 million, from $155.0 million to $195.0 million, accessing a portion of the $100.0 million accordion in place on the facility.
 ﻿
 During the fourth quarter of 2017, commercial development of the JGP Energy Partners intermodal import and export fuels terminal in Beaumont, Texas was completed, with storage capacity of 550 thousand barrels to support various export and domestic grades of ethanol. On December 4, 2017, the first ethanol shipment departed from the terminal. Our parent formed the 50/50 joint venture to construct the terminal in June 2016 with Jefferson Ethanol Holdings LLC, a subsidiary of Fortress Transportation and Infrastructure Investors LLC. Per the omnibus agreement between Green Plains and the partnership, Green Plains will offer its interest in the joint venture to the partnership no later than six months after the completion of construction.
 ﻿
 Our Competition
 ﻿
 Our contractual relationship with Green Plains Trade and the integrated nature of our storage tanks with our parent’s production facilities minimizes potential competition for storage and distribution services provided under our commercial agreements from other third-party operators.
 ﻿
 We compete with independent fuel terminal operators and major fuel producers for terminal services based on terminal location, services provided, safety and cost. While there are numerous fuel producers and distributors that own terminal operations similar to ours, they often are not focused on providing services to third parties. Independent operators are often located near key distribution points with cost advantages that provide more efficient services and distribution capabilities into strategic markets with a variety of transportation options. Companies often rely on independent operators when their own storage facilities cannot manage their volumes or throughput adequately due to lack of expertise, market congestion, size constraints, optionality or the nature of the materials being stored.
 ﻿
 We believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively in a growing market due to our expertise managing third-party terminal services and logistics. We are a low-cost operator, focused on safety and efficiency, and capable of managing the needs of multiple constituencies across geographical markets. While the competitiveness of our services may be impacted by competition from new entrants, transportation constraints, industry production levels and related storage needs, we believe there are significant barriers to entry that partially mitigate these risks, including significant capital costs, execution risk, complex permitting requirements, development cycle, financial and working capital constraints, expertise and experience, and ability to effectively capture strategic assets or locations.
 ﻿
 Seasonality
 ﻿
 Our business is directly affected by the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels in the markets served by our assets. However, the effects of seasonality on our revenues are substantially mitigated through our fee-based commercial agreements with Green Plains Trade, which include minimum volume or take-or-pay capacity commitments.
 ﻿
 Major Customer
 ﻿
 We are highly dependent on Green Plains Trade and anticipate deriving a substantial portion of our revenues from them in the foreseeable future. Revenues from Green Plains Trade totaled approximately $100.8 million, or 94.2%, $95.5 million, or 92.0%, and $42.5 million, or 83.5% of our consolidated revenues, during years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Green Plains Trade and any development that

materially and adversely affects its operations, financial condition or market reputation. For additional information, please refer to Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Industry and Risks Related to an Investment in Us.
 ﻿
 Regulatory Matters
 ﻿
 Government Ethanol Programs and Policies
 ﻿
 We are sensitive to government programs and policies that affect the supply and demand for ethanol and other fuels, which in turn may impact the volume of ethanol and other fuels we handle. In the United States, the federal government mandates the use of renewable fuels under RFS II. The EPA assigns individual refiners, blenders and importers the volume of renewable fuels they are obligated to use based on their percentage of total fuel sales. The EPA has the authority to waive the mandates in whole or in part if there is inadequate domestic renewable fuel supply or the requirement severely harms the economy or environment.
 ﻿
 RFS II has been a driving factor in the growth of ethanol usage in the United States. When RFS II was established in October 2010, the required volume of renewable fuel to be blended with gasoline was to increase each year until it reached 15.0 billion gallons in 2015, which left the EPA to address existing limitations in both supply (ethanol production) and demand (usage of ethanol blends in older vehicles). On November 30, 2017, the EPA announced the final 2018 renewable volume obligations for conventional ethanol, which met the 15.0-billion-gallon congressional target.
 ﻿
 According to RFS II, if mandatory renewable fuel volumes are reduced by at least 20% for two consecutive years, the EPA is required to modify, or reset, statutory volumes through 2022. While conventional ethanol maintained 15 billion gallons, 2018 is the first year the total proposed RVOs are more than 20% below statutory volumes levels. Thus, the EPA Administrator directed his staff to initiate the required technical analysis to perform any future reset consistent with the reset rules. The reset will be triggered if the 2019 RVOs continue to be more than 20% below the statutory levels, and the EPA will be required to modify statutory volumes through 2022 within one year of the trigger event, based on the same factors used to set the RVOs post-2022.
 ﻿
 Obligated parties use RINs to show compliance with RFS-mandated volumes. RINs are attached to renewable fuels by producers and detached when the renewable fuel is blended with transportation fuel or traded in the open market. The market price of detached RINs affects the price of ethanol in certain markets and influences the purchasing decisions by obligated parties. In November 2017, the EPA denied a petition to change the point of obligation under RFS II to the obligated parties that own the gasoline before it is sold. 
 ﻿
 See further discussion in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 ﻿
 Environmental and Other Regulation
 ﻿
 Under the omnibus agreement, our parent is required to indemnify us from all known and certain unknown environmental liabilities associated with owning and operating our assets that occurred on or before the closing of the IPO. In turn, we agree to indemnify our parent from future environmental liabilities associated with the activities of the partnership. Construction or maintenance of our terminal facilities and storage facilities may impact wetlands, which are regulated by the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers under the Clean Water Act.
 ﻿
 See further discussion in Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 We do not have any direct employees. We are managed and operated by the executive officers of our general partner, who are also officers of our parent, and our general partner’s board of directors. Our general partner and its affiliates have approximately 45 full-time equivalent employees under its direct management and supervision supporting our operations.
 ﻿
 In addition, we have entered into service agreements with unaffiliated third-parties to provide railcar unloading and terminal services for several of our terminal facilities. Under these service agreements, the third parties are responsible for providing the personnel necessary to perform various railcar unloading and terminal services. The third parties are considered independent contractors and none of their employees or contractors are considered employees, representatives or agents of the partnership.
