Item 1 - Business
General
 
Mansfield-Martin Exploration Mining, Inc. (“Company” or “MMEM”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 23, 2011.  The Company was originally incorporated as SW China Imports, Inc. on February 23, 2011 in the State of Nevada.  The Company’s initial business plan was to import high-end handmade lace wigs, hairpieces, and other beauty supplies and accessories manufactured overseas into the United States.  In June 2014, the Company changed its name to Med-Cannabis Pharma, Inc. and implemented a new business plan to enter into the retail sale of medical and personal use  marijuana, where allowable.  In October 2015, the Company changed its name to MCPI, Inc.  In March 2017, the Company, in anticipation of consummating a proposed asset acquisition transaction, changed its name to Mansfield-Martin Exploration Mining, Inc.
 
Effective March 31, 2016, the Company ceased activities in all of its subsidiaries and disposed of Med-Pharma Management, Inc. and High Desert MMJ, Inc.  Prior thereto, the Company’s subsidiaries were Medical Management Systems, Inc., an Oregon corporation engaged in providing back-office and support services to marijuana dispensaries in the State of Oregon; Med-Pharma Management, Inc., a Washington State corporation which was formed to own, manage or provide back-office and support services to marijuana dispensaries in Washington State; and High Desert MMJ, Inc. an Oregon corporation, which is a 99.0% partner in Emerald Mountain Organics, an Oregon joint venture, formed to facilitate the development and growing of medical marijuana plants for wholesale distribution to licenced dispensaries in the State of Oregon.
 
As of December 31, 2015, Medical Management Systems, Inc. held a Management Contract for three marijuana dispensaries located in Newport, Bend and Cottage Grove, Oregon; which are owned by a company controlled by a related party.  This Management Contract was terminated by the consent of both parties, effective March 31, 2016.   Med-Pharma only conducted introductory due diligence efforts in the State of Washington and, currently, had abandoned all activities in the State of Washington.  Emerald Mountain Organics had established an early-phase growing operation and  generated nominal sales through September 30, 2015.
 During the first 10 days of October 2015, the Company’s subsidiary, High Desert MMJ, Inc., learned that the 1.0% minority partner in the Emerald Mountain Organics joint venture had absconded with all of the assets of the joint venture.  Efforts to locate and recover either the individuals representing said 1.0% minority partner or the said absconded assets were unsuccessful.  Accordingly, effective October 10, 2015, High Desert MMJ, Inc. abandoned the Emerald Mountain Organics joint venture and wrote off its investment.  The cumulative start-up losses in the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the Emerald Mountain Organics joint venture through the date of abandonment were approximately $53,000 and the Company recognized a loss on the stolen assets of approximately $51,000 during the quarter ended December 31, 2015.
 
On June 1, 2016, the Company entered into a Settlement, General and Mutual Release of Claims and Assignment of Interest Transfer Agreement (Settlement Agreement) with its majority shareholder and a related party.  The Settlement Agreement relates to the Company’s management of three medical marijuana dispensaries (Stores) located in Oregon, which are owned by Bendor Investments, Ltd. (Bendor), whose sole shareholder is Charles Stidham.  The Company owed Mr. Stidham approximately $1,100,000, including accrued interest, as of the date of the Settlement Agreement.

The Company asserted a claim for management fees of approximately $80,000 and reimbursement of monies advanced to support the operations of the Stores totaling approximately $343,000 for the services of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Medical Management Systems, Inc. (MMS), in managing the Stores.  Bendor disputed this claim.  To resolve the dispute, the parties agreed to forgive the accrued management fees and to offset the approximately $343,000 due from Bendor against the approximately $1,100,000 owed to Mr. Stidham with the Company releasing any and all interests it may have had in the Stores and MMS.  Additionally, the Company agreed to assign a trademark to Mr. Stidham as well as executing a new Note in the principal sum of $752,694.19.  The effect of the June 1, 2016 Settlement Agreement is reflected in the accompanying 2015 consolidated financial statements.
 
Pending Transaction
 
On November 28, 2016, the Company entered into a Material Definitive Agreement (Agreement) with Armada Mining, Inc. of Tombstone, Arizona, an Arizona corporation (Armada).  Under the terms of the Agreement, the Company will issue 284,580,000 shares of its common stock to Armada, its affiliates, related entities and other common parties in exchange for rights and interests in mining properties in the Tombstone Mining District of Arizona.  The Company will acquire rights and interests to approximately 3,800 acres of contiguous mineral leases, including some property acquired in fee simple, and ownership of 100% of Tombstone Development Company, which was formed in 1933, and is believed to be the oldest continually operating mining company in Arizona.  Subject to the completion of due diligence, acquisition of adequate financing and various regulatory approvals, the Company intends to commence development of these properties by processing previously mined materials for gold, silver and other precious or base metals, by reopening and developing existing mines using modern equipment and techniques and by completing an existing drill/test grid to establish the boundary of producible ore bodies, in anticipation of a Bankable Feasibility Study and further development.
 
Upon completion of the terms of the Agreement, Armada will own approximately 85% of the Company’s  post-transaction issued and outstanding common stock of the Company.  Armada has represented to the Company that it anticipates exchanging a portion of these shares with their existing shareholders; using a portion to satisfy existing obligations to related parties and others; and using a portion to finance other Armada operations.  The Agreement anticipates that Company, post-transaction, will have new Board of Directors that will, in turn, appoint new management for the Company.  Additionally, the Company and Armada have facilitated a change in the Company’s corporate name to better reflect the nature and focus of the Company’s proposed ongoing and future business interests.
 
As of the date of this filing, this transaction has not been completed and, in the opinion of current management, remains viable.
