ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
OVERVIEW
We are a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on bringing innovative medicines to people with renal disease. Our long-term vision is to build a leading renal company. Our marketed product, Auryxia (ferric citrate), which is an orally available, absorbable, iron-based medicine is approved in the United States for the control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, on dialysis. Ferric citrate is also approved in Japan under the trade name Riona and marketed by our Japanese partner, Japan Tobacco Inc., or JT, and its subsidiary, Torii Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., or Torii, and approved in Europe as Fexeric. We are also investigating the use of ferric citrate for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia, or IDA, in adults with non-dialysis dependent, CKD, or NDD-CKD, and, pending potential approval for this indication, plan to leverage our U.S. clinical and commercial infrastructure and treat many more people with CKD. Our vision of building a leading renal company includes expansion of our product portfolio with other medicines that help patients with kidney disease. We use the brand name Auryxia only when we refer to the approved indication in the United States. We refer to the product as ferric citrate when referring to its investigational use. 
OUR STRATEGY
Our business is focused on creating long-term stockholder value by bringing differentiated medicines for the treatment of people with kidney disease to the market that provide meaningful benefits to patients and their healthcare providers. The three pathways to our strategy are:
Maximize Auryxia's Potential
We developed and subsequently launched Auryxia in the United States in late December 2014. Auryxia is a non-chewable, orally-administered phosphate binder for patients on dialysis. Auryxia is being marketed in the United States to renal care teams through our specialty salesforce and commercial infrastructure. In the United States, there are approximately 450,000 adult patients with CKD requiring dialysis (referred to as End Stage Renal Disease, or ESRD), including approximately 350,000 adults currently taking a phosphate binder. Our field-based organization is aligned to 95 territories calling on target nephrologists and their associated dialysis centers. We believe strong fundamentals are in place to continue to drive commercial adoption of Auryxia in the dialysis setting following the return of this medicine to patients in November 2016. 
We also believe that we can maximize the potential of ferric citrate through potential label expansion for the treatment of IDA, NDD-CKD patients. We completed a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating ferric citrate for this indication and presented results from this trial to the medical community at the American Society of Nephrology’s Kidney Week 2016 Annual Meeting. The results from this trial were also published online in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology in January 2017. We submitted a supplemental new drug application, or sNDA, to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in January 2017 seeking to expand the label for Auryxia to include the treatment of IDA in NDD-CKD patients and expect that the sNDA will be accepted by the FDA for review. We anticipate a standard review cycle for this sNDA and, if approved, could potentially make the medicine available to these patients late in 2017. We estimate that in the United States, approximately 1.7 million adults under the care of a nephrologist have IDA, NDD-CKD, including approximately 650,000 adults currently being treated by nephrologists for IDA. IDA is common in the NDD-CKD population and the prevalence and severity increases as CKD advances. IDA is symptomatic and can significantly impact quality of life. No oral iron medications are currently FDA-approved to treat IDA, NDD-CKD.
Expand Our Portfolio
We will evaluate opportunities to expand our product portfolio with other medicines that help patients with kidney disease. Our business development activities include evaluating several clinical-drug candidates and commercial medicines to in-license or acquire to add to our portfolio and provide us with new commercial opportunities. We will seek to add assets that leverage the infrastructure we have built to support our foundational medicine, Auryxia, including our clinical development and commercial teams. We believe these efforts have the potential to provide additional revenues to us in the future.

AURYXIA (FERRIC CITRATE)
Commercial Program
Auryxia is an oral, absorbable iron-based medicine approved in the United States for the control of serum phosphorus levels in patients with CKD on dialysis. It is also marketed in Japan under the brand name Riona by our Japanese partner, JT and Torii, as an oral treatment for the improvement of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD, including dialysis and NDD-CKD. We receive royalties from JT and Torii based on their sales in Japan. Our efforts and associated expenses are focused on commercializing Auryxia in the United States.
Auryxia’s mechanism of action works as an oral ferric iron tablet with the capacity to bind to phosphate in the gastrointestinal tract and form non-absorbable complexes to reduce intestinal absorption and aid in the management of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD. The U.S. approval of Auryxia was based on data from our Phase 3 registration program. In the Phase 3 clinical trials, Auryxia effectively reduced serum phosphorus levels to within the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative, or KDOQI, guidelines range of 3.5 to 5.5 mg/dL. In addition to the effects on serum phosphorus levels, Auryxia’s pharmacodynamic properties resulted in increased ferritin, iron and transferrin saturation, or TSAT; whereas these parameters remained relatively constant in patients treated in the active control arm (Renvela® and/or Phoslo®) in our Phase 3 registration program. The most common adverse events for Auryxia-treated patients were gastrointestinal-related, including diarrhea, nausea, constipation, vomiting and cough.
Auryxia is being marketed in the United States through our specialty salesforce and commercial infrastructure. Our sales organization is aligned to 95 territories calling on target nephrologists and their associated dialysis centers. In addition, we have a small team of national account managers who are primarily responsible for working with insurance plans, health maintenance organizations and other payers to secure reimbursement and formulary access for Auryxia. In December 2014, we created the Keryx Patient Plus program to assist with patient accessibility to Auryxia. The Keryx Patient Plus program offers benefit verification, co-pay assistance for eligible commercial patients, a no-cost drug program for those who qualify, and a short-term prescription bridge program that may assist those already on Auryxia who are in danger of suffering a lapse in coverage.
In the third quarter of 2016, our collaborator, JT and Torii, commenced enrollment in a Phase 2 clinical trial of ferric citrate for the treatment of IDA. 
Currently, our only product is Auryxia. In January 2015, we began to recognize product sales based on prescription sales of Auryxia in the United States. We have also generated, and expect to continue to generate, revenue from the sublicensing of rights to Auryxia in Japan to our Japanese partner. We may engage in business development activities that include seeking strategic relationships for ferric citrate outside of the United States, as well as evaluating other compounds and companies for in-licensing or acquisition, with a focus on complementary assets.
On September 23, 2015, the European Commission, or EC, approved Fexeric (ferric citrate coordination complex) for the control of elevated serum phosphorus levels, or hyperphosphatemia, in adult patients with CKD, including dialysis and NDD-
3

CKD. The EC also considered Fexeric as a New Active Substance, or NAS, which provides 10 years of data and marketing exclusivity in the European Union, or EU. We do not plan to launch Fexeric on our own in the EU. 
Ferric Citrate Label Expansion Opportunity
Auryxia’s mechanism of action has also shown to increase iron parameters, including TSAT and ferritins. In 2016, we completed the pivotal Phase 3 study of ferric citrate for the treatment of IDA, in adults with Stage 3-5 NDD-CKD. In March, we announced topline data from this trial, and in November we presented results from this study to the medical community at the American Society of Nephrology’s Kidney Week 2016 Annual Meeting. The full data were subsequently published online in the peer-reviewed publication, Journal of the American Society of Nephrology, in January 2017. The study’s primary endpoint was the between group comparison of the proportion of patients achieving a 1 g/dL or greater increase in hemoglobin at any point during the 16-week randomized period of the study. Secondary endpoints in the Phase 3 study included the change from baseline to the end of the randomized period for hemoglobin, ferritin, TSAT and serum phosphorus. The results demonstrated statistically significant differences between ferric citrate- and placebo-treated patients for the primary endpoint and all pre-specified secondary endpoints. The majority of patients in the ferric citrate group (52 percent) achieved a 1 g/dL or greater increase in hemoglobin at any point during the 16-week randomized period as comparted to 19 percent in the placebo group (p<0.001). Additionally, the safety profile of the investigational medicine was consistent with previously reported clinical studies of ferric citrate, with the majority of adverse events reported as mild to moderate. These results were included in the sNDA, submitted in January 2017 seeking to expand the label for ferric citrate to include the treatment of IDA in adults with NDD-CKD.
Foreign Operations
We have no foreign operations. Revenues from customers outside of the United States amounted to approximately 15% and 26% of our total revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales of ferric citrate outside of the United States do not and are not expected to materially contribute to our revenues.
Market Opportunity
In the United States, there are approximately 450,000 adult patients with CKD requiring dialysis (referred to as ESRD). Managing ESRD is complex as many metabolic factors, such as iron and phosphorus, are out of balance. Phosphate retention and the resulting hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients are typically associated with increased risk for heart and bone disease and death. The majority of ESRD patients require chronic treatment with phosphate-binding agents to lower and maintain serum phosphorus at acceptable levels. There are approximately 3.0 million prescriptions written in the United States for phosphate binders annually. Although the majority of dialysis patients are treated with phosphate binders, according to the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study, or DOPPS, program, 30-40 percent of these patients still have serum phosphorus levels above the KDOQI guidelines recommended range. DOPPS is one of the largest prospective studies of ESRD patients worldwide and includes samples from dialysis patients and units in multiple countries, including the United States to identify clinical practices that benefit patients. As we continue to increase utilization of Auryxia in the dialysis setting, our sales force is focused on asking renal care teams to try Auryxia on patients with serum phosphorus levels outside of the target range. At the American Society of Nephrology's 2016 Kidney Week in November, case study data from 92 patient charts for Auryxia were presented that showed treatment with this medicine lowered and maintained serum phosphorus levels in CKD patients on dialysis. Specifically, the majority of patients when started on Auryxia achieved target serum phosphorus levels within the KDOQI guideline target range at six months of treatment -- 48 percent and 65 percent of patients at one and six months, respectively. 
In addition, it is estimated that more than 10 percent of the U.S. adult population is affected by CKD. As kidney function declines levels of serum phosphorus become more prevalent especially in non-dialysis stages 3-5 of CKD, which are the more progressive stages of CKD. Several studies have shown that higher serum phosphorus concentrations may be associated with increased mortality and morbidity in CKD; however, no phosphate binders are currently FDA approved for NDD-CKD.
IDA is extremely prevalent in the NDD-CKD population and is associated with fatigue, lethargy, decreased quality of life and is also believed to be associated with cardiovascular complications, hospitalizations, and increased mortality. Given our field force interacts primarily with nephrologists, we have conducted market research to assess how many patients under the care of a nephrologist have IDA and how many of those are treated. Our research shows that approximately 650,000 patients under the care of a nephrologist are treated for their IDA, and another 250,000 to 400,000 have IDA, but are not currently being treated. To treat this type of anemia, iron replacement therapy is essential to increase iron stores, which is reflected in ferritin and TSAT levels, and to raise hemoglobin levels. Market insights from proprietary research and Spherix Global Insights data show that a need exists for an effective, well-tolerated, convenient IDA treatment. Nephrologists report low satisfaction with 
4

existing oral iron therapies due to tolerability. No oral iron medications are currently FDA-approved to treat IDA in NDD-CKD, and guidelines recommend treating first with oral iron. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, or ESAs, and intravenous, or IV, iron are viewed as effective treatment but are not frequently administered in NDD-CKD due to potential hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis and logistical complications associated with administering IV medicines in office settings. 
CKD on Dialysis: Auryxia Approval and Phase 3 Registration Clinical Program
In September 2014, we received approval from the FDA to market Auryxia for the control of elevated serum phosphorus levels in patients with CKD on dialysis. In January 2014, our Japanese partner received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare to market Riona in Japan as an oral treatment for the improvement of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD, including dialysis and NDD-CKD. In September 2015, the EC approved Fexeric for the control of serum phosphorus levels, or hyperphosphatemia, in adult patients with CKD, including dialysis and NDD-CKD. These approvals to treat patients with CKD on dialysis in the United States were based on our Phase 3 clinical registration program in which we conducted a Phase 3 short-term trial (completed in November 2010), a Phase 3 long-term trial (completed in January 2013) and a long-term open label extension, or OLE, trial (completed in July 2014). The two Phase 3 trials showed that treatment with Auryxia resulted in changes in serum phosphorus levels during and at the end of treatment as compared to baseline that were statistically significant and increases in certain iron parameters, including ferritin, TSAT and hemoglobin levels, as compared to baseline.
The side-effect profile of Auryxia in these Phase 3 trials appeared similar to the profile of the control groups, which received Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) and/or Phoslo (calcium acetate). No serious adverse events deemed to be drug-related were reported in the short-term Phase 3 trial. In the long-term Phase 3 trial, the most common adverse events were gastrointestinal-related, including: diarrhea, including soft stools (26% Auryxia vs. 14% control), nausea (15% Auryxia vs. 14% control), feces discoloration (17% Auryxia vs. 0% control), vomiting (9% Auryxia vs. 15% control) and constipation (8% Auryxia vs. 5% control). Adverse events were generally characterized as mild to moderate in nature in this trial. The overall serious adverse event rates in the long-term Phase 3 trial were 41.9% Auryxia vs. 49.7% control and there were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences between Auryxia and the control group in serum calcium levels, aluminum levels and liver enzymes, as measured by alanine transaminase, or ALT, and aspartate transaminase, or AST. The safety profile observed in the OLE trial was consistent with that seen in the long-term Phase 3 trial.
CKD on Dialysis: Auryxia Phase 3 Registration Clinical Program—Short-Term Trial
In November 2010, we completed a Phase 3 short-term, dose-ranging and efficacy trial of Auryxia for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia. This short-term trial was a multicenter, randomized, open-label trial with a two-week washout period, following which patients were randomized 1:1:1 to receive a fixed dose of Auryxia of either 1 gram, 6 grams or 8 grams per day for a treatment period of 28 days using a 1 gram oral tablet formulation. One hundred fifty-four hemodialysis patients were enrolled into the study. The intent-to-treat, or ITT, group included 146 patients, representing all patients who took at least one dose of Auryxia and provided a baseline (at the end of washout) and at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. Efficacy assessments were taken weekly starting at baseline for four weeks.
The primary endpoint of the study was to determine whether there was a dose response in the change in serum phosphorus from baseline to Day 28 of treatment in the ITT group, using a regression analysis to evaluate this objective. The study met the primary endpoint, with the regression analysis indicating a highly statistically significant dose response (p<0.0001) where mean serum phosphorus levels changed from baseline to end of the trial by 0.1 mg/dL (n=50) with 1 g/day, -2.0 mg/dL (n=51) with 6 g/day and -2.2 mg/dL (n=45) with the 8 g/day dosing. Certain iron parameters, including serum ferritin and TSAT, were measured in the study. Over the 28-day treatment period, modest upward trends in ferritin and TSAT levels were observed in the 6 g/day and 8 g/day dose groups. No serious adverse events were deemed to be drug-related by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee in this clinical study.
CKD on Dialysis: Auryxia Phase 3 Registration Clinical Program—Long-Term Trial
In January 2013, we announced successful top-line results from the long-term Phase 3 study of Auryxia for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD on dialysis. In this study, conducted pursuant to a special protocol assessment, or SPA, agreement with the FDA, Auryxia met the study’s primary endpoint, described below, demonstrating a statistically significant change in serum phosphorus levels as compared to placebo over the four-week efficacy assessment period of the study. In addition, Auryxia met the key pre-defined secondary endpoints of increasing ferritin and TSAT and reducing the use of IV iron and ESAs as compared to the active control group (Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) and/or Phoslo (calcium acetate)) over the 52-week safety assessment period of the study. This long-term study was the final component of our Phase 3 registration program.
5

This Phase 3 long-term study was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, safety and efficacy clinical trial in 441 CKD patients on hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. The study consisted of a 2-week washout period followed by a 52-week Safety Assessment Period in which patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either Auryxia or an active control (Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) and/or Phoslo (calcium acetate)). The 52-week Safety Assessment Period was followed by a 4-week efficacy assessment period. During the efficacy assessment period, only those patients randomized to treatment with Auryxia during the safety assessment period and completed the safety assessment period were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either continue treatment with Auryxia or switch to placebo for a 4-week treatment period. Patients were titrated during the study to achieve serum phosphorus levels that ranged between 3.5 to 5.5 mg/dL. Patients were included in the trial if ferritin was less than 1000 ng/mL and TSAT < 50%.
The primary objectives of this study were to determine the long-term safety of Auryxia in patients with CKD undergoing either hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, and the efficacy of Auryxia following 52 weeks of treatment in a four-week, randomized, open-label, placebo-controlled efficacy assessment period. Auryxia was administered using a 1 gram oral tablet formulation. Oral iron therapy was not permitted during the course of the study. IV iron therapy was at the physician’s discretion, though was not permitted if a subject’s serum ferritin level was greater than 1000 ng/mL or TSAT was greater than 30%. The use of ESAs was at the physician’s discretion.
The primary efficacy endpoint of this trial was the mean change in serum phosphorus from baseline (Week 52) to end of the four-week efficacy assessment period (Week 56) versus placebo in the ITT group. The ITT group included 182 patients, representing all patients who took at least one dose of Auryxia or placebo in the efficacy assessment period and provided at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. Auryxia met the primary efficacy endpoint with a highly statistically significant result (p<0.0001, in an analysis of covariance, or ANCOVA, model with treatment as the fixed effect and baseline as the covariate) where patients on placebo had a change in serum phosphorus form 5.4 mg/dL to 7.2 mg/dL and those on Auryxia changed from 5.1 mg/dL to 4.9 mg/dL demonstrating a 2.2 mg/dL least squares mean difference between groups.
During the 52-week safety assessment period, Auryxia maintained serum phosphorus in the normal range, with highly statistically significant changes in mean serum phosphorus concentration at Weeks 12, 24, 36, 48, and 52 as compared to baseline (Day 0, p<0.0001). In addition, as agreed to with the EC, the treatment difference between Auryxia and Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) at Week 12 of the safety assessment period in terms of change from baseline (Day 0) in serum phosphorus was analyzed. Auryxia successfully achieved the non-inferiority endpoint versus Renvela.
The objectives of the key iron-related secondary endpoints, which were all pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan in a sequential strategy to control overall Type I error rate, were to corroborate prior data which suggested that Auryxia may increase iron storage parameters and reduce the need for IV iron and/or ESAs as compared to the active control group. Auryxia met all the key pre-defined secondary efficacy endpoints related to iron storage parameters with statistically significant treatment differences as compared to the active control group (Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) and/or Phoslo (calcium acetate)), as follows:


• | Auryxia demonstrated a statistically significant treatment difference as compared to the active control group in mean change in serum ferritin from baseline (Day 0) to Week 52 from 593 ng/mL (n=253) at baseline to 895 ng/mL at the end of 52 weeks for Auryxia compared to those on active control where the serum ferritin level at baseline was 610 ng/mL (n=137) and at the end of the 52-week period was 632 ng/mL. Auryxia also demonstrated a statistically significant treatment difference as compared to the active control group in mean change in TSAT from baseline (Day 0) to Week 52 where the TSAT at baseline for Auryxia was 31% (n=252) and at the end of the 52-week period was 39% compared to the active control group where baseline TSAT was 31% (n=137) and at the end of the 52-week period was 30%.


• | Each subject’s average cumulative IV iron intake was calculated over the 52-week safety assessment period. The ITT group consisted of 271 patients and 138 patients for the Auryxia and active control groups, respectively. Auryxia demonstrated a 51% decrease in median IV iron intake as compared to the active control group (median 1.87 mg/day for Auryxia versus 3.83 mg/day for active control, p<0.0001). Each patient’s average cumulative ESA intake was calculated over the 52-week safety assessment period. The ITT group consisted of 273 patients and 141 patients for the Auryxia and active control groups, respectively. Auryxia demonstrated a 24% decrease in median ESA intake as compared to the active control group (median 756 units/day for Auryxia versus 993 units/day for active control, p<0.05).


• | Auryxia demonstrated a statistically significant treatment difference as compared to the active control group in mean change in hemoglobin from baseline (Day 0) to Week 52 (p<0.05) with a mean change

6

in hemoglobin in the Active control group of -0.6 g/dL and a mean change of -0.2 g/dL for those on Auryxia.
Safety and Tolerability Profile
For reference, patients previously intolerant to Renvela (sevelamer carbonate) and/or Phoslo (calcium acetate) were ineligible to participate in this study. Based on an analysis of safety data, the side-effect profile of Auryxia and the active control group, or Active Control, appeared similar, with the most common adverse events gastrointestinal-related. The most common gastrointestinal adverse events were: diarrhea, including soft stools (26% Auryxia vs. 14% Active Control), nausea (15% Auryxia vs. 14% Active Control), feces discoloration (17% Auryxia vs. 0% Active Control), vomiting (9% Auryxia vs. 15% Active Control) and constipation (8% Auryxia vs. 5% Active Control). Adverse events were generally characterized as mild to moderate in nature.
The overall serious adverse event rates in the study were 41.9% Auryxia vs. 49.7% Active Control. Importantly, there were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences between Auryxia and the active control group in serum calcium levels, aluminum levels and liver enzymes, as measured by ALT and AST.
CKD on Dialysis: Auryxia Open-Label Safety Extension Study
In July 2014, we completed the long-term, OLE study for Auryxia in dialysis-dependent CKD patients. Patients who had participated in and successfully completed the long-term pivotal Phase 3 study were eligible for enrollment in the 48-week OLE study, providing for cumulative exposure to Auryxia of up to two years (n=17). Patients in the OLE study (n=168) were titrated to achieve and maintain serum phosphorus levels within a range of 3.5 to 5.5 mg/dL, with a maximum daily dose of 12 grams per day of Auryxia. The safety profile observed in the OLE study was consistent with that seen in the long-term pivotal Phase 3 study and there were no clinically meaningful changes in liver enzymes or aluminum levels over the course of the study.
NDD-CKD: Clinical Program Evaluating Ferric Citrate for the Treatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia
In addition to studying Auryxia to treat patients with CKD on dialysis, we have a clinical program to evaluate the use of ferric citrate for the treatment of IDA in the non-dialysis setting. As part of the program, we have completed a Phase 2 clinical trial and a Phase 3 clinical trial of ferric citrate to potentially gain FDA approval to use ferric citrate in patients with NDD-CKD.
Phase 3 Clinical Trial
In September 2014, we initiated a pivotal Phase 3 study of ferric citrate for the treatment of IDA in patients with Stage 3-5 NDD-CKD. This is a 24-week Phase 3, multi-center clinical trial, comprised of a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled period, or the Randomized Period, followed by an 8-week open label safety extension period, where all patients received ferric citrate, or the Extension Period. Patients with CKD Stage 3-5 who were intolerant of or had an inadequate therapeutic response to oral iron supplements (with a limit of up to 20% of the target randomization in CKD Stage 5) and had a hemoglobin between 9.0 g/dL and £11.5 g/dL at screening for enrollment in the trial. In addition, patients with serum phosphorus <3.5 mg/dL were excluded from the trial. Unlike the Phase 2 NDD-CKD trial where dosing was based on serum phosphorus levels, in the Phase 3 study, ferric citrate was dosed, with meals, to obtain an increase in Hgb of >1.0 g/dL from baseline. Increase of study drug dose occurred only if the subject’s serum phosphate is ≥3.0 mg/dL. The use of oral or IV iron, ESAs, receipt of blood transfusions and phosphate binders were not permitted at any time during the study.
The study’s primary endpoint is a between group comparison of the proportion of patients achieving a 1 g/dL or greater increase in hemoglobin at any point during the 16-week Randomized Period. Secondary endpoints in this Phase 3 study include change from baseline to end of Randomized Period for hemoglobin, ferritin, TSAT and serum phosphorus.
In March 2016, we announced positive top-line results from the U.S.-based Phase 3 study of ferric citrate in treating IDA in patients with Stage 3-5 NDD-CKD. The study met its primary endpoint and all pre-specified secondary endpoints with statistical significance. 
The pivotal Phase 3 study enrolled 234 patients who previously had not adequately responded to or tolerated oral iron therapies at 32 clinical sites in the United States. Patients were randomized 1:1 (ferric citrate versus placebo). Patients enrolled in this study were not allowed to receive any IV or oral iron, or ESAs during this study. The study had a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy period followed by an 8-week open-label safety extension period in which all patients remaining in the study, including the placebo group, received ferric citrate. During the 16-week efficacy period, ferric 
7

citrate was administered at a starting dose of three tablets per day with food and could be titrated every four weeks by an additional three tablets for up to a maximum of 12 tablets per day; the mean dose received in ferric citrate treated patients was 5 tablets per day. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving a 1 g/dL or greater increase in hemoglobin at any point during the 16-week efficacy period. Baseline laboratory values were similar between the treatment arms.

Baseline laboratory values: | Ferric Citrate (FC) (n=117) | Placebo (P) (n=115)
Hemoglobin (g/dL) | 10.4 | | 10.4
TSAT (%) | 20.2 | | 19.6
Ferritin (ng/mL) | 85.9 | | 81.7
Serum phosphate (mg/dL) | 4.2 | | 4.1 

Efficacy analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat population and included all enrolled patients who received at least one dose of ferric citrate or placebo and one post-treatment laboratory assessment. The analysis also used a sequential gatekeeping strategy for statistical testing of the secondary endpoints.
Primary and Secondary Endpoint Results

* Efficacy period defined as the 16-week randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled period.
** Sustained treatment effect on hemoglobin was defined as a mean change from baseline ≥0.75 g/dL over any 4-week time period during the efficacy period, provided that an increase of at least 1.0 g/dL had occurred during that 4-week period.  
Safety and Tolerability Profile
The safety population in the study included all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study drug. The safety analysis demonstrated that ferric citrate was generally well tolerated in adults with Stage 3-5 NDD-CKD. Specifically, the results showed:

• | During the efficacy period, the majority of adverse events reported were mild to moderate, with the most common being diarrhea (20.5% FC; 16.4% P), constipation (18.8% FC; 12.9% P), discolored feces (14.5% FC; 0% P), and nausea (11.1% FC; 2.6%P). During the efficacy period, hypophosphatemia was reported as an adverse event in four patients, one patient in the ferric citrate arm and three patients in the placebo arm.


• | During the efficacy period, 26 percent (31/117) of ferric citrate-treated patients and 30 percent (35/116) of those receiving placebo discontinued treatment. Of the patients who discontinued, 12 patients treated with ferric citrate discontinued due to an adverse event, compared to 10 patients who received placebo.

• | During the efficacy period, the rate of serious adverse events was balanced between the ferric citrate and placebo treatment groups, at 12% and 11%, respectively. None of the serious adverse events were deemed drug related.


• | During the course of the study, there were two deaths reported, both in patients receiving ferric citrate; neither of which were related to study drug.

The company submitted an sNDA to the FDA in January 2017 seeking Auryxia label expansion to treat IDA in adults with NDD-CKD.
NDD-CKD: Phase 2 Clinical Trial
In November 2013, we announced successful top-line results from the U.S.-based Phase 2 study of ferric citrate in managing serum phosphorus and IDA in patients with Stage 3-5 NDD-CKD. In this study, ferric citrate met both co-primary endpoints, demonstrating statistically significant changes in both serum phosphorus and TSAT versus placebo over the 12-week treatment period. In addition, ferric citrate met the key secondary endpoints of increasing ferritin and hemoglobin, and decreasing fibroblast growth factor-23, or FGF-23, as compared to placebo.
This Phase 2 study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial in patients with Stage 3-5 NDD-CKD, with elevated serum phosphorus ≥4.0 mg/dL and IDA. The study consisted of a 2-week washout period (for subjects on a phosphate binder at screening) followed by a 12-week treatment period in which patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either ferric citrate or placebo. Dosing was based upon change serum phosphorus. One hundred forty-nine patients were randomized into the study from 20 sites in the United States. The use of IV or oral iron and ESAs were not permitted within 8 weeks and 4 weeks prior to the study, respectively, and not permitted during the course of the study.
Co-Primary and Key Secondary Endpoints
Ferric citrate demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both co-primary (serum phosphorus and TSAT) and all key secondary endpoints. The ITT group included 141 patients, representing all patients who took at least one dose of ferric citrate or placebo and provided at least one post-baseline efficacy assessment. In the group receiving ferric citrate, the mean serum phosphorus at baseline was 4.5 mg/dL (n=72) and at the end of the 12-week treatment period was 3.9 mg/dL. In the group receiving placebo, the mean serum phosphorus at baseline was 4.7 mg/dL (n=69) and at the end of the 12-week treatment period was 4.4 mg/dL. In the group receiving ferric citrate, the mean TSAT at baseline was 22% (n=72) and at the end of the 12-week treatment period was 32%. In the group receiving placebo, the mean TSAT at baseline was 21% (n=69) and at the end of the 12-week treatment period was 20%.
The key secondary endpoints of the study measuring iron parameters were the mean changes in ferritin and hemoglobin from baseline to the end of the 12-week treatment period as compared to placebo in the ITT group. Ferric citrate significantly increased serum ferritin from 116 ng/mL at baseline to 189 ng/mL at the end of the treatment period, which was significantly higher than that of placebo (baseline 110 ng/mL; week 12 106 ng/mL). Mean hemoglobin change from baseline to the end of the 12-week treatment period was significantly higher in those that received ferric citrate than those that received placebo (p<0.001).


Mean Hemoglobin (g/dL) | Placebo(n=69) | Ferric Citrate(n=72)
Baseline | 10.6 | | 10.5
End of Treatment1 (Week 12) | 10.4 | | 11.0
Treatment Difference p-value2 | | p<0.001 | 


1 | Last observation carried forward was used for missing data.


2 | P-value is created via an ANCOVA model with treatment as the fixed effect and baseline as the covariate.

Patients were discontinued from the study if they had hemoglobin measurements <9.0 g/dL on two consecutive visits or serum phosphorus measurements ≥6.0 mg/dL on two consecutive visits following randomization. There were 12% treatment failures in the placebo group associated with low hemoglobin versus 1% on ferric citrate. In addition, there was a 3% serum phosphorus associated treatment failure in the placebo group compared to none on ferric citrate.
Safety and Tolerability Profile
9

The safety population in the study included all randomized patients who took at least one dose of study drug. Ferric citrate appeared to be safe and well-tolerated in this Phase 2 study, with discontinuation rates of 19% and 32% in the ferric citrate and placebo groups, respectively, including treatment failures. There were no study discontinuations due to hypophosphatemia in the study. 
Serious adverse events occurred in six ferric citrate subjects (8%) versus ten placebo subjects (14%). Two deaths were recorded in the study, both from the placebo group. There were no clinically meaningful or statistically significant differences in serum calcium levels and liver enzymes as measured by ALT and AST. 
COMMERCIAL ORGANIZATION
We have established a commercial organization to support the sales of Auryxia in the United States. Our sales force and managed markets organizations are responsible for promoting our products to health care professionals, providers, and payors.
Our U.S. sales force and managed markets organizations include approximately 125 employees. We market our products and educate physicians by calling on individual physicians and dietitians, advertising, public relation efforts, and other activities.
We also have established programs in the United States that provide our products to qualified uninsured or underinsured patients at no charge or at a reduced charge, based on specific eligibility criteria.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND PATENTS
General
Patents and other proprietary rights are very important to the development of our business. Our ability to protect our proprietary technologies from unauthorized use by third parties is limited by the extent to which our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents supported by regulatory exclusivity, or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. It is our intention to seek and maintain patent and trade secret protection for Auryxia and our proprietary technologies. As part of our business strategy, our policy is to actively file patent applications in the United States and, when appropriate, internationally to cover methods of use, processes of manufacture, new chemical compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, dosing of the compounds and compositions, and improvements in each of these areas. We also rely on trade secret information, technical know-how, innovation and agreements with third parties to continuously expand and protect our competitive position. We have a number of patents and patent applications related to our compounds and other technology, but we cannot guarantee the scope of protection of the issued patents, or that such patents will survive a validity or enforceability challenge, or that any of the pending patent applications will issue as patents.
Generally, patent applications in the United States are maintained in secrecy for a period of 18 months or more. Since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we are not certain that we were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our pending patent applications or that we were the first to file those patent applications. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents, or their enforceability. To date, there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents. Third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications, if issued. If our competitors prepare and file patent applications in the United States that claim technology also claimed by us, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in front of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial cost, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us.
Because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products, any related patent may expire or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization, thus reducing any advantage of the patent. However, the life of a patent covering a product that has been subject to regulatory approval may have the ability to be extended through the Patent Term Extension program available under 35 U.S.C. § 156, although any such extension could still be minimal.
If a patent is issued to a third party containing one or more preclusive or conflicting claims, and those claims are ultimately determined to be valid and enforceable, we may be required to obtain a license (if a license is available on commercially reasonable terms) under such patent or to develop or obtain alternative technology. In the event of a litigation involving a third party claim, an adverse outcome in the litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to such third party, require us to seek a license for the disputed rights from such third party, and/or require us to cease use of the technology. Further, our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to commercialize our products 
10

may seriously harm our business. We also may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. Litigation would involve substantial costs.
Pursuant to our license with Panion & BF Biotech, Inc., or Panion, we have the exclusive rights under a series of patent and patent applications to commercialize Auryxia worldwide, excluding certain Asian-Pacific countries. These patents and patent applications include claims directed to compositions of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of treatment, as well as methods for the manufacture of Auryxia.
Our patent rights include: (1) U.S. Patent No. 8,846,976, which expires in 2024 and includes claims covering a method of treating hyperphosphatemia using Auryxia and encompasses the dosing regimen approved by the FDA for Auryxia; (2) U.S. Patent Nos. 7,767,851, 8,299,298, 8,338,642, 8,609,896, 8,754,257, 8,754,258 and 9,050,316, which expire in 2024 and include either composition of matter claims, methods of use claims or both covering Auryxia; and (3) U.S. Patent No. 8,093,423, which expires in 2026 and includes methods of use claims covering Auryxia. The expiration dates referenced above are without regard to potential patent term extension. In addition, our patent portfolio includes a U.S. patent with claims directed to formulations of ferric citrate and U.S. patent applications directed to methods for the prophylaxis or treatment of hyperphosphatemia comprising administering a ferric citrate tablet , methods of improving at least one iron storage parameter (e.g., hemoglobin) in certain CKD patients comprising orally administering ferric citrate, and methods for treating IDA in certain CKD patients comprising orally administering a certain table formulation of ferric citrate.
The term of a patent will vary depending upon the legal term for a patent in the country in which the patent is obtained. Generally, the term for a patent is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application in the United States. In the United States, the term of a patent may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. In addition, the term of a U.S. patent that covers a drug, biological product or medical device approved by the FDA for commercial marketing may be eligible for patent term extension, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met.
Our pending patent applications may not issue as patents and may not issue in all countries in which we develop, manufacture or potentially sell our product(s) or in countries where others develop, manufacture and potentially sell products using our technologies. Moreover, our pending patent applications, if issued as patents, may not provide additional protection for our product. 
Obtaining proof of direct infringement by a competitor for a method of use patent requires us to demonstrate that the competitors make and market a product for the patented use(s). Alternatively, we can prove that our competitors induce or contribute others in engaging in direct infringement. Proving that a competitor contributes to, or induces, infringement of a patented method by another has additional proof requirements. For example, proving inducement of infringement requires proof of intent by the competitor. If we are required to defend ourselves against claims or to protect our own proprietary rights against others, such defense or protection could result in substantial costs to us and the distraction of our management. An adverse ruling in any litigation or administrative proceeding could prevent us from marketing and selling Auryxia, increase the risk that a generic version of Auryxia could enter the market to compete with Auryxia, limit our development and commercialization of Auryxia, or otherwise harm our competitive position and result in additional significant costs. In addition, any successful claim of infringement asserted against us could subject us to monetary damages or injunction, which could prevent us from making or selling Auryxia. We also may be required to obtain licenses to use the relevant technology. Such licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.
Moreover, physicians may prescribe a competitive identical product for indications other than the one for which the product has been approved, or off-label indications, that are covered by the applicable patents. Although such off-label prescriptions may directly infringe or contribute to or induce infringement of method of use patents, such infringement is difficult to prevent.
In addition, any limitations of our patent protection described above may adversely affect the value of our product candidate and may inhibit our ability to obtain a corporate partner at terms acceptable to us, if at all.
Other Intellectual Property Rights
We depend upon trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information, we require our employees, scientific advisors, consultants and collaborators, upon commencement of a relationship with us, to execute confidentiality agreements and, in the case of parties other than our research and development collaborators, to agree to assign their inventions to us. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed in connection with their relationship with us. These agreements may not, however, provide protection for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized disclosure of such information.
11

In addition to patent protection, we may utilize orphan drug regulations, pediatric exclusivity or other provisions of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938, as amended, or FDCA, such as new chemical entity exclusivity or new formulation exclusivity, to provide market exclusivity for a drug candidate. Orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases, currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or, diseases that affect more than 200,000 individuals in the United States but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit. Under these provisions, a manufacturer of a designated orphan drug can seek tax benefits, and the holder of the first FDA approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity for such FDA-approved orphan product. In the United States, the FDA has the authority to grant additional data protection for approved drugs where the sponsor conducts specified testing in pediatric or adolescent populations. If granted, this pediatric exclusivity may provide an additional six months which are added to the term of data protection as well as to the term of a relevant patent, to the extent these protections have not already expired. We may also seek to utilize market exclusivities in other territories, such as in the EU. We cannot assure that our drug candidate, Auryxia, or any drug candidates we may acquire or in-license, will obtain such orphan drug designation, pediatric exclusivity, new chemical entity exclusivity or any other market exclusivity in the United States, EU or any other territory, or that we will be the first to receive the respective regulatory approval for such drugs so as to be eligible for any market exclusivity protection.
LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND COLLABORATIONS
We have formed strategic alliances with a number of companies for the development, manufacture and commercialization of ferric citrate. Our current key strategic alliances are discussed below.
Panion & BF Biotech, Inc.
In November 2005, we entered into a license agreement with Panion & BF Biotech, Inc., or Panion. Under the license agreement, we acquired the exclusive worldwide rights, excluding certain Asian-Pacific countries, for the development and marketing of ferric citrate. To date, we have expensed an aggregate of $11.6 million of milestone payments to Panion, including the $2.0 million paid upon European marketing approval in 2015. In addition, Panion is eligible to receive royalty payments based on a mid-single digit percentage of net sales of ferric citrate in the licensed territory, as well as a manufacturing fee for product manufactured for us in the licensed territory. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recorded approximately $1.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively, in cost of goods sold related to royalty payments due Panion relating to sales of Auryxia (ferric citrate) in the United States.
The license agreement terminates upon the expiration of our obligations to pay royalties thereunder. In addition, we may terminate the license agreement (i) in its entirety or (ii) with respect to one or more countries of the territory covered by the agreement, in either case upon 90 days’ notice. We and Panion also have the right to terminate the license agreement upon the occurrence of a breach of a material provision of the license agreement and certain insolvency events.
Japan Tobacco Inc. and Torii Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
In September 2007, we entered into a Sublicense Agreement with JT and Torii, under which JT and Torii obtained the exclusive sublicense rights for the development and commercialization of ferric citrate in Japan. Effective June 8, 2009, we entered into an Amended and Restated Sublicense Agreement, or the Revised Agreement, with JT and Torii, which, among other things, provided for the elimination of all significant on-going obligations under the Sublicense Agreement.
In January 2013, JT and Torii filed its new drug application, or NDA, with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare for marketing approval of ferric citrate in Japan for the treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD. Under the terms of the Revised Agreement, we received a non-refundable milestone payment of $7.0 million in January 2013 for the achievement of the NDA filing milestone.
In January 2014, JT and Torii received manufacturing and marketing approval of ferric citrate from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. Ferric citrate, launched in May 2014 and being marketed in Japan by Torii under the brand name Riona, is indicated as an oral medicine for the improvement of hyperphosphatemia in patients with CKD. Under the terms of the license agreement with JT and Torii, we received a non-refundable payment of $10.0 million in February 2014 for the achievement of the marketing approval milestone. We also receive royalty payments based on a tiered double-digit percentage of net sales of Riona in Japan escalating up to the mid-teens, and may also receive up to an additional $55.0 million upon the achievement of certain annual net sales milestones. In accordance with our revenue recognition policy, royalty revenues are recognized in the quarter that JT and Torii provide their written report and related information to us regarding sales of Riona, which generally will be one quarter following the quarter in which the underlying sales by JT and Torii 
12

occurred. We recorded $4.8 million and $3.5 million in license revenue related to royalties earned on net sales of Riona in Japan in 2016 and 2015, respectively. We record the associated mid-single digit percentage of net sales royalty expense due to Panion, the licensor of ferric citrate, in the same period as the royalty revenue from JT and Torii is recorded. We recorded $2.9 million and $2.1 million in license expenses in 2016 and 2015, respectively, related to royalties due to the licensor of ferric citrate relating to sales of Riona in Japan.
The sublicense terminates upon the expiration of all underlying patent rights. Also, JT and Torii may terminate the sublicense agreement with or without cause upon at least six months prior written notice to us. Additionally, either party may terminate the sublicense agreement for cause upon 60 days’ prior written notice after the breach of any material provision of the sublicense agreement, or after certain insolvency events.
COMPETITION
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are highly competitive. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and public and private research institutions. In addition, companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us. Many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources, larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development, regulation, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel, attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations, and license technologies that are competitive with ours. To compete successfully in this industry, we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors.
Auryxia is competing in the United States with other FDA-approved phosphate binders such as Renagel® (sevelamer hydrochloride) and Renvela (sevelamer carbonate), both marketed by Genzyme Corporation (a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi), or Genzyme, PhosLo (calcium acetate), marketed by Fresenius Medical Care, Fosrenol® (lanthanum carbonate), marketed by Shire Pharmaceuticals Group plc, and Velphoro® (sucroferric oxyhydroxide), marketed by Fresenius Medical Care North America, as well as over-the-counter calcium carbonate products such as TUMS® and metal-based options such as aluminum and magnesium. Our strategy to compete against these existing treatments depends in part on physicians and patients accepting that Auryxia is differentiated in the marketplace versus these FDA-approved phosphate binders
Aluminum-type phosphate binders were widely used in the past. However, the systemic absorption of aluminum from these agents and the potential toxicity associated with their use no longer make this type of binder a viable long-term treatment option.
Calcium-type phosphate binders are commonly used to bind dietary phosphate; however, they promote positive net calcium balance and an increased risk of metastatic calcification in many patients, especially in those patients taking vitamin D analogs and those with adynamic bone disease. Calcification of the cardiovascular system is believed to represent a significant risk factor for morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD.
Non-calcium-based, non-absorbed phosphate binders, including sevelamer hydrochloride and sevelamer carbonate are among the most prescribed phosphate binders in the United States. Compared to the calcium-type binders, fewer coronary and aortic calcifications have been documented, however, there is a risk of metabolic acidosis with sevelamer hydrochloride, as well as the potential for gastrointestinal problems, and sevelamer can affect concomitant vitamin K and vitamin D treatment.
Lanthanum-type phosphate binders are another alternative. Lanthanum is a rare earth element and is minimally absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Lower level tissue deposition, particularly in bone and liver, has been observed in animals. However, the long-term, potentially harmful, effects due to the accumulation of lanthanum in these tissues have not been clearly determined.
The need for alternative phosphate-binding agents has long been recognized, especially given the increasing prevalence of ESRD and shortcomings with current therapies available to such patients.
Auryxia, currently our only drug product, which we launched in December 2014, is competing with existing therapies. In addition, other companies are pursuing the development of pharmaceuticals that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting with Auryxia, including the treatment of hyperphosphatemia and IDA. Other companies have products or drug candidates in various stages of pre-clinical or clinical development to treat diseases for which we are also seeking to acquire and develop drug products. Some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than Auryxia and other potential drug candidates we may acquire or in-license, and may be commercialized earlier. Additional information can be found in this report in Item 1A under the heading “Risk Factors—Other Risks Related to Our Business.”
13

SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING
We have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes. We intend to continue, in whole or in part, to use third parties to manufacture and analytically test our drug, Auryxia, for use in clinical trials and for sales.
We believe that we have established contract manufacturing relationships for the supply of Auryxia to ensure that we will have sufficient material for clinical trials and ongoing commercial sales. In addition, we are establishing the basis for long-term commercial production capabilities to supply the potential expanded demand for Auryxia in future years. As with any supply program, obtaining raw materials of the required quality and quantity cannot be guaranteed and we cannot ensure that we will be successful in this endeavor.
As we continue to build inventory for the expanded commercialization of Auryxia, we intend to engage additional suppliers to produce Auryxia under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, requirements. Our third-party manufacturers have a limited number of facilities in which Auryxia can be produced and will have limited experience in manufacturing Auryxia in quantities sufficient for commercialization. Our third-party manufacturers will have other clients and may have other priorities that could affect their ability to perform the work satisfactorily and/or on a timely basis. Both of these occurrences would be beyond our control.
We expect to similarly rely on contract manufacturing relationships for any products that we may in-license or acquire in the future. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully contract with such manufacturers on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
Contract manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the FDA, the Drug Enforcement Administration and corresponding state and foreign government agencies to ensure strict compliance with cGMP and other state and federal requirements and corresponding foreign standards. Any of our contractors in Europe face similar challenges from the numerous European Union and member state regulatory agencies and authorized bodies. We do not have control over third-party manufacturers’ compliance with these regulations and standards, other than through contractual obligations and periodic auditing. If they are deemed out of compliance with cGMPs, approvals could be delayed, product recalls could result, inventory could be destroyed, production could be stopped and supplies could be delayed or otherwise disrupted.
If we need to change manufacturers after commercialization, the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these new manufacturers in advance, which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with applicable requirements and standards and may require significant lead times and delay, and disruption of supply. Furthermore, switching manufacturers may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers is limited. It may be difficult or impossible for us to find a replacement manufacturer quickly or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.
GOVERNMENT AND INDUSTRY REGULATION
FDA Approval Process
In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDC Act, and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
Pharmaceutical product development in the United States typically involves the performance of nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate, well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity, and novelty of the product or disease.
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical and other nonclinical tests must comply with certain federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about 
14

product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations, (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice, or GCP, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND.
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time or impose other sanctions if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The clinical trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board, or IRB, at each site where a clinical trial will be performed for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRB’s requirements or it may impose other conditions.
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves clinical trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in instances where the clinical trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with potentially serious outcome, and confirmation of the result in a second clinical trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture, and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees which typically increase annually.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months, while most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committee, which is typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing 
15

practice requirements, or cGMP is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for health care professionals, and elements to assure safe and effective use, or ETASU. ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring, and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial is made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these clinical trials can be delayed until the product or new indication being studied has been approved. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
The Hatch-Waxman Act
Orange Book Listing
In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicant’s product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, nonclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as “generic equivalents” to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug.
The ANDA applicant is required to make certain certifications to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that: (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement, certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain or carve out any language regarding the patented method-of-use, rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent.
If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from 
16

approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
Exclusivity
Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by the FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which the FDA cannot approve an ANDA for a generic drug that includes such changes.
An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period.
Patent Term Extension
After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents or their agents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension for delays caused by FDA regulatory review. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drug’s testing phase—the time between IND submission and NDA submission—and all of the review phase—the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years. The time can be shortened if the FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years.
We have filed applications under the patent term extension provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 156 for U.S. Patent Nos. 8,299,298, 8,093,423, 7,767,851, 5,753,706, and 8,338,642 for delays caused by FDA regulatory review. If granted, we can utilize the patent term extension on one of these patents, however, we cannot assure you that we can obtain any extension of the term of these patents. Upon expiration of these patents, competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval may potentially offer products with the same composition and/or method of use as our product, so long as the competitors do not infringe any other patents that we may own or license.
For patents that might expire before a determination regarding patent term extension, the patent owner or its agent may request an interim patent term extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the USPTO must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. 
We have filed for an interim patent term extension in accordance with 35 U.S.C. § 156(e)(2) for U.S. Patent No. 5,753,706.
In addition, certain other non-jurisdictions, including Japan, have provisions that provide for patent term extension. In October 2014, following the regulatory approval of Riona in Japan, the Japan Patent office granted the patent term extensions filed by our sublicensee, JT, for Japanese Patents Nos. 4964585 and 4173553. As a result of the extension of patent term, Japanese Patents Nos. 4964585 and 4173553 will expire in November 2025 and November 2022, respectively.
Advertising and Promotion
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Adverse Event Reporting and GMP Compliance
17

Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
Pediatric Information
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication where orphan designation has been granted.
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or BPCA, provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivity—patent or non-patent—for a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDA’s determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric clinical trials, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested clinical trials within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.
Special Protocol Assessment
A company may reach an agreement with FDA under the Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, process as to the required design and size of clinical trials intended to form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. Under the FDC Act and FDA guidance implementing the statutory requirement, an SPA is generally binding upon the FDA except in limited circumstances, such as if the FDA identifies a substantial scientific issue essential to determining safety or efficacy after the clinical trial begins, public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the protocol assessment, the sponsor and FDA agree to the change in writing, or if the clinical trial sponsor fails to follow the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA.
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs, and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Even if a drug qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for these programs are those for serious or life threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs, and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill an unmet medical need. The request may be made at the time of IND submission and generally no later than the pre NDA meeting. The FDA will respond within 60 calendar days of receipt of the request. Priority review, which is requested at the time of NDA submission, is designed to give drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months as compared to a standard review time of ten months. Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent meetings with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated drug and expedite review of the application for a drug designated for priority review. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs to treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint, which is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. Discussions with the FDA about the feasibility of an accelerated approval typically begin early in the development of the drug in order to identify, among other things, an appropriate endpoint. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post marketing clinical trials to confirm the appropriateness of the surrogate marker clinical trial.
18

In the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, Congress encouraged the FDA to utilize innovative and flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated approval. The law required the FDA to issue related draft guidance within a year after the law’s enactment and also promulgate confirming regulatory changes. The FDA published a final guidance on May 30, 2014, entitled “Expedited Programs for Serious Conditions—Drugs and Biologics.” One of the expedited programs added by FDASIA is that for Breakthrough Therapy. A Breakthrough Therapy designation is designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint(s). A sponsor may request Breakthrough Therapy designation at the time that the IND is submitted, or no later than at the end of Phase 2 meeting. The FDA will respond to a Breakthrough Therapy designation request within sixty days of receipt of the request. A drug that receives Breakthrough Therapy designation is eligible for all fast track designation features, intensive guidance on an efficient drug development program, beginning as early as Phase 1 and commitment from the FDA involving senior managers.
Foreign Approval
Should we wish to market our products outside the United States, we must receive marketing authorization from the appropriate foreign regulatory authorities. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. At present, companies may apply for foreign marketing authorizations at a national level. However, within the EU, registration procedures are available to companies wishing to market a product in more than one EU member state. Typically, if the regulatory authority is satisfied that a company has presented adequate evidence of safety, quality and efficacy, then the regulatory authority will grant a marketing authorization. This foreign regulatory approval process, however, involves risks similar or identical to the risks associated with FDA approval discussed above, and therefore we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the appropriate marketing authorization for any product in any particular country.
Failure to comply with applicable federal, state and foreign laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of new drugs are subject to future changes. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, effect or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
Third party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. If third party payors do not consider a product to be cost effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the product after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
The U.S. government and state legislatures have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government paid health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for brand named prescription drugs. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of government controls and measures, and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
19

As noted above, even if we are able to secure regulatory approval, sales of any of our products may suffer if the government and third party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. An increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States has increased, and we expect this sentiment will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies and third party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments.
We also are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either (1) the referral of an individual to a person for furnishing any item or service for which payment is available under a federal health care program, or (2) the purchase, lease, order or recommendation thereof of any good, facility, service or item for which payment is available under a federal health care program;


• | The False Claims Act and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from the federal government or making or using, or causing to be made or used, a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim;


• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, obtaining money or property of the health care benefit program through false representations or knowingly and willingly falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, making false statements or using or making any false or fraudulent document in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, health care benefits or services;


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;


• | The provision under the ACA commonly referred to as the Sunshine Act, which requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to track and annually report to CMS payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members in applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations; and


• | State law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and state laws concerning security and privacy of health care information, which may differ in substance and application from state to state thereby complicating compliance efforts.

The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. Section 1320a 7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
As noted above, the federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment from federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. 
20

Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their off label promotion of drugs. Penalties for such violations could include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, mandatory civil penalties between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and the potential implication of various federal criminal statutes. Private individuals also have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act, or qui tam actions, and certain states have enacted laws based on the federal False Claims Act.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Company sponsored research and development expenses totaled $29.5 million in 2016, $36.7 million in 2015 and $51.5 million in 2014. Research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs (including stock-based compensation expense), fees paid to consultants and outside service providers for clinical and laboratory development, manufacturing, including pre-FDA approval inventory, facilities-related and other expenses relating to the design, development, manufacture, testing, and enhancement of our drug candidates and technologies, as well as expenses related to in-licensing of new product candidates.
