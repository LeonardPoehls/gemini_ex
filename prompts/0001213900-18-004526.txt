Item 1. Business
 
History of the Company
 
Wave Sync Corp. (the “Company”), formerly known as China Bio-Energy Corp., formerly known as China INSOnline Corp., was initially incorporated on December 23, 1988 as Lifequest Medical, Inc. (“DEXT”) as a Delaware corporation. On December 6, 2010, the Company entered into an Amendment (the “Amendment”) to a certain share exchange agreement dated November 12, 2010 with Ding Neng Holdings, a British Virgin Islands company (“Ding Neng Holdings”). This share exchange agreement and the Amendment provides for an acquisition transaction in which the Company, through the issuance of 25,875,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.001, representing 90% of the issued and outstanding common stock immediately following the closing of this acquisition, acquired 100% of Ding Neng Holdings.
 
The closing of this acquisition took place on February 10, 2011, on which date, pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement as amended, the Company shall acquire all of the outstanding equity securities of Ding Neng Holdings from the shareholders of Ding Neng Holdings; and the shareholders of Ding Neng Holdings shall transfer and contribute all of their issued and outstanding shares of Ding Neng Holdings to the Company. Accordingly, the Company, via Ding Neng Holdings, held 100% of Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Limited, a Hong Kong Company, which held 100% of Zhangzhou Fuhua Biomass Energy Technology Co., Ltd., a wholly-foreign owned enterprise in China (“Fuhua Biomass”), which, via a series of variable interest entity (or VIE) arrangements, controlled the operating company Fujian Zhangzhou Ding Neng Bio-technology Co., Ltd. (“Ding Neng Bio-tech”). In connection of this share exchange, the Company changed its fiscal year end from June 30 to December 31.
 
In or about early October 2011, Mr. Nie Xinfeng, the Company’s former chairman of the Board of Directors, took possession of, among other things, the company seal, financial seal, and original books and records of Ding Neng Bio-tech. Since then, the Company was prevented from obtaining and did not have access to the financial information of Ding Neng Bio-tech.
 
It is within the Company’s knowledge that from late 2011 to 2014, due to change in law, unfavorable market conditions, and lack of effective management, the business of Ding Neng Bio-tech deteriorated significantly and eventually defaulted on various loan obligations. The Company also believes that Ding Neng Bio-tech guaranteed some of Mr. Nie’s personal debts. From 2011 to 2014, multiple legal proceedings were brought against Ding Neng Bio-tech by creditors, service vendors and former employees of the Company and against Mr. Nie by his creditors. As a result, substantially all of Ding Neng Bio-tech’s assets were seized or disposed of by Ding Neng Bio-tech’s or Mr. Nie’s creditors. Eventually, Ding Neng Bio-tech completely ceased its operations.
 
On June 4, 2015, Fuhua Biomass filed a civil action in Haicang District People’s Court of Xiamen, Fujian, PRC (the “Court”) against Ding Neng Bio-tech, alleging that the purposes of those certain Consulting Service Agreement, Operating Agreement, Pledge and Security Agreement, Option Agreement, and Voting Rights Proxy Agreement (the “VIE Agreements”) entered into by Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech on October 28, 2010 had been frustrated, and that these VIE Agreements should be terminated. Fuhua Biomass alleged that Ding Neng Bio-tech did not make any payment of service fees to Fuhua Biomass, and that Ding Neng Bio-tech failed to perfect the security interest in the pledged stock. On July 14, 2015, this case was settled via in-court mediation directed by the Court. As a result, Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech entered into binding settlement (i) to terminate the VIE Agreements, (ii) that Fuhua Biomass and Ding Neng Bio-tech did not have any other disputes over this case, and (iii) that the litigation fee in the amount of RMB10,000 (approximately $1,610.5) would be borne by Ding Neng Bio-tech.
 
Given that the Company was unable to exercise effective control over Ding Neng Bio-tech or gain access to Ding Neng Bio-tech’s financial information since 2011, and that the VIE Agreements were terminated, the Company deconsolidated Ding Neng Bio-tech’s financial results.

During a review of the Company’s financial statements by its auditor, the auditor examined the share register and all transactional bought note, sold notes, and instruments of transfer provided by the Secretary of the Company. There was no evidence that ownership of Ding Neng Holdings was ever registered to be transferred and held by the Company. The Company also discovered that Ding Neng Holdings was delinquent and defunct. Accordingly, it was unable to determine whether the Company was registered as the sole shareholder of Ding Neng Holdings pursuant to the share exchange agreement dated November 12, 2010, as amended on December 6, 2010. As a result, the Company excluded the accounts of Ding Neng Holdings and its subsidiaries in the Company’s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes as contained herein. The Company has written off all investments made in Ding Neng Holdings as loss on investment in subsidiary.
 
Share Purchase Agreement with EGOOS Mobile Technology Co. Ltd.
 
On October 19, 2015, the Registrant entered into a Share Purchase Agreement (the “Share Purchase Agreement”) with EGOOS Mobile Technology Company Limited, a British Virgin Islands holding company (“EGOOS BVI”), which owns 100% of EGOOS Mobile Technology Company Limited, a Hong Kong company (“EGOOS HK”), which owns 100% of Move the Purchase Consulting Management (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. (“WOFE” or “Yigou”), a foreign investment enterprise organized under the laws of the PRC, and which has, through various contractual agreements, management control and the rights to the profits of Guangzhou Yuzhi Information Technology Co., Ltd., a corporation organized under the laws of the PRC as a variable interest entity(“Guangzhou Yuzhi”), which owns 100% of Shenzhen Qianhai Exce-card Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“Shenzhen Exce-card”), which owns 100% of Guangzhou Rongsheng Information Technology Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation (“Guangzhou Rongsheng”, together with Guangzhou Yuzhi and Shenzhen Exce-card, is collectively referred to herein as “Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries”), and the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI. Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries engage in research, development, marketing and distribution of inlays/audio chips for audio bank card products.
 
The Share Purchase Agreement provides for an acquisition transaction (the “Acquisition”) in which the Registrant, through the issuance of a convertible note in the principal sum of Fifteen Million U.S. Dollars ($15,000,000) to EGOOS BVI’s sole shareholder, will acquire 100% of EGOOS BVI.
 
The closing of the Acquisition (the “Closing”) took place on October 19, 2015 (the “Closing Date”). On the Closing Date, pursuant to the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement, the Registrant acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of EGOOS BVI from the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI; and the shareholder of EGOOS BVI transferred and contributed all of his issued and outstanding shares of EGOOS BVI to the Registrant. In exchange, the Registrant issued to the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI a convertible note, which was subsequently converted into an aggregate of 15,000,000 post-Reverse Split (as defined below) Common Shares of the Registrant. There is no material relationship between the sole shareholder of EGOOS BVI and/or EGOOS BVI, on one hand, and the Company and its affiliates or associates, on the other hand. Upon conversion of the note (the “Conversion”), the then existing shareholders of the Registrant collectively own an aggregate of 24.7% of the post-Acquisition entity.
 
On August 5, 2015, Yigou entered into an Exclusive Service Agreement which entitles Yigou to receive substantially all of the economic benefits of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries in consideration of services provided by Yigou to Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries. In addition, Yigou entered into certain agreements with each of Wenbin Yang, Ping Li, (collectively, the “Guangzhou Yuzhi shareholders”), as well as Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries, including (i) a Call Option Agreement allowing Yigou to acquire the shares of Guangzhou Yuzhi as permitted by PRC laws, (ii) a Voting Rights Proxy Agreement that provides Yigou with the voting rights of the Guangzhou Yuzhi shareholders and those of Guangzhou Yuzhi, and (iii) an Equity Pledge Agreement that pledges the shares in Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries to Yigou. This VIE structure provides Yigou, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EGOOS HK, with control over the operations and benefits of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries without having a direct equity ownership in Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries (EGOOS BVI, EGOOS HK, Guangzhou Yuzhi, Shenzhen Exce-card, Guangzhou Rongsheng and Yigou are collectively referred to herein as the “Group”).

Reverse Stock Split
 
On October 13, 2015, the Company’s board of directors and stockholders collectively holding approximately 70.5% of the Company’s outstanding common stock executed a joint written consent approving a reverse stock split at a ratio of one-for-twenty (the “Reverse Split”). A Certificate of Amendment to our Certificate of Incorporation effecting the Reverse Split was filed with the Secretary of State of Delaware on December 1, 2015.
Business Overview
 
EGOOS BVI, a British Virgin Islands business company, acts as a holding company and indirectly controls Guangzhou Yuzhi (a variable interest entity in China) and its Subsidiaries. EGOOS BVI’s sole source of income and operations is through its indirect, contractual control of Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.
 
Based in the city of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, Guangzhou Yuzhi and Guangzhou Rongsheng are principally engaged in software and information technology services and share full-time employees with Shenzhen Exce-card.
 
Shenzhen Exce-card is based in the city of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, with a business development department in New York, NY. Additionally, Shenzhen Exce-card has entered into a partnership agreement with UINT France located in Saint Aubin, France (“UINT”), amended and supplemented by an amendment dated March 27, 2015 (as amended and supplemented, the “Partnership Agreement”), pursuant to which UINT is engaged by Shenzhen Exce-card to conduct product research and development (“R&D”) and other related services in connection with new audio signals, testing and producing new inlays for audio bank card and assisting the card manufacturers with lamination test, new generation of audio card, and assisting the card manufacturers with certification of the new audio card products.
 
Shenzhen Exce-card is principally engaged in the design and production of inlays composed of flexible circuit boards for active smart cards and other products in the related technological field, which provide a comprehensive solution for mobile payment. As of the date of this annual report, Shenzhen Exce-card has approximately 23 full-time employees.

In February 2015, Shenzhen Exce-card developed an electronic inlay utilizing innovative audio technology and embedded in a specialized IC card product, namely, “audio bank card.” We were granted the patent (expiring in 2023) pertaining to such audio bank cards inlay. The audio bank cards meet innovative product standards set forth by UnionPay, the only domestic bank card organization in China as well as the only interbank network in mainland China. UnionPay has authorized its logo to be displayed on the audio bank cards. However, it should be noted that we have no contractual agreement or arrangement with UnionPay with respect to audio bank cards.
 
We supply and sell electronic inlays embedded with audio chips and other modules to card manufacturers, such as Hengbao Co., Ltd. (“Hengbao”) and Wuhan Tianyu Information Industry Co., Ltd. (“Tianyu”), which have established relationships with major banks in China. As of December 31, 2015, we generated revenue in the amount of RMB150,000 (approximately $23,602.72), from the aforementioned sales to Tianyu.
 
Our Business Plan
 
We believe our growth in the coming years may be supported by the continuing expansion of the market for bank cards and electronic payment in the PRC. According to data compiled by the People’s Bank of China (the “PBOC”), by the end of 2015, the amount of bank cards issued in aggregate reached 5.4 billion in the PRC, with on average 3.99 cards held by each citizen.
 
We are seeking to develop and maintain long-term relationships with major card issuers in China. Since 2014, we have been actively communicating with China Construction Bank (“CCB”), one of China’s four major banks, in the pursuit of promoting new audio bank cards embedded with our inlays, which communications led to CCB’s desire to launch a pilot audio bank card program to be operated by its Guangdong branch offices (“CCB Guangdong”). Under this proposed program, 500,000 audio cards are expected to be manufactured by Tianyu, with inlays supplied by Shenzhen Exce-card, and issued and distributed by CCB Guangdong to some of its 25 million customers. At a meeting among Shenzhen Exce-card, Tianyu, and CCB Guangdong in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, PRC held on September 24, 2015, CCB Guangdong indicated that they would report to the individual finance department and procurement department of CCB’s headquarters for approval to start the procurement process regarding these 500,000 audio bank cards. In March 2016, CCB Guangdong started testing the audio cards internally (Phase I of the pilot program), and 500,000 audio bank cards are expected to be gradually introduced to the bank’s customers three to six months from Phase I. We also plan to pursue CCB’s Guangxi branch offices to promote another pilot program in the province of Guangxi, a province to the west of Guangdong, with a population of approximately 47 million. If these two pilot programs are launched and proved to be successful, CCB is expected to issue 4 million audio bank cards in various locations throughout China.
 
On April 22, 2016, Guangdong Branch (“CCB Guangdong”) of China Construction Bank, one of China’s four major banks, launched a pilot program to issue new audio bank cards embedded with our inlays. Under this pilot program, the audio cards with our inlays, once applied for by the end-users, will be issued and distributed by CCB Guangdong to its selected customers from its pool of 25 million customers.
 
On August 22, 2016, we announced that Guangdong Qilong Internet Technology Co., Ltd. (“Qilong”), a high technology company based in Guangzhou, China, and one of the Company’s subsidiaries, Shenzhen Exce-card, entered into a strategic agreement to jointly develop the next generation of audio bank cards within the China Union Pay network. It is expected that the end users of the audio bank cards to be developed under this strategic agreement will have the ability to use various services, including the ability to connect their savings accounts thereto, purchase items on credit, transfer among their accounts, take advantage of discounts on certain purchases and travel arrangements and manage their capital.
 
On February 15, 2017, we, through Shenzhen Exce-card, entered into a card supply agreement (the “SD Card Supply Agreement”) with SmartDisplayer Technology, Co. Ltd. (“SmartDisplayer”), a company incorporated under the law of Taiwan, Republic of China, pursuant to which SmartDisplayer agrees to supply audio bank cards in compliance with Shenzhen Exce-card’s specifications and the ISO 7810 standard and in amounts requested by Shenzhen Exce-card from time to time for a term of two years commencing from the execution date of the SD Card Supply Agreement.
 
Other than the research, development, marketing and distribution of inlays for audio bank cards, we are developing and expanding our product and services to other fields, which may include providing business consulting services, solutions and software products, and system development services to card issuing banks, third party payment entities, and other card issuing entities, and may also include entering into cooperation agreements with banks to issue co-branded cards in order to share annual fees and transaction fees generated by these co-branded cards, and developing customers and commercial users via the operation of audio payment platform.

Our Market
 
The Chinese Bank Card Market
 
According to a report published by the PBOC, in 2015, an aggregate of 5.442 billion bank cards were issued in China, an increase of 10.25% over 2014; national cardholding per capita was 4.39 as of the end of the third fiscal quarter of 2016. In terms of number of cards in circulation, the Chinese payment cards market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.9% over the period 2015-2020. Respecting the markets outside China, 68 million UnionPay cards have been issued in over 40 countries and regions by the end of November 2016.
The Chinese Contactless Bank Card Market
 
Audio bank cards enable a direct communication between bank cards and electronic devices (including telephones, cell phones, tablets, and computers), allowing electronic payment by bank cards. Audio bank cards can be used in swiped transactions (including point of sale payment and ATM deposit, withdrawal and transfer) as a regular bank card as well as transactions via electronic payment which, according to the Payment and Settlement System Report published by the PBOC in April 2014, is a combined market of potentially up to 1.85 quadrillion RMB.
 
Supportive Government Policies and Legislation in the PRC
 
In April 2005, the PBOC and other state departments jointly promulgated Certain Opinions on Promoting the Development of Bank Card Industry, which encouraged and promoted work emphasis of related government authorities on, among other things, meeting the demand and improving the varieties and functions of bank cards, promoting a fast and sound development of bank card handling market, enhancing the risk management of bank cards, and implementing industrial incentive policies to support the bank card industry.
 
On January 1, 2008, the National People’s Congress of China passed “the Enterprise Income Tax Law of the People’s Republic of China.” Accordingly, “the enterprise income tax on important high- and new-tech enterprises that are necessary to be supported by the state shall be levied at the reduced tax rate of 15%”, which applies to Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries. The regular enterprise income tax rate is 25% in China.
 
On July 18, 2015, the PBOC, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, the Ministry of Finance and seven other state government authorities jointly issued the Guideline Opinions on Promoting the Healthy Development of Internet Finance (the “Guidelines”), which aim to encourage innovation and support the steady development of internet finance.
 
Our Customers
 
Our inlays and relevant technology support are expected to be sold to bank card manufacturers. Audio bank cards embedded with our inlays are then expected to be sold to CCB Guangdong via its pilot program. In addition, we expect to develop and maintain our relationships with other banks throughout China.
 
Shenzhen Exce-card has entered into cooperation agreements on July 23, 2014 and July 7, 2014, respectively, to partner with two bank card manufacturers in China, Hengbao and Tianyu, both of which are publicly traded on China’s Shenzhen Stock Exchange and have established relationships with major commercial banks in China as their bank card providers, including Bank of China, Bank of Communications, CCB, Agricultural Bank of China, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.

Additionally, Shenzhen Exce-card and Tianyu signed a more detailed audio bank card production preparation service agreement (the “Service Agreement”), according to which, from May 1, 2015 to May 1, 2016, Shenzhen Exce-card is to provide inlays for testing, technology and support to Tianyu for the manufacturing of the audio bank card end product, and in return, Tianyu pays RMB150,000 (approximately $23,630.61) for Shenzhen Exce-card’s services. Tianyu, headquartered at Huazhong University of Science and Technology Science Park in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, is a high-tech enterprise focusing on the research and development, manufacturing, and sale of products and services related to data security, mobile internet, and payment services. It has an annual production capacity of 500 million IC cards, and an estimated annual production capacity of 10 million audio bank cards. At present, Tianyu is testing and digesting the technics for the lamination of audio bank cards, and thus, is manufacturing a portion of the 10,000 beta testing audio bank cards for Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries.
 
A second cooperation agreement was entered into between Shenzhen Exce-card and Tianyu on September 16, 2015, with a 10-year term, confirming terms of services and cooperation between the parties detailed in the Service Agreement.
 
Shenzhen Exce-card has also entered into a cooperation agreement with Hengbao on September 28, 2015, according to which, for 10 years from the date of this agreement, Shenzhen Exce-card is to provide inlays, technology and support to Hengbao for the manufacturing of the audio card end product, and in return, Hengbao pays RMB200,000 (approximately $31,507.48) for Shenzhen Exce-card’s services. Shenzhen Exce-card and Hengbao also agree to cooperate and develop the market application and to gradually increase the market shares of audio bank cards. Hengbao, headquartered in Beijing, China, with a manufacturing facility in Danyang City, Jiangsu Province, China, is one of the largest card manufacturers and providers in China. Hengbao has recently started to test and adjust the technics for the lamination of audio bank cards according to the cooperation agreement between Shenzhen Exce-card and Hengbao.
 
Through the strategic partnership with Qilong, we are exploring the possibility of selling our next generation audio bank cards to customers or members of Qilong, which is a joint developer of such said cards.

Marketing
 
Since we supply audio chips/inlays for bank cards, we have not engaged in direct advertising efforts for marketing our products to the mass bank card end users.
 
Our marketing strategy is to develop relationships with major banks and strategic business partners in China, starting with the pilot program in March of 2016 when CCB started testing internally the audio bank cards embedded with our flexible circuit board with the audio chips. Upon a consistent positive response from the market and relying on the success of this pilot program, we may seek to further develop relationships with other card issuers including banks, such as China Industrial and Commercial Bank, Bank of China, Agricultural Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. Issuance of audio bank cards by these card issuers and large banks may in turn encourage other smaller banks and card issuers in China to work with us and market our products to their customers. In addition, we are exploring co-development opportunities with non-bank businesses. On August 22, 2016, we entered into a strategic agreement with Qilong to jointly develop the next generation of audio bank cards within the China Union Pay network. We hope that we can leverage Qilong’s customer base to market the next generation of our audio bank cards.

Pricing
 
At present, there are no similar products on the market. Taking into account the level of acceptance by the market and the negotiation with issuing banks, we suggest that the unit price of the audio bank cards with our inlays to be set at per unit RMB 55, approximately $8.65, and inlay audio chips at per unit RMB 45, approximately $7.08. Price will be adjusted downwards upon the increase of volume issued and the amounts of competitive offers.
Research and Development
 
Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement between Shenzhen Exce-card and UINT, for the period from May 1, 2014 to April 30, 2016, Shenzhen Exce-card paid UINT €120,000 for R&D services, €20,000 of which was for developing new audio signals of new audio card product, €30,000 of which was for the testing of new Inlay and assisting the card manufacturers with lamination test, €50,000 of which was for the conception of new generation audio cards, and the last €20,000 of which was for assisting the card manufacturers with certification of the new audio card product. Another €60,000 was loaned to UINT to cover its operation costs. We plan to continue our cooperation relationship with UINT after the expiration of the Partnership Agreement, and plan to engage UINT for R&D and other related services for next generations of our audio card products in the future.
 
UINT currently have 12 employees for R&D. We expect to invest resources to retain more qualified employees and update our R&D equipment in China for our second generation audio bank cards with one chip of a combined function of audio chip and financial chip, and third generation audio bank cards with fingerprint sensor chips and other personalized functions.
 
Seasonality
 
We do not expect our operating results and operating cash flows to be subject to seasonal variations.
 
Employees
 
A substantial part of our employees are located in China. As of the date of this annual report, Guangzhou Yuzhi and its subsidiaries have nine employees in China and seven employees are located in the U.S. There are no collective bargaining contracts covering any of our employees. We believe our relationship with our employees is satisfactory.
 
We are required to contribute a portion of our employees’ total salaries to the Chinese government’s social insurance funds, including medical insurance, unemployment insurance and workers’ compensation insurance, and a housing assistance fund, in accordance with relevant regulations. Guangzhou Yuzhi and its Subsidiaries are currently paying social insurance for all of their twenty (20) full-time employees through a third party agent. We expect the amount of contribution to the government’s social insurance funds to increase in the future as we expand our workforce and operations.
 
Insurance companies in China offer limited business insurance products. While business interruption insurance is available to a limited extent in China, we have determined that the risks of interruption, cost of such insurance and the difficulties associated with acquiring such insurance on commercially reasonable terms make it impractical for us to have such insurance. As a result, we could face liability from the interruption of our business.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Currently we have five valid patents that were granted by the State Intellectual Property Office of the P.R.C. (“SIPO”) and the terms of which are ten years from the dates of grant of the patent applications. The five patents relate to the audio bank card technology and designs and its transaction system, such as the design of the circuit board embedded in the audio card, the transaction platform processing the audio data and the design of the audio chip. Two of the five patents were granted on May 4, 2016 and the rest were granted respectively on January 22, 2014, September 9, 2015 and December 23, 2015. We obtained one trademark of the Company’s logo from SIPO on August 21, 2016, which remains valid until August 20, 2026. In addition, we have two other pending trademark applications in P.R.C. On April 23, 2015, the Company through one of its subsidiaries obtained the copyright on its software of Zhuozhi Changtian bank audio card application for micro and small businesses

Pursuant to the Partnership Agreement, any background information and know-how used in connection with the agreement remain the property of the party introducing such background information. UINT’s know-how relating to the services it provides under this agreement remains the exclusive property of UINT and it may use such know-how for other clients. Additionally, the costs and rights of any patent related to the new audio bank card product arises during the Term are borne by and shared equally by both parties.
 
Government Approval and Regulation
 
We believe that we have been compliant to date with all requirements required by the applicable governing authorities in China for the research, development, production and distribution of audio bank cards embedded with our inlays, and that such laws, rules and regulations do not currently have a material impact on our operations. However, it is possible that more stringent rules or regulations could be adopted, which may increase our operating costs and expenses.
 
Additionally, since 1997, the PBOC has issued several versions of Financial IC Card Specifications. On November 3, 2014, PBOC published a Notice on Further Application of Financial IC Card, proposing a time frame, i.e., from April 1, 2015, new financial IC cards issued by any issuing banks should comply with the PBOC Financial IC Card Specifications version 3.0. We believe that we are in compliance with these requirements by the PBOC.
 
Competition
 
We currently are not aware of any other companies in or outside of China which is producing or marketing the similar products as our audio bank cards.
 
However, upon the introduction of our products and technology into the market, our potential competitors worldwide may include NagraID Security SA, a Switzerland-based technology and security services supplier for governments, enterprises, the banking industry and online electronic transactions; SmartPlayer Technology Co., Ltd., a Taiwan-based developer of viable display module for smart card applications; Suzhou HierStar System Limited, a PRC-based company that focuses on display cards embedded with one-time password (OTP) and public key infrastructure (PKI) technologies; and UINT.
 
Going Concern
 
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, as of December 31, 2017, the Company had accumulated deficits of $21,452,071 and working capital deficit of current liabilities exceeding current assets by $897,516 due to the substantial losses in operation in previous periods. Management’s plan to support the Company in operations and to maintain its business strategy is to raise funds through public and private offerings and to rely on officers and directors to perform essential functions with minimal compensation. If we do not raise all of the money we need from public or private offerings, we will have to find alternative sources, such as loans or advances from our officers, directors or others. Such additional financing may not become available on acceptable terms and there can be no assurance that any additional financing that the Company does obtain will be sufficient to meet its needs in the long term. Even if the Company is able to obtain additional financing, it may contain undue restrictions on our operations, in the case of debt financing, or cause substantial dilution for our stockholders, in the case of equity financing. If we require additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend operations or cease business entirely. The accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
