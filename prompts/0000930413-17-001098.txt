Market
 
Since the Company’s incorporation in the State of New Jersey in 1985, it has been primarily engaged in supplying noise source products, electronic testing and measurement instruments, and RF passive components to customers. Approximately 85% and 89% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in fiscal years 2016 and 2015, respectively, were derived from commercial customers. The remaining consolidated revenues (approximately 15% and 11%, respectively) were comprised of revenues made to the United States government (particularly the armed forces) and prime defense contractors.
Products
 
The Company, through its Microlab subsidiary, designs and manufactures a wide selection of RF passive components and integrated subsystems for signal conditioning and distribution in the wireless infrastructure markets, particularly for DAS, the in-building wireless solutions industry, radio base-station market and medical equipment sector. Microlab’s passive RF components share unique capabilities in the area of broadband frequency coverage, minimal loss and low Passive Intermodulation (“PIM”).
  Microlab product offerings include: neutral host DAS and co-siting combiner solutions, hybrid couplers and hybrid matrices, cross band couplers, attenuators, RF terminations, RF power splitters and diplexers, as well as RF combiners and broadband combiner trays for in-building DAS deployments.
 
The Company, through its Boonton subsidiary, designs and produces electronic test and measurement equipment including power meters, voltmeters, audio and modulation meters, portable passive intermodulation test equipment for field-based testing of cellular transmission signals and accessory products. These products measure the power of RF and microwave systems used by the military and in commercial sectors like telecommunications.
 
Boonton products are also used to test terrestrial and satellite communications, radar and telemetry. Certain power meter products are designed for measuring signals based on wideband modulation formats, allowing a variety of measurements to be made, including maximum power, peak power, average power and minimum power.
 
The Company’s noise components and instruments (noise source products) are used as a method to provide wide band signals for sophisticated telecommunication and defense applications, and as a stable reference standard for instruments and systems, including radar and satellite communications. Furthermore, noise sources can simulate challenging signaling conditions in data and RF transmission systems. Examples are jitter testing for high speed data lines used in modern computer architecture and signal to noise measurements to optimize wireless receivers and transmitters. Additionally, noise sources are used for jamming RF signals, and blocking or disturbing enemy radar and other communications, as well as insulating and protecting friendly communications.
 
Noise sources also are used in radar systems as part of built-in test equipment to continuously monitor the radar receiver and in satellite communications where the use of back-up receivers are becoming more common as the demand for communication availability and reliability is increasing. This test helps assure that the back-up receiver is functional and ready.
 
The Company’s products consist of several models with varying degrees of capabilities, which can be customized to meet particular customer requirements. They may be incorporated directly into the electronic equipment concerned or may be stand-alone components or devices that are connected to, or used in conjunction with, such equipment operating from an external site, in the factory or in the field. Prices of products range from approximately $100 to $100,000 per unit, with most revenues occurring between $2,000 and $35,000 per unit. The Company may experience variations in gross profit based upon the mix of these products sold, as well as variations due to revenue volume and economies of scale.

The Company’s products have extended useful lives and the Company provides recalibration services for its instrument products to ensure their accuracy, for a fee, to its domestic and international customers. Such services accounted for approximately 4% of consolidated revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
 
Management believes that its products offer state-of-the-art performance combined with outstanding customer and technical support.
 
Marketing and Sales
 
The Company’s products for both of its segments are sold globally through a small in-house sales force, by over one hundred manufacturers’ representatives and through a network of authorized distributors. The Company promotes the sale of its products through its web-site, product literature, publication of articles, presentations at technical conferences, direct mailings, trade advertisements and trade show exhibitions.
 
The Company’s relationship with its manufacturers’ representatives and distributors is governed by written contracts that either run for one-year renewable periods terminable by either party on 60 days prior notice or have indefinite lives terminable by either party on 60 days prior notice. The contracts generally provide for territorial and product representation. The Company does not believe that the loss of any single manufacturers’ representative or distributor would have a material adverse effect on its business.
 
Customers and Sales by Geographic Areas
 
The Company currently sells the majority of its products from both of its segments to commercial users in the communications industry. Other sales are made to large defense contractors, which incorporate the Company’s products into their products for sale to the U.S. and foreign governments, multi-national companies and Fortune 500 companies, and directly to the U.S. government.
 
For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, no one single customer accounted for 10% or more of total consolidated revenues. The Company’s largest customers vary from year to year.
 
Regional consolidated revenues from operations for fiscal year 2016 were made to customers in the Americas ($24,155,154 or 77% of total consolidated revenues), Europe, Middle East and Africa ($5,497,826 or 18% of total consolidated revenues) and Asia Pacific ($1,673,747 or 5% of total consolidated revenues). Regional consolidated revenues from operations for fiscal year 2015 were made to customers in the Americas ($24,946,340 or 75% of total consolidated revenues), Europe, Middle East and Africa ($5,885,975 or 18% of total consolidated revenues) and Asia Pacific ($2,276,791 or 7% of total consolidated revenues).
 
Research and Development
 
The Company currently maintains an engineering staff responsible for the improvement of existing products, design and modification of existing products and custom products with unique specifications to meet customer needs, and engineering, research and development of new products and applications. Research and development costs were approximately $4,046,000 and $3,957,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Competition
 
We compete against many companies which utilize similar technology, some of which are larger and have substantially greater resources and expertise in financial, technical and marketing areas than us. Some of these companies include Keysight Technologies, Inc., Rohde & Schwarz GmbH & Co. KG, Anritsu Corporation, Kathrein, Commscope and Westell Technologies, Inc. The Company competes by having a niche in several product areas where it capitalizes on its expertise in manufacturing products with unique specifications.

The Company designs its products with special attention to making them user-friendly and re-evaluates its products for the purpose of enhancing and improving them. The Company believes that these efforts coupled with its willingness to adapt its products to the particular needs of its customers and its intensive efforts in customer and technical support are factors that add to the competitiveness of our products.
 
Backlog
 
The Company’s consolidated backlog of firm orders to be shipped in the next twelve months was approximately $4,000,000 at December 31, 2016, compared to approximately $2,500,000 at December 31, 2015. It is anticipated that the majority of the backlog orders at December 31, 2016 will be filled during the current year. The stated backlog is not necessarily indicative of Company revenues for any future period nor is a backlog any assurance that the Company will realize a profit from the orders.
Inventory, Supplies and Manufacturing
 
The Company purchases components, devices and subassemblies from a wide variety of sources. The Company’s procurement policy requires maintaining adequate levels of raw materials inventory to minimize the Company’s production lead times with third-party suppliers and to improve the Company’s capacity to expedite fulfillment of customer orders. Although the procurement team focuses its efforts to work closely with its suppliers to avoid adverse effects of shortages or delays in delivery of inventories, delays in the future may have an adverse impact on the Company’s operations. For the year ended December 31, 2016, no one single third-party supplier accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total consolidated inventory purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2015, two third-party suppliers each accounted for approximately 10% of the Company’s total consolidated inventory purchases. No other third-party supplier accounted for 10% or more of the Company’s total consolidated inventory purchases for the year ended December 31, 2015.
 
The Company is not party to any long term contracts regarding the deliveries of its supplies and components. It generally purchases such items pursuant to written purchase orders of both the individual and blanket variety. Blanket purchase orders usually cover the purchase of a larger amount of items at fixed prices for delivery and payment on specific dates.
 
The Company develops, designs, manufactures, assembles, calibrates and tests our products at our facility in Parsippany, New Jersey. Testing of products is generally accomplished at the end of the manufacturing process and is performed in-house, as are all quality control processes. The Company utilizes modern equipment for the design, engineering, manufacture, assembly and testing of its products.
 
Warranty and Service
 
The Company typically provides one-year warranties on all of its products covering both parts and labor. The Company, at its option, repairs or replaces products that are defective during the warranty period if the proper preventive maintenance procedures have been followed by its customers.
 
In cases of defective products the customer typically returns them to the Company’s facility. The Company’s service personnel replace or repair the defective items and ships them back to the customer. Generally, all servicing is done at the Company’s facility, and the Company charges its customers a fee for those service items that are not covered by warranty. The Company’s Noisecom and Microlab divisions typically do not offer their customers any formal written service contracts. However, the Company’s Boonton division does offer its customers formal written service contracts for a fee.
 
Product Liability Coverage
 
The testing of electronic communications equipment and the accurate transmission of information entail a risk of product liability to the Company. Product liability claims could be asserted against the Company by end-users of any of the Company’s products.

The Company maintains product liability insurance coverage and no claims have been asserted for product liability due to a defective or malfunctioning device in the past 5 years.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We believe that our intellectual property, including its methodologies, is critical to our success and competitive position. We rely on a combination of U.S. and foreign patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Key employees have signed confidentiality and non-competition agreements regarding the Company’s proprietary information.
Regulation
 
Environmental
 
The Company’s operations are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations that limit discharges into the environment, establish standards for the handling, generation, use, emission, release, discharge, treatment, storage and disposal of, or exposure to, hazardous materials, substances and waste, and require cleanup of contaminated soil and groundwater.
 
The New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (the “NJDEP”) conducted an investigation in 1982 concerning disposal at a facility previously leased by the Company’s Boonton operations. The focus of the investigation involved certain materials formerly used by Boonton’s manufacturing operations at that site and the possible effect of such disposal on the aquifer underlying the property. The disposal practices and the use of the materials in question were discontinued in 1978. The Company has cooperated with the NJDEP investigation and has been diligently pursuing the matter in an attempt to resolve it in accordance with applicable NJDEP operating procedures. The above referenced activities were conducted by Boonton prior to our acquisition of that entity in 2000.
 
In 1982, Boonton and the NJDEP agreed upon a plan to correct ground water contamination at the site, located in the township of Parsippany-Troy Hills, pursuant to which wells have been installed by Boonton. The plan contemplates that the wells will be operated and that soil and water samples will be taken and analyzed until such time that contamination levels are satisfactory to the NJDEP. In 2014, the Company received approval for a groundwater permit from the NJDEP to carry out the final remedial action work plan and report. Under the final phase of the plan, there will be limited and reduced monitoring and testing as long as concentrations at the site continue on a decreasing trend.
 
Expenditures incurred by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 in connection with the site amounted to approximately $18,000 and $22,000, respectively. While management anticipates that the expenditures in connection with this site will not be substantial in future years, the Company could be subject to significant future liabilities and may incur significant future expenditures if further contaminants from Boonton’s testing are identified and the NJDEP requires additional remediation activities. Management is unable to estimate future remediation costs, if any, at this time. The Company will continue to be liable under the plan, in all future years, until such time as the NJDEP releases the Company from all obligations.
 
In December 2016, the Company and its subsidiary, Boonton, entered into an agreement with an insurance company to settle prior disputes between the parties related to whether insurance policies were issued by a former insurer and whether they provided coverage for expenses arising from the NJDEP environmental matter. Under the terms of the settlement agreement, the Company received a payment in the amount of $485,000 for full and final settlement of any and all further insurance claims.
 
At this time, the Company believes that it is in material compliance with all environmental laws, does not anticipate any material expenditure to meet current or pending environmental requirements, and generally believes that its processes and products do not present any unusual environmental concerns. Besides the matter

referred to above with the NJDEP, the Company is unaware of any existing, pending or threatened contingent environmental liability that may have a material adverse effect on its ongoing business operations.
 
Workplace Safety
 
The Company’s operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health. The Company believes it is in material compliance with these laws and regulations and does not believe that future compliance with such laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on its results of operations or financial condition.
 
ITAR and Export Controls
 
The Company is subject to International Traffic in Arms Regulation, or ITAR. ITAR requires export licenses from the U.S. Department of State for products shipped outside the U.S. that have military or strategic applications. Because some of the Company’s products could have military or strategic applications, it must ensure its compliance with ITAR.
 
In addition, the Company is subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, which regulates the export of certain “dual use” items and technologies and, in some instances, requires a license from the U.S. Department of Commerce in connection with sales of the Company’s products.
 
Government Contracting Regulations
 
Because the Company has contracts with the federal government and its agencies, it may be subject to audit from time to time of our compliance with government regulations by various agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA. The DCAA reviews the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, compensation and management information systems. The DCAA has the right to perform audits on our incurred costs on all contracts on a yearly basis. The Company has not been subject to a DCAA audit in the past 5 years.
 
Other governmental agencies, including the Defense Securities Service and the Defense Logistics Agency, may also, from time to time, conduct inquiries or investigations regarding a broad range of our activities.
 
Employees
 
As of March 3, 2017, the Company has 111 full time employees. The Company is not subject to collective bargaining agreements in the United States or internationally and considers its relationship with its employees to be good.
Investor Information
 
The Company is subject to the disclosure requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). Therefore, the Company files periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Such reports, proxy statements and other information may be read and copied by visiting the Public Reference Room of the SEC at 100 F Street N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
