Overview
 We are a molecular information company focused on fundamentally changing the way in which patients with cancer are evaluated and treated. We believe an information-based approach to making clinical treatment decisions based on comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, will become standard of care for patients with cancer. We derive revenue from selling services that are enabled by our molecular information platform to physicians and biopharmaceutical companies. Our platform includes proprietary methods and algorithms for analyzing specimens across all types of cancer, and for incorporating that information into clinical care in a concise and user-friendly fashion. Our services provide genomic insights about each patient’s individual cancer obtained from that analysis, enabling physicians to optimize treatments in clinical practice and biopharmaceutical companies to develop targeted therapies and immunotherapies more effectively. We believe we have a significant first-mover advantage in providing high-quality, CGP and molecular information services globally on a commercial scale. 
 We offer a full suite of validated clinical assays based on our CGP approach:
  
• | FoundationOne® for solid tumors, our flagship assay, that we commercialized in 2012;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FoundationOne®Heme for blood-based cancers, or hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, lymphoma, and advanced sarcomas, that we commercialized in 2013;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FoundationACT® (Assay for Circulating Tumor DNA), our blood-based (liquid biopsy) assay to evaluate circulating tumor DNA, or ctDNA, which is DNA shed from tumors that circulates in blood plasma outside of cells, that we commercialized in 2016;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FoundationFocus™ CDx BRCA, a companion diagnostic assay, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca™ (rucaparib) is being considered, that we commercialized in 2016; and,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FoundationOne CDx™, the first FDA approved broad companion diagnostic assay for solid tumors. FoundationOne CDx was approved by the FDA on November 30, 2017 as part of a parallel review process for breakthrough devices with FDA and The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To accelerate our commercial growth and enhance our competitive advantage, we are continuing to innovate and commercialize new molecular information services for physicians and biopharmaceutical companies, pursue reimbursement from regional and national commercial third-party payors and government payors, strengthen our commercial organization, introduce new marketing, education, provider, policy, and advocacy engagement efforts, seek inclusion of molecular information services into oncology clinical care treatment guidelines published by accredited cancer care organizations, grow our molecular information knowledgebase, called FoundationCore, expand global access to our molecular information services through our broad collaboration with affiliates of Roche Holdings, Inc., or Roche, publish scientific and medical advances, broaden our collaborations with biopharmaceutical companies, particularly in the areas of biomarker discovery, targeted and immuno-oncology, and companion diagnostics development, and foster relationships across the global oncology community. 
 The Shift to Personalized Cancer Care
 The cancer treatment paradigm is evolving rapidly, and we believe there is now widespread recognition that cancer is a disease of the genome, rather than a disease defined solely by its specific anatomical location in the body. Today, physicians increasingly use precision medicines to target cancers based on the specific genomic alterations driving their growth. Furthermore, in May 2017, the 
 1

FDA granted its first tissue/site-agnostic approval. We believe this signals the potential for additional FDA approvals based on the presence of genomic biomarkers as opposed to the anatomic location of the cancer.
 We believe physicians need molecular information about their patients’ unique cancers to determine the optimal course of treatment.
 We also believe the oncology community needs comprehensive molecular information services that can assess the known biologically relevant genomic alterations and cancer biomarkers from a patient’s disease and distill complex molecular information into a concise and actionable format. We designed our suite of clinical molecular information services to meet these needs. We believe a CGP approach to providing molecular information for use in clinical settings addresses an area of significant unmet medical need for patients suffering from advanced, or active metastatic, cancers. We estimate that there are approximately 1.1 million patients per year in the United States with newly-diagnosed or recurrent, active metastatic cancers who fall into challenging treatment categories, including patients who have rare or aggressive diseases, patients whose disease has progressed after standard treatments, and patients who have tested negative under, or been ineligible for, traditional molecular diagnostic tests. We are initially focusing on these patients because we believe this patient population will benefit most from our comprehensive molecular information products. 
 To maintain our market leadership position and offer physicians and the biopharmaceutical industry a full suite of innovative molecular information services, we continue to innovate new molecular information tests and services that can help advance personalized cancer care. For example, in November 2017, we announced FDA approval and receipt of a preliminary NCD from CMS for FoundationOne CDx, the first FDA-approved broad companion diagnostic for solid tumors. FoundationOne CDx is the next evolution of our flagship assay, FoundationOne. FoundationOne CDx provides physicians with a clinically and analytically validated platform to help guide treatment decisions and enable efficient patient access to targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and clinical trials. By enabling physicians to use a single, FDA-approved companion diagnostic assay for multiple drugs requiring a companion diagnostic, we believe we can reduce much of the guesswork that often arises when selecting a diagnostic test for cancer. Our approach is designed to help assure physicians and their patients that they have the information necessary to make an informed treatment decision based on a comprehensive view of companion diagnostic claims, as well as potential treatment options based on oncology clinical care guidelines, peer-reviewed literature, and clinical trial options.
 At the time of its approval, FoundationOne CDx guided to 17 targeted therapies across five of the most common solid tumors: NSCLC, CRC, ovarian cancer, breast cancer, and melanoma. FoundationOne CDx also reports predictive genomic signatures for immuno-oncology treatment selection including microsatellite instability (MSI) and tumor mutational burden (TMB). We intend to update FoundationOne CDx over time with new FDA-approved companion diagnostic claims. As such, we believe FoundationOne CDx enables the practice of precision oncology by identifying more patients who may benefit from targeted treatment, immunotherapy approaches, and clinical trials than traditional single gene testing methods. 
 FoundationOne CDx was approved by the FDA and granted a preliminary NCD by CMS as part of a process called Parallel Review for breakthrough devices. Concurrent with our FDA approval, we received a preliminary NCD from CMS. The preliminary NCD proposes to cover FoundationOne CDx for Medicare beneficiaries and for individuals with Medicare Advantage plans who meet the eligibility criteria outlined in the to-be-finalized coverage policy. We received our unique PLA billing code for FoundationOne CDx in February 2018 and expect to commercialize FoundationOne CDx in early 2018. 
 As the number of available targeted therapies and immunotherapies expands and as physicians gain further experience using comprehensive molecular information in their routine treatment decisions, we believe that the potential addressable market for comprehensive molecular information services will expand over the next five years to include most patients who have metastatic disease and additional patients with earlier stage disease, to identify patients with predictive tumor biomarkers for whom immunotherapy may provide the best course of treatment, and for liquid biopsy services for patients from whom a tissue biopsy is not available. We estimate that this potential market expansion could bring the total number of patients who could benefit from our approach in the United States to approximately two million annually. 
 The use of personalized medicine in oncology is continually evolving, and we believe the understanding of the genomic changes in each patient’s tumor DNA is enabling a shift in clinical treatment from a one-size-fits-all approach to one that is highly individualized based on comprehensive molecular insights. As such, the biopharmaceutical industry is accelerating research and development of targeted therapies and immunotherapies.  For example, we believe there are more than 630 targeted therapies and immunotherapies for cancer care in late-stage clinical development by biopharmaceutical companies, as well as thousands of open and enrolling clinical trials ongoing in the United States. To keep pace with this shift to personalized cancer care, there is an increasing focus on the use of companion diagnostics to guide physicians in selecting the most appropriate therapy for each patient, and a desire to accelerate biopharmaceutical development of new, innovative therapies.
 We believe FoundationOne CDx, along with our full suite of molecular information services, provides us with significant competitive differentiation and a first-mover advantage in our biopharmaceutical and clinical businesses. FoundationOne CDx provides our biopharmaceutical partners with an FDA-approved platform for companion diagnostic development which may mitigate developmental, operational, and commercial risks in companion diagnostic development. FoundationOne CDx received FDA approval that included companion diagnostic claims for 17 targeted therapies indicated for treatment in five of the most common solid tumor types. Over time, we expect to expand the number of companion diagnostic claims approved by the FDA on FoundationOne CDx. For 
 2

example, we have announced that we are developing companion diagnostics to be included on FoundationOne CDx for several of our partners including AstraZeneca PLC, or AstraZeneca; Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer; and Roche.
 As a precursor to the FDA approval of FoundationOne CDx, in December 2016, we received FDA approval for, and began commercialization of, FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, a companion diagnostic assay to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca™ (rucaparib), a therapy offered by Clovis Oncology, Inc., or Clovis, is being considered. This companion diagnostic claim is now included on FoundationOne CDx. We believe the experience of gaining FDA approval for FoundationFocus CDx BRCA was instrumental in our FDA approval for FoundationOne CDx.
 Our Unique and Synergistic Business
 We believe we have a unique and synergistic business model comprised of:
  
• | A robust clinical business providing molecular information to physicians;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A strong biopharmaceutical business where our molecular information services enable us to serve as a powerful research and development partner; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Bioinformatics and data analytics capabilities that enable us to provide molecular insights that inform our partners’ development strategies.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each facet of our business enables us to continually innovate and update our molecular information services so that all patients with advanced cancer have access to personalized care.

We are dedicated to ongoing innovation of our molecular information platform and new product pipeline.  Through our synergistic business model that incorporates broad biopharmaceutical partner relationships, we have a unique opportunity to generate revenue and to provide insights into new cancer genes and important biomarkers under investigation. These new genes and biomarkers can then be incorporated into our molecular information platform at an early stage and allow us to participate in the development of the newest oncology therapeutics and clinical practice. 
 For example, our efforts have yielded enhancements to our CGP platform over time:
  
• | In 2017, we continued to build upon the body of evidence supporting tumor mutational burden (TMB) as a reliable, predictive marker of response to immunotherapy. At the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, we presented data showing that measuring TMB with FoundationOne can predict responses to FDA-approved anti-PD-1/anti-PD-L1 immunotherapies in triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian cancer, metastatic melanoma, biliary tract cancer, and cancer of unknown primary, pointing to potentially new subsets of patients who may benefit from this therapeutic strategy. This data builds off data previously presented at ASCO 2016 demonstrating that FoundationOne may help predict response to cancer immunotherapy agents across a variety of advanced cancers by integrating two independent quantitative markers, TMB, and micro-satellite instability, or MSI, as part of the assay. Specifically, TMB calculated by Foundation Medicine successfully predicted a greater likelihood of patient response and longer response duration to cancer immunotherapies in patients with advanced bladder cancer, metastatic melanoma, and colorectal and lung cancers.

• | We further presented new and compelling data at the 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, using FoundationOneHeme. One data presentation showed that more than one-quarter of patients with plasma
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

cell leukemia, or PCL, had high TMB indicating the potential for response to immuno-oncology treatment strategies, including checkpoint inhibitors. Currently, less than 50 percent of PCL patients achieve complete remission with current standard of care treatments, underscoring the need for new treatment options for these patients and the importance of measuring TMB as part of genomic profiling.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | At the 2017 European Society for Medical Oncology Annual Meeting, we presented validation data for our novel assay measuring tumor mutational burden from blood, or bTMB. The data presented was from a retrospective analysis from Roche/Genentech's Phase II POPLAR and Phase III OAK studies that enabled analytic and clinical validation for our bTMB assay. The studies demonstrate that high bTMB as measured by our novel assay is associated with response to atezolizumab in individuals with previously-treated NSCLC, potentially offering a new option to expand personalized care options for patients with advanced cancer. Based on these findings, our bTMB assay has been integrated as part of Roche/Genentech's prospective, randomized Phase III Blood First Assay Screening Trial (BFAST) as a companion diagnostic assay to investigate bTMB as a non-invasive biomarker of response to first-line atezolizumab in advanced NSCLC patients. As cancer immunotherapy continues to emerge as a therapeutic tool for patients, there is a significant need for a non-invasive measure of TMB in patients where tissue is not available or when a tissue biopsy is not feasible. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 TMB and MSI are reported on all FoundationOne CDx, FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme cases. We expect further development of our bTMB assay as a companion diagnostic, providing an important predictive and complementary solution to add to our FoundationACT liquid biopsy platform, and ultimately enabling physicians to make informed selection of targeted or immunotherapy treatments if tissue is unavailable.
 We believe we have a significant first mover advantage in building a compelling portfolio of molecular information services that comprehensively assesses cancer simultaneously for immunotherapy biomarkers such as MSI and TMB as well as for four classes of genomic alterations (i.e., base pair substitutions, copy number alterations, short insertions and deletions, or indels, and gene rearrangements) across all cancer-related genes with the sensitivity and specificity required for routine medical practice. We continually publish or present our analytic validation to demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of our assays. For example:
  
• | FoundationOne: Our analytic validation for FoundationOne was published in Nature Biotechnology in October 2013.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FoundationOneHeme: Together with our partner, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, we published our analytic validation for FoundationOneHeme in the journal Blood in 2016.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FoundationACT: We presented analytic validation data for FoundationACT in the 2016 Advances in Genome Biology and Technology, or AGBT, Conference and at the 2016 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, or AACR, demonstrating that our platform achieves high unique coverage for our test from limited ctDNA input which enables accurate detection of base substitutions, indels, and genomic rearrangements at very low tumor content, as well as copy number amplifications with performance specifications equivalent to those for FoundationOne. Subsequently, we submitted a manuscript for publication.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FoundationFocus CDx BRCA: FDA approved based on analytic and clinical validation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FoundationOne CDx: We presented analytic validation data for FoundationOne CDx at the 2017 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, or IASLC, 18th World Conference on Lung Cancer, or WCLC. Data demonstrated high concordance with multiple companion diagnostics and other single marker assays currently used to match targeted therapies to people with certain types of NSCLC, melanoma, CRC, ovarian cancer or breast cancer.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe the genomic alterations identified for each patient by our CGP assays should be accompanied by the most current and relevant scientific and medical literature related to those alterations, and that this information should be presented in a clear and concise manner to enable informed clinical treatment decisions and to facilitate development of novel therapeutics. Our molecular information knowledgebase, FoundationCore, amasses genomic alteration data from every tumor sequenced with one of our CGP assays, combined with a highly curated database of clinical findings and evidence associated with these genomic results. We have sequenced approximately 180,000 sample profiles as of December 31, 2017, representing more than 150 tumor types, and we believe FoundationCore is the largest real-world cancer genomics database of its kind. Our test reports contain combined genomics information with scientific and medical literature specific to the identified genomic alterations detected in a patient’s tumor. These patient reports are available to ordering physicians through our Foundation Portal (formerly our Interactive Cancer Explorer, FoundationICE). 
 In an effort to leverage molecular insights to advance personalized cancer care, we are working to match patients to clinical trials based on the genomics of each patient’s unique cancer. Clinical trials often provide opportunities for patients to access targeted therapies and immunotherapies, yet it is estimated that only 3%-4% of patients with cancer in the United States are enrolled in clinical trials. We believe our unique and proprietary decision support applications are a competitive differentiator of our comprehensive molecular information solutions. They may accelerate the adoption of our molecular information services and potentially enable greater patient access to personalized medicine. One example is our innovative program called FoundationSmartTrials, which includes a suite of offerings to help increase patient access to, and provider awareness of, clinical trials, and, in doing so, accelerate drug development for our biopharmaceutical partners.

One such offering in our FoundationSmartTrials program is called Precision Enrollment, which efficiently identifies patients with rare or specific biomarkers and matches them to clinical trials. A second offering in FoundationSmartTrials is our Recruiter tool which is optimized for early-stage trials or trials with broader target profiles. This service identifies qualified patients for potential enrollment at the same institution where they are being treated. We have developed, and are now piloting, additional offerings within the FoundationSmartTrials portfolio. We believe our FoundationSmartTrials program may be a catalyst for precision medicine by enabling greater patient access to personalized therapies and simultaneously enabling our biopharmaceutical partners to accelerate drug development due to optimized patient identification and trial enrollment, while building the necessary evidence base to guide clinical decision-making. We believe the combination of our CGP assays, our FoundationCore knowledgebase, our robust data analytics programs, and our deep and extensive biopharmaceutical relationships uniquely position us to make a significant impact on patient enrollment in oncology clinical trials nationwide.
 We have observed significant adoption of our clinical molecular information products in the marketplace, and many thousands of physicians from large academic centers to community-based practices have ordered our molecular information products for clinical use. We believe this breadth of adoption demonstrates the demand for and utility of our comprehensive genomic profiling solutions that help oncologists effectively implement the promise of precision medicine. 
 We believe our suite of molecular information services have a sustainable competitive advantage because they: 
  
• | Provide comprehensive and reliable identification of clinically relevant information — FoundationOne currently assesses 315 biologically relevant cancer genes for all four classes of genomic alterations clinically relevant to the treatment of cancer, including TMB and MSI, with high sensitivity and specificity. We believe FoundationOne identifies genomic alterations that many other commercially available “hot spot” diagnostic tests cannot. FoundationOneHeme employs RNA sequencing of 265 genes in addition to DNA sequencing of 406 genes to detect all classes of genomic alterations, including TMB, across genes known to be altered (other than through inherited genetic characteristics), which are also known as somatic alterations, in hematologic malignancies, and in advanced sarcomas, which we believe also will lead to the identification of clinically relevant information. FoundationACT identifies in a cancer patient’s blood all known clinically relevant alterations in 62 genes altered in human solid tumors that are validated targets for therapy or are unambiguous drivers of cancer. The assay has been optimized to overcome the tremendous challenges of detecting low quantities of ctDNA in blood and has been analytically validated for high accuracy across all classes of genomic alterations clinically relevant to the treatment of cancer. FoundationFocus CDx BRCA is the first FDA-approved, tissue-based, genomic assay based on next generation sequencing that detects tumor BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (which may include both germline (inherited) and somatic (acquired) mutations) in women with ovarian cancer. FoundationOne CDx is the first FDA-approved broad companion diagnostic assay for solid tumors. FoundationOne CDx currently assesses 324 relevant cancer genes for all classes of genomic alterations, and reports on TMB and MSI. FoundationOne CDx has demonstrated proven concordance with multiple FDA-approved companion diagnostic assays and FDA approval is based on analytical and clinical validation of more than 6,300 samples.

• | Offer a portfolio approach providing oncologists with important options in CGP testing — We believe we are the only provider of both tissue and liquid biopsy CGP, together with a full range of molecular information products and companion diagnostics for solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. We believe physicians appreciate the ease-of-use and simplicity of ordering from one company that provides a full solution for all CGP testing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Eliminate Barriers to Patient Access — FDA-approved FoundationOne CDx provides physicians with a single validated, high quality test that looks for all guideline-recommended genes in solid tumors, including companion diagnostic indications with a direct path to therapy. The national coverage determination, or NCD, from CMS, when final, will provide covered access to our test for eligible Medicare beneficiaries, helping to alleviate some of the reimbursement challenges that can be an obstacle for patient access.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Incorporate the latest scientific and medical advances — We have extensive relationships across the scientific and medical oncology communities, including with key thought leaders and leading biopharmaceutical companies. These relationships help us incorporate new cancer genes, important biomarkers, like MSI and TMB, the latest scientific findings, newly available targeted therapeutics, immunotherapies, and relevant clinical trials into test results of our CGP tests.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Readily integrate into routine clinical practice — Our proprietary sample preparation processes and computational biology algorithms allow us to utilize small amounts of tumor tissue from a wide variety of sample types, including tissue with low tumor purity and from liquid (blood) biopsies, so as to allow for routine specimen collection. We detect and report the clinically relevant genomic alterations, typically within two weeks from the time the specimen is received. We are dedicated to providing high-quality support to our customers, from order initiation and sample acquisition through report delivery and follow-up with our medical affairs team.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Provide clinically relevant information and decision support applications that physicians can use — In a concise report, we communicate the relevant genomic alterations in a patient’s cancer and, based on peer-reviewed literature and clinical and governmental databases, match these alterations with targeted therapies, immunotherapies and relevant

clinical trials. FoundationOne CDx will deliver increased simplicity in reporting. We continue to develop innovative new decision support applications, like FoundationSmartTrials, that support informed treatment decision-making and enable improved access to therapies.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we are a unique and highly differentiated molecular information company. The combination of our suite of CGP assays and molecular information services, our world-class laboratories in Cambridge, MA; Research Triangle Park NC; and Penzberg, Germany, our analytic and bioinformatics capabilities, and our genomics knowledgebase, FoundationCore, enable us to be a leader in personalized oncology care and data driven insights, making us a trusted solution partner to the biopharmaceutical industry.  Our molecular information platform is currently used by more than 30 biopharmaceutical partners to enhance the development of their targeted oncology therapies and immunotherapies, to identify novel targets and for biomarker discovery, to optimize and accelerate patient selection and recruitment into clinical trials and to rapidly develop companion diagnostics as part of a coordinated regulatory strategy. We believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on additional significant market opportunities with biopharmaceutical partners over the next five years. Our biopharmaceutical partners leverage our molecular information platform in four primary ways to accelerate research, optimize development and enhance commercialization: 
  
• | Molecular profiling: We use our proprietary comprehensive genomic profiling platform, computational biology, and information technology capabilities to perform both retrospective and prospective analyses of clinical trial patient samples. Our molecular profiling solutions enable novel clinical trial designs, enhance patient selection, identify appropriate patient populations for clinical trials, and identify novel genomic targets. A selection of our biopharmaceutical partners for molecular profiling includes AstraZeneca, Celgene, Clovis, Johnson & Johnson, or J&J, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, or Novartis, and Roche.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Clinical Trials Design and Enrollment Support (or Acceleration): In addition to customary clinical settings in which physicians prescribe an FDA-approved therapy, approximately 3%-4% of patients with cancer in the United States are currently enrolled in clinical trials of experimental therapies sponsored by biopharmaceutical companies. As we broaden our relationships with current and future biopharmaceutical partners, we expect our molecular information platform to enable an increasing number of cancer patients both within and outside the United States to access clinical trials. Our innovative program, FoundationSmartTrials, includes a suite of offerings to help increase patient access to, and provider awareness of, clinical trials, and, in doing so, accelerate drug development for our biopharmaceutical partners. We believe this program may be a catalyst for precision medicine by enabling greater patient access to personalized therapies and simultaneously enabling our biopharmaceutical partners to accelerate drug development.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Companion Diagnostics Development and Approval: We provide our partners with companion diagnostic development and regulatory support services to help drive their precision medicine strategies. We utilize our FDA-approved FoundationOne CDx and FoundationFocus CDx BRCA tests under Quality System Regulation, or QSR, standards with the aim of developing companion diagnostic assays having a premarket approval, or PMA, from the FDA. Our FDA-approved companion diagnostics platforms offer a significantly streamlined and accelerated path to approval for our biopharmaceutical customers. We are currently working with several biopharmaceutical partners, including AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS, Pfizer, and Roche, among others, to develop companion diagnostics to complement their oncology therapeutic pipelines. We believe our companion diagnostic development work is an integral component of our regulated products strategy and represents the primary engine of new content development for FoundationOne CDx.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FoundationCore: Our FoundationCore knowledgebase now amasses approximately 180,000 real-world, genomic profiles as of December 31, 2017. Our biopharmaceutical partners use the insights we generate from this data for novel target identification, clinical trial design, and product lifecycle management. We leverage our advanced analytics and data sharing capabilities in combination with our FoundationCore database to collaborate with our biopharmaceutical partners to identify new genomic signatures, design development programs to support novel programs and to expand therapeutic treatment franchises. An example of such a collaboration is our work in immunotherapy with our partner Roche, leveraging signatures such as TMB. Against the backdrop of a large number of immunotherapy programs currently in development as well as demand for such treatment options, there is an increasing need by biopharmaceutical companies to partner with us to differentiate their immunotherapy programs and identify the most appropriate patients for their drugs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Over time, we intend to expand our ability to capture, aggregate, analyze, and facilitate the broader exchange of genomic data across the global oncology community. We are investing in our technology architecture to allow oncologists to share clinical data. This platform has been deployed within our Precision Medicine Exchange Consortium, or PMEC, and is being deployed with other institutional and biopharmaceutical partners to enable genomic and clinical data sharing in support of research initiatives to advance personalized medicine in cancer. PMEC, which is organized as an unincorporated non-profit association, brings together oncology thought leaders from leading U.S. academic medical centers, hospital systems, and community oncology networks. PMEC has been formed to advance the development and use of precision medicine in oncology. To achieve this purpose, PMEC expects to engage in a number of activities, including establishing an enhanced clinical trials network among its members, exchanging molecular information and clinical outcomes data, and engaging in joint research projects.

Furthermore, through data partnerships with leading technology and software companies such as Flatiron Health, Inc., or Flatiron, we are building a broader data platform around FoundationCore that powers research and discovery. For example, our clinico-genomic database with Flatiron has 33,000 linked clinico-genomic records, and is designed to help researchers and biopharmaceutical partners accelerate the development of targeted therapeutics and immunotherapies to treat cancer. We believe this HIPAA-compliant, clinico-genomic database is one of the largest information efforts of its kind in oncology to integrate genomic profiling data from patients whose tumors were sequenced with our assays together with annotated longitudinal clinical and outcomes data developed by Flatiron. By making clinico-genomic data available as part of the clinical research process, researchers will have access to real-world information in designing the next generation of oncology therapeutics and clinical trials, ultimately paving the way for new and more precise therapies for cancer patients.
 In addition to our collaborations across the biopharmaceutical industry and academia, we have also partnered with the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, in a collaborative data exchange program. In 2016, we agreed to contribute 18,000 genomic profiles of adult cancers to the NCI Genomics Data Commons (GDC) portal from our FoundationCore knowledgebase, which is one of the largest and most robust knowledgebases of its kind, in an effort to stimulate research for novel drug targets. Further, in 2016 and as part of President Obama’s Precision Medicine Initiative, we released a dataset of pediatric genomic profiles to accelerate the discovery and development of new therapeutics to treat pediatric cancer disease.  We are also participating in the Blood Profiling Atlas Consortium (BloodPAC) to aggregate, make freely available, and harmonize for further analyses, raw datasets from circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and exosome assays as well as relevant clinical data (e.g., clinical diagnosis, treatment history and outcomes), and sample preparation and handling protocols from 13 different studies.
 We believe that our molecular information platform will continue to add to the collective knowledgebase of cancer biology and clinical practice and potentially contribute to advancements in the treatment of cancer by: 
  
• | creating additional utility for our physician customers by delivering new potentially actionable information through the Foundation Portal;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | informing data-driven patient care decisions;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | providing molecular epidemiology for novel and known targets for target validation;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identifying known drug targets in novel tumor types;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | identifying novel resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | discovering new insights into the biologic basis of metastasis;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | illuminating new cancer targets, including determining the role of genomic variants of previously unknown significance;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enabling combination therapy; and
--+----------------------------------


• | enhancing clinical trial design.
--+---------------------------------

 We expect the importance of our molecular information strategy will increase with the number of our patient cases and as we augment FoundationCore with additional clinical data. If we, in conjunction with our partners, oncologists, pathologists, biopharmaceutical partners, and academic researchers, can successfully capture and utilize this data, we believe we can continue to play an even more impactful role in transforming care for the millions of patients suffering from cancer. 
 Our Strategy
 Our mission is to transform cancer care. Our goal is to be the global leader in precision oncology, and to build a company where we advance innovative new therapies and impact cancer care through data-driven insights. To achieve this objective, our strategy is to: 

• | Launch and scale FoundationOne CDx and extend market leadership of our core suite of CGP assays including FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, and future products we may develop — In the near-term we will focus on the launch and scale of FoundationOne CDx as our next flagship product.

Our Industry 
 Despite enormous investment in research and the introduction of new treatments, cancer remains a critical area of unmet medical need. According to the 2017 American Cancer Society report, “Cancer Facts & Figures 2017,” in the United States more than 15.5 million people were living with a history of cancer, and nearly 1.7 million people were expected to be diagnosed with the disease during 2017. Hematologic malignancies, most commonly leukemias, lymphomas, myelomas, and pediatric cancers, are cancers that affect the body’s blood, lymphatic system, or bone marrow, and, taken together, account for approximately 10% of new cancer diagnoses in the United States.  
 The global cancer burden is growing. The World Health Organization predicts in its publication, Global Action Against Cancer, that in 2020 there will be 16 million new cancer cases and 10 million cancer deaths globally. A recent report by the American Cancer Society, “The Global Economic Cost of Cancer,” estimates that the total annual economic impact of premature death and disability from cancer worldwide is approximately $900 billion. 
 According to ASCO, there were more than 12,000 practicing hematologists and/or medical oncologists treating patients with cancer in the United States in 2017. While a small portion of oncologists practice in major academic-based cancer centers, the National Cancer Institute estimates that approximately 80% of the oncologists in the United States practice in community-based settings, which is where the vast majority of patients with cancer are treated.
 According to Quintiles IMS Health, there are currently approximately 630 late stage oncology drugs in the pipeline, 87% of which are targeted therapies and immunotherapies. Approximately 11% of those oncology drugs are utilizing biomarker-based segmentation. In 2016, the global costs of oncology therapies totaled approximately $113 billion. With future growth anticipated in the range of 6-9% annually, it is estimated that oncology spending will total more than $147 billion by 2021.
 The diagnosis of cancer is complex and multidimensional. Practicing oncologists routinely order multiple tests, including currently available molecular diagnostic tests, to better understand the genomic alterations that are driving their patients’ cancer growth.
 Cancer Treatment is Evolving to a Molecular-Based Paradigm 
 Cancer is not a single disease. The term ‘cancer’ describes a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. Cells can experience uncontrolled growth if there are alterations to DNA, such as damage or mutations, and, therefore, disruption to the genes and proteins regulating cell division. 
 Surgery is often the first line of therapy for cancer where possible, and according to the American Cancer Society, most patients with cancer will have some type of surgery. Surgery often presents the greatest chance for a cure, especially if the cancer has been detected early in its development and has not spread to other parts of the body. Many patients, however, require therapeutic intervention beyond surgery alone.

Physicians have used radiation as a cancer therapy since the early 20th century, and modern radiation techniques deliver therapy with significant precision. Nevertheless, even today, radiation’s use and efficacy is limited because the high doses necessary to kill cancer cells often cause damage to healthy cells in the treatment area and fail to kill all cancer cells, particularly if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. 
 Physicians began using chemotherapy in the 1940s as a drug therapy approach that acts by killing cells that divide rapidly, one of the main properties of most cancer cells. These cytotoxic therapies are often prescribed by a trial and error approach — both because certain chemotherapies have limited efficacy in some patients and the treatment effect might thus be inconsistent, and because the therapies’ indiscriminate destruction of healthy cells involved in critical biological functions can cause severe toxic side effects in some patients. 
 More recently, oncologists are integrating a precision medicine approach by utilizing therapeutics that target cancers based on the specific genomic alterations driving their growth. We believe the oncology community is generally beginning to change clinical practice so that oncologists treat each individual’s cancer according to its unique genomic alterations that impact the underlying biological pathways within the patient’s cancer, rather than treating a patient’s cancer based solely on its initial anatomical location in the body, such as the breast, colon, or lung. In addition, as a result of advancements in cancer biology and genomic technology that enable the identification of new cancer genes, biopharmaceutical companies are directing more research and development resources towards targeted therapies, including immunotherapies. 
 The rapid increase in the amount of molecular information related to cancer, as well as the increasing array of targeted oncology therapeutics, is making it more difficult for physicians to make treatment decisions. Off-label usage of traditional cytotoxic therapies is often driven by physicians struggling to treat a patient’s disease after it fails to respond to initial treatment regimens. Targeted therapies are used off-label by oncologists who have expertise in genomics or access to diagnostic tools that allow them to make informed decisions about off-label use of targeted therapies. 
 In order to maximize the utility of diverse cancer-related molecular information to better guide the use of targeted therapies, we believe a new approach is needed. Specifically, we believe the oncology community needs comprehensive genomic information products that can assess the known and biologically relevant genomic alterations, and distill complex molecular information into a concise and actionable format. 
 Current Challenges of Evaluating Cancer on a Molecular Level 
 Today, physicians are faced with numerous challenges when making decisions on how to best utilize currently available molecular diagnostics for cancer, including: 
  
• | the inherent limitations of certain molecular diagnostic tissue tests that analyze only a single or a limited number of genomic markers from tumor tissue and that only identify a subset of the four classes of genomic alterations found in cancers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in the case of solid tumors, insufficient and/or poor-quality tumor biopsy tissue relative to the amount and quality needed to perform all desired or required tests; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | difficulty integrating existing molecular diagnostic tests into clinical practice, including the decisions about which tests to order and how to effectively match the genomic information provided by tests with current targeted therapies or clinical trials.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Single-Marker or Limited Gene Tissue-based Hotspot Panel Tests Can Be Useful Tools But Often Are Not Designed to Detect Relevant Information
Most currently available molecular diagnostic tests are single-marker or limited gene “hotspot” panel tests that are designed to capture only one or a limited number of the most common, well-known gene alterations. There are four classes of genomic alterations that are clinically relevant to the treatment of cancer: base pair substitutions; copy number alterations; short indels; and gene rearrangements and fusions. Hotspot panel tests generally are only able to identify base pair substitutions and specific gene rearrangements, do not routinely detect copy number alterations, and often lack the sensitivity to identify short indels. In addition, hotspot panel tests are typically incapable of detecting gene fusions, a type of alteration that is a common driver of hematologic malignancies, sarcomas and pediatric cancers, and certain solid tumors. 
 9

The following table summarizes the uses and inherent limitations of the current testing methods utilized in commercially available single-marker and hotspot panel tests for cancer, including the most commonly ordered according to results of a 2008 survey of oncologists and hematologists published in the Journal of Clinical Pathology article, “Molecular testing for somatic cancer mutations: a survey of current and future testing in UK laboratories.” Although oncologists may order these tests to look for one or a limited number of specific gene alterations, we believe the inherent limitations of tests using these methods are understood by pathologists and genomicists who perform the tests and the oncologists who order them. 
 


 
Name | Uses | Limitations 
Polymerase chain reaction, or PCR-based tests, a technology used for amplifying DNA sequences | Enable the detection of short fragment DNA or RNA sequences. | Single-gene tests for specific and limited number of mutations. Only identify known and select base substitutions and short indels, such as BRAF V600E. 
Immunohistochemical, or IHC, stains, a process used to diagnose abnormal cells | Utilize antibody proteins to identify certain antigens that are unique to various types of cancer. | Only identify the expressed presence of a known and select protein or specific protein marker, such as HER2, related to a particular genomic alteration. 
FISH-based DNA probes, a mechanism for detecting DNA sequences through the use of fluorescent technology | Reveal specific genomic abnormalities, including insertion/deletions and rearrangements. | Only detect select gene rearrangements, such as EML4-ALK. Difficult to test for multiple markers. 
Flow Cytometry | Detection of tumor cell DNA aneuploidy, the analysis of tumor cell proliferation and the immunophenotyping of leukemias. | Only looks at a limited number of cells, and does not detect broader range of genomic alterations. 
Cytogenetics | Determination of which chromosomal translocations and fusion genes are present in malignant cells. | Cannot detect other types of genomic abnormalities. 

Limited Tissue Availability and Poor Tissue Quality Restrict Testing Options 
 Many clinical tumor samples are provided from standard biopsies, needle biopsies, or fine needle aspirates that yield very small tissue amounts. Small amounts of tissue samples limit the number of diagnostic tests a physician can order, and ordering one or a limited number of tests that look for one or a limited number of genomic alterations necessarily increases the likelihood that a physician may fail to identify other genomic alterations and, ultimately, therapeutic options. 
 Clinical tumor specimens also often have low tumor purity, meaning that the relevant genomic alterations occur in low frequencies within the sample and are difficult to detect. Moreover, the vast majority of clinical samples are stored as formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded, or FFPE, specimens. FFPE preservation can damage DNA and RNA. Low tumor purity or damage to DNA or RNA may limit the availability of hotspot panel tests to identify certain genomic alterations. 
 A Growing Number of Molecular Diagnostics are Often Difficult to Integrate into Clinical Practice 
 Physicians today face an increasingly difficult decision about which single-marker or hotspot panel tests to order. There are a growing number of tests, each specific to a different cancer type and each having limited ability to detect multiple genomic alterations. Often, in the case of solid tumors, only a small amount of tumor biopsy is available, forcing the physician to order only a subset of desired diagnostic tests, often one test at a time in a serial manner. Furthermore, tests are usually selected based on the traditional treatment paradigm of the cancer’s location in the body or by simple trial and error. Integration of molecular diagnostics into clinical practice is particularly challenging with hematologic cancers where lack of tissue distinctions within the cancers often lead to misdiagnosis, lack of prognostic information and, thus, mistreatment. 
 Running multiple, disjointed tests also poses logistical challenges associated with routing samples to several different laboratories and the high costs associated with conducting multiple tests. Moreover, limited tissue availability may prevent relevant tests from being ordered, tests conducted may miss genomic alterations, and the results may not be delivered soon enough to be used during the typical treatment cycle for a patient. Even if a physician has enough cancer specimen to order a sufficient number of hotspot panel tests and single gene molecular tests to identify relevant genomic alterations, and receives the results of all of these tests in a timely fashion, the physician would commonly receive a series of uncoordinated individual reports from different laboratories that are difficult for non-specialized pathologists or oncologists to interpret and synthesize. Compounding these challenges, especially in the community oncology setting, is how to effectively match the genomic information provided by tests with current targeted therapies 
 10

or clinical trials for a particular patient. As a result of one, or a combination of these current limitations, physicians may fail to identify or to prescribe a potentially appropriate targeted oncology therapy or to direct a patient to a potentially appropriate clinical trial. 
 The Opportunity for a Single, Comprehensive Molecular Information Solution 
 In order to harness the potential of understanding the genomic drivers of a patient’s cancer and new therapies targeted at specific genomic alterations, we believe the oncology community needs a better approach: a single molecular information platform that can assess a solid tumor or hematologic malignancy for the presence of biologically relevant genomic alterations and biomarkers from either a tissue specimen or a liquid biopsy. This solution would also provide assistance to physicians in matching the genomic alterations identified in their patients’ cancers with relevant available therapeutic alternatives and clinical trials. 
 
Our molecular information platform, which includes proprietary technology, methods, and computational algorithms, is the product of years of research and development and significant capital investment. Through this platform we deliver comprehensive genomic profiling to support physicians in the improvement of clinical patient care and to support biopharmaceutical companies in the development of novel cancer therapeutics. The first molecular information products enabled by our platform are FoundationOne, which is optimized for use with solid tumors, FoundationOneHeme, which is optimized for hematologic cancers, including leukemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and sarcomas, and FoundationACT, which is optimized for use with liquid (blood) samples when solid tumor tissue specimens are insufficient. FoundationOne, our initial clinical product launched in June 2012, is a comprehensive genomic profile that identifies the individual molecular alterations present in a patient’s cancer tumor and matches them with relevant targeted therapies and clinical trials. FoundationOneHeme, our second commercially available product, which we developed in collaboration with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, or MSKCC, and launched in December 2013, is a comprehensive genomic profile that identifies the individual molecular alterations present in a patient’s blood-based cancer and matches them with relevant targeted therapies and clinical trials. FoundationACT, our third molecular information product, enables comprehensive genomic profiling from a blood sample when a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained. FoundationACT was launched to ordering physicians in May 2016. 
 In December 2016, we launched our first FDA-approved product, FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, for use as a companion diagnostic to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca™ is being considered. In November 2017, we announced FDA approval for FoundationOne CDx for solid tumors. FoundationOne CDx currently assesses 324 relevant cancer genes for all classes of genomic alterations, and reports TMB and MSI, enabling patient access to FDA-approved targeted therapies and immunotherapies and clinical trials. 
 Our Suite of Molecular Information Products Integrates Complex Insights into Routine Clinical Care 
 We believe our suite of comprehensive genomic profiling products is the only widely available suite of molecular information products that can comprehensively assess cancer tissue simultaneously for the four classes of genomic alterations found in cancer with published validation studies demonstrating sufficient sensitivity and specificity for routine medical practice. Moreover, these products deliver this complex molecular information in a contextualized report that matches detected molecular alterations with potentially relevant treatment options and clinical trials. We perform our clinical tests in our laboratories located in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, each of which is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, and accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP.  Our Cambridge testing location holds individual state licensure as required and issued by New York, Florida, Maryland, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and California, and is therefore permitted to perform testing on specimens originating in all states. Our North Carolina testing location holds individual state licensure as required by New York, Florida, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and California and is therefore permitted to perform testing on specimens originating in all states. We also perform FoundationOne testing for most European countries in our lab in Penzberg, Germany.

Our FDA-approved assays, FoundationOne CDx and FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, are performed in a QSR environment.  Optimization and automation enable workflows to deliver medical reports to ordering physicians typically within two weeks from the time the specimen is received.

A Validated and Highly Precise Process of Testing for Tissue and Liquid Biopsies 
 Our proprietary methods and workflow make our suite of clinical molecular products suitable for clinical use at a commercial scale. Standard biopsies and needle biopsies obtained in a clinical setting often yield very small tissue amounts that have a low concentration of tumor cells and are preserved in a FFPE format. We have developed proprietary techniques for optimizing pre-sequencing sample preparation and have built post-sequencing computational algorithms that enable our products to be sufficiently sensitive to perform comprehensive genomic profiling on routine clinical tumor samples. We have optimized our processes to maximize throughput, efficiency, and quality. 
 FoundationOne has undergone extensive analytic validation that demonstrates test performance using both reference specimens and hundreds of actual FFPE clinical cancer specimens having results derived from prior standard diagnostic tests. We performed validation studies in which FoundationOne testing was conducted on previously characterized cell lines known to contain various base substitutions and cancer specimens known to contain various indels and copy number alterations to evaluate whether FoundationOne was capable of detecting these pre-defined genomic alterations. FoundationOne was found to be highly sensitive in identifying these genomic alterations even where the percentage of cells in test samples containing the alterations (versus normal cells not containing the alterations) was very low. Specifically, FoundationOne was able to detect 99% of base substitutions contained in test samples in which less than 10% of the cells contained the base substitutions, 97% of indels in samples in which 10% to 20% of the cells contained the indels, and 99% of copy number alterations of at least 8-fold in which 30% of the cells contained the alterations. In aggregate, FoundationOne detected greater than 99% of the genomic alterations contained in the samples tested in the validation study. We believe these results demonstrate the importance of our proprietary methods, algorithms, and advanced bioinformatics, and are helping to set the industry standards for validation of comprehensive genomic profiling. The analytic validation results of our studies on FoundationOne were published in Nature Biotechnology in October 2013. 
 12

FoundationOneHeme has also undergone extensive analytic validation for both the DNA and RNA sequencing components of the test. Test performance of the DNA component matched the high accuracy achieved by FoundationOne for all classes of genomic alterations. Test performance of the RNA component demonstrated a sensitivity to detect greater than 99% of known gene fusions at 20% tumor content and 97% of known gene fusions at 10% tumor content. The results of our analytic validation studies on FoundationOneHeme were presented at the 2013 ASH annual meeting and published in March 2016 in the journal, Blood.
 FoundationACT, an assay which enables genomic profiling of ctDNA, has undergone extensive analytic validation demonstrating that the assay exceeds requirements for clinical use. Circulating cell-free DNA is highly fragmented, present at very low concentrations in the blood, and contains only a small fraction of ctDNA. We believe many cancer patients may not shed enough detectable tumor DNA into their bloodstream and may thus test negative using ctDNA assays. Therefore, the isolation and identification of ctDNA is extremely challenging. Assay sensitivity and specificity is directly dependent on cell-free DNA extraction and circulating tumor evaluation, high efficiency sample preparation, and capture efficiency combined with custom low frequency variant calling algorithms. We have optimized FoundationACT for sensitivity and specificity of base substitutions, indels, genomic rearrangements, and copy number amplifications. The workflow for FoundationACT is highly reproducible, achieves the required turnaround time, and is compatible with whole blood, plasma and cell-free DNA inputs. 
 At the 2016 annual meeting of the Advances In Genome Biology and Technology (AGBT), we reported on aspects of our analytic validation study in a presentation entitled, “Assessment of the Relative Clinical Utility of ctDNA and Tissue Biopsies for the Detection of Actionable Genomic Alterations in Routine Clinical Oncology Specimens.” Our analytic validation study demonstrated that FoundationACT results were 100% concordant with FoundationOne and digital droplet PCR results across 87 base substitutions (43 at <5% mutant allele frequency), 3 indels, and 5 genomic alterations. The precision and sensitivity observed with FoundationACT passed target performance specifications. We believe, based on our analysis of the literature, that we have one of the most accurate, highly sensitive and specific, analytically validated assays to measure ctDNA from blood. We have submitted this analytic validation work for publication. 
 To support our commercial efforts for FoundationACT and to give providers confidence in using a liquid biopsy assay when tissue is not available, we launched a large, multi-center study to assess the potential utility of this test across various cancers and stages of the disease as well as to refine indications for use. Enrollment in this trial has completed. We believe this study will provide critical information by comparing the genomic alterations seen in tissue and blood in a given patient which will in turn inform clinical applications of this approach. We expect to publish results from this study. 
 In December 2016, the FDA approved FoundationFocus CDx BRCA for use as a companion diagnostic to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca™ (rucabarib) is being considered. FoundationFocus CDx BRCA is an FDA-approved tissue-based, genomic assay that uniquely detects tumor BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations (may include both germline (inherited) and somatic (acquired)) in ovarian cancer. 
 We closely collaborated with Clovis on a regulatory strategy to develop FoundationFocus CDx BRCA in parallel with the development of Rubraca™ (rucaparib). Tissue samples taken from individuals with ovarian cancer who enrolled in rucaparib clinical trials were analyzed by us utilizing CGP to identify biomarkers associated with a response to therapy. These molecular signatures of response informed the development of FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, which was utilized in Clovis’ pivotal trial, ARIEL2, to identify patients and accelerate recruitment into the study. The companies filed concurrent PMA and new drug application submissions with the FDA in early 2017.
 With this FDA approval, FoundationFocus CDx BRCA is the first validated, tissue-based assay developed from the QSR-compliant version of our CGP assay, providing uniform analysis of all BRCA1/2 coding exons. The PMA submitted to the FDA for review included clinical and analytical studies. The clinical benefit of the FoundationFocus CDx BRCA assay as a companion diagnostic test was demonstrated in a retrospective analysis of efficacy and safety data from two Phase 2 open-label studies (Study 1 and Study 2) that evaluated rucaparib for treatment of patients with advanced ovarian cancer. The analytic validation was designed to demonstrate that the FoundationFocus CDx BRCA laboratory processes are robust, precise, and sensitive, and are not adversely affected by interfering substances or reagent lot changes. Analytical studies were performed to establish performance characteristics including, but not limited to, accuracy, analytic specificity, carryover/cross-contamination, precision, and limit of detection.
 In November 2017, the FDA approved FoundationOne CDx, the first broad CGP assay including multiple companion diagnostics for solid tumors. We presented analytic validation data for FoundationOne CDx at the 2017 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) 18th World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC). Data demonstrated high concordance with multiple companion diagnostics and other single marker assays currently used to match targeted therapies to people with certain types of NSCLC, melanoma, CRC, ovarian cancer, or breast cancer. Results showed that FoundationOne CDx detected alterations in the EGFR, ALK, BRAF, ERBB2, KRAS and BRCA1/2 genes and demonstrated concordance with FDA-approved companion diagnostics currently used to match targeted therapies to patients with certain types of NSCLC, melanoma, colorectal cancer, ovarian cancer or breast cancer. In each of the separate studies, concordance was measured as positive percent agreement (PPA) with other FDA-approved tests.
 We are investing in technologies to allow oncologists and pathologists to collaborate and share treatment and other clinical information, and we continue to develop new and innovative decision support offerings, such as FoundationSmartTrials, to further this 
 13

goal. Over time, we intend to expand our capacity to capture, aggregate, analyze and facilitate the broader exchange of genomic and clinical data across the global oncology community.
 Reports Physicians Can Readily Understand and Use to Guide Patient Care 
 We designed our test reports, in collaboration with leading oncologists, to deliver clinically relevant information in a manner that seamlessly integrates into their practices. We aim to present the results from our tests in a medically relevant and practice-friendly manner that empowers physicians to make informed treatment decisions. During a period of active treatment, patients typically visit their physician every three to four weeks. We report the clinically relevant genomic alterations to a physician for use typically within two weeks from the time the specimen is received. 
 The FoundationOne CDx report contains two sections: the first section lists therapies corresponding to FDA-approved companion diagnostics across five tumor types as well as other advanced immuno-oncology biomarkers including tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI).  The second section, our Professional Services section, summarizes key findings and lists the analyzed cancer’s relevant genomic alterations and matches them to either targeted therapies or open clinical trials for therapies targeting these alterations. The report also identifies noteworthy absences of genomic alterations and indicators of resistance to targeted therapy typically associated with anatomical tumors of the same type. In addition, the report includes summaries of, and references to, supporting data from peer-reviewed publications and clinical trial information. 
 The FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, and FoundationACT reports contain similar information and are presented in a similar easy-to-follow format, but do not have a first page that corresponds to FDA-approved companion diagnostic claims. Information on the report from all tests can also be accessed by ordering physicians through Foundation Medicine’s online portal.

Our Platform for Biopharmaceutical Research and Development 
 We deploy our highly-validated clinical assay platform to analyze tissue samples provided by biopharmaceutical partners from their clinical trials, and we provide our partners access to our FoundationCore knowledgebase to enable novel insights into the 
 16

molecular basis of the cancers they seek to treat. We use our proprietary genomic testing, computational biology, and information technology capabilities to provide our biopharmaceutical partners with comprehensive genomic profiling and information relevant to precision medicine strategies for clinical studies and other drug development activities. Our platform capabilities enable our biopharmaceutical partners to:
  
• | accelerate clinical development timelines and improve the likelihood of patient response by prospectively identifying patients with genomic alterations qualifying them for enrollment in clinical trials of targeted cancer therapeutics;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | realize significant cost-effectiveness and risk-reduction by utilizing a single genomic platform for research, trial enrollment, and development of the companion diagnostics that may be necessary to bring a targeted cancer therapeutic to market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inform future development opportunities for experimental and marketed therapies by retrospectively analyzing clinical trial patients to stratify them as responders or non-responders based on the presence or absence of certain genomic alterations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | create opportunities for drug combination studies or new target discovery by identifying mechanisms of primary and acquired resistance; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inform improvements to clinical trial design by contributing to the understanding of why some clinical studies did not meet their primary endpoints.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We currently have ongoing relationships with more than 30 biopharmaceutical partners, many of which are leaders in developing targeted cancer therapies, and these relationships have expanded over time. Our publicly announced biopharmaceutical customers include Agios, ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Array BioPharma Inc., AstraZeneca, BMS, Clovis, Loxo, Johnson & Johnson, Novartis, Pfizer and Roche, among others.
 Since the onset of our partnership, we have worked with multiple biopharmaceutical partners to report solid tumor sequencing results for hundreds of samples as part of retrospective or prospective clinical trial testing. We expect our biopharmaceutical partner relationships will continue to expand and will provide more opportunities to sell our molecular information products for companion diagnostic development, research and development projects, new target discovery and validation and clinical trials participation. For example, in February 2018, we amended our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement with Roche to include FoundationOne CDx, the first FDA approved broad CGP assay for all solid tumors and with multiple companion diagnostics.
 In addition, we believe our strategic collaboration with Roche represents a significant opportunity to further standardize clinical trial testing across many cancer therapeutics development programs, develop additional companion diagnostic products, and grant access to our molecular information knowledgebase, FoundationCore.
In addition to generating near and long-term revenue, our relationships with key players in the biopharmaceutical industry provide us with important strategic opportunities, including enabling us to identify new genes and biomarkers under investigation that can be incorporated early into our molecular information platform and our products, and more broadly allowing us to actively participate in the development of the newest oncology therapeutics and inform the evolving clinical treatment paradigm. Our partnerships with leading drug development companies that are focused on cancer therapeutics further our connections with the broader oncology community, including thought leaders who are important to the adoption of our commercial products.
 Market Opportunities for Our Fully Integrated Suite of Clinical Molecular Information Services
 We believe our suite of molecular information services will continue to serve as a valuable tool for a greater number of physicians. Aggregating and delivering complex molecular, medical, and scientific information in a single report that can be understood and acted upon has become increasingly important, especially as a majority of our test volume is driven by physicians in community-based practices rather than academic medical centers. Physicians in the community setting often see patients across a wide spectrum of cancer types, which can be particularly challenging as new data emerges specific to each cancer type. In 2013, approximately 30% of our test volume was driven by physicians in community practices, whereas in 2017, approximately 70% of our test orders were received from community-based physicians. Approximately 80% of patients with cancer in the United States today are treated in community practice settings.
 As we deploy our commercialization strategy, we continue to work with our growing network of oncology clinicians to identify the subsets of patients with metastatic cancer for whom FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, and FoundationFocus CDx BRCA are most likely to positively inform treatment decisions. We intend to commercialize FoundationOne CDx in early 2018. We are focused on driving awareness of the potential utility of our tests in all solid tumor types and appropriate hematologic malignancies, including but not necessarily limited to these subsets of patients:

• | patients who may benefit from targeted therapy or immunotherapy in tumor types where comprehensive molecular profiling is specified in practice guidelines, such as NSCLC, CRC, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients who have NSCLC, CRC, melanoma, breast, or ovarian cancers for which there are FDA-approved therapies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients who have predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy like MSI and TMB:
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17

 
• | patients who test negative under traditional single marker or hotspot panel tests for their tumor type;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients from whom a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained or who have insufficient available tissue to perform further tissue-based testing;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients for whom standard treatments have been tried and failed, such as patients whose breast cancer continues to progress despite multiple chemotherapy regimens or patients who have developed resistance to first line tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients with rare or uncommon tumors, such as certain sarcomas or non-colon/small-bowel gastrointestinal tumors, for whom no standard treatment approach exists;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients who have aggressive disease and failed conventional chemotherapy but who maintain adequate functional status, such as some individuals with urothelial cancers or cholangiocarcincoma;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca™ (rucaparib), a therapeutic offered by Clovis, is being considered; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients considering participating in clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 While these groups are not mutually exclusive, we estimate that annually in the United States there are approximately 1.1 million patients who fall into the above patient categories and who would benefit from FoundationOne CDx, FoundationOne, FoundationACT, or FoundationFocus CDx BRCA testing, and another approximately 100,000 patients who would benefit from FoundationOneHeme. These estimates are based upon a combination of feedback from our network of oncology thought leaders, data published by the National Cancer Institute in the Cancer Statistics Review, and focused market research that we commissioned. 
 As the number of available targeted therapies and immunotherapies expands, as professional guidelines are updated to integrate personalized cancer care, and as physicians gain further experience using comprehensive genomic profiling in their routine treatment decisions, we believe that the potential addressable market for comprehensive genomic profiling will expand over the next five years to include most patients who have metastatic disease, not only those patients limited to the categories noted above. We also believe FDA approval of FoundationOne CDx, accompanied by a national coverage policy from CMS, will expand testing to patients who are earlier in the treatment cycle particularly for those patients with NSCLC, CRC, melanoma, breast, and ovarian cancers; those who suffer from a broader set of disease conditions; those patients diagnosed with rare and uncommon cancers regardless of stage who may be eligible for Medicare coverage with clinical evidence development; and, to those patients with other solid tumors as additional FDA-approved companion diagnostics claims are added to the FoundationOne CDx platform over time. We also believe there will be an increasing opportunity with patients for whom tissue is not available and who would benefit from a liquid biopsy assay.
 Although we expect existing and future diagnostic testing providers to also target these patient populations, we believe our tests are currently the only commercially available suite of comprehensive genomic profiles that comprehensively assess cancer tissue simultaneously for four classes of genomic alterations across all cancer-related genes with published validation demonstrating the required sensitivity and specificity required for routine medical practice. In addition, we believe that our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement with Roche provides us with access to global markets and an estimated additional two million patients worldwide.
 Commercialization Strategy
 We continue to create awareness and drive adoption of our comprehensive molecular information platforms through our commercialization strategy to: 
  
• | further build our experienced, fully-integrated, oncology-focused commercial organization in the United States;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expand our footprint globally through our ex-U.S. commercial collaboration with Roche;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | collaborate with oncology thought leaders, leading academic institutions, biopharmaceutical partners and community-based oncology networks/practices on FoundationOne CDx, FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, and FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, clinical cases, clinical research, publications, and product development;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | demonstrate improved clinical outcomes and health economic data to support broad reimbursement from third-party commercial payors and government payors for comprehensive genomic profiling;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | drive broader adoption and increased ordering frequency per physician by offering differentiated programs, ongoing product innovation, and new technology tools and applications, like FoundationSmartTrials, that provide easier access to clinically relevant information;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | support an active medical affairs team to build and support new and ongoing client relationships, focusing on enhancing the actionability of the molecular information generated through our testing platforms;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | publish important medical and scientific data in top-tier peer-reviewed journals and present at major industry conferences in support of demonstrating the actionability and patient care enhancements of the molecular information provided through our testing platforms; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 18

 
• | work with patient advocacy groups, medical societies, and professional guideline organizations to create greater awareness of our products and the importance of incorporating molecular diagnostics into cancer treatment.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Through these efforts, we are creating greater awareness and utilization of the unique capabilities of our suite of molecular information platforms throughout the oncology community—from patients suffering from cancer, to the physicians treating them, to the third-party payors for these treatments, and to biopharmaceutical companies developing new treatments—all with the goal of facilitating better-informed treatment decisions for the greatest number of patients with cancer. We believe that by driving physician and patient demand for our suite of clinical molecular information products and by being part of improving patient outcomes, we will continue to increase utilization of our molecular information platforms and obtain favorable reimbursement decisions by third-party payors.
 Building an Experienced, Oncology-Focused Commercial Organization 
 United States 
 Our commercial organization in the United States works with oncologists and pathologists in hospitals, clinics, and cancer centers in both the community and academic settings. We have built a fully integrated commercial organization including sales, sales management and support, client services, marketing, and reimbursement. 
 Our current sales efforts focus on building relationships with thought leaders at leading academic medical centers and research institutions, pathologists and oncologists in community practice settings, and leading physician networks to demonstrate the clinical usefulness of our molecular information solutions.  Since launching our first comprehensive genomic profile assay in 2012, over 3,000 practices and more than 9,000 health care providers have ordered Foundation Medicine services for their patients.
 As we continue to grow and optimize our commercial organization through streamlined ordering, data collection, and clinical trial enrollment, we are increasing our support of community hospitals and community-based cancer centers that we believe require greater efficiencies and a reliable and collaborative partner for molecular information solutions. Our presence in the community-based cancer centers continues to grow, and this represents an important market segment given that approximately 80% of all cancer patients in the United States are treated in community-based settings.
 In addition, we are continuing our development of important relationships with pathologists so that we can better serve the pathology community by providing value-added molecular information products, technology solutions, and integration services that support a pathologist’s important position as part of the patient management team. These efforts also include the expansion of our virtual tumor board services that bring together the entire clinical care team at both academic partners as well as community-based practices, to support the education and patient management of the most challenging of patient cases.
 Further, we believe that our U.S. Education Collaboration Agreement (as described in detail in our other public filings and below in the section entitled “Our Strategic Collaboration with Roche”) with Genentech, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche, or Genentech, is driving awareness of comprehensive genomic profiling and the most appropriate uses for liquid biopsy platforms, and thereby supplementing the education provided today by our field sales team.
 International 
 Prior to the closing of our strategic collaboration with Roche in April 2015, our international sales strategy had been focused on partnering with leading distributors and building our direct selling efforts. We believe that our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement with Roche accelerates our access to these and other global markets.
 Under the terms of our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement with Roche, Roche has the right to commercialize FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, and, as of February 2018, FoundationOne CDx outside of the United States. Roche has significant experience, expertise, and local market knowledge across many regions around the world, and we believe they are uniquely positioned to understand local market dynamics, payor systems, and regulatory systems. By the end of 2017, Roche had commercially launched our products in close to 30 countries. We expect Roche will launch our products in additional countries in 2018. To support Roche’s launch, and as part of our Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement, we now operate a lab in Penzberg, Germany.
 Collaborating with Thought Leaders to Shape the New Cancer Treatment Paradigm
 We believe physicians look to peers and key thought leaders in the medical community when evaluating a new technology. Oncology thought leaders have historically been early adopters of new technologies because they have greater access to new therapies, clinical trials, and diagnostic tools as compared to many community oncologists. Since our inception, our founders, medical affairs group, senior management, and commercial team have leveraged existing and built new relationships with these early adopters to provide our customers solutions to meet their needs.
 KOLs and leading cancer researchers have embraced our comprehensive molecular information approach, including oncologists at premier cancer institutions such as MSKCC, Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, and the Taussig Cancer Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. In addition to using FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme for clinical cases, these individuals and institutions collaborate 
 19

with us on clinical studies, peer-reviewed publications, virtual tumor boards, and medical and scientific conference presentations. We believe our relationships with KOLs help validate our platform, drive adoption of our clinical products in community oncology settings and international markets, establish our leadership position in the field of molecular information about cancer, and thereby further our ultimate goal — to facilitate better-informed treatment decisions for the greatest number of patients with cancer. 
 We believe that a significant barrier to the achievement of precision medicine in oncology is that patient information is trapped in silos across the healthcare system, and we believe we can help to facilitate cross-organizational sharing of clinico-genomic data in oncology as a means to drive better insights and improved clinical outcomes. For example, we launched PMEC in September 2015. PMEC brings together oncology thought leaders from leading U.S. academic medical centers, hospital systems, and community oncology networks, who share a desire to improve clinical outcomes in oncology treatment through molecular profiling. The consortium intends to improve the practice of precision medicine through a collaborative exchange of molecular information and clinical outcomes data, and through a broader integration of comprehensive genomic profiling in cancer treatment. Additionally, a key focus of PMEC is cancer research focused on genomics within these facilities.
 We believe the creation of PMEC and the associated planned establishment of research opportunities, clinical trials, tracking outcomes, and sharing of clinico-genomic information will help increase utilization of molecular information products, demonstrate our commitment to research and development and educational initiatives, and further strengthen our position as a thought leader in cancer. 
 Our relationships with KOLs in oncology have been instrumental in driving the adoption of FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme. We believe awareness of FoundationOne within the community oncology setting was largely created through our publications and presentations with KOLs and the resulting peer-to-peer interaction they generated. We will continue to nurture these relationships with thought leaders as we drive adoption of FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT and our companion diagnostic assays, and as we develop new, innovative products that enable providers to deliver the best cancer care. 
 Supporting Adoption through Publications and Clinical Trials 
 We believe the successful completion of multiple clinical trials, our publication of scientific and medical results in peer-reviewed journals, and presentations at leading conferences are critical to the broad adoption of products enabled by our proprietary platform. Our publications and presentations to date have helped communicate our capabilities and the clinical results that early adopters of our platform have achieved. We will continue to use these channels in our efforts to drive commercial adoption of our products and obtain favorable reimbursement decisions. In 2017, we, together with our collaborators, published 95 peer-reviewed manuscripts in top medical and scientific journals and presented 141 podium talks and posters at scientific and medical meetings.
 Since the beginning of 2011, we have had: 
  
• | over 290 peer-reviewed articles published or accepted for publication, including by Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Clinical Cancer Research, Cancer Discovery, Cancer Research, Clinical Breast Cancer, Hematology & Oncology, American Journal of Surgical Pathology, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, Blood, and Genome Medicine;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | over 433 poster presentations based on clinical and research data that have been accepted and presented at major scientific conferences on themes that include the identification of multiple novel actionable drug targets, known drug targets in novel tumor types, novel resistance mechanisms to targeted therapies, new insights into models of metastasis, and novel hypotheses on the molecular basis of response or resistance to certain targeted therapies; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | more than 138 speaking presentations at scientific meetings such as ASCO, American Association of Cancer Research, San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, US and Canadian Association of Pathology, or USCAP, Advances in Genome Biology and Technology, and ASH, among others.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have a number of clinical trials sponsored by us and clinical trials sponsored by individual physicians, or investigator-initiated clinical trials, underway or completed, such as: 
  
• | Circulating Tumor DNA clinical study. This multicenter study is a clinical utility study designed to identify the clinical settings for which FoundationACT may be indicated and to compare the genomic alterations between primary/metastatic surgical resections/biopsies and ctDNA across multiple solid tumor types. This study completed enrollment in 2017.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | BeatAML Master Trial. This is a trial being led by The Leukemia & Lymphoma Society. The goal of the study is to test a number of drugs or drug combinations in development to speed approval and increase effectiveness of treatments for certain patients diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. This will be accomplished by performing CGP with FoundationOneHeme for each patient before treatment and assigning a specific drug when a match is available to that untreated patient based on the results of the screening.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sarah Cannon Collaboration. This is a collaboration between FMI and Sarah Cannon Research Institute (SCRI) focused on advancing personalized medicine utilizing molecular information for patients across SCRI cancer programs in the United States. Together with SCRI, we are gathering results across several of our CGP assays to personalize
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 20

 
treatment options for patients in an effort to support improved outcomes. Researchers can use our CGP assays to identify eligible patients for participation in select SCRI clinical studies.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Lung Cancer Master Protocol. Lung-MAP is a multi-drug, multi-arm, biomarker-driven clinical trial for patients with advanced squamous cell lung cancer. The trial utilizes our CGP platform to match patients to one of several different investigational treatment arms that are designed to target the genomic alterations found to be driving the growth of their cancer. In 2017, our participation in the Lung-MAP clinical trial was expanded to include TMB reporting with FoundationOne results, as well as testing with our FoundationACT liquid biopsy assay. This ongoing innovative approach to clinical testing should both improve access to promising targeted therapies and immunotherapy drugs for patients who have tissue and/or liquid biopsies performed and facilitate recruitment in this important clinical trial.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | NCI-MATCH (Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice). This study is a collaboration with the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN). NCI-MATCH is designed to evaluate the benefit of genomically-guided treatments targeting specific alterations within a person's tumor, regardless of cancer type. FoundationOne or FoundationOneHeme are being used by physicians at the approximately 1,100 clinical sites participating in NCI-MATCH to reveal genomic findings that may make a patient eligible for one of several NCI-MATCH treatment arms.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | i-PREDICT (Investigation of Profile-Related Evidence Determining Individualized Cancer Therapy). This trial is being conducted at the University of San Diego and Avera Cancer Institute. Foundation Medicine is the sole provider of CGP and IHC testing to inform patient eligibility for trial participation.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Beating Lung Cancer in Ohio. This study, led by Ohio State University in collaboration with the Addario Lung Cancer Medical Institute (ALCMI), integrates FoundationOne and FoundationACT assays to help guide patients to therapy based on the genomics of a patient’s tumor from a tissue or liquid biopsy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Additionally, our molecular information services are increasingly being integrated into investigator initiated trials (IITs) in countries outside of the United States to support our collaboration with Roche. Our CGP products have also been integrated into a number of ongoing investigator sponsored pediatric cancer studies investigating a range of outcomes including the percentage of pediatric cancer patients for whom NGS profiling changes therapy prescribed by physician, phase 1 dosing studies, and the exploration of clonal heterogeneity, among others.
 Engaging With Patient Advocacy Groups and Other Important Stakeholders to Drive Awareness 
 We have established relationships with many patient advocacy groups to drive awareness of our products and to educate the advocacy community and other key stakeholders, including major medical societies and networks, about the shifting oncology paradigm towards precision medicine. 
 Patient advocates are important stakeholders in the cancer community because they have influence within the patient community and with health care providers, KOLs, and policy makers. We established our advocacy relations program with the following goals: 
  
• | develop awareness around genomic testing;
--+------------------------------------------


• | position us as a patient-centered company within the patient community by creating goodwill and becoming a trustworthy corporate partner;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | effectively shape the dialogue around cancer genomics with key constituents; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | work with advocates to help increase genomics conversation and drive the use of molecular information testing.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We have successfully established key relationships to help educate advocates about us and our capabilities in oncology. Some of the organizations we engage with include Friends of Cancer Research, Patient Advocate Foundation, Clearity Foundation, American Cancer Society Cancer Action Network, Lung Cancer Foundation of America, Bonnie J. Addario Lung Cancer Foundation, Lungevity Foundation, FightCRC, and many others. We continue to engage representatives from several patient advocacy organizations, establishing our commitment to understanding patients’ needs and positioning us as a neutral facilitator of oncology stakeholders, with important insights and relationships across industry, advocacy, and regulatory bodies. Through these activities, we have developed the basis for a meaningful advocacy relations program, with opportunities to more strategically engage advocates moving forward. 
 Our relationships with other influential organizations that shape the delivery of care are also critical as we work to develop and educate the market. We currently work with and aim to work with many organizations, including the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, ASCO, USCAP, and others regarding the role of NGS and broader molecular profiling in the evaluation of patients and their tumors. We are working with these organizations both on potential educational initiatives as well as the evolution of guidelines, which today are very much tumor-type specific, to recognize the growing importance of the molecular characterization of the collection of diseases known as cancer. 
 21

Driving Adoption by Enabling Broader Access to Care 
 Adoption of comprehensive genomic profiling by academic and community-based oncologists supports the clinical utility required to improve health outcomes and quality of life for select groups of patients that can benefit from targeted therapy treatment. However, it can sometimes be difficult for patients and their physicians to gain access to these potentially life-saving treatments. We provide patient-centric support services that we call FoundationACCESS to help break down barriers to greater utilization of comprehensive genomic profiling and clinical trial access. Examples of these services include our Financial Assistance program, our Smart-Trials Precision Enrollment program, and our on-call Medical Affairs service.
Payment and Reimbursement for Our Molecular Information Products 
 The principal groups that currently pay us, or that we expect to pay us in the future, for our molecular information and pharma research and development services include: 

• | our biopharmaceutical customers, with whom we have individual agreements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | commercial third-party payors;
--+-------------------------------


• | government payors, including Medicare and state Medicaid plans, to whom we have been submitting claims;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | certain hospitals, cancer centers, and other institutions that pay us directly at negotiated rates for tests ordered by their physicians; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | patients who make self-payments, or co-payment, co-insurance or deductible payments and other amounts that we have been unable to collect from their third-party payors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that our services present unique solutions for commercial third-party payors and government payors who are faced with an increasingly complex and dynamic cancer diagnostic and treatment environment. These complexities include a growing number of single-marker and hotspot panel tests, the increasing number and cost burden of targeted oncology therapies, and an underlying shift in physicians’ treatment of cancer that is based on molecular pathways rather than tumor location. In addition, this shifting treatment paradigm comes at a time when commercial third-party payors and government payors are increasingly making significant efforts to contain healthcare costs. We believe the use of our services aligns with payors’ goals to improve the safety, efficacy, and efficiency of cancer diagnosis and treatment. 
 The current list price for our FoundationOne and FoundationACT tests is $5,800, the current list price for the FoundationOneHeme test is $7,200, and the current list price for our FoundationFocus CDx BRCA is $2,900. The actual payment received for each of the tests is not certain, may come from various sources, and is typically less than the list price.
 Adequate reimbursement is an important factor in achieving broad clinical adoption of our molecular information services. At the same time, we believe broad clinical adoption will help drive favorable reimbursement decisions. To achieve adequate reimbursement and broad coverage with commercial third-party payors and government payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, we are focused on demonstrating the economic and clinical value of our services to payors by: 
  
• | Setting a High Bar for Validation and Performance. Our tests provide clinically relevant results that are highly reproducible and sensitive, and we believe that many of our relevant findings would not be detected by many other commercial tests on the market today. Patients may benefit from our detection of otherwise unknown genomic alterations that can lead to their physicians choosing alternate therapies. We have presented data on the reproducibility, sensitivity, specificity, and comprehensive scope of our services at numerous conferences and in peer-reviewed journals. In October 2013, the analytic validation results of our studies on FoundationOne were published in Nature Biotechnology. In 2014, we received approval from the New York State Department of Health for FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme, which represents a high standard for quality in large-scale, multi-gene sequencing-based testing in cancer. In 2016, Palmetto published validation guidelines for liquid biopsy tests and we believe FoundationACT meets these validation criteria. Also in 2016, we obtained FDA approval for FoundationFocus CDx BRCA for use as a companion diagnostic to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca™ (rucaparib) is being considered. In 2017, the FDA-approved FoundationOne CDx as a comprehensive companion diagnostic to identify patients who may benefit from treatment with specific FDA-approved targeted therapies, and as a comprehensive genomic profiling, or CGP, test that includes genomic biomarkers to help inform the use of other targeted oncology therapies, including immunotherapies. Concurrent with FDA approval, CMS issued a preliminary NCD that proposes nationwide Medicare coverage for FoundationOne CDx and certain other NGS tests for eligible Medicare beneficiaries with advanced cancer (i.e., recurrent, metastatic, or advanced stage IV cancer), who have not been previously tested using the same NGS technology and continue to seek further cancer therapy. Specifically, the preliminary NCD proposes coverage for FoundationOne CDx for its FDA-approved companion diagnostic claims and provides a pathway for additional coverage with evidence development, or CED, in other solid tumor types.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increasing Utilization by Driving Repeat Physician Demand. Thousands of physicians from large academic centers and community-based practices have ordered FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, and FoundationFocus CDx BRCA since their respective formal commercial launches. The expansion of our commercial 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 22

 
organization is driving volume growth by strengthening customer relationships with academic and community-based oncologists. We believe that this adoption, including repeat usage, demonstrates growing physician demand for a comprehensive solution to help in the treatment of their patients. In addition, we believe that increasing adoption and consistent utilization of our services and their impact on improving outcomes for patients with cancer will help lead to favorable coverage and reimbursement decisions.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Engaging Key Members of the Oncology Community. We continue to work with oncology thought leaders, professional societies, patient advocacy groups, and cancer networks. We believe these relationships help validate our platform, drive adoption of our services in the broad community oncology setting, and establish our leadership position in the field of molecular information about cancer. In addition, we believe adoption of our services by key members of the oncology community will help to influence the inclusion of FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, and FoundationOne CDx in practice guidelines as well as coverage decisions by commercial third-party payors and government payors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Publishing in Peer-Reviewed Publications. We seek to publish in scientific and medical journals such as Nature Medicine, Nature Biotechnology, Journal of Thoracic Oncology, Cancer Discovery, Clinical Cancer Research, Blood, Hematology & Oncology, and others. Our publications have covered novel scientific findings, clinical utility of test results, individual patient outcomes, and common traits of genomic alterations in primary and metastatic tumors, among many others. We believe that our approach, which we have designed to be rigorous and data-driven, is important in establishing requisite evidence of the clinical and analytical validity and clinical utility of our services with payors.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Demonstrating Clinical Utility. To demonstrate the impact of our services on physician treatment decisions and patient outcomes, we have conducted and will continue to conduct a number of clinical studies with organizations such as US Oncology, MD Anderson Cancer Center, MSKCC, and other leading academic and community-based medical centers.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optimizing Health Economics. We have built economic models to measure the financial dynamics of using our services in guiding patient treatment by selecting targeted and immunotherapy drugs for patients, and for minimizing the use of drugs that will not likely have a positive impact. We launched several health economics studies in late 2015 and presented posters on our findings at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Annual Meeting in June 2017. We are also pursuing multiple publications in 2018. We plan to use the data we gather through the use of these models and studies in our discussions with commercial third-party payors and government payors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Coverage Determinations
 We are focused on obtaining adequate reimbursement and coverage for our molecular information services from commercial third-party payors and government payors. The reimbursement environment is evolving as regulators and payors try to establish new rules and frameworks for the reimbursement of molecular diagnostic tests. Our continued ability to participate in the development and implementation of those rules and frameworks is important in order to differentiate between our services and other third-party tests in the marketplace.
 With respect to commercial third-party payors, we continue to work with national and regional payors to obtain coverage. Representative of coverage decisions received from commercial third-party payors, in October 2014, we announced a formal agreement with Priority Health, a regional commercial third-party payor in Michigan, for broad coverage of FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme, and in 2016, FoundationACT was added to coverage. In December 2015, we announced an agreement with UnitedHealthcare, one of the largest national insurers in the United States. The agreement covers FoundationOne for patients with initially diagnosed metastatic stage IV NSCLC. We have also entered into formal agreements with Blue Cross Blue Shield of Illinois, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts, Harvard Pilgrim, and HealthPartners.  
 Several large, self-insured organizations have also enacted coverage for some of our molecular information services as part of broad, best-in-class employee benefits packages. We also have direct agreements in place with various healthcare providers pursuant to which we process specimens using our molecular information services, and the providers pay us for the test results based on negotiated rates. We may also negotiate rates with individual patients if the patient is responsible for payment.
 We believe we are also making important progress with government payors. In May 2015, Palmetto published a final LCD, which includes reimbursement for comprehensive genomic profiles for highly validated testing in an initial subset of patients diagnosed with NSCLC. The Palmetto website listed FoundationOne as a covered test under this LCD effective October 1, 2015.  In September 2016, Palmetto expanded this LCD to include NSCLC patients regardless of smoking history and included requirements for the collection of data in a registry. In September 2016 we began submitting claims to Palmetto for FoundationOne cases performed at our North Carolina facility that met the Palmetto LCD criteria. In December 2016, Palmetto further revised the final LCD to remove the registry requirements from the LCD, and to require instead an annual review of publications and/or presentations of clinical utility data demonstrating that comprehensive genomic profiling for NSCLC improves patient outcomes and/or directs or changes selection of therapies to improve patient outcomes. Also in December 2016, Palmetto issued three draft LCDs for coverage and payment of CGP for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic melanoma, and advanced primary peritoneal, fallopian tube and ovarian cancer, respectively.
 23

 Concurrent with FDA approval of FoundationOne CDx in November 2017, CMS issued a preliminary NCD that proposes nationwide Medicare coverage for FoundationOne CDx for eligible Medicare beneficiaries with advanced cancer (i.e., recurrent, metastatic, or advanced stage IV cancer), who have not been previously tested using the same NGS technology and continue to seek further cancer therapy. Specifically, the preliminary NCD proposes coverage for FoundationOne CDx for indications in which there are FDA-approved companion diagnostic claims. The preliminary NCD also proposes a pathway for additional coverage under CED in other solid tumor types. If the preliminary NCD is finalized in its current form, the terms of the final NCD would apply and the terms of any final or draft LCDs would not apply, including the Palmetto LCD for NSCLC, and FoundationOne will be considered non-covered by Medicare once the NCD is implemented.
 As of December 31, 2017, we were not a participating provider in any state Medicaid program, and, therefore, did not have coverage decisions under which our tests were covered by these Medicaid programs.
 Coding
 We submit claims for our services to third-party payors using CPT codes for molecular testing services. We receive payments on some, but not all, of our claims submitted. In 2014, new CPT codes were approved by the American Medical Association, or AMA, that are intended to classify with greater specificity those molecular tests that rely on NGS and evaluate multiple genes at once. These new CPT Codes became effective on January 1, 2015. We do not believe that these CPT codes describe our tests since they do not appropriately differentiate our comprehensive genomic profiles from hotspot panel tests. Therefore, unless payors specifically request use of these CPT codes, we intend to continue submitting claims for our tests utilizing coding that we believe more accurately describes our tests, including stacked CPT codes, McKesson Z-Codes (as described below), and other potential accepted coding policies. When submitting claims for molecular services or procedures that do not have specific CPT codes, providers may submit those claims using a CPT code, referred to as the miscellaneous molecular CPT code, to provide the means of reporting and tracking services and procedures until a more specific CPT code is established. The use of a miscellaneous molecular CPT code for claims submitted to CMS may decrease the likelihood of reimbursement given that a miscellaneous CPT code is a single CPT code that does not represent a specific identified service or procedure.
 To assist payors in making reimbursement and coverage decisions, the McKesson Diagnostics Exchange™, or McKesson DEX, was created. Tests that are registered with McKesson DEX are assigned, based on the uniqueness of each test, a five-digit alphanumeric McKesson Z-Code™ identifier, or Z-Code. These identifiers are intended to enable the consistent identification of tests across systems by laboratories, providers, and payors, and are reported separate from established CPT or other Healthcare Common Procedure Code System (HCPCS) codes. We believe the current CPT codes associated with NGS testing do not adequately address the comprehensive and precise characteristics of our tests, and therefore we have established unique Z-Codes for FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, and FoundationFocus CDx BRCA. 
 Palmetto, which currently plays a leading role in many states regarding Medicare coverage determinations for complex molecular tests, has established the Molecular Diagnostic Services program, or MolDX, which is currently used to help determine coverage and payment for Medicare in more than 26 states. Z-Codes have been adopted by Palmetto as part of MolDX and by several commercial third-party payors.
 We have received a Proprietary Laboratory Analysis, or PLA, code from the AMA for our FoundationOne CDx test. PLA codes are alphanumeric CPT codes with corresponding descriptors for labs or manufacturers that want to more specifically identify their test. Our PLA code was published in February 2018, and will become effective on April 1, 2018.
 Billing Commercial Third-Party Payors
 Currently, the significant majority of commercial third-party payors reimburse our claims based upon stacked CPT codes, the predominant methodology, or based on other methods such as percentages of charges or other formulas that are not made known to us. In addition, a small but growing portion of payors outsource our claims to preferred provider organizations or third-party administrators, who process our claims and pay us directly at negotiated rates. Coverage and payment is determined by the third-party payor on a case-by-case basis. Since we are not currently contracted with many commercial third-party payors, coverage and payment for our testing remains largely uncertain. We request that physicians discuss with their patients the potential responsibility of the patient for the cost of our services should the patient’s insurance policy not cover those costs. We undertake the primary responsibility for obtaining third-party coverage on behalf of patients, including appeals for any initial denials, prior to billing a patient. With this practice established, we believe that most patients receiving our tests know that they may be responsible for some portion of the cost of the test should their third-party payor deny or limit coverage. We also offer a comprehensive patient assistance program, FoundationAccess.
Billing Government Payors
 Although we are in the process of seeking a final NCD for FoundationOne CDx , there are currently no NCDs that establish whether and how our tests are covered and paid by Medicare. In the absence of NCDs, local MACs that administer the Medicare program in various regions have some discretion in determining coverage, the reimbursement rate, and payment for tests. The local MAC for our Cambridge laboratory, National Government Services, issued a final LCD effective April 1, 2016, to provide 
 24

coverage for hotspot tests of 5 to 50 genes for patients with metastatic NSCLC. We do not believe this LCD reflects coverage for our validated comprehensive genomic profiling services, which include comprehensive analysis of greater than 50 genes and all classes of alterations. As of December 31, 2017, National Government Services has either denied the FoundationOne or FoundationOneHeme claims that we have submitted using stacked CPT codes, or not processed and reimbursed us for the claims in a manner that we believe is consistent with applicable processing guidelines. In August 2016, we began submitting claims for FoundationACT tests associated with our Cambridge, Massachusetts laboratory to NGS using stacked CPT codes, and as of December 31, 2017, we have recognized revenue from some of those claims. The local MAC for our Research Triangle Park laboratory, Palmetto GBA, issued a final LCD, the Palmetto LCD, to cover well-validated comprehensive genomic profiles for initially diagnosed Stage IIIB and Stage IV NSCLC patients who meet the eligibility criteria. In January 2017, we began submitting claims to Palmetto for FoundationOne test requisitions where components of our testing services were performed in our North Carolina facility. In March 2017, we began receiving payment for eligible NSCLC claims submitted under the Palmetto LCD based upon the allowable rate of $3,416 per test. In addition, on December 22, 2016, Palmetto issued three draft LCDs for the use of comprehensive genomic profiling to guide treatment in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer; with metastatic melanoma; and with advanced primary peritoneal, fallopian tube, and ovarian cancer. These draft LCDs are awaiting finalization. 
 If the preliminary NCD for FoundationOne CDx is finalized in its current form, the terms of the final NCD would apply the terms of any final or draft LCDs would not apply, including the Palmetto LCD for NSCLC, and FoundationOne will likely be considered non-covered by Medicare once the NCD is implemented.
 We believe FoundationOne CDx will meet the criteria of a New Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Test, or New ADLT, which was created under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA. We are awaiting guidance from CMS on the mechanism to achieve formal designation of FoundationOne CDx as a new ADLT.
 There is a subset of Medicare patients that fall under the Medicare 14-Day Rule, requiring us to bill the ordering institution directly instead of billing Medicare. We have recognized some revenue for these patients upon receipt of payment from the institution. 
 Investing in Ongoing and New Product Innovation
 We were founded as a scientifically and medically driven company and are dedicated to ongoing innovation in our molecular information services and precision oncology product pipeline. We have invested, and will continue to invest, significant time and resources into the improvement of our platform and the development and introduction of new molecular information products and services that will increase the actionability, connectivity, and utilization of our clinical products and enable more efficient drug development by our biopharmaceutical partners. 
 We believe we have a first mover advantage in offering comprehensive genomic profiling products that interrogate with precision the genes known to be altered in human cancer. Since our formal commercial launch of FoundationOne in June 2012, we have continued to invest in its improvement, including periodic updates to increase the number of relevant cancer-related genes, decrease tissue size requirements, increase sensitivity, and improve turnaround time. We have incorporated RNA-based sequencing technology into FoundationOneHeme to identify additional gene fusions commonly found in hematologic malignancies and sarcomas. We have also innovated and launched three additional assays, FoundationACT, which enables highly accurate molecular profiling from a blood sample when a tissue biopsy is not available or accessible, FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, an FDA-approved companion diagnostic to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca™ (rucaparib) is being considered, and FoundationOne CDx, the first FDA-approved broad CGP assay for solid tumors incorporating multiple companion diagnostics.
 We endeavor to stay at the cutting edge of molecular information and genomic testing and to maintain our competitive advantages by continuously exploring and developing new clinically relevant approaches to improving cancer care. Our ongoing research and technology development efforts to advance our product pipeline and expand the impact of molecular information for improving cancer care include: 
  
• | building on our recent FDA success with a regulated products strategy;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | broadening our understanding of biomarkers of response to targeted therapies and immunotherapies, and researching immuno-diagnostic assays;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing new products to evaluate and monitor cancer progression over time;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | creating and enhancing decision support applications such as FoundationSmartTrials and FoundationInsights;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | advancing data-driven insights into new therapeutic modalities that enable drug discovery and development; and,
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enhancing clinical trial design.
--+---------------------------------

Operations 
 We currently perform all of the services for FoundationACT, FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, and FoundationOne CDx in our clinical laboratories located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. We perform some of the services for FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme in our North Carolina laboratory and some of the services in our Cambridge laboratory through referral. Since October 2017, we perform services for FoundationOne for most European countries in our laboratory in Penzberg, Germany. When a 
 25

physician orders our products, he or she does not need to alter the standard surgical technique or tissue handling processes. The physician’s staff typically completes an order form (by hand, electronically, or via electronic medical records technology), packages the specimen in a kit we provide, and then ships the kit via overnight carrier to one of our labs. Once we receive the specimen at one of our laboratories and enter all pertinent information about the specimen into our clinical laboratory information management system, we prepare the specimen for testing. The analysis for all of our assays consists of three parts: specimen preparation, sequencing, and data analysis and reporting. 
  Specimen Preparation 
 For FoundationOne, where samples are submitted as FFPE blocks or slides, our first step is pathology review, in which we assess the quality of the tissue sample to determine if it is suitable for testing using FoundationOne. We are able to process samples for testing using a very small amount of DNA. In general, the sample must be at least 40 microns in thickness and consist of at least 20% tumor cells. Almost all samples meeting our tissue requirements will allow for extraction of enough high-quality DNA (>50 nanograms; optimal 200 nanograms) for FoundationOne for solid tumor analysis. 
 For FoundationOneHeme samples submitted as FFPE blocks or slides, the process is exactly as outlined for FoundationOne above except that we extract both DNA and RNA from these specimens, 50 nanograms and 300 nanograms, respectively, and the requisite tissue thickness is 80 microns. For FoundationOneHeme samples that are received as fresh peripheral blood or bone marrow aspirate, we prepare a smear and perform a morphologic review in order to confirm adequate cellularity and tumor/lesional tissue content (e.g., 20%) before the specimen is sequenced.
 For FoundationACT, blood samples are submitted in blood collection tubes containing a preservative that helps stabilize nucleated cells to minimize cell lysis during normal shipping conditions.
 We extract the DNA from the plasma component of the blood sample, and in order to be acceptable to proceed through testing, the amount of DNA extracted must be 20 nanograms or more.
 Following FoundationOne test ordering, pathology review, and DNA extraction, the extracted DNA is broken down into small fragments which we then manipulate using standard and molecular biology techniques, some of which represent our trade secrets and know-how, to create a complex mixture of DNA molecules. We then separate additional DNA fragments from the DNA representing the relevant cancer genes through our proprietary hybrid capture process. After hybrid capture, we are ready to interrogate the DNA content to determine where the critical genomic alterations exist. 
 The DNA component of the FoundationOneHeme test is similar to the FoundationOne process described above, but the RNA component has an additional step where the RNA must first be converted into cDNA. Once in this state, the RNA component of the FoundationOneHeme test progresses side-by-side with the DNA component. 
 The DNA component of the FoundationACT test is similar to the FoundationOne process described above once the extraction step is complete, the DNA has been quantified, and the specimen is determined to be adequate.
 Post-DNA extraction laboratory processes for FoundationFocus CDx BRCA and FoundationOneCDx are identical to that of FoundationOne, however, these assays have slightly different DNA input requirements.  FoundationFocus CDx BRCA requires 200 nanograms of DNA while FoundationOneCDx only requires 55 nanograms.
 Sequencing 
 The content of each DNA or cDNA molecule is determined using a process called sequencing in which sequences of DNA molecules, or nucleotides, are identified in every position of every molecule. NGS involves the massively parallel sequencing of DNA or RNA isolated from human cells that, in the context of cancer, can be applied to genes throughout the entire cancer genome. Our products are able to detect genomic alterations that may be present in as low as 1% of all cells being tested. We have made substantial modifications to our process in order to maximize throughput, efficiency, and quality based upon the NGS technology supplied by Illumina, Inc., or Illumina, that we currently use. 
Data Analysis and Reporting
 At the end of the sequencing process, we have identified the entire coding regions of the relevant genes, and that data is entered into a sophisticated series of our proprietary computational algorithms designed to detect and identify all genomic alterations present in the cancer sample. 
 Sequence analysis involves a careful alignment of every DNA sequence with a known reference sequence. We have validated our algorithms that perform this alignment by running tens of thousands of samples through the process. Once all DNA sequences are aligned against the reference and quality filters have been applied, specific algorithms search for differences between the sequenced DNA and the reference. These differences represent potential genomic alterations. 
 Not all of the genomic alterations that are detected are responsible for driving the cancer; therefore, we further distill the alterations to a point where we have a list of only those alterations that are cancer drivers and where there is a therapy, FDA-approved 
 26

drug, or available clinical trial for which the patient is eligible based on the genomic characteristics of the patient’s sample. A qualified computational biologist further scrutinizes identified alterations to ensure accuracy. 
 The last part of our process involves synthesizing the data into clinically relevant information. This is a multi-faceted procedure performed by a team of trained scientists that culminates in the production and review of an integrated report, which contains information about the alterations detected and what therapeutic options may be available based on the genomic findings in a given patient’s sample. This report is reviewed and signed by our medical staff and is returned to the ordering physician who can use the data in conjunction with a clinical assessment to inform his or her treatment decisions. 
 A report is typically delivered to the physician within two weeks from the time the specimen is received.  
 Quality Assurance 
 We are committed to providing reliable and accurate molecular information to our customers. Accurate specimen identification, timely communication of results, and prompt correction of errors is critical. We monitor our quality through a variety of methods, including performance improvement indicators, proficiency testing, internal and external audits, and satisfaction surveys. Any quality concerns and incidents are subject to risk assessment, root cause analysis, and a corrective action plan that is reviewed monthly with department management to ensure that we are providing the best products possible to our customers. Protection of patient results from misuse and improper access is important and thus patient confidential information is only accessible by necessary personnel. 
 We have established a comprehensive quality assurance program for our laboratories designed to produce accurate and timely test results and to ensure the consistent high quality of our tests. Our quality assurance program includes policies and procedures covering personnel qualifications and training requirements, process and test validation, quality control of reagents and test processes, proficiency testing, routine monitoring, and internal audits. Quality control metrics are assessed at various points in the testing process and final disposition of patient results requires adherence to quality control metrics that meet and exceed recommendations by professional organizations and regulatory authorities. Additionally, the long-term trends in quality control metrics are reviewed monthly by management. Our quarterly internal quality assurance audits cover pre-analytic, analytic and post-analytic functions, assess improvement indicators, and set new metrics for the following quarter. We also have an extensive, internally administered program of specimen proficiency testing to ensure that test performance is reproducible and functioning optimally. 
 Policies and procedures have been developed to satisfy all applicable requirements necessary for federal and state licensures and accreditation for clinical diagnostic laboratories. We follow the policies and procedures for patient and employee safety, hazardous waste disposal, and fire codes stated in the general laboratory procedure manuals. We believe that all pertinent regulations of CLIA, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Environmental Protection Agency, and FDA are satisfied by following the established guidelines and procedures of our quality assurance program. 
 Reproducibility 
 Our ability to reproduce high quality results is critical to ensuring that we deliver better-informed treatment options to the greatest number of patients with cancer. For example, we have worked to ensure the results of FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme are commensurate by conducting an extensive analytical validation that robustly demonstrates test performance using both reference specimens and hundreds of routine FFPE clinical cancer specimens with results derived from prior standard diagnostic tests. For example, in validation studies on actual clinical cancer specimens, including samples where as few as 20% of the nuclei in the specimen were derived from tumor cells, high accuracy for FoundationOne was observed across all classes of genomic alterations, including sensitivity greater than 99% for detection of base substitutions, greater than 98% for detection of indels, and greater than 95% for detection of copy number alterations. Our specificity was greater than 99% across all classes of alterations. 
Instrumentation and Reagent Supply Agreement 
 In July 2013, we entered into a five-year supply, service and support agreement with Illumina, or the Supply Agreement, which was most recently amended in April 2017, for Illumina to provide products and services that support and can be used for the gene sequencing component of our molecular testing activities. During the term of the Supply Agreement, Illumina will supply us and our German subsidiary with sequencers, reagents and other consumables for use with the Illumina sequencers, and service contracts for the maintenance and repair of the sequencers. 
 During the term of the Supply Agreement, we are required to make a rolling forecast of our expected needs for reagents and other consumables, and we may place purchase orders for reagents and other consumables that conform to such forecast. Illumina may not unreasonably reject conforming purchase orders and will, in its reasonable discretion, accept additional purchase orders for quantities of reagents and other consumables beyond our forecast requirements. During each six-month period we have a binding obligation to purchase an amount of reagents and other consumables equal to the greater of a percentage of our six-month forecast and a fixed minimum amount. Subject to discounts that vary depending on the volume of hardware and reagents and other consumables ordered, the price for sequencers and for service contracts is based on Illumina list prices, and the price for reagents and other consumables is based on contract prices that are fixed for a set period of time and may increase thereafter, subject to limitations. The 
 27

Supply Agreement does not require us to order minimum amounts of hardware, or to use exclusively the Illumina platform for conducting our sequencing.
  We may use equipment, reagents and other materials supplied by third parties in the operation of our business. The Supply Agreement contains customary use restrictions, representations and warranties, indemnification obligations, limitations of liability, and other provisions.
 Intellectual Property 
 Our business relies upon proprietary technologies, methods and processes, product designs and branding that we have invented, developed, or licensed. Our policy is to seek patent protection and trademark registration for commercially valuable assets we develop, as appropriate, and maintain as trade secrets other aspects of our proprietary platform, processes, and know-how. 
Patents 
 Our patent portfolio includes multiple issued patents in the United States and various foreign countries, pending U.S. provisional and utility applications, and strategically focused corresponding international applications filed via the Patent Cooperation Treaty and foreign national and regional counterpart applications. We believe our portfolio of patents and patent applications serve to protect our business in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions in which we elect to pursue and are successful in obtaining patent rights. The patents and patent applications in our patent portfolio fall into three broad categories relating to: 

• | genomic analysis methodologies, modalities, and procedures, including claims directed to process innovations and advances in solution hybridization, bait selection and capture, variant calling, and novel advanced analytics;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | genomically-driven innovations, including novel methods of treatment elucidated by analysis of genomic alterations harbored by tumors of a given cancer type; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | genomic information and correlated treatment and outcome information management, matching, and delivery, including claims directed to web-mediated systems for capturing, managing, tracking and reporting genomic information and associated clinical outcome data, as well as other applications relating to annotation and curation of genomic results for medical reporting.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our patent portfolio provides us with potential royalty-bearing licensing opportunities. These opportunities arise primarily with companies developing or selling therapeutic products for cancer treatment or cancer diagnostic tests. It may be determined that the products or tests they are developing or selling require a license to the methods claimed in our patents and patent applications. 
 Trade Secrets and Trademarks 
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. For example, significant elements of our products, including aspects of sample preparation, computational-biological algorithms, and related processes and software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how that are not publicly disclosed. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, and commercial partners. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entity’s relationship with us must be kept confidential during and after the relationship and that all inventions or developments resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties. We have also adopted policies and conduct training for our employees and consultants that provides guidance on our expectations, and our advice for best practices, in protecting our trade secrets. 
 We also seek trademark protection in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions where available and when appropriate. Foundation Medicine®, FoundationOne®, FoundationACT®, FoundationICE®, Interactive Cancer Explorer®, Once. And for All®, and The Molecular Information Company® are all registered trademarks of Foundation in the United States, and several of these marks are at various stages of the registration process in other countries. FoundationOne CDx™, FoundationCORE™, FoundationFocus™, FoundationInsights™, PatientMatch™, Precision Medicine Exchange Consortium™, and FoundationSmartTrials™ are also trademarks of Foundation Medicine. Other trademarks or service marks that may appear in this Annual Report are the property of their respective holders. For convenience, we do not use the ® and ™ symbols in each instance in which one of our trademarks appears throughout this Annual Report, but this should not be construed as any indication that we will not assert, to the fullest extent under applicable law, our rights thereto.
 Competition 
 We believe our product portfolio is currently the only commercially available portfolio of comprehensive molecular information products that provide a fully informative genomic profile in a concise and actionable format designed for use in the clinical setting, 
 28

backed by rigorous peer-reviewed validation studies. Our principal competition comes from existing large and small commercial diagnostic companies, as well as certain medical institutions that offer single-marker or hotspot panel tests that can capture only the most common and known gene alterations and a limited set of gene rearrangements. Although these tests assess only a limited number of genes, are unable to detect copy number alterations, and often miss short indels, in many circumstances, these are the diagnostic methods that physicians use and have used for many years. It may be difficult to change the methods or behavior of the referring physicians to incorporate our products into their practices. In addition, academic research centers and NGS platform developers are offering or developing NGS-based testing intended to be comprehensive for known cancer genes that may seek to compete with our products on the number of genes they interrogate. We have also observed increased competition from companies that offer similar molecular information tests. However, we continue to believe we have unique capabilities in providing requisite sensitivity and specificity, operational scale, or reporting elements to fit the realities of current clinical practice, including volume and quality limits of tumor samples, demands on turnaround time, and ease of use. 
   Single-Marker and Hotspot Panel Tests 
 We may face competition from companies that offer products or have conducted research to profile genes and gene expression in various cancers. Personalized genetic diagnostics is a new area of science, and we cannot predict what tests others will develop that may compete with or provide results comparable or superior to the results we are able to achieve. Our competitors include laboratory companies such as Bio-Reference Laboratories, Inc., Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings, Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, Caris Life Sciences, Guardant Health, Paradigm, NeoGenomics Laboratories, as well as companies that manufacture or may manufacture diagnostic testing kits such as Abbott Laboratories, Qiagen N.V., Roche Diagnostics, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.  These kits, which companies often include with capital equipment and reagents to local pathology laboratories, can be used directly by the physician, which can facilitate adoption. In addition, companies such as Genomic Health, Inc. and Myriad Genetics, Inc., have well-established commercial organizations that sell molecular diagnostic tests to physicians and may develop tests which compete with our products on price. 
 Academic Research Centers and NGS Platforms 
 Some hospitals and academic centers may look to internalize the type of comprehensive molecular testing we perform. Our competition may include entities such as the MD Anderson Cancer Center, MSKCC, University of Michigan, Baylor Medical Genetics Laboratories, Washington University in St. Louis, University of Washington, and other academic hospitals and research centers. Although these academic centers could have greater access to, and ability to drive adoption with, certain key thought leaders than we do, we expect that the competition from these academic centers will, for the most part, be restricted to their local markets. 
 In addition to developing kits, certain life sciences and diagnostic companies also provide NGS platforms. Illumina, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., and other companies develop NGS platforms that are being sold directly to research centers, pharmaceutical companies, and clinical laboratories. While many of the applications for these platforms are focused on the research and development markets and others are focused on testing for non-cancer conditions, each of these companies has launched and may continue to commercialize products used in the clinical oncology market. Illumina and Thermo Fisher Scientific have received FDA approval for a diagnostic kit for clinical use in oncology, which are sold to clients who have purchased their platforms. A number of private companies are also developing information technology-based tools to support the integration of NGS testing into the clinical setting. These companies could have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources than we do and may be more successful than we may be in achieving widespread market acceptance. Any tests they develop may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than FoundationOne CDx, FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, or FoundationFocus CDx BRCA.
 Liquid Biopsy Assays 
 There is excitement within the oncology community about the promise of liquid biopsy assays for their potential to improve cancer diagnosis and optimize patient care. We believe that a ctDNA assay is an important tool for providers when a tissue biopsy cannot be obtained, when tissue has been depleted or when resistance to targeted therapies is expected. There are a variety of techniques for analyzing ctDNA for a single gene or multiple genes. We believe we have developed an accurate, reliable, and comprehensive ctDNA assay, FoundationACT, that provides new options for patients when tissue is not available. Developed with input from our biopharmaceutical partners, FoundationACT includes a clinically relevant gene list with 99% positive predictive value at specified mutant allele frequencies. FoundationACT has been analytically validated for all four types of alterations clinically relevant to the treatment of cancer. 
 
Several diagnostic companies have developed and launched, or plan to launch, ctDNA assays. Some of these companies include Biocept, Exosome Diagnostics, Guardant Health, Genomic Health, Invitae, Personal Genome Diagnostics, Qiagen, and Roche Diagnostics, among others. 
 29

Our Competitive Strengths 
 Our molecular information platform enables us to offer comprehensive molecular information products that interrogate with precision the genes known to be altered in human cancer. Our products are uniquely differentiated from other oncology diagnostic products because, to our knowledge, they are the first and only products to comprehensively address all solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, and to deliver a clear, concise report detailing clinically relevant treatment alternatives. We believe our molecular information services have a sustainable competitive advantage on the basis of: 

• | our ability, with FoundationOne, to assess 315 cancer-related genes for all classes of genomic alterations with high sensitivity and specificity, unlike currently available single gene tests and hotspot panel tests, which focus only on a limited number of genes and a subset of genomic alteration types;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability, with FoundationOneHeme, to detect all classes of genomic alterations, including base pair substitutions, indels, copy number alterations and select gene rearrangements in 406 cancer-related genes, in addition to utilizing RNA sequencing across 265 genes to capture a broad range of gene fusions, a type of alteration that is a common driver of hematologic cancers and sarcomas;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability, with FoundationACT, our ctDNA assay, to reliably and accurately find all the clinically relevant alterations in 62 genes from a blood sample when a tissue biopsy is not an option. We believe the introduction of FoundationACT enables us to strengthen our established Foundation Medicine brand to be the molecular information solution of choice for providers with a full suite of highly validated and reliable products to aid in cancer diagnosis and treatment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability, with FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, our first, FDA-approved companion diagnostic, to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca™ (rucaparib) is being considered;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability, with FoundationOne CDx, the first FDA-approved broad CGP assay for solid tumors to incorporate multiple companion diagnostics to identify patients who may benefit from treatment with specific FDA-approved targeted therapies, to help inform the use of other targeted oncology therapies, including immunotherapies, to help physicians identify patient opportunities for clinical trial participation and to provide biopharmaceutical companies an FDA-approved platform for companion diagnostic development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability, to receive reimbursement from Medicare for FoundationOne CDx for several tumor types;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our proprietary optimizations allow us to utilize a wide variety of sample types, including small biopsies and fine needle aspirates, and samples with low tumor purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to leverage our expertise and relationships with oncology thought leaders to keep pace with scientific and medical advances to, among other things, incorporate newly relevant cancer genes along with newly available targeted therapeutics and clinical trials;

• | our ability to deliver, in a concise report, actionable information regarding the relevant genomic alterations in a patient’s cancer and to match these alterations with targeted therapies based on peer-reviewed literature in a medically relevant time frame;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to accelerate precision medicine in oncology, through a complete suite of molecular information decision support applications, including FoundationSmartTrials, a program to increase patient access to investigational agents and clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our efforts to capture, aggregate, analyze, and facilitate the broader exchange of genomic data across the global oncology community, including our efforts with PMEC, to create a network effect as we gather more data which will lead to more users and ultimately more comprehensive datasets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to leverage the vast array of genomic data generated by our molecular information platform, and included in FoundationCore, together with clinical data, for example, through our relationship with Flatiron, to position ourselves at the nucleus of this new treatment paradigm;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our strategic collaboration with Roche, which we believe accelerates all aspects of our business, including advancing our leadership position in precision medicine, supporting our innovative product development efforts, contributing to education and awareness among providers in the United States, significantly expanding our commercial opportunities globally, and strengthening our balance sheet and operating leverage;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to actively participate in the development of the newest oncology therapeutics and practice through our relationships with biopharmaceutical partners; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to provide value-added services to help our physician customers and patients act on the results of their comprehensive genomic profiling test results, including through FoundationACCESS.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Strategic Collaboration with Roche
 On April 7, 2015, we closed our broad, strategic collaboration with Roche and certain of its affiliates in the field of molecular information for oncology, including an R&D collaboration, a U.S. educational support collaboration, an Ex-U.S. commercial collaboration, a binding term sheet for an in vitro diagnostic product development collaboration, and an equity investment with certain governance provisions. We believe our strategic collaboration with Roche is a competitive differentiator for our business for its ability to:

• | expand and accelerate our global commercial reach for our molecular information services and enable greater patient access to personalized care;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | to accelerate and inform our research and development efforts toward new patient care innovations like TMB, bTMB and other innovative new markers and tests; and,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enable access to capital that allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and continue to build value for investors via non-dilutive mechanisms.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transaction Agreement 
 Under the terms of the Transaction Agreement, dated January 11, 2015, by and between us and Roche Holdings, Inc., or the Transaction Agreement, Roche made an equity investment, or the Investment, including (1) a primary investment of $250 million in cash to purchase 5 million newly issued shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $50.00 per share and (2) a tender offer in which Roche acquired 15,604,288 outstanding shares of our common stock at a price of $50.00 per share. As of December 31, 2017, Roche owned approximately 57.5% of our outstanding common stock. 
Collaboration 
 In connection with the Investment and simultaneously with the execution of the Transaction Agreement, we entered into a strategic collaboration with certain affiliates of Roche to develop and commercialize comprehensive molecular information and genomic analysis products for the treatment of cancer patients, or the Collaboration, pursuant to (a) a Collaboration Agreement, or, as amended, the R&D Collaboration Agreement, by and among us, F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd, or Roche Basel, and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc., or Roche U.S., (b) a US Education Collaboration Agreement, or the U.S. Education Collaboration Agreement, by and between us and Genentech, (c) an Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement, or, as amended and restated, the Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement, by and between us and Roche Basel, and (d) a Binding Term Sheet for an In Vitro Diagnostics (IVD) Agreement, or the IVD Term Sheet, by and between us and Roche Basel, each of which became effective April 7, 2015. In April 2016, we entered into a Master IVD Collaboration Agreement, or the IVD Collaboration Agreement, with Roche Basel and Roche Molecular Systems, Inc., which memorialized in a definitive agreement the principal terms set forth in the IVD Term Sheet. We refer to the R&D Collaboration Agreement, the U.S. Education Collaboration Agreement, the Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement, and the Master IVD Collaboration Agreement collectively as the Collaboration Agreements. 
 Pursuant to the R&D Collaboration Agreement, we are collaborating with Roche on multiple programs related to the use and development of products and services for use in molecular information, immunotherapy, ctDNA, and companion diagnostics. These programs are being conducted pursuant to agreed-upon work plans and are subject to the oversight of a joint research and development committee. Under the molecular information platform program, Roche is required to pay us $85 million over five years, which commenced in April 2015, for the molecular genomic profiling of a minimum number of cancer samples and to access our molecular information database. We could also receive up to approximately $74 million for the scope of activities related to the immunotherapy testing platform program, the ctDNA platform program, and the companion diagnostics platform program. The initial term of the molecular information platform program under the R&D Collaboration Agreement ends in April 2020. However, certain provisions of the R&D Collaboration Agreement may remain in effect after such initial five-year term so long as Roche and its affiliates own at least a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock. We or Roche may terminate the R&D Collaboration Agreement in the event of a breach of the agreement by the other party. 
 Pursuant to the U.S. Education Collaboration Agreement, we and Genentech, a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche, are conducting an education support program for healthcare professionals and laboratories in the United States regarding the use of next-generation sequencing and comprehensive genomic profiling technology. Genentech will develop education materials based upon information related to comprehensive genomic profiling provided by us, and we and Genentech share the costs related to the education support program activities. In addition, in the event we seek to promote any companion diagnostic product for use with a Genentech therapeutic in the United States, Genentech will have a right of first negotiation, subject to certain conditions, with respect to the co-promotion of such companion diagnostic product. The U.S. Education Collaboration Agreement will remain in effect for five years from April 2015, and either party may terminate the agreement without cause upon three months’ written notice, and either party may terminate in the event of a breach by the other party.
 Pursuant to the Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement, which was recently amended and restated in February 2018, Roche has the right, subject to the terms and conditions of such agreement, to commercialize our existing clinical diagnostic testing products, 
 31

including FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, FoundationOne CDx, any clinical diagnostic products developed under the R&D Collaboration Agreement, and any other products upon mutual agreement. Roche has the exclusive right to commercialize such products worldwide, excluding the United States, and any countries excluded pursuant to the terms of the agreement. Roche also holds a right of first negotiation with respect to the commercialization of our future clinical diagnostic products, excluding in vitro diagnostic kit products, companion diagnostic products developed by us for third parties, and any standalone data or molecular information products. In connection with the commercial launch of a given product in a given country or region, Roche must, among other things, establish and maintain a dedicated sales force (which is prohibited from promoting, and may not be directly compensated by the sale of, oncology therapeutics), provide marketing message for the product that is consistent with our messaging relating to that product in the United States, and provide customer support for the product. Roche has also agreed to additional regulatory and commercialization obligations relating specifically to FoundationOne CDx. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we and Roche have agreed upon the process by which FoundationOne CDx will replace FoundationOne in each country in the Roche commercialization territory in which we determine to commercially launch FoundationOne CDx. In the event that Roche does not satisfy any of its commercial launch or other obligations in a given country, we have the right to terminate Roche’s exclusive commercialization rights in such country. Roche will also pay agreed upon royalties and commercial milestones for each of the products. Further, if Roche fails to meet certain minimum revenue requirements for FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme, FoundationACT, or FoundationOneCDx for three consecutive years in a specified country, we have the right to terminate Roche’s exclusive commercialization rights in the applicable country. The Ex-U.S. Commercialization Agreement will remain in effect until April 2020 and may be extended by Roche for additional two-year periods. Roche has the right to terminate the agreement without cause upon six months’ written notice after the initial five-year term, and either party may terminate the agreement in the event of breach by the other party. 
 The IVD Collaboration Agreement provides terms for us and Roche to collaborate non-exclusively to develop and commercialize in vitro diagnostic versions of certain of our existing products, including FoundationOne and FoundationOneHeme, and our future products, including those developed under the R&D Collaboration Agreement. The IVD Collaboration Agreement expires on April 7, 2020, unless earlier terminated as provided therein. Roche also has the right, in its sole discretion, to extend the term of the IVD Collaboration Agreement for additional two-year periods of time during any period of time in which Roche continues to hold at least 50.1% of our capital stock. Either party may terminate the IVD Collaboration Agreement for an uncured breach of the agreement, or for insolvency or bankruptcy. 
 Investor Rights Agreement 
 In connection with the Investment and simultaneously with the execution of the Transaction Agreement, we entered into an Investor Rights Agreement, or the Investor Rights Agreement, which became effective April 7, 2015, with Roche and certain of our former stockholders. 
  Following the closing in April 2015: (a) so long as Roche beneficially owns at least 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, it will be entitled to the lesser of (i) the number of seats representing 33.34% of our Board and (ii) proportionate representation on our Board, which provision was waived by Roche until our 2017 annual meeting of stockholders in connection with the appointment of Troy Cox, our Chief Executive Officer, to the Board, and (b) so long as Roche is entitled to appoint at least one director to our Board, it will be entitled to proportionate representation on each committee of our Board, subject to compliance with the applicable rules of the SEC and the NASDAQ Stock Market. 
 Until such time as Roche and its affiliates beneficially own less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock (subject to a cure period), we may not take certain actions without Roche’s prior written consent, including any of the following: (a) appoint a new Chief Executive Officer; (b) incur any indebtedness (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement) that would result in the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the indebtedness of us and our subsidiaries exceeding the lesser of (A) $200 million and (B) 20% of our aggregate market capitalization at the time of such incurrence; (c) issue or sell any equity securities (including any securities convertible or exercisable into such equity securities), other than (X) common stock issued upon the exercise or settlement of equity awards granted as of the date of the Investor Rights Agreement in accordance with their terms, (Y) equity awards granted after the date of the Investor Rights Agreement pursuant to our 2013 Stock Option and Incentive Plan or any permitted new equity incentive plan or equity incentive plan amendment, and (Z) in connection with permitted acquisitions, certain shares of our common stock issued as stock consideration as long as such issuance does not result in Roche beneficially owning less than 50.5% of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis; (d) establish or amend any of our equity incentive plans, except for certain permitted equity incentive plans and permitted equity incentive plan amendments; (e) acquire any entity, business or assets if the aggregate consideration payable by us exceeds the lesser of (X) $200 million and (Y) 20% of our aggregate market capitalization at the time of such transaction, unless Roche is separately contemplating acquiring the same entity, business or assets; (f) dispose of any entity, business or assets if the aggregate consideration payable to us exceeds $50 million; (g) change the scope and nature of our business; (h) amend our organizational documents; (i) take any action that would impair in any material respect our ability to perform our obligations under the Investor Rights Agreement or Roche’s rights thereunder; or (j) voluntarily dissolve or liquidate or make any voluntary bankruptcy filings. 
 Voting Obligations. As long as Roche is entitled to appoint at least one director to our Board, Roche will be required to (a) cause all of its shares of our common stock to be present for quorum purposes at any meeting of our stockholders, (b) vote all of its shares of 
 32

our common stock to approve any matter requiring approval by Roche described in the preceding paragraph that Roche has approved within the previous six months, and (c) vote all of its shares of our common stock in connection with the election of directors or the adoption of certain equity incentive plans either (i) in accordance with the recommendation of our Board or (ii) in the same proportion as the votes cast by all of our stockholders other than Roche and its affiliates. 
 Standstill Provisions. Under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement, from April 7, 2015 until April 7, 2018, or the Restricted Period, Roche will be restricted from acquiring additional shares of our common stock, except in order to offset dilution and maintain its aggregate percentage ownership in us. During the Restricted Period and for as long as Roche has the right to designate a director, Roche shall not make any proxy solicitations in connection with the election or removal of our directors, or knowingly encourage or facilitate a third party to engage in any such solicitation, subject to certain limited exceptions. 
 Following the Restricted Period, Roche will be permitted to make an offer to purchase all remaining shares of our common stock held by our stockholders, or a Roche Buyout Offer. Prior to April 7, 2020, any Roche Buyout Offer shall be made on a confidential basis, subject to the review, evaluation and approval of a special committee of independent directors who are unaffiliated with Roche and are not our officers or employees, or the Disinterested Directors, and subject to a non-waivable condition that a majority of the shares of our common stock held by stockholders not affiliated with Roche approve the Roche Buyout Offer. From and after April 7, 2020, any Roche Buyout Offer may be made directly to our stockholders without the review, evaluation or approval of our Board or the Disinterested Directors, as long as it is subject to the non-waivable condition that a majority of the shares of our common stock held by stockholders not affiliated with Roche approve the Roche Buyout Offer. If, from and after April 7, 2020, Roche makes a Roche Buyout Offer, then at any subsequent annual meeting of our stockholders (or special meeting called for the purpose of electing directors), Roche will be entitled to nominate any individuals who qualify as independent directors under the terms of the Investor Rights Agreement. 
 The standstill restrictions on Roche will automatically terminate if Roche ceases to own at least 20% of our outstanding common stock or we enter into a definitive agreement with respect to, or our Board recommends to our stockholders, a transaction pursuant to which any person or group would acquire, directly or indirectly, voting securities representing more than 20% of the aggregate voting power of all of our then-outstanding voting securities. 
 Anti-dilution Protections. We have agreed to establish and maintain a stock repurchase program and to repurchase shares of our common stock in order to maintain Roche’s aggregate percentage ownership at no less than 50.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, less any shares transferred by Roche until the earlier of (a) any transfer by Roche of shares of our common stock, following which Roche beneficially owns less than 40% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis and (b) Roche beneficially owning less than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. 
 Until the date on which Roche beneficially owns less than 30% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, Roche also will hold a continuing option to purchase shares of common stock directly from us or in the open market, at prevailing market prices, in order to maintain its aggregate percentage ownership at no less than 50.5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, less any shares transferred by Roche, or the Share Percentage Cap. If we fail to or are unable to satisfy our repurchase obligations under the stock repurchase program described above, and Roche purchases shares of common stock from us or in the open market, the Share Percentage Cap will be increased by the percentage of the outstanding shares of common stock, on a fully diluted basis, represented by the shares of common stock that Roche was required to purchase at its cost in order to maintain its aggregate percentage ownership. 
 In the event that we issue any securities and, as a result thereof, Roche beneficially owns less than 50.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock on a fully diluted basis, the restrictions on Roche under the Investor Rights Agreement (including with respect to the agreement to vote Roche’s shares of common stock, the standstill restrictions and the transfer restrictions), but not the rights of Roche under the Investor Rights Agreement, will immediately terminate, and Roche will thereafter have the ability to exercise in full its rights as a stockholder. 
 Restrictions on Transfer of Shares. Roche may not transfer any shares of our common stock during the Restricted Period. Thereafter, subject to certain exceptions, Roche may not transfer any shares of our common stock to any person or group, if such person or group would beneficially own in excess of 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock following such transfer, without the prior consent of a special committee of Disinterested Directors. Following April 7, 2020, Roche will be permitted to transfer all (but not less than all) of its shares of our common stock to a third party that has made an offer to us or our stockholders (including pursuant to a tender offer) to purchase all of the outstanding shares of our common stock if the price, form of consideration and other terms and conditions of the transfer offered to Roche are the same (or no more favorable) than the price, form of consideration and other terms and conditions offered to all of our other stockholders, other than (a) fair market consideration payable in exchange for entering into restrictive covenants and (b) commercial agreements (including with respect to transition services) on arm’s-length terms, in each case that the purchaser requires as a condition to the transaction. 
 Registration Rights. Following the Restricted Period, Roche will be entitled to customary demand and piggyback registration rights, subject to customary underwriter cutbacks.
33

Matters Reserved for Approval of the Disinterested Directors. For as long as there is at least one director designated by Roche on our Board, the following actions will require approval of a majority of the Disinterested Directors (or a special committee of Disinterested Directors): (a) any transaction between Roche or any of its affiliates, on the one hand, and us, on the other hand; (b) any enforcement or waiver of our rights under any agreement between us, on the one hand, and Roche or any of its affiliates, on the other hand; and (c) any purchase of shares of our common stock by Roche or any of its affiliates, except as otherwise expressly set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement. 
 Freedom to Pursue Opportunities. As a general matter, neither we nor Roche will be required to offer a corporate opportunity to the other, and except as agreed in connection with the Collaboration or as part of the Investor Rights Agreement, there will be no restrictions on our or Roche’s ability to engage in similar activities or lines of business. 
 Termination. The Investor Rights Agreement will automatically terminate on the later of the date Roche beneficially owns less than 10% of the outstanding shares of our common stock or the date that Roche owns no Registrable Securities (as defined in the Investor Rights Agreement). 
 The foregoing summary descriptions of the Transaction Agreement, the Investment, the Collaboration Agreements and the Investor Rights Agreement do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the applicable agreements, copies of which are filed with this Annual Report. 
 Credit Facility
 In August 2016, we entered into a Credit Facility Agreement, or the Credit Facility, with Roche Finance Ltd, or Roche Finance, an affiliate of Roche, which provided for borrowing up to $100 million.  In July 2017, we amended the Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Credit Facility, as amended, during the four-year period ending August 2, 2020, or the Draw Period, we expect to borrow up to $200 million, of which $80 million was available immediately, $70 million became available upon the achievement of certain milestones in November 2017, and $50 million will be available upon the achievement of certain additional milestones. During the Draw Period, we shall pay Roche Finance a quarterly commitment fee of 0.4% on the available balance of the Credit Facility. Loans made under the Credit Facility bear interest at 6.5% per annum. We shall pay Roche Finance, on a quarterly basis, during the Draw Period and for six months thereafter, accrued interest on the outstanding principal of the loans. Beginning six months after the Draw Period and for five years thereafter, we shall pay Roche Finance quarterly equal payments of principal, with accrued interest, until maturity of the Credit Facility on February 2, 2026. 
 The Credit Facility is secured by a lien on all of our tangible and intangible personal property, including, but not limited to, shares of our subsidiaries (65% of the equity interests in the case of foreign subsidiaries), intellectual property, insurance, trade and intercompany receivables, inventory and equipment and contract rights, and all proceeds and products thereof (other than certain excluded assets). The Credit Facility contains certain affirmative covenants, including, among others, obligations for us to provide monthly and annual financial statements, to meet specified minimum cash requirements, to provide tax gross-up and indemnification protection, and to comply with laws. The Credit Facility also contains certain negative covenants, including, among others, restrictions on our ability to dispose of certain assets, to acquire another company or business, to encumber or permit liens on certain assets, to incur additional indebtedness (subject to customary exceptions) and to pay dividends on our common stock. The Credit Facility also provides for a number of events of default, including, among others, defaults due to non-payment, bankruptcy, failure to comply with covenants, breaches of a representation and warranty, change of control, a material adverse effect, and judgment defaults.  
 Governmental Regulations 
 Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation 
 As a clinical laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications, and permits to conduct our business. As to federal certifications, in 1988, Congress passed the CLIA, establishing quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. Our laboratories in Cambridge, MA and North Carolina are each CLIA certified and accredited by the CAP, a CLIA-approved accrediting organization. In addition, we are required to meet certain laboratory licensing requirements for states with regulations beyond CLIA. For more information on state licensing requirements, see below in the section entitled “Governmental Regulations—State Laboratory Testing.” 
 Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility which performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of, or assessment of health. CLIA also requires that we hold a certificate applicable to the type of work we perform and comply with certain standards. CLIA further regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality, and proficiency requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable, and timely. Laboratories must register and list their tests with The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the agency that oversees CLIA. CLIA compliance and certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to 
 34

bill for services provided to governmental payor program beneficiaries and for many private payors. CLIA is user-fee funded. Therefore, all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs. 
 We are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards, and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing less complex tests. In addition, a laboratory like ours that is certified as “high complexity” under CLIA may develop, manufacture, validate, and use proprietary tests referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. While laboratories that offer LDTs are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, in addition to CLIA, the FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion towards these tests. In compliance with CLIA requirements to establish performance specifications including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and a reference range for any LDT used in clinical testing, our LDTs have undergone full analytical validation.
 In addition to CLIA requirements, we elect to participate in the accreditation program of CAP. CMS has deemed CAP standards to be equally or more stringent than CLIA regulations and has approved CAP as a recognized accrediting organization. Inspection by CAP is performed in lieu of CMS for accredited laboratories. Because we are accredited by the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program, we are deemed to also comply with CLIA. 
 CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratories meet certain personnel qualifications, specify certain quality control procedures, meet facility requirements, or prescribe record maintenance requirements. 
 State Laboratory Testing
 Several states require the licensure of out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens from those states. For example, New York requires a laboratory to hold a permit which is issued after an on-site inspection and approval of testing methodology, and has various requirements over and above CLIA and CAP, including those for personnel qualifications, proficiency testing, physical facility, equipment, and quality control standards. Each of our CLIA laboratory locations, including a site in Massachusetts and a site in North Carolina, holds the appropriate licensure for the activities performed at that location.
 From time to time, other states may require out-of-state laboratories to obtain licensure in order to accept specimens from the state. If we identify any other state with such requirements, or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to follow instructions from the state regulators as to how we should comply with such requirements.
 Regulation of In Vitro Diagnostic Devices (IVDs)
 We currently market two 
in vitro diagnostic, or IVD, companion diagnostic devices: FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, which 
was approved by the FDA in December 2016 as a companion diagnostic 
to aid in identifying women with ovarian cancer for whom treatment with Rubraca™ (rucaparib) is being considered, and FoundationOne CDx, which was approved by the FDA in November 2017 as a broad companion diagnostic to identify patients who may benefit from treatment with a number of therapies for multiple types of cancer. As defined by the FDA, an IVD companion diagnostic is a medical device that provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product. An IVD companion diagnostic helps a health care professional determine whether a particular therapeutic product’s benefits to patients will outweigh any potential side effects or risks. FDA-approval of FoundationFocus CDx BRCA and FoundationOne CDx as IVDs was based on demonstration of safety and effectiveness of each respective test, including a robust demonstration of each test’s analytical and clinical validity, along with evidence of each test’s clinical utility in guiding therapy with the respective therapeutic drug. 
 FoundationFocus CDx BRCA and FoundationOne CDx are 
approved to be run in our Cambridge laboratory.  As approved medical devices, both tests are 
subject to the post-market requirements of the FDCA and ongoing FDA oversight, including unannounced inspection for compliance with the FDA’s QSR (codified at 21 CFR 820) and other post-market requirements applicable to devices. The laboratory in which FoundationFocus CDx BRCA and FoundationOne CDx are 
run must maintain a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation, and servicing of FoundationFocus CDx BRCA and FoundationOne CDx
. This is in addition to the existing CLIA, CAP and state oversight described above regarding laboratory testing. Any future modification to these devices could, depending on the scope of the change, require FDA notification and could trigger additional premarket review by the FDA pursuant to a supplemental application.
 FDA 
 The FDA regulates the sale and distribution in interstate commerce of medical devices under the FDCA, including in IVDs, reagents, and instruments used to perform diagnostic testing. Devices must undergo premarket review by the FDA prior to commercialization unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute, regulation, or pursuant to the FDA’s exercise of enforcement discretion.  We currently market FoundationFocus CDx BRCA
as a companion diagnostic to Clovis’ drug Rubraca™ (rucaparib). In addition, we currently market FoundationOne CDx
 for solid tumors including NSCLC, colorectal, breast, ovarian, and 
 35

melanoma. FoundationFocus CDx BRCA and FoundationOne CDx are regulated by the FDA as a Class III medical devices and are marketed pursuant to approved PMAs.
  Laboratory Developed Tests
 The FDA does not currently regulate most LDTs, such as FoundationOne, FoundationOneHeme
, and FoundationACT. The FDA historically took the position that, although such LDTs are medical devices, it would exercise enforcement discretion by not requiring compliance with the FDCA or its regulations. However, in June 2010, the FDA announced that it intended to no longer exercise enforcement discretion for LDTs and in October 2014, the FDA published two draft guidance documents that, if finalized, would implement a regulatory approach for most LDTs. In the draft guidance documents, the FDA stated that it had serious concerns regarding the lack of independent review of the evidence of clinical validity of LDTs and asserted that the requirements under CLIA, do not address the clinical validity of any LDT. The draft guidance documents proposed to impose a risk-based, phased-in approach for LDTs similar to the existing framework for in vitro diagnostic devices. On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced that it would not finalize the draft guidance documents for LDTs prior to the end of the Obama administration. 
However, 
in January 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper synthesizing public comments on the 2014 draft guidance documents and outlining a possible approach to regulation of LDTs. The discussion paper has no legal status and does not represent a final version of the LDT draft guidance documents. In the discussion paper, the FDA states that there is “a growing consensus that additional oversight of LDTs is necessary.” Similar to the FDA’s 2014 draft guidance, the FDA’s discussion paper proposes a risk-based framework that would require most LDTs to comply with most of the FDA’s regulatory requirements for medical devices.  Unlike the draft guidance, however, the discussion paper proposes to exempt currently marketed LDTs from premarket review, requiring only new or modified tests to be approved or cleared by the agency.  In addition, the FDA proposed requiring LDTs to comply with only a subset of the medical device QSRs and proposed other changes from the 2014 draft guidance. 
 Under the Trump administration, the FDA has not yet taken any regulatory action to regulate LDTs and has indicated that the agency would support legislative action.  We cannot predict whether the FDA will take action to regulate LDTs under the new administration or what approach the FDA will seek to take. Legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress or publicly circulated, each of which would implement differing approaches to the regulation of LDTs. We cannot predict whether any of these legislative proposals will be enacted into law or the impact such new legal requirements would have on our business. In the meantime, we maintain our CLIA certification, which permits us to offer LDTs for diagnostic purposes.
 Regulated Medical Devices
 Legislative proposals have been introduced in Congress or publicly circulated, each of which would implement differing approaches to the regulation of LDTs. We cannot predict whether any of these legislative proposals will be enacted into law or the impact such new legal requirements would have on our business. In the meantime, we maintain our CLIA certification, which permits us to offer LDTs for diagnostic purposes.
 FDA regulations pertaining to medical devices govern, among other things, the research, design, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, clearance or approval, record-keeping, packaging, labeling, storage, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, sales, distribution, import, and export of medical devices. Pursuant to the FDCA, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the controls the FDA determines necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. 
 Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include applicable portions of the FDA’s QSR, facility registration and product listing; reporting of adverse medical events; and appropriate, truthful, and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Many Class I devices are exempt from premarket regulation; however, some Class I devices require clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. 
 Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, and FDA guidelines, deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the devices’ safety and effectiveness. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices are accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, although some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements. Premarket notifications are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared 510(k) device or a preamendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a premarket approval, or PMA, application. In determining substantial equivalence, the FDA assesses whether the proposed device has the same intended use and technical characteristic as the predicate device, or whether the proposed device has different technological characteristics, but the information submitted in the premarket notification demonstrates the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. The FDA may request additional information, including clinical data. Under the FDCA, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification at least 90 days before introducing a device into interstate commerce, but the FDA’s review of the premarket notification 
 36

can take significantly longer. If the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), the subject device may be marketed. However, if the FDA determines that a device is not substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), then the device would be regulated as a Class III device, discussed below. If a manufacturer obtains a 510(k) clearance for its device and then makes a modification that could significantly affect the device’s safety or effectiveness, a new premarket notification must be submitted to the FDA. 
 Class III devices are those deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as those for which reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness cannot be assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above and that are life-sustaining or life-supporting. Some preamendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA require the FDA’s clearance of a premarket notification in order to be marketed. However, most Class III devices are required to undergo the PMA process in which the manufacturer must demonstrate reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence, typically extensive preclinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications (and supplemental PMA applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than 510(k) premarket notifications. Some PMA applications are exempt from a user fee, for example, a small business’s first PMA. 
 After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. The FDA also may convene an advisory panel of outside experts to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR. The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons. 
 If the FDA’s evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter authorizing commercial marketing or an approvable letter that usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval. If the FDA’s evaluations are not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The agency may determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed while the trials are conducted and the data acquired and submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Even with additional trials, the FDA may not approve the PMA application. The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data, and the submission to the FDA for review, can take several years, and the process can be expensive and uncertain. 
 Even if the FDA approves a PMA, the agency can impose post approval conditions that it believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, and distribution. After approval of a PMA, a new PMA or PMA supplement may be required for a modification to the device, its labeling, or its manufacturing process. 
 A clinical trial may be required in support of a 510(k) submission and generally is required for a PMA application. These trials generally require an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, approved by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is exempt from IDE requirements or deemed a non-significant risk device eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. Clinical trials may begin 30 days after the submission of the IDE application unless the FDA disapproves the IDE or places the trial on clinical hold. Additionally, clinical trials may not begin until their protocol and informed consent receive approval from the appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations, and we may need to submit information on certain clinical trials to a database maintained by the National Institutes of Health, in compliance with clinical trial reporting regulations. 
 Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a device is granted, the FDA may impose limitations on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted, and the device remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must register their facilities and list their devices with the FDA. A device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of some of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover quality management, design, purchasing controls, document controls, 
production and process controls, quality assurance, corrective and preventative actions, labeling, packaging, shipping, and complaint handling. Device manufacturers must submit to the FDA medical device reports for deaths, serious injuries, and certain malfunctions and report certain field corrections and product recalls or removals. Some manufacturers also may be subject to post-market surveillance regulations. Facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. 
 Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, delays in or denial of 510(k) clearance or PMA applications for new or modified products, challenges to existing 510(k) clearances or PMA applications, and a recommendation by the FDA to disallow a device manufacturer from entering into government contracts. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed. In the event that a supplier fails to maintain compliance with a device 
 37

manufacturer’s quality requirements, the manufacturer may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result. 
 If FDA takes action to regulate LDTs as devices, we believe that our LDTs would likely be regulated as either Class II or Class III devices. Accordingly, premarket review—either a 510(k), de novo application, or a PMA—would likely be required for our test if the FDA no longer applies its enforcement discretion to LDTs and our tests do not qualify as grandfathered tests that are exempted from premarket review. While the data requirements are typically greater for Class III devices, the data required for Class II devices has increased, and it is likely that some amount of clinical data (retrospective or prospective or both) would be required for any type of submission to the FDA.  We believe that products we may develop in the future for use as companion diagnostic tests are likely to be regulated as Class III devices requiring PMA approval. We cannot assure you that our current products and other future products will not require 510(k) clearance or PMA approval in the future, or, in such an event, that such approval or clearance would be forthcoming.
 The FDA also regulates software products if the products meet the definition of a medical device. Software may be regulated as a medical device if it is intended for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease; if it is a component of a medical device; or if it is an accessory to a medical device. Section 520(o) of the FDCA, which was enacted as part of the 21st Century Cures Act in December 2016, excludes certain software functions from the statutory definition of a device. The FDA has also issued guidance documents in which the agency announced that it plans to exercise enforcement discretion over certain software products. If the software is regulated as a medical device and is not subject to FDA enforcement discretion, the software may be subject to premarket review requirements and post-market regulatory requirements. We continue to evaluate our software products to determine they will be subject to preapproval and post-market requirements, but we cannot assure you that the FDA will not change its policy regarding the regulation of these products.
 HIPAA and HITECH 
 Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or the HITECH Act, the United States Department of Health and Human Services issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by health care providers and other covered entities. Three principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA: privacy regulations, security regulations, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common health care transactions. The privacy and security regulations were extensively amended in 2013 to incorporate requirements from the HITECH Act. 
 The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by health care providers and other covered entities. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a health care provider, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HITECH Act, among other things, established certain protected health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify affected individual(s) and the United States Department of Health and Human Services when there is a breach of unsecured protected health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” that health care providers must meet and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information. Massachusetts, for example, has a state law that protects the privacy and security of personal information of Massachusetts residents that is more prescriptive than HIPAA. 
 These laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information. Additionally, to the extent that we submit electronic health care claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, payments to us may be delayed or denied. 
 
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 In the United States, there are various fraud and abuse laws with which we must comply and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws. 
 In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for patient referrals for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any health care item or service reimbursable under a governmental payor program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal health care program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The 
 38

definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the health care industry, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure health care providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti- Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Penalties for federal anti-kickback violations are severe, and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil money penalties, and exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 Legislation defining two new federal crimes related to health care were recently enacted: health care fraud and false statements relating to health care matters. The health care fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from governmental payor programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact, or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items, or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment, or exclusion from governmental payor programs. 
 Finally, another development affecting the health care industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal governmental payor program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government by submitting a false claim to the federal government and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim. 
 In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a governmental payor program. 
 In Europe various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010, faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery. 
 Physician Referral Prohibitions 
 Under a federal law directed at “self-referral,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment or ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, an entity performing the tests. The prohibition also extends to payment for any testing referred in violation of the Stark Law. A person who engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare or Medicaid programs in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per bill submission, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal governmental payor programs. Bills submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited bill is obligated to refund such amounts. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.
Corporate Practice of Medicine 
 Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining what diagnostic tests are appropriate for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of the patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would 
 39

constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us and/or the professional through licensure proceedings. Typically, such laws are only applicable to entities that have a physical presence in the state. 
 Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Our laboratories are subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples, and other human tissue. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste. 
 The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for health care employers, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries. 
 Segment, Revenue and Geographical Information
 We operate in one reportable business segment and derive revenue from multiple countries, with 92.8%, 91.2%, and 92.7% of our total revenue coming from the United States in fiscal years 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In 2017, we generated total revenue of $152.9 million from the sale of our products, compared to $116.9 million in 2016 and $93.2 million in 2015.
 In January 2015, we announced a broad strategic collaboration with Roche Holdings, Inc. and certain of its affiliates. This relationship has continued to expand and Roche accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015.
 Employees
 As of January 31, 2018, we had 662 full-time employees, with 380 in technology, research and development, business development and laboratory and commercial operations, and 99 in general and administrative functions. We had 516 full-time employees in our Cambridge, Massachusetts facilities, 51 full-time employees in our Morrisville, North Carolina facility, 17 full-time employees in our Penzberg, Germany facility, and 95 of our full-time employees work outside of Massachusetts and North Carolina. None of our employees are represented by a labor union with respect to his or her employment with us.
Research and Development Expenses
 Research and development expenses increased to $91.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributed to a $12.9 million increase in personnel-related costs and a $9.1 million increase in consulting costs.
 Research and development expenses increased to $67.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from $43.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase was primarily related to costs incurred for new product development, including FoundationFocus CDx BRCA, and increased analytical validation to support our universal companion diagnostic and other companion diagnostic work. The increase was attributed to a $9.8 million increase in employee and contractor-related expenses, a $5.7 million increase in laboratory supply costs, including reagents utilized in research and development activities, a $3.4 million increase in consulting costs, a $2.5 million increase in laboratory management and facilities costs, and a $2.1 million increase in clinical trial expenses.
