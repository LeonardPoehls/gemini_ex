Overview
 Our company is focused on discovering and developing innovative, protein-based immunotherapies targeting the immune synapse to treat cancer, autoimmune/inflammatory disorders, and other diseases. Our proprietary scientific platform uses a process known as directed evolution to create therapeutics potentially capable of modulating human immune system proteins.
 In our pre-clinical studies, our scientific platform has proven capable of identifying novel molecules, including single domains capable of modulating multiple targets. These molecules have demonstrated efficacy in in vitro and in vivo mouse models. We believe therapeutics generated by our scientific platform have the potential to provide benefit in a broad range of immune system disorders. We have chosen to focus our initial efforts in select areas with unmet medical needs in oncology and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases.
 The human immune system is a complex system evolved to protect humans from external infections and harmful changes of internal cells. The Immunoglobulin Superfamily (abbreviated “IgSF”) is the name given to the largest family of adhesion, costimulatory (activating), and inhibitory (blocking) proteins found on the surface of immunological, neurological, and other human cell types. Our scientific approach and platform are based upon IgSF protein units (referred to as “domains”). We believe the IgSF protein family is particularly valuable because many IgSF proteins naturally bind multiple binding partners, also referred to as “counterstructures”.
 The scientific discoveries resulting from our work to date have resulted from applying our technology to IgSF proteins to create what we call “Variant Ig Domains” or “vIgDs”. Ours is a platform technology, and we believe our scientific platform represents a novel approach to targeting the immune system. Our scientists create vIgDs through directed evolution—an iterative scientific engineering process purposefully conducted to “evolve” an IgSF protein towards a desired therapeutic function. The potential to create therapies capable of working within a formed synapse, forcing a synapse to occur, or preventing a synapse from occurring are important, novel attributes of our scientific platform.
 In cancer, the immune system is often suppressed by inhibitory signals (or quiescent due to lack of costimulatory signals) within the tumor microenvironment. We believe our vIgDs can stimulate the immune system by delivering an activating signal, blocking an inhibitory signal, or both. The potential of vIgDs to modulate multiple inhibitory and/or activating pathways simultaneously for the treatment of cancer is a powerful and novel attribute of our scientific platform.
 In autoimmune and inflammatory conditions, the immune system has become overactive and mistakenly attacks healthy cells. Our vIgDs are potentially capable of delivering an inhibitory signal, blocking an activating signal, or both—potentially diminishing the severity of autoimmune and inflammatory conditions.
 Our scientific platform creates a variety of molecules with broad potential applicability across diseases. vIgDs can be formatted in many different ways, including standard Fc fusion proteins, localized Fc fusion proteins, and monoclonal antibody fusion proteins as well as formulated as a Transmembrane Immunomodulatory Protein (“TIP”) or as a Secreted Immunomodulatory Protein (“SIP”) The ability to utilize different formats potentially broadens future applications of vIgDs in addition to potentially conferring useful therapeutic properties.
 ALPN-101 is our lead program and is being developed for the treatment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We are developing our ALPN-202 program for the treatment of cancer.
 We expect to request regulatory approval to begin human clinical trials of ALPN-101 (ICOSL vIgD-Fc), our dual ICOS/CD28 antagonist, in the fourth quarter of 2018. We expect the target indications for ALPN-101 will be inflammatory and/or autoimmune disorders or both.
 We expect to request regulatory approval to begin human clinical trials with a molecule from our ALPN-202 program in 2019. The ALPN-202 program is a CD80 vIgD-Fc, a dual PD-1/CTLA-4 antagonist with CD28 costimulation. The target indication for the ALPN-202 program will be the treatment of cancer.

In addition to advancing programs internally, we continue to seek partners who can bring therapeutic area experience, development expertise, commercialization capabilities, and funding allowing us to maximize the potential of vIgDs and our scientific platform.
 In October 2015, we signed a research and license agreement with Kite Pharma, a Gilead company (“Kite”), granting Kite an exclusive license to two of our TIP programs for use in Kite’s ECT programs. We received $5.5 million in up-front cash and are eligible to receive up to $530.0 million in developmental, clinical, and regulatory milestone payments in addition to royalties on any products containing our TIPs. In the collaboration, we provide the TIPs and perform in vitro testing, while Kite is responsible for in vivo testing, manufacturing, clinical trials and commercialization of any resulting therapies. This collaboration was renewed in October 2017.
 Immunology Background
 Our therapies are being evaluated for their potential to target immune system disorders, including oncology (cancer), infectious disease, and inflammatory/autoimmune disease. Based on preclinical data generated to date, we believe vIgDs have the potential to provide therapeutic benefit in a broad range of immune system disorders. We have chosen to focus our initial efforts on select therapeutic areas with unmet medical needs in oncology and inflammatory/autoimmune disease.
 The human immune system is a complex system evolved to protect the host from external infection and harmful alterations of natural cells. At the most basic level, this system has evolved to detect antigens. Antigens are essentially anything causing the immune system to try and mount an immune response. Antigens vary from pathogens like a virus, mutated cells like those involved in causing cancer, or even otherwise healthy cells. In special situations such as transplanted organs or cells from a bone marrow transplant, the body sees antigens from these otherwise normal cells as “non-self”.
 The immune system determines if an antigen is harmful or not, and then acts accordingly—activating to destroy cells displaying the target antigen or inhibiting the immune system from doing anything if the target antigen is judged not harmful. The immune system has a memory for antigens so it can mount an activating or inhibitory response more quickly if a previously-seen antigen is encountered again.
 The basic actors within the immune system are as follows:
  
• | Antigen presenting cells (“APCs”) responsible for gathering antigens and presenting them to the immune system.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T cells armed to destroy cells the immune system has decided are harmful—including pathogens, cancer cells, and transplanted cells.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | B cells capable of recognizing foreign antigens and secreting antibodies to facilitate removal of the identified antigens.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Regulatory T cells and suppressive myeloid cells which inhibit the immune system from responding, preventing the immune system from attacking healthy cells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Importantly, the APCs in the immune system gather antigens to determine whether they are harmful or not. If the antigens are judged harmful by the immune system, cytotoxic (effector) cells are activated to eliminate the harmful cells. If the antigens are judged not harmful by the immune system, regulatory cells inhibit the immune system to ensure no normal healthy cells are killed.
 Activation and inhibition can be thought of like applying the gas or pressing the brake in an automobile. When viewed through the lens of activation (costimulation) and inhibition, our scientists work to develop therapies seeking to do one of four things:
  
• | Deliver an activating signal (press on the gas) to get a stronger immune response
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Block an inhibitory signal (release the brake) to get a stronger immune response
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deliver an inhibitory signal (press on the brake) to slow down an existing immune response
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Block an activating signal (release the gas) to slow down an existing immune response
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 3

The above can also be expressed in more precise scientific terminology this way:
  
• | Agonize a costimulatory receptor to press on the gas
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Antagonize an inhibitory receptor to release the brake
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | Agonize an inhibitory receptor to press on the brake
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | Antagonize a costimulatory receptor to release the gas
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 For infectious disease or cancer, patients need a stronger immune response so we seek to develop therapies delivering an activating signal, blocking an inhibitory signal, or both. If a patient has an inflammatory/autoimmune disease or has received a transplant, we seek to develop therapies delivering an inhibitory signal, blocking an activating signal, or both.
 IgSF Proteins Defined
 The IgSF is the name given to the largest family of adhesion, costimulatory (activating), and inhibitory proteins found on the surface of immunological, neurological, and other human cell types. Structurally predicted to number over 400 proteins, these cell surface and soluble molecules are broadly involved with recognition of antigens, assisting in the formation of the immune synapse, and performing costimulatory, co‑inhibitory, and cytokine receptor signaling functions.
 Figure 1 below shows several IgSF protein types ranging from a CD1 protein with a single “V” domain to the IgM protein which has a variety of “V” and “C” domains (referred to in scientific literature as “IgC” and “IgV” domains). This family of proteins underpins our technology because our scientific approach and platform are based upon engineering these IgC and IgV domains for therapeutic benefit.
 
Figure 1
 IgSF proteins like those in Figure 1 have evolved to play a primary role in the immune system of higher order species. This is reflected in the central components of the adaptive immune system—such as antibodies, MHC molecules, T cell receptors (“TCRs”), and B cell receptors—all being composed of IgSF domains. Other critical IgSF components of T cell responses include the TCR co-receptors, CD4 and CD8.
 Current therapeutic advances in oncology block “checkpoint inhibitor” IgSF domains such as PD-1 and CTLA-4. The next generation of therapeutics target checkpoint inhibitor IgSF domains such as TIGIT, LAG-3, TIM-3, and BTLA. Critical costimulatory ligands of the B7 family are all IgSF proteins, as are their activating receptors CD28, ICOS, CD226, and 
 4

TMIGD2. IgSF domains participate in the most critical aspects of adaptive immunity. Figure 2 below shows a subset of the over 400 identified IgSF proteins and where they are typically found on tumor cells and immune system cells.
 
Figure 2
 Figure 2 illustrates how some IgSFs appear on multiple cell types. For example, CD28 (and its ligand binding partners or “counterstructures”, CD80 and CD86) and ICOS (and its counterstructure ICOSL) show up on CD4 helper T cells, myeloid/myeloid-derived suppressor cells, CD4 TREG regulatory cells, and CD8 T cells. A vIgD targeting ICOS and CD28, to continue the example, could therefore potentially have activity across a number of these cell types.
 Previous utilizations of IgSF domains as therapeutic products have been limited by the generally low affinities of native, unmodified IgSFs (also referred to as “wild-type” IgSFs) have for their various counterstructures. We believe our expertise in protein engineering and immunological function enables novel therapeutic mechanisms of action not previously appreciated by the biopharmaceutical industry.
 Specifically, our scientists apply directed evolution via our scientific platform to strategically engineer single IgSF domains to potentially bind to multiple IgSF counterstructures. The ability to potentially bind multiple counterstructures with varying affinity has resulted in increased functional activity in our pre-clinical work and potentially represents the discovery of novel biology by using our scientific platform.
 While the IgSF family also includes antibodies, and monoclonal antibodies are commonly used as therapeutics by the biotechnology industry, we are interested instead in the native, non-antibody, IgSF proteins secreted or expressed on the surface of human cells. We believe these members of the IgSF family are particularly valuable in terms of therapeutic potential compared to antibodies because IgSF proteins have often evolved to bind multiple counterstructures.
 Even though our non-antibody vIgDs possess novel functional activity not associated with antibody reagents, we believe vIgDs will share many of the beneficial biochemical properties making antibodies attractive therapeutic molecules, such as stability, manufacturability, and flexible formatting—while retaining novel vIgD benefits and potentially enabling new opportunities to target human disease.

Immune Synapse Defined
 The immune synapse is a temporary, dynamic interaction at the core of the immune system’s response to antigens. When the synapse is created between two cells (like an APC and a T cell, or a tumor cell and a T cell), adhesion molecules hold cell membranes in tight formation to enable sufficient antigen presentation and/or receptor signaling. When this exchange works well, the body is adequately defended against a wide range of pathologies—including cancer and infectious diseases. When the exchange malfunctions, harmful cells are not destroyed or normal/healthy cells are mistakenly attacked.
 The immune synapse is very small and often exists for just minutes. While intact, cells forming the synapse exchange a wide variety of information. Environmental cues, ligand/receptor expression ratios, and specific receptor orientations come together in a dynamic fashion to determine whether a T cell is going to respond to a given antigen or recognize it as harmless. Importantly, IgSF proteins are the principal players in the immune synapse—another reason we chose to focus our scientific platform on IgSF proteins.
 Some of our research is targeted to these critical moments of T cell activation where vIgD-based therapeutics generated by our proprietary scientific platform can be used to modulate the spatial arrangement and signaling of multiple targets in the immune synapse. Other research projects seek to develop the ability to force synapses to occur, or prevent them from occurring, based upon the desired therapeutic outcome. This flexibility to work within a formed immune synapse, force an immune synapse to occur, or prevent an immune synapse from occurring is an important, novel attribute of our vIgDs.
 Inflammatory/Autoimmune Disease
 Inflammatory or autoimmune diseases like Type I diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus (“lupus”), inflammatory myositis (for example, polymyositis and dermatomyositis), Sjögren’s syndrome, and inflammatory bowel disease are a result of the immune system targeting the body’s healthy tissues by mistake. There are more than 80 known types of inflammatory/autoimmune diseases, many of which are severely debilitating and/or life threatening. A related condition is when a transplant patient’s body attacks the newly transplanted organ (graft rejection) or, in the case of stem cell transplants, the newly transplanted cells attack the patient’s body (graft versus host disease). These are all immune system disorders caused by the immune system having too much activation or too little inhibition. For simplicity, we refer to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as simply “inflammatory diseases” for the remainder of this section, or both.
 Our therapeutic goal with inflammatory disease is to press on the brake by delivering an inhibitory signal or release the gas by blocking an activating signal. We believe one novel aspect of our proprietary scientific platform is the potential ability to create a single vIgD-based therapeutic capable of doing both. We do not currently have a therapeutic targeting inflammatory diseases in human clinical trials or on the market. However, based upon evidence from preclinical studies to date, we believe our scientific platform has the potential to produce vIgD‑based therapeutics targeting inflammatory diseases.
 Substantial progress has been made over the last decade in developing disease-modifying therapies to slow or stop disease progression in multiple inflammatory indications. Inhibitors of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα, as well as approved drugs like abatacept and belatacept, have led to disease reductions and improvements in quality of life for patients with a variety of inflammatory disorders including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, and others. 
 Challenges in Inflammatory Disease
 We believe there remains a large unmet need for improved efficacy in the treatment of inflammatory diseases. For example, in rheumatoid arthritis, where arguably the greatest advances in treating inflammatory disease have been made, patients frequently cycle through different biologic therapies and a recent meta-analysis found only just over half of patients on anti-TNFα therapies achieved at least a twenty percent improvement in disease activity. 1
 The need for novel therapies is particularly acute for patients with chronic diseases such as lupus, for which only one new drug has been approved by the FDA in the last 50 years. Belimumab, a monoclonal antibody inhibiting B-cell activating factor, was approved in 2011 by the FDA despite concerns the therapy resulted only in modest improvement for lupus patients. Belimumab demonstrated a reduction in corticosteroid usage and an acceptable safety profile, but was not approved for use in severe active lupus nephritis or severe active central nervous system lupus.

Graft versus host disease (“GvHD”), with a mortality rate of 75% or more, is an inflammatory disease which has been particularly challenging for development of new therapies and where there exists a substantial unmet need. Over the last two decades, a multitude of therapies including stem cell transplant, IL-2 antagonists, antithymocyte globulin, anti-CD52, anti-TNF therapies, and others have been studied. While ibrutinib was recently approved for chronic GvHD, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of acute GvHD and a significant number of chronic GvHD patients did not have durable responses to ibrutinib. 
 How We Are Different
 We currently plan to develop therapeutics for inflammatory diseases by focusing on key activating and inhibitory IgSFs driving aberrant immune reactions. For these diseases, we plan on using our proprietary scientific platform to create vIgD-based therapies intended to affect the immune synapse (usually by preventing its formation) and/or interacting directly with those IgSF proteins causing immune system reactions to healthy tissues. We do not currently have a therapeutic targeting inflammatory diseases in human clinical trials or on the market. However, based upon evidence from preclinical studies to date, we believe our scientific platform has the potential to produce therapeutics targeting inflammatory diseases.
 Although some signaling between cells occurs between singular ligand and receptor pairs, there are an increasing number of examples where signaling between cells involves multi-protein complexes consisting of three or more proteins recognized in cytokine, adhesion, inhibitory, and other signaling pathways. IgSF domains are exquisitely evolved for such complex interactions. Our next-generation therapies target multi-protein complexes and could potentially facilitate transformative patient care by forcing complexes consisting of the desired protein combinations.
 Our scientific platform is flexible enough to be able to take combined approaches like blocking costimulatory proteins ICOS and CD28. When formatted properly, the resulting domain could potentially work in the immune synapse—or potentially prevent an immune synapse from forming—thereby potentially simultaneously decreasing the activating signal and sparing the inhibitory signal, ideally reducing or eliminating symptoms of inflammatory disease.
 Oncology
 Cancer is broadly defined as normal human cells growing in an uncontrolled fashion and capable of spreading this aberrant activity elsewhere in the body. Cancer can also be seen as a failure of the immune system to recognize transformed, harmful cells. Tumors develop because cancer cells learn to evade the immune system or dampen immune system activity to such a low level the tumor grows despite an otherwise healthy immune system.
 Traditional cancer treatments have focused on directly killing tumor cells through the use of toxic chemicals like chemotherapy or other approaches like irradiating cells. The 2010 FDA approval of sipuleucel-T marked a meaningful change in how tumors are treated. Sipuleucel-T represented the FDA’s first approval of an active cancer immunotherapy. It was designed to help a patient’s immune system attack prostate cancer cells. Brought to FDA approval by one of the founders of our company, the approval of sipuleucel-T energized the field to focus more closely on how to make use of the immune system to treat cancer.
 The subsequent development of therapies targeting “checkpoint inhibitors” or pathways responsible for inhibiting an immune response has resulted in several recent FDA-approved therapeutics. Targeting checkpoint inhibitors, thereby releasing the brake on the immune system, has provided meaningful efficacy for a subset of cancer patients. 
 The first drug approved in this therapeutic class was ipilimumab, an antibody interfering with inhibitory signals from an IgSF protein called CTLA-4. In 2014, two antibodies blocking the inhibitory IgSF protein PD-1— pembrolizumab and nivolumab—were approved in multiple indications. Antagonists of the IgSF protein PD-L1 followed (atezolizumab, avelumab, and durvalumab).
 In addition to modulators of these IgSF proteins, several other immunotherapies for cancer are either approved or in development including adoptive T cell therapies (CAR-T, TCR and autologous T cells called “TILs”), cancer vaccines, and oncolytic viruses.
 As noted in more detail below, we believe there is a significant unmet medical need for cancer patients for whom existing immunotherapies fail to help or who relapse after initial success on these existing immunotherapies.

Challenges in Oncology
 While checkpoint inhibitors have meaningfully changed cancer treatment, their benefit is only observed in a minority of patients and response rates vary substantially by tumor type, disease stage, and other factors. For example, observed response rates for PD-1 inhibitors in melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer are among the highest and range from 20%–40%—possibly due to the higher mutational burden frequently found in these tumors. In contrast, response rates of checkpoint inhibitors in ovarian cancers are lower, with clinical data to date demonstrating a 10%–15% response rate. Therapies designed to stimulate the immune system to attack tumors often have their effect diminished by a tumor’s evolved ability to generate redundant inhibitory signals, or dampen costimulatory signals, effectively shutting down productive immune responses before the tumor can be cleared.
 One of our goals is to “raise the tail of the survival curve” for cancer patients while potentially minimizing further adverse events. In Figure 3, the arrows represent this concept of “lifting the tail”— achieving a higher percentage of patients with durable relief from their cancer diagnosis.

Figure 3
 While the field of cancer immunotherapy advanced significantly since the approval of sipuleucel-T, no single immunotherapy is capable of creating a durable anti-tumor response in more than a third of cancer patients—and some types of cancer continue to be resistant to any immunological approach. The field has initially tried to address this unmet medical need by combining different checkpoint inhibitors—essentially trying to release the brake twice as hard. Despite several attempts, however, this approach has not resulted in success across a broad variety of cancers.
How We Are Different
 Our proprietary scientific platform is potentially capable of engineering wild-type IgSF proteins for therapeutic benefit and with potentially novel attributes and activity. For example, our platform creates novel IgSF mutants we call vIgDs designed to be capable of antagonizing (blocking) an inhibitory receptor while agonizing (delivering) an activating signal, 
 8

boosting the immune system’s response to cancer cells. We are evaluating whether these vIgD-based therapeutics will work in patients where there might be too much inhibition or too little activation in the tumor micro-environment (abbreviated “TME”), or both. 
 We believe antagonizing inhibitory signals to release the brakes on the immune system is important, but insufficient for most patients. One way we are different than approved immune-oncology therapeutics is our focus on agonizing activating receptors, pressing on the gas to stimulate the immune system. A potentially unique attribute of our scientific platform is its ability to create single vIgDs capable of both antagonizing inhibitory receptors (release the brake) and agonizing activating receptors (press the gas).
 We are also developing molecules intended to force synapses to form, delivering activating signals, blocking inhibitory signals, or both. We intend to evaluate whether these types of therapies could potentially work in situations where there might be insufficient T cells in the TME.
 Our early research suggests working with vIgDs engineered through our scientific platform potentially create a more powerful immune system response compared to unmodified, wild-type IgSF proteins. We do not currently have a therapeutic targeting cancer in human clinical trials or on the market. However, based upon evidence from our preclinical studies to date, we believe our scientific platform has the potential to produce vIgD-based therapeutics targeting cancer.
 Our Scientific Platform
 Our proprietary scientific platform is potentially capable of engineering native IgSF proteins for use as therapeutics. For example, vIgDs can be engineered with improved binding to single or multiple protein partners or counterstructures. A core potential advantage of our scientific platform is creating vIgDs with the ability to potentially strengthen binding to one counterstructure while losing or diminishing binding to another—potentially increasing selectivity for novel therapeutic outcomes. These protein engineering efforts may also potentially uncover binding to previously under-appreciated counterstructures with the potential to positively impact therapeutic efficacy.
Directed Evolution
 We recognize how evolution resulted in a finely-tuned and delicately-balanced human immune system in general, and the important role of complex IgSF protein interactions in particular. Our aim is to leverage our scientists’ expertise in protein engineering and understanding of the immune system. Our scientific platform seeks to engineer or evolve natural, wild-type IgSFs in a manner conferring a therapeutic benefit when administered to patients.
 Our scientists utilize yeast display protein library strategies to identify variants of wild-type IgSFs with desired binding characteristics. The power of yeast library approaches derives from the fact libraries can contain up to 109 protein variants with either random or rationally targeted amino acid mutations at any desired frequency per variant. At this level of protein diversity, it is usually possible to find at least a small fraction of variants with desired binding profiles. Thus, this technology can potentially provide us with protein variants of interest we can later optimize to potentially achieve the desired biology. We call this process “directed evolution” and its purpose is to alter the domains on wild-type IgSF proteins to achieve a desired therapeutic goal. This process is our proprietary scientific platform and we call the altered domains produced by our scientific platforms “vIgDs”.
 We believe the key advantages to our approach are:
  
• | potential broad applicability since many critical immuno-regulatory proteins are composed of IgSF members;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potentially rapid and precise selection of desired binding properties; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential early elimination of unstable proteins because the yeast display platform biases recovery of affinity-modified proteins towards a well-folded, non-aggregated, and stable subset of proteins;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Figure 4 shows the work flow process of directed evolution in our scientific platform. We start with a wild-type IgSF protein and then enter a cycle of library generation and yeast display. Flow cytometry or other methods are used to sort for yeast clones displaying variants with desired binding characteristics. Biologic and biophysical assays of purified proteins assess biological function and manufacturing characteristics. The end product is an optimized vIgD. Additional cycles can be carried out by building next generation libraries from the output of prior libraries to result in further optimization.

Figure 4
 A key skill in our directed evolution approach is our ability to construct productive libraries. When the structure of the wild-type IgSF protein is available, potential predictions can be made regarding the optimal amino acid alterations necessary to obtain the desired binding profile. We use these predictions to create a “rationally designed” library featuring mutations introduced in specific regions of the target IgSF protein. When such information is not available, mutations can be randomly introduced into the target protein at any desired average number of mutations per variant creating a “random” library. When our scientists apply these library designs, either approach can yield useful candidate proteins.
 Our scientific platform is generally able to improve upon native IgSF activity regardless of whether natural binding affinity is weak or strong. When starting affinity is very weak, techniques employed by our scientists have accomplished several thousand-fold increases in binding affinity with sometimes as few as two library generation cycles. Even when starting affinity is very high, our scientific platform can still improve binding affinities. The same general strategies can be used when the desired therapeutic profile requires reduced affinity compared to the wild-type IgSF.
 Our scientists rely on results from various in vitro analyses using human immune cells to guide outputs from our scientific platform. Upon the completion of one generation of the directed evolution process described above, the identified proteins are reformatted from display on yeast to soluble Fc fusion proteins produced in mammalian cells, and then tested in vitro with human immune cells. Candidates for further discovery research are identified by their desired immune system activity compared to the activity of the wild-type IgSF protein or other reference molecules. Those engineered vIgDs most strongly outperforming wild-type IgSFs and/or reference molecules may then be potentially used as the basis for second- or even third-generation directed evolution cycles.
 Discovering New Biology
 We believe the advantages of our scientific platform allow us to identify new biology. Our lead program is an example of this where a single ICOSL domain, normally only binding ICOS with any physiological relevance, is engineered into a vIgD able to bind both ICOS and CD28. We have replicated this type of novel biology in other programs directed to disclosed and undisclosed targets.
 10

In preclinical animal models, we often find our engineered vIgDs can outperform the relevant wild-type IgSF protein and/or other reference molecules when the vIgD differs from the wild-type IgSF by as few as one to three mutations. Based on in silico analyses and analogous FDA-approved therapies, we do not believe vIgDs are unusually susceptible to immunogenic effects causing adverse events or loss of drug activity.
 Highly Productive
 Our scientific platform is highly productive. A single library run through the directed evolution process can potentially create vIgDs useful in both oncology and inflammatory/autoimmune conditions. While this potential advantage is not universal for every IgSF target, our experience is most of our successful discovery campaigns result in vIgDs applicable to a broad variety of therapeutic protein designs and indications. We believe this is a novel attribute given most other platforms require each molecule to be painstakingly purpose-built for each intended therapeutic area.
Potential vIgD Formats
 We believe our vIgDs are highly flexible. In many cases, a single affinity-maturation campaign can result in potential multiple domains suitable for use in the formats such as those appearing in Figure 5.
Figure 5
 Which format is chosen depends upon the therapeutic application of the vIgD, the desired product profile, and/or the needs of our current and future partners. Figure 5 is not a complete listing as some formats in our discovery program remain undisclosed.
 vIgD-Fc
 The vIgD-Fc fusion protein is the simplest format. Our lead autoimmune/inflammation program, ALPN-101, and lead oncology program, ALPN‑202, are both examples of vIgD-Fc formats. 
 The IgV(s), IgC(s), or both of an engineered vIgD protein are fused to an Fc backbone. Combining vIgDs with antibody Fc domains to make Fc fusion proteins potentially allows better expression, facilitates purification, and improves pharmacokinetic (dosing) properties. Fc fusion proteins are a standard format in the industry, with examples such as etanercept, abatacept, and belatacept. In most of our early programs, the Fc backbone is effectorless. In certain situations, the Fc backbone can be designed to have effector function, potentially capable of depleting problematic cell populations. A vIgD-Fc could potentially be administered intravenously, subcutaneously, topically, or other methods
 Multifunction vIgD-based Molecule
 Multiple vIgDs can be combined or “stacked” together with or without an Fc backbone to create a multifunctional, vIgD-based molecule. With the potential to make use of novel biology discovered using our scientific platform, an Fc fusion with just two domains can potentially affect three, four, or more IgSF targets.
 11

Unlike most other approaches trying to target multiple checkpoints or costimulatory molecules, or both, our vIgD-based therapeutics are not traditional antibody constructs or large and unwieldy scaffolds. In general, all of our vIgD-based therapeutics utilize domains appearing very much like the native IgSF proteins.
 V-mAb
 

Figure 6
 Our V-mAb technology potentially allows targeting a vIgD into the tumor microenvironment with a monoclonal antibody. A “V-mAb” is a vIgD joined with a monoclonal antibody recognizing a validated target (as depicted in Figure 6). Our V-mAbs use the targeting antibody to localize the vIgD to the TME or target tissue to potentially deliver specific, locally-active immuno-modulation.
 Tumors thrive in environments of immune suppression. Immune cells have often been recruited to the TME, but are not responding correctly. In many cases, the T cells are recognizing antigen in the form of MHC peptide, but this signal is not supported by required costimulatory activity. In these cases, T cells could benefit from tumor or APC expression of costimulatory ligands such as CD80, CD86, or ICOSL. This strategy will potentially invigorate tumor immune responses in a tumor-specific context, which could potentially be safer than activating T cells with systemic costimulatory agonists.
 From a manufacturing standpoint, V-mAbs may potentially have advantages compared to antibody-drug conjugates or ADCs. ADCs typically join a targeting monoclonal antibody with a cytotoxic drug. Our V-mAbs are potentially different from the complex four-step manufacturing process (mAb, linker, drug, and conjugation) necessary for ADCs and do not contain toxic chemicals potentially harmful to bystander cells.

TIP Program
 

Figure 7
 Engineered Cellular Therapies (“ECTs”) in the form of CAR-T cells, engineered TCR human T cells, and engineered TILs have captured the attention of the scientific community and patients. The first CAR-T products were approved by the FDA in 2017, ushering in a new era of cancer immunotherapy. 
 Our TIP program (depicted in Figure 7) was created to potentially improve ECTs. The cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and survival of ECTs can potentially benefit from costimulatory signaling. We created vIgD-based extracellular domains engineered to potentially bind multiple powerful activating receptors on the surface of the T cell, which we call “TIPs”. By expressing costimulatory TIPs on CAR-Ts or TCR-engineered T cells, a TIP-enabled product could potentially increase the activity of infused CAR-T/ TCR cells and endogenous T cells present in the tumor environment—potentially causing enhanced and/or more persistent responses to tumors via enhanced costimulatory (activating) signaling.
 In October of 2015, Kite and Alpine entered into a research and license agreement pursuant to which we granted Kite an exclusive license to two of our TIP programs, which Kite plans to further engineer into CAR and TCR product candidates. This agreement was extended in October 2017.
 SIP Program
 Our scientific platform is not restricted to transmembrane proteins expressed on the surface of engineered cell therapies in the TIP format. Infused CAR-T or modified TCR T cells—or even oncolytic viruses—can also be potentially modified to express vIgD-based SIPs.
 Potential applications include secretion of SIPs into the extracellular space to antagonize inhibitory receptor activity, which often restricts T cell responses in the tumor environment. Cellular therapies can be engineered to express therapeutic molecules in the tumor environment, such as secreted cytokines or modulators of both inhibitory and activating receptors. The potential result could be ECTs or oncolytic viruses capable of carrying their own localized signals to modify the immune synapse with no need for combination use with expensive checkpoint monoclonal antibodies.
 We believe SIPs are a promising approach to antagonize inhibitory receptors because of a SIP’s small size as well as the demonstrated ability of T cells to express SIPs compared to monoclonal antibodies or antibody fragments.

Collaboration with Kite Pharma, a Gilead Company
 In October 2015, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license and research agreement with Kite to research, develop, and commercialize autologous ECTs incorporating two programs from our TIP technology. The research term of this agreement was extended in October 2017.
Overview
 Under the terms of the license and research agreement with Kite, we will conduct initial research to deliver two program TIPs with certain pre-defined characteristics. Kite will then conduct further research on the program TIPs with the goal of demonstrating proof-of-concept. If successful, Kite would further engineer the program TIPs into certain CAR-T and TCR product candidates to potentially enhance anti-tumor response.
 Pursuant to the terms of the license and research agreement, we are responsible for conducting a research plan to deliver TIPs to two specified IgSF targets. Kite is responsible for integrating the TIPs into their ECT constructs. Kite is also responsible for performing in vitro and in vivo studies of resulting TIP/ECT therapeutics, manufacturing, and clinical trials.
 Financial Terms
 Under the terms of the agreement, Kite paid us a $5.0 million upfront payment plus $0.5 million in additional payments to support our research. These amounts became non-refundable upon completion of a milestone in March 2016. We are eligible to receive an additional $0.5 million research support payment payable by Kite in two tranches.  In addition, we remain eligible to receive up to $530.0 million in total milestone payments based upon the successful completion of pre-specified research, clinical and regulatory milestones relating to both program TIPs. At Kite’s option, a portion of the milestone payments may be paid in shares of Kite’s common stock. We will also be eligible to receive a low, single-digit percentage royalty for sales on a licensed-product-by-licensed-product and country-by-country basis, until the later of (1) the date on which the licensed product is no longer covered by certain intellectual property rights, and (2) the expiration of a defined term beginning on the first commercial sale of the licensed product. We also granted to Kite an exclusive right of first negotiation to negotiate an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable, royalty-bearing license, to practice and exploit any pharmaceutical or biologic product containing certain allogeneic T cells developed for use as a therapy for cancer, which we refer to as the Allogeneic Products. In addition, Kite has a one-time right of first refusal prior to our accepting any offer to license such Allogeneic Products on terms substantially similar to terms offered by Kite.
 
Kite may terminate the agreement with prior written notice after expiration of the research term. Either party may also terminate the agreement upon certain insolvency events of the other party, or with written notice upon material breach by the other party, if such breach has not been cured within a defined period of receiving such notice. We may terminate the agreement with prior written notice if Kite or Kite’s affiliates or sublicensees challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of any Alpine licensed patents.
 Exclusivity
 Kite has worldwide exclusive use of TIPs engineered to target two IgSF proteins chosen by Kite. The license exclusivity is limited to these targets used as ECTs. We retain the right to develop or outlicense these two target families outside of ECTs as well as the right to develop or license any other IgSF targets for use in ECTs.
Intellectual Property Related to Kite Transaction
 Each party will each solely own any inventions, and patents claiming those inventions, generated and invented solely by such party, respectively, subject to the exclusive licenses granted by us to Kite. Each party will jointly own any inventions, and patents claiming those inventions, generated or invented by both parties pursuant to the activities conducted under the license and research agreement, subject to the exclusive licenses granted by us to Kite.

Our Strategy
 Our goal is to create modern therapies targeting the immune synapse, using our directed- evolution based scientific platform to treat patients with serious conditions such as cancer and inflammatory/autoimmune diseases. To achieve our goals, we intend to:
 Aggressively move our lead inflammation/autoimmune program ALPN-101 to clinical trials for the treatment of autoimmune/inflammatory diseases.
 ALPN-101 is an ICOS/CD28 dual antagonist vIgD fused to an effectorless Fc backbone. ALPN‑101 is based on the discovery, using our scientific platform, of a single vIgD with increased binding affinity for both ICOS and CD28. Molecules in the ALPN-101 program have demonstrated activity in vitro and in vivo in multiple models of disease. IND-enabling nonclinical and manufacturing efforts have started and we intend to apply for authorization in the fourth quarter of 2018 to begin clinical trials. We currently plan to study ALPN-101 initially in healthy volunteers. We may subsequently study ALPN-101 in patients with diseases such as GvHD, systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjögren’s syndrome, inflammatory myositis (e.g., polymyositis, dermatomyositis), and/or arthritis. 
 Aggressively move our lead oncology program ALPN-202 to clinical trials.
 Molecules in the ALPN-202 program are designed to antagonize PD-L1 and CTLA-4, while also providing tumor-localized CD28 agonism. Molecules in the ALPN-202 program are thus potentially capable of blocking inhibitory signals from PD-L1 and CTLA-4 while providing CD28 costimulation. This is accomplished with a single vIgD fused to an effectorless Fc backbone. The ALPN-202 program is based on the discovery, using directed evolution and our scientific platform, of a single domain capable of interacting with PD-L1, CD28, and CTLA-4. Molecules in the ALPN-202 program have demonstrated in vivo activity in a mouse model of PD-L1 positive tumors. We intend to file an IND in 2019 to begin clinical trials. 
 Maximize the value of our pipeline and platform via partnering activities.
 We believe our scientific platform is highly productive, with affinity maturation campaigns often resulting in hundreds of potential hits producing dozens of vIgDs with potentially desirable biologic activity. Our discovery efforts to date have resulted in vIgDs with potential uses in cancer, autoimmune/inflammatory, and infectious disease. We believe this provides significant opportunity for partnering discussions. Our first such collaboration, with Kite Pharma, involved two targets for use in ECTs and provided us $5.5 million in cash plus $530.0 million in potential developmental, clinical, and regulatory milestone payments. While difficult to predict the timing of such partnerships or whether we will be successful in our efforts to enter into further collaborations, we are continually in discussions with multiple potential partners ranging from small biotechnology firms to large pharmaceutical companies.

Lead inflammation/autoimmune program: ALPN-101, a Dual ICOS/CD28 vIgD-Fc Antagonist
 Our lead autoimmune/inflammation program is comprised of a novel single domain vIgD binding both ICOS and CD28 at higher affinity than wild-type molecules. This vIgD is fused to an effectorless Fc backbone and is intended for the potential treatment of certain inflammatory and autoimmune conditions.
 Inducible T cell Costimulator (“ICOS”) is part of the CD28 costimulatory family of molecules, including PD-1, CD28, and CTLA-4. ICOS is related to CD28, but, in contrast, is poorly expressed in naïve T cells, and rapidly induced upon activation.2 It appears to be a dominant costimulatory pathway in at least some effector or pathogenic T cells, particularly in the absence of CD28.3 Elevated levels of ICOS‑expressing T cells have been described in an increasing number of inflammatory diseases, correlating with disease activity.4,5 Inhibition of ICOS is effective in several preclinical inflammatory disease models. The ICOS pathway may therefore represent a major costimulatory pathway, nonredundant with CD28 and highly relevant to inflammatory diseases.
 Cluster of Differentiation 28 (“CD28”) is the dominant costimulatory pathway in naïve, antigen-inexperienced T cells, and required for their activation.6 However, optimal activation of activated and/or effector T cells often occurs independently of CD28.7 CD28 expression becomes progressively reduced during activation in at least some T cell populations, and CD28-negative T cells have been observed in a growing number of autoimmune diseases, often correlated with disease activity.8 Therapeutic agents directed against the CD28 pathway alone, such as abatacept, have proven only partially effective or ineffective in some inflammatory diseases,9 and/or only induce only partial disease improvement in their approved indications.10 Therefore, an additional, non-CD28, costimulatory pathway(s) likely participates in activated, effector T cells, and may be particularly relevant to inflammatory disease pathogenesis. The known ligands for CD28 are CD80 and CD86. CD28 functions akin to a rheostat—the more CD28 signaling occurs, the faster and stronger the subsequent immune response.
 Few studies have examined the effect of therapeutic blockade of ICOS in humans, but early clinical trial findings with the anti-ICOSL mAb AMG-55711 suggest inhibition of the ICOS pathway alone may also be insufficient to achieve complete efficacy in many inflammatory conditions. 
 ALPN-101 is designed to inhibit both the CD28 and ICOS pathways to potentially dampen an overactive immune response. Since it addresses potential deficiencies of single pathway blockade, we hypothesize it to be capable of delivering deeper clinical responses by blockading two key T cell costimulatory pathways with a single therapeutic. Using our scientific platform, we have potentially created a powerful dual ICOS/CD28antagonist with significantly increased binding affinity for both ICOS and CD28 and capable of modulating both targets with a single domain.

Figure 9 is a graphical representation of ALPN-101 and the theorized mechanism of action in humans.
 
Figure 9
 The left side of Figure 9 represents how the interaction typically works to activate T cells when they connect with antigen-presenting cells (“APCs”). CD80/CD86 binds to CD28, and ICOSL binds to ICOS. The resulting costimulatory signal boosts T cell activity (press on the gas). In the case of autoimmune disease and inflammation, this is unwanted activity.
 The center of Figure 9 depicts two single ICOSL vIgDs engineered with our scientific platform, each capable of binding CD28 and ICOS. These ICOSL vIgDs are fused to an effectorless Fc.
 The right side of Figure 9 shows the goal of ALPN-101—specifically, to block the ability of CD80/CD86 and ICOSL to bind their respective receptors. Put more simply, ALPN-101 seeks to block activating signals (release the gas pedal). When these powerful CD28 and ICOS costimulatory signals are blocked, we believe unwanted immune system activity may be reduced to potentially help patients with inflammatory conditions. The versatility of this therapeutic will potentially allow us to affect a number of different autoimmune/inflammatory diseases and different sets of refractory patient populations.
 Notably, ALPN-101 is not a bispecific antibody construct. A traditional bispecific would be constructed of one domain binding ICOS and one domain binding CD28. Instead, ALPN-101 makes use of a novel single domain engineered by our scientists using our proprietary scientific platform. 
 We have performed a number of pre-clinical experiments demonstrating molecules in the ALPN‑101 program are active in both in vitro (lab bench) and in vivo (animal) models.
 Novel Biology
 The dual ICOS/CD28 antagonist vIgD at the core of the ALPN-101 program represents potentially novel biology. The mixed-lymphocyte reaction (“MLR”) assay used in this test is an in vitro assay using real human immune system cells. The MLR assay helps gauge the relative immune activity of our early discovery candidates. The data in Figure 10 below show 
 17

ALPN-101 is a much better inhibitor of T cell activity, as measured by interferon gamma (IFN-γ) than either belatacept or abatacept, two drugs approved for autoimmune/inflammatory indications. 
 
Figure 10
 Superior Activity in Human Xenograft GvHD Model
 Molecules in the ALPN-101 program were studied in an in vivo mouse model of Graft versus Host Disease (“GvHD”), a damaging and even potentially fatal inflammatory disease most often brought about during stem cell and/or bone marrow transplant treatments for cancer or other serious diseases. The results represented in Figure 11 show an ALPN-101 program molecule had superior survival (right panel) and a better Disease Activity Index (left panel). Belatacept, an FDA-approved drug for prevention of renal allograft rejection (a type of inflammation-related rejection process analogous to GvHD) is used as a comparison.
Figure 11
 18

Arthritis Model
 Figure 12 shows data from an in vivo collagen-induced arthritis model. This model is designed to test a drug’s ability to reduce the kinds of inflammatory signals associated with rheumatoid arthritis and other types of inflammatory arthritis conditions. In this experiment, an early molecule in the ALPN-101 program was superior in suppressing arthritic inflammation to abatacept, a drug approved by the FDA to treat rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis. 

Figure 12
 Summary of ALPN-101 Program Preclinical Data
 Our scientists have demonstrated in preclinical studies molecules in the ALPN-101 program:
  
• | potently inhibit T cell activity;
--+----------------------------------


• | improve the disease activity index and extend survival in an in vivo animal GvHD model with comparable activity to belatacept, an FDA-approved drug for immunosuppression in renal transplantation with data in GvHD; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduce disease severity and delays onset time relative to control in a pilot in vivo arthritis model with activity superior to abatacept, an FDA-approved drug for rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ALPN-101 Clinical Plans
 Our goal is to file for regulatory authorization for our first ALPN-101 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. While subject to change, we expect that the initial clinical study will involve cohorts of healthy volunteers who will receive single or multiple ascending doses of ALPN-101 to ascertain its safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics (the biological effects of ALPN-101, as measured in the blood and/or other tissues)
ALPN-202 Program in Oncology 
 The ALPN-202 program is our lead program for immuno-oncology. Our scientists used wild‑type CD80 as the basis for a directed evolution campaign using our proprietary scientific platform. They were able to create a number of interesting vIgDs, including a series capable of blocking PD-1 inhibition and delivering costimulation via CD28. Some vIgDs from this campaign also have significant binding to CTLA-4, another inhibitory checkpoint IgSF.
 19

Programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (“PD-L1”) and its counterstructure, PD-1, are responsible for suppressing immune system responses. Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte Associated protein 4 (“CTLA-4”) also suppresses immune system responses. Both are IgSFs commonly referred to as checkpoint proteins since they act as inhibitory checks against immune system activation, pressing the brakes on an immune reaction. As noted above, CD28 provides a costimulatory signal necessary for T cell activation and survival. It is believed to be the most potent T cell costimulatory receptor of the immune system.
 It has long been recognized CD28 is required for T cell activation and CD28 is the most important of the costimulatory molecules.12 The tumor microenvironment often features exhausted T cells suppressed via PD-1/PD-L1 engagement as seen on the left of Figure 13 below. The development of anti PD-1/L1 mAbs have helped relieve one aspect of the exhausted phenotype, but less than 30% of patients typically respond – likely attributable to the minority of patients who do have sufficient CD28 costimulation as depicted in the center panel of Figure 13. More recent research has, in fact, shown CD28 costimulation is required for anti PD-1/L1 efficacy, absent which tumors do not respond due to inadequate costimulation as seen in the third panel of Figure 13.13 Therefore, there may be a need for a therapeutic providing both checkpoint antagonism and CD28 costimulation.

Figure 13
 The goal of the ALPN-202 program is to create a therapeutic capable of blocking checkpoint inhibitor activity to take the brakes off the immune system while providing for CD28 costimulation to step on the gas and increase immune system response. Among the potential therapeutic molecules in the ALPN-202 program are those we believe have three modes of activity:

• | antagonize PD-L1 to inhibit immune responses;
--+----------------------------------------------


• | agonize CD28 to increase immune response, but only in the presence of PD‑L1—a potential mechanism of action we call PD-L1 “dependent” activity; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | antagonize CTLA-4 to decrease CTLA-4’s ability to inhibit immune response.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe we have one or more therapeutic candidates in the ALPN-202 program capable of this triple-action mechanism. This has been accomplished with a single vIgD fused to an effectorless Fc backbone. The fact we have engineered a single vIgD to accomplish this, instead of relying on multiple IgSF domains fused together, represents a potentially important scientific advance and emphasizes the potential power of our scientific platform to create novel therapeutics. We are studying molecules in the ALPN-202 program using in vivo models to better understand their activity against tumors.
 We will present additional data on the ALPN-202 program at scientific conferences over the coming year.

ALPN-202 Program Clinical Plans
 Our goal is to file for regulatory approval for our first ALPN-202 clinical trials in 2019. We have not yet determined which cancer indication or indications we will investigate first. 
Active Discovery Programs
 We have a number of active discovery programs under way. In addition to active target research programs listed in Figure 14 below, we are working on a number of undisclosed IgSF targets using our proprietary scientific platform.
Figure 14
 In addition to ongoing target discovery work, we are pursuing preclinical development work on a number of undisclosed therapeutic programs plus the following three discovery-stage programs.
Inhibitory Receptor Agonist (IRA) Program
 A subset of IgSFs includes immune inhibitory or “checkpoint” receptors, such as PD-1, CTLA-4, TIGIT, LAG-3, and BTLA. These checkpoint receptors reduce inflammation in several proposed ways, such as competing with activating ligands and/or initiating negative signaling within cells—essentially putting the brakes on the immune system. They are thought to play critical roles in inflammation since genetic flaws affecting their activity have been associated with many autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. Additionally, therapeutic interventions reducing or eliminating their activity result in autoimmunity and/or inflammation in preclinical models. 
 Agonizing one or more of these checkpoint receptors, therefore, may be particularly effective in the treatment of multiple autoimmune/inflammatory disorders. True inhibitory receptor agonists, however, appear to have been generally difficult to generate reliably in drug-like formats.
 Traditional approaches to make inhibitory receptor agonists have included monoclonal antibodies mAb14 or ligand-Fc fusion biologics15, but to date, no such agonists have been approved for clinical use.

Our proprietary scientific platform may provide a particularly unique and advantageous means to achieve inhibitory receptor agonism, since it is based upon potently functional IgSF domains highly similar to naturally evolved checkpoint ligands. This potentially allows greater physiologic accessibility to the immune synapse and the ability to modulate specific interactions therein. We are investigating the ability of appropriately engineered vIgD inhibitory receptor agonists to target specifically pathogenic inflammatory cells, creating potent yet directed immunosuppressants.
 Trastuzumab/ICOSL V-mAb Program
 As noted above, one potential advantage of vIgDs is they can be formatted in a number of different ways. To demonstrate the ability of vIgDs to be integrated into monoclonal antibodies—what we call V-mAbs—we advanced a development program to fuse a costimulatory ICOSL vIgD targeting ICOS and CD28 with trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER2-neu, which is FDA-approved for treating HER2-positive breast and gastric cancers.
 Figure 15 below shows a number of alternate ways to attach vIgDs to trastuzumab. While not all of the formats were equally easy to manufacture, all variations shown were producible in sufficient quantities for in vitro testing.
 
Figure 15
 In preclinical in vitro investigations, certain of the trastuzumab/ICOSL V-mAbs were able to retain binding to trastuzumab as well as their original binding to ICOS and CD28. Additionally, molecules in the trastuzumab/ICOSL V-mAb program were able to stimulate human T cells in a manner thought to be important for anti-tumor immunity, in the presence of HER2-positive tumor cells. 
 The goal of the V-mAb program is to use vIgDs to provide tumor-localized costimulation and/or tumor-localized checkpoint antagonism by using the targeting capability of monoclonal antibodies.
 22

Tumor-Localized vIgD Program
 As noted above, multiple vIgDs can be fused together on an Fc backbone. There are some IgSF members more likely to be present on the surface of tumors than anywhere else. We undertook a development program on one such IgSF, using it to localize an ICOS/CD28 dual costimulatory signal to tumor cells. Figure 16 is a schematic for how localization could work.
 

Figure 16
 This approach was tested using a pilot in vivo mouse model. The CT26 murine colon tumor model was transfected with the target IgSF and implanted in mice. The vIgD-Fc created to target this IgSF was then given to the mice. Figure 17 below is a comparison of anti-tumor activity for the set of mice with the largest tumors prior to dosing. When used in combination with an anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody, complete tumor control was shown. These data are from a preliminary proof-of-concept molecule which, unlike molecules in the ALPN-202 program, work better in combination with anti PD-1 monoclonal antibodies.

Figure 17
 Manufacturing
 We have established in-house recombinant protein generation capabilities for producing sufficient protein material to enable our scientific platform process, validate new scientific discoveries, and enable our discovery in vivo programs as currently contemplated. Having protein production capabilities in-house allows more rapid progression from yeast libraries to in vivo study results.
 To date, generating our most promising leads—including our lead program ALPN-101 – has been accomplished through standard protein production and purification methods. As noted above, we believe one advantage of our scientific platform is selection outputs are generally manufacturable. Because the directed evolution process itself requires some level of protein production, second and third generation maturation campaigns usually select for proteins readily expressed with favorable biochemical properties. We produce our vIgDs and vIgD-Fc constructs in mammalian cell lines using both HEK293 and CHO cell expression systems in our in-house protein production processes.
 We have not yet manufactured any of our proteins at commercial scale. Abatacept is a wild-type IgSF protein commercially approved for multiple indications with no publicly-reported manufacturing difficulties. Belatacept is an IgSF protein with two mutations, likewise approved in multiple countries. We believe these two examples are potentially similar (in manufacturing terms) to our vIgD-based products.
 We have chosen a U.S.-based contract drug substance manufacturer for our initial clinical trial supplies of ALPN-101. We believe this contract manufacturer’s particular expertise is in protein analytics and production, and it has the capability to meet rapid timelines encompassing the development of production cell-lines to manufacturing of clinical trial quantities of the biopharmaceutical product.
 Competition
 We participate in the highly competitive sector of biotechnology and pharmaceuticals and in the subsector of immune modulation. This subsector has undergone tremendous technological advancement over the last decade due to advancements in understanding the role of the immune system across multiple therapeutic areas, including oncology and autoimmune/inflammatory disease. While we believe our novel technology platform, discovery programs, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources offer competitive advantages, we face competition from major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, public and private research institutions, and others. 
 24

Any products we successfully develop and commercialize will face competition from currently approved therapies and new therapies potentially available in the future.
 The availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors will also significantly affect the pricing and competitiveness of our products. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for our products, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
 Many of the companies we compete against may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 Specifically, our competitors include companies developing therapies with the same target(s) as ALPN-101 and ALPN-202 as well as companies building novel platforms to generate multi-specific antibody or non-antibody-based targeting proteins.

 Government Regulation
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements on the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of therapeutic candidates. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and export and import of therapeutic candidates and products.
 26

In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs, medical devices, and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA, its implementing regulations and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our potential therapeutic candidates and products will be subject to regulation by the FDA as biologics. Biologics require the submission of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) and approval by the FDA before being marketed in the U.S. None of our therapeutic candidates have been approved by the FDA for marketing in the U.S., and we currently have no BLAs pending. If we fail to comply with applicable FDA or other requirements at any time during the product development process, clinical testing, the approval process, or after approval, we may become subject to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties, or criminal prosecution. Any FDA enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before biologic therapeutic candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests, preclinical animal studies, and formulation studies all performed in accordance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice (“cGLP”), regulations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application which must become effective before human clinical trials in the U.S. may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;
--+--------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing, sale, or shipment of the therapeutic product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and we cannot be certain any approvals for our therapeutic candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 Once a therapeutic candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of protein chemistry, formulation, and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals. The results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application. Currently, the IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day period, raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may result in the FDA not allowing the clinical trials to commence or not allowing the clinical trials to commence on the terms originally specified in the IND. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during drug development, and the FDA must grant permission, either explicitly or implicitly by not objecting, before each clinical trial can begin. We have not yet commenced clinical trials for any of our current therapeutic candidates.
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the therapeutic candidate to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be used. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. For each medical center proposing to conduct a clinical trial , an institutional review board (“IRB”) must also review and approve a plan for any clinical trial before it can begin at that center and the IRB must monitor the clinical trial until it is completed. The FDA, an IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or discontinue a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice requirements, including the requirements for informed consent.
 All clinical research performed in the U.S. in support of a BLA must be authorized in advance by the FDA under the IND regulations and procedures described above. However, a sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside the U.S. may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of a BLA so long as the clinical trial is conducted in compliance with an international guideline for the ethical conduct of clinical research known as the Declaration of Helsinki and/or the laws and regulations of the country or countries in which the clinical trial is performed, whichever provides the greater protection to the participants in the clinical trial.
 27

Clinical Trials
 For purposes of BLA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined.
  
• | Phase I clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population of subjects to test the therapeutic candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy humans or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening diseases to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase II clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the therapeutic candidate for specific targeted indications in patients with the disease or condition under study; evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage; and identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase III clinical trials are commonly definitive efficacy studies of the experimental medication. Phase III trials are typically conducted when Phase II clinical trials demonstrate a dose range of the therapeutic candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. Phase III clinical trials are generally undertaken with large numbers of patients, such as groups of several hundred to several thousand, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple, geographically-dispersed clinical trial sites.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of a BLA on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional post-approval clinical trials to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Such post-approval clinical trials are typically referred to as Phase IV clinical trials.
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal trials and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the biologic in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the therapeutic candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate the therapeutic candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
 Biologics License Applications
 The results of preclinical studies and of the clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the chemistry, pharmacology, clinical pharmacology, and the clinical effects of the biologic, are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the biologic for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine, among other things, whether a biologic is safe, pure, and potent and whether the facility in which the biological product is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the biological product continues to be safe, pure, and potent.
 Once a BLA has been accepted for filing, by law the FDA will review the application and respond to the applicant but the review process may be significantly delayed by FDA’s requests for additional information or clarification. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, the FDA evaluates a standard original BLA submission within the first 60 days of its receipt to determine if it is sufficiently complete to conduct a full review, and the FDA has a goal of responding to the submission within ten months of the 60-day filing date, but this timeframe is often extended. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation, and/or recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. The FDA may deny approval of a BLA if the applicable statutory and regulatory criteria are not satisfied, or for any reason, or it may require additional clinical data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide the BLA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret data. Once the FDA approves a BLA, or supplement thereto, the FDA may withdraw the approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems are identified after the biologic reaches the market. Where a withdrawal may not be appropriate, the FDA still may seize existing inventory of such biologic or require a recall of any biologic already on the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase IV clinical trials and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved biologics which have been commercialized. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a biologic based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
 28

A sponsor may also seek approval of its therapeutic candidates under programs designed to accelerate FDA review and approval of BLAs. For instance, a sponsor may seek FDA designation of a therapeutic candidate as a “fast track product.” Fast track products are those products intended for the treatment of a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for such diseases or conditions. If fast track designation is obtained, the FDA may initiate review of sections of a BLA before the application is complete. This “rolling review” is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the remaining information. In some cases, a fast track product may be approved on the basis of either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments, under the FDA’s accelerated approval program. Approvals of this kind typically include requirements for appropriate post-approval confirmatory clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or otherwise confirm the effect of the clinical endpoint.
 In addition, the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, (“FDASIA”) which was enacted and signed into law in 2012, established a new category of drugs referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be subject to accelerated approval. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life- threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development.
 Therapeutic candidates may also be eligible for “priority review,” or review within a six-month timeframe from the 60-day filing date, if a sponsor provides sufficient clinical data demonstrating its therapeutic candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed products. Even if a therapeutic candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide the therapeutic candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. When appropriate, we intend to seek fast track designation and/or accelerated approval for our biologics. We cannot predict whether any of our therapeutic candidates will obtain a fast track and/or accelerated approval designation and, if so, whether such designation will be maintained or rescinded by FDA, or the ultimate impact, if any, of the fast track or the accelerated approval process on the timing or likelihood of FDA approval of any of our proposed biologics.
 Biologics may be marketed only for the FDA approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. Further, if there are any modifications to the biologic, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes, equipment, or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 Before approving an application, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the biologic product is manufactured, and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA may also inspect the sites at which the clinical trials were conducted to assess their compliance, and will not approve the biologic unless compliance with Good Clinical Practice requirements is satisfactory.
 The testing and approval processes require substantial time, effort, and financial resources, and each may take several years to complete. The FDA may not grant approval on a timely basis, or at all. Even if we believe a clinical trial has demonstrated safety and efficacy of one of our therapeutic candidates for the treatment of a disease, the results may not be satisfactory to the FDA. Preclinical and clinical data may be interpreted by the FDA in different ways, which could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval. We may encounter difficulties or unanticipated costs in our efforts to secure necessary governmental approvals which could delay or preclude us from marketing our therapeutic candidates. The FDA may limit the indications for use or place other conditions on any approvals restricting the commercial application of the products. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, change in personnel, manufacturing changes, or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement—which may require additional studies to evaluate the effect of such change on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the product as they may relate to the safety or effectiveness of the product—must be filed and approved before the change may be implemented. As with new BLAs, the review process for BLA supplements may be delayed by the FDA through requests for additional information or clarification.
 We believe any of our therapeutic products approved as a biological product under a BLA might qualify for a 12-year period of exclusivity currently permitted by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (“BPCIA”). Specifically, the BPCIA established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new 
 29

abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on its similarity to an existing brand product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be submitted by an applicant until four years after the date the reference product was first licensed and cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product was first licensed under a BLA. There is a risk the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to significantly shorten this exclusivity period or the FDA will not consider our therapeutic candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing. The BPCIA is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA and the courts. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes operating to limit the scope or length of exclusivity afforded by the BPCIA could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological products. In addition, foreign regulatory authorities may also provide for exclusivity periods for approved biological products or for abbreviated pathways for follow on biological products. For example, biological products in Europe may be eligible for a 10-year period of exclusivity.
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to therapeutic candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition affecting fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a therapeutic candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that therapeutic candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a marketing application for the therapeutic for that particular rare disease or condition. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The FDA may revoke orphan drug designation, and if it does, it will publicize the drug is no longer designated as an orphan drug. If a therapeutic candidate with orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the therapeutic candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same therapeutic candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same therapeutic candidate as defined by the FDA or if our therapeutic candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s therapeutic candidate for the same indication or disease.
 Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain therapeutic candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, referred to as a “Written Request,” relating to the use of the active moiety of the therapeutic candidate in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications where it determines information relating to the use of a therapeutic candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population. In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most therapeutic candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen, or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, BLAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the therapeutic candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the therapeutic candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding the drug or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor failing to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current, or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation.
 Other Regulatory Requirements
 Any biologics manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to FDA approvals would be subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. Manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMPs, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and third-party manufacturers. Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can 
 30

subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil penalties. Our company cannot be certain it or its present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other ongoing FDA regulatory requirements. If our company or its present or future third-party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a drug from distribution, or withdraw approval of the BLA for the therapeutic product.
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available biologics for uses not described in the product’s labeling and different from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
 Healthcare Reform
 In March 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “ACA”), a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry, and impose additional policy reforms. The ACA contains a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, and fraud and abuse, impacting existing government healthcare programs and resulting in the development of new programs, including Medicare payment for performance initiatives, and improvements to the physician quality reporting system and feedback program. The Affordable Care Act also does, among other things, the following:

• | Increases pharmaceutical manufacturer rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program due to an increase in the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs, and the application of Medicaid rebate liability to drugs used in risk-based Medicaid managed care plans.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expands the 340B Drug Pricing Program to require discounts for “covered outpatient drugs” sold to certain children’s hospitals, critical access hospitals, freestanding cancer hospitals, rural referral centers, and sole community hospital.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Requires pharmaceutical companies to offer discounts on brand-name drugs to patients who fall within the Medicare Part D coverage gap, commonly referred to as the “Donut Hole.”
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Requires pharmaceutical companies to pay an annual non-tax-deductible fee to the federal government based on each company’s market share of prior year total sales of branded drugs to certain federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, Department of Veterans Affairs, and Department of Defense.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which, since 2014, has had authority to recommend certain changes to the Medicare program to reduce expenditures by the program when spending exceeds a certain growth rate and such changes could result in reduced payments for prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, these recommendations will become law unless Congress enacts legislation achieving the same or greater Medicare cost savings. However, as of early 2018, the President has yet to nominate anyone to serve on the board and there is legislation being proposed to repeal it.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishes the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research. The research conducted by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute may affect the market for certain pharmaceutical products.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Establishes The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. Funding has been allocated to support the mission of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation from 2011 to 2019.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 31

From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced, and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the sale, marketing, coverage, and reimbursement of products regulated by the CMS or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, CMS regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways significantly affecting our business and our products.
 In particular, we expect the Administration and Congress will continue to seek to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the U.S. healthcare reform legislation. Since taking office, President Trump has continued to support the repeal of all or portions of the ACA. President Trump has also issued an executive order in which he stated it is his Administration’s policy to seek the repeal of the ACA and directed executive departments and federal agencies to waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay the implementation of the provisions of the ACA to the maximum extent permitted by law. There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact President Trump’s Administration and Congress may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from therapeutic candidates we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop therapeutic candidates. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing, or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on our company.
 Furthermore, political, economic, and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the U.S. to fundamental change. Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform health care coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures, and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative health care benefits, controls on health care spending, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage for or the amounts federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures, and limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability.
 Third-Party Payor Coverage and Reimbursement
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third- party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, and the Veterans Administration, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations.
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which is part of the federal Medicaid program, a program for financially needy patients, among others, requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients.
 In order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under Medicare Part B, part of the federal Medicare program covering outpatient items and services for the aged and disabled, and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program, a federal program requiring manufacturers to provide discounts to certain safety-net providers. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based upon certain Medicaid Drug Rebate Program metrics reported by the manufacturer.
 The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate a payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded product on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. However, under Medicare Part D—Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit—there are protections in place to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oncology products and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all anti-cancer agents. Furthermore, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product approved for sale, we may need to pursue compendia listings or conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in 
 32

order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost- effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
 Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 If we obtain regulatory approval of our products, we may be subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing strategies. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws affecting our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order, or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal health care program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing, or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provisions of HIPAA, prohibiting knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program and making false statements relating to health care matters; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which was part of the Affordable Care Act, requiring manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and disclose payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer, which information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides the government may assert a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
