 Item 1.      Business
 General
 Sunshine Financial, Inc. ("Sunshine Financial" or the "Company"), a Maryland corporation, is the holding company for its wholly owned subsidiary, Sunshine Community Bank.  Sunshine Community Bank was originally chartered as a credit union in 1952 as Sunshine State Credit Union to serve state government employees in the metropolitan Tallahassee area.  We expanded over the years to serve city, county, state and federal government employees as well as the employees of commercial and industrial companies, associations, contract employees serving these groups, and family members.  This expansion resulted in our evolution toward a community financial institution with a growing focus trending more toward real estate lending than the traditional credit union products.  On July 1, 2007, we converted from a state-chartered credit union known as Sunshine State Credit Union to a federal mutual savings bank known as Sunshine Savings Bank, and in 2009 reorganized into the mutual holding company structure.  On April 5, 2011, the Company completed a public offering as part of Sunshine Saving Bank's conversion and reorganization from a mutual holding company to a public stock holding company structure (the "Conversion").
 On July 1, 2016, Sunshine Savings Bank completed its conversion from a federal savings bank charter to a Florida state bank charter, changing its name to Sunshine Community Bank.  As a Florida-chartered financial institution, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation ("FOFR") is the primary regulator for the Bank, with additional federal oversight provided by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the "FDIC").  Sunshine Financial, Inc. continues to be regulated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the "Federal Reserve").
 We currently operate out of five full-service offices serving the Tallahassee, Florida metropolitan area.  Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public and investing those funds in loans secured by first and second mortgages on one- to four-family residences (including residential construction loans), lot loans, commercial real estate loans and consumer loans.  We offer a wide variety of secured and unsecured consumer loan products, including home equity, direct automobile loans and credit card loans in our market area.  In addition, in conjunction with owner and non-owner occupied real estate loans we occasionally will originate commercial secured or unsecured loans.  In early December 2016, we closed our Appleyard branch and relocated the deposits to our other branches.
 We offer a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms, including savings accounts, money market deposit and term certificate accounts, business accounts, and demand accounts.  Our primary sources of funds are deposits and payments on loans.

 Market Area
 
We consider our primary market area to be the Tallahassee, Florida metropolitan area.  We are headquartered in Tallahassee, Florida and have five retail offices as of December 31, 2016.  Each of our offices is located within Leon County, Florida.  Based on the most recent branch deposit data provided by the FDIC our share of deposits in the Leon County, Florida was approximately 2.16%.  This data does not include deposits held by credit unions with which we also compete.  See "- Competition."
 Tallahassee is the state capital and home to Florida State University, Florida A&M and Tallahassee Community College and is significantly impacted by government services and education activities.  Our primary market area includes a diverse population of management, professional and sales personnel, office employees, manufacturing and transportation workers, service industry workers and government employees, as well as retired and self-employed individuals.  The population has a skilled work force with a wide range of education levels and ethnic backgrounds.  Major employment sectors are government; education, health and social services; retail trades; professional & business services; leisure & hospitality services; and financial services.

Leon County's unemployment rate as of December 2016 was 4.4%, while the State of Florida rate was 4.9% and the United States rate was 4.7% for the same time period, as reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  According to RealtyTrac, the foreclosure rate of 0.09% in Leon County has been steady and is equal to the 0.09% foreclosure rate for the State of Florida at December 31, 2016, which has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the nation.  As of December 31, 2016, the United States foreclosure rate was 0.06%.  The median home price in Tallahassee was $167,200 as compared to the Florida median home price of $203,200 and the United States median home price of $228,900 at December 31, 2016.
 Population growth in Leon County and the city of Tallahassee is projected to exceed population growth for the country and state as a whole.  Per capita and average household income levels for Florida, Leon County and the city of Tallahassee generally fall below the United States levels.  Demographic data for Leon County and Tallahassee are skewed by the large student population that resides in the area.  Approximately 47% of the population of Tallahassee falls in the 15-34 year old age group, as compared to 40% for Leon County, 25% for the state of Florida and 27% for the United States, due to the large number of college students who reside in the area. The total number of households has increased since 2010 in Leon County and in Tallahassee, similar to the State of Florida. Total households in Leon County and Tallahassee are projected to continue this expansion at a more rapid pace over the next five years than state and national growth.

Our lending policies and loan approval limits are recommended by senior management and approved by the Board of Directors.  Unsecured loans of $50,000 and secured loans of $150,000 and below meeting our underwriting guidelines can be approved by individual loan officers, although secured loans up to $750,000 may be approved by our Chief Executive Officer.  Our Management loan committee, consisting of our President and Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, reviews all other loans and all loan modifications.  Loan committee meetings require a quorum of two members of the committee.  Loans submitted to the loan

committee require approval of a majority of the members voting.  Loans and total loan relationships exceeding $1.0 million must be approved by the Directors loan committee and loans and total loan relationships exceeding $2.0 million must be approved by the Board of Directors.  All closed loans are presented to the Board for ratification on a monthly basis.
 At December 31, 2016, the maximum amount under federal law that we could lend to any one borrower and the borrower's related entities was approximately $4.6 million.  Our five largest lending relationships totaled $20.8 million in the aggregate, or 15.4% of our gross loan portfolio, at December 31, 2016.  The largest relationship consisted of eight loans totaling $4.5 million secured primarily by non-owner occupied commercial buildings.  The next four largest lending relationships at December 31, 2016, ranged from $3.3 million to $4.4 million and are also primarily secured by non-owner occupied commercial real estate.  All of these loans were performing in accordance with their repayment terms at December 31, 2016.
 Commercial Real Estate Loans.  We began originating commercial real estate loans in 2012, primarily owner occupied loans.  We are targeting  small and mid-size owner occupants and investors with prime credit for commercial real estate loans between $500,000 and $2.0 million with a three, five, or seven year balloon payment and 20 year amortization term. We offer both fixed and adjustable-rate loans on commercial real estate loans, although a majority of the loans we recently originated were at a fixed interest rate with an amortization term of 20 years and maturity of up to 7 years.  Commercial real estate loans are generally underwritten with loan-to-value ratios of up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or the purchase price of the property. We require appraisals of all properties securing commercial real estate loans. Appraisals are performed by independent appraisers designated by us. We generally require a minimum pro forma debt coverage ratio of 1.25 times for loans secured by commercial real estate properties. We also generally require and obtain loan guarantees from financially capable parties based upon the review of personal financial statements. If the borrower is a corporation, we generally require and obtain personal guarantees from the corporate principals based upon a review of their personal financial statements and individual credit reports.  At December 31, 2016, we had $53.0 million of commercial real estate loans, representing approximately 39.1% of the total loan portfolio, consisting of loans secured by retail, office, warehouse, mini-storage facilities and other improved commercial properties, compared to $43.4 million, or 38.0% of the total loan portfolio at December 31, 2015. The largest commercial real estate relationship at December 31, 2016 included eight loans totaling $4.5 million which were performing in accordance with their repayment terms.  The average size of our commercial real estate loans was approximately $481,000 at December 31, 2016.
 Commercial real estate loans typically involve higher principal amounts than other types of loans, and repayment is dependent upon income generated, or expected to be generated, by the property securing the loan or business occupying the property in amounts sufficient to cover operating expenses and debt service, which may be adversely affected by changes in the economy or local market conditions. Commercial real estate mortgage loans also expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by residential real estate because the collateral securing these loans typically cannot be sold as easily as residential real estate. In addition, to date, all of our commercial real estate loans are amortized over 15 to 20 years and contain large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or non-payment. If we foreclose on a commercial real estate loan, our holding period for the collateral typically is longer than for one-to-four family residential mortgage loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of the collateral. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our commercial real estate loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred with our residential or consumer loan portfolios.
 One- to Four-Family Real Estate, Construction and Lot Loans.  We originate loans secured by first mortgages on one- to four-family residences primarily in our market area.  We originate one- to four-family residential mortgage loans primarily through referrals from real estate agents, builders and from existing customers.  Walk-in customers are also important sources of loan originations.

We generally originate mortgage loans in amounts up to 80% of the lesser of the appraised value or purchase price of a mortgaged property, but will also permit loan-to-value ratios of up to 95%.  For loans exceeding an 80% loan-to-value ratio, we generally require the borrower to obtain private mortgage insurance covering us for any loss on the amount of the loan in excess of 80% in the event of foreclosure.  The majority of our one- to four-family residential loans are originated with fixed rates and have terms of ten to 30 years.  We also originate adjustable-rate mortgage, or ARM, loans which have interest rates that adjust annually to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities adjusted to a constant one-year maturity plus a margin.  Most of our ARM loans are hybrid loans, which after an initial fixed rate period of one, five or seven years will convert to an adjustable interest rate for the remaining term of the loan. Our ARM loans have terms up to 30 years.  Our pricing strategy for mortgage loans includes setting interest rates that are competitive with other local financial institutions and consistent with our asset/liability management objectives.  Our ARM loans generally have a cap of two percentage points on rate adjustments during any one year and nine percentage points over the life of the loan.  As a consequence of using caps, the interest rates on these loans may not be as rate sensitive as is our cost of funds.
 ARM loans generally pose different credit risks than fixed-rate loans, primarily because as interest rates rise, the borrower's payment rises, increasing the potential for default.  Due to historically low long term fixed interest rates, we have originated only $161,000 in ARM loans in the past three years and total ARM loans represent only 2.6% of our total mortgage loan portfolio.  As of December 31, 2016, one-to four-family mortgage loans delinquent over 60 days represented 4.08% compared to 3.81% of that portfolio as of December 31, 2015.  See "- Asset Quality -- Nonperforming Assets" and "-- Classified Assets."
 Most of our loans are written using generally accepted underwriting guidelines, and are readily saleable to Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, or other private investors.  Our real estate loans generally contain a "due on sale" clause allowing us to declare the unpaid principal balance due and payable upon the sale of the security property.  At December 31, 2016, one- to four-family residential loans totaled $56.6 million or 41.8% of our gross loan portfolio. The average size of our one- to four-family residential loans was approximately $119,000 at December 31, 2016.
 Beginning in 2008 we began originating lot loans, which are loans secured by developed lots in residential subdivisions located in our market area. We originate these loans to individuals intending to construct their primary residence on the lot.  We will generally originate construction loans in an amount up to 75% of the lower of the purchase price or appraisal, although we will also permit loan-to-value ratios of up to 95%.  For loans exceeding a 75% loan-to-value ratio we generally require the borrower to obtain private mortgage insurance covering us for any loss on the amount of the loan in excess of 75% in the event of foreclosure.  Lot loans are secured by a first lien on the property, have a fixed or variable rate of interest with a maximum amortization of 20 years.  At December 31, 2016, lot loans totaled $2.9 million or 2.1% of our gross loan portfolio and the average loan size in our lot loan portfolio was approximately $36,000.
 Property appraisals on real estate securing our one- to four-family and lot loans are made by state certified independent appraisers approved by the board of directors.  Appraisals are performed in accordance with applicable regulations and policies.  We generally require title insurance policies on all first mortgage real estate loans originated, but may also originate loans that will be retained for our portfolio with an attorney's opinion in lieu of title insurance.  Homeowners, liability, fire and, if required, flood insurance policies are also required for one- to four-family loans. We also originate a limited amount of construction loans for single family houses to individuals for construction of their primary residence in our market area.  We will generally originate construction loans in an amount up to 80% for a one- to four-family residential construction loan.  Our construction loans generally have terms up to 12 months and provide for monthly payments of interest only until maturity.  We typically originate construction loans to individuals as construction to permanent loans and on completion of construction the loan is automatically converted to permanent, but do not require take-out financing prior to origination.
 Construction and lot loan lending is generally considered to involve a higher degree of credit risk than long-term permanent financing of residential properties.  If the estimate of construction cost proves to be inaccurate, we may be compelled to advance additional funds to complete the construction with repayment

dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan.  If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, there is no assurance that we will be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan.  In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project and may have to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time. Lot loans also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral.  The value of the lots securing our loans may be affected by the success of the development in which they are located.
 Consumer Lending.  We offer a variety of secured consumer loans, including home equity, new and used automobile, boat and other recreational vehicle loans, and loans secured by savings deposits.  We also offer unsecured consumer loans including a credit card product.  We originate our consumer loans primarily in our market area.
 Our home equity loans, consisting of fixed-rate loans and variable-rate lines of credit, have been the largest component of our consumer loan portfolio over the past several years.  At December 31, 2016, home equity lines of credit totaled $5.9 million and home equity loans totaled $1.3 million, or collectively 41.0 % of our consumer loan portfolio and 5.3 % of our gross loan portfolio.  The lines of credit may be originated in amounts, together with the amount of the existing first mortgage, of up to 95% of the value of the property securing the loan (less any prior mortgage loans) provided that the borrower obtain private mortgage insurance covering us for any loss on the amount of the loan in excess of 80% in the event of foreclosure.  Home equity lines of credit are originated with an adjustable-rate of interest, based on prime rate plus a margin.  Home equity lines of credit generally have up to a ten-year draw period and amounts may be re-borrowed after payment at any time during the draw period.  At December 31, 2016, unfunded commitments on these lines of credit totaled $3.0 million.
 Our fixed-rate home equity loans are originated in amounts, together with the amount of the existing first mortgage, of up to 100% of the appraised value of the subject property for home equity loans (less any prior mortgage loans) provided that the borrower obtain private mortgage insurance covering us for any loss on the amount of the loan in excess of 80% in the event of foreclosure.  These loans may have terms for up to 20 years and are fully amortizing.
 Collateral value is determined through existing appraisals, new appraisals or evaluations by the loan department.  On second mortgages, we do not require title insurance but do require homeowner, liability, fire and, if required, flood insurance policies.
 We make loans on new and used automobiles.  We currently originate automobile loans on a direct basis.  Our automobile loan portfolio totaled $3.2 million at December 31, 2016, or 18.4% of our consumer loan portfolio and 2.4% of our gross loan portfolio.  Automobile loans may be written for a term of up to six years for both new and used cars with fixed rates of interest.  Loan-to-value ratios are up to 125% of the lesser of the MSRP or the National Automobile Dealers Association value for auto loans, plus the price of extended warranty insurance.  We follow our internal underwriting guidelines in evaluating automobile loans, including credit scoring.
 Our consumer loans also include loans secured by new and used boats and recreational vehicles, deposits and unsecured credit card and other consumer loans, all of which, at December 31, 2016, totaled $7.1 million, or 5.2% of our gross loan portfolio.  Loans secured by boats and recreational vehicles typically have terms up to twenty years, and loan-to-value ratios up to 90%.  They are made with fixed and adjustable rates.  Our unsecured consumer loans have either a fixed rate of interest generally for a maximum term of 60 months, or are revolving lines of credit of generally up to $50,000.  At December 31, 2016, unfunded commitments on our unsecured lines of credit and credit cards totaled $10.0 million, and the average outstanding balance on these lines was approximately $3,900.
 Consumer loans generally have shorter terms to maturity, which reduces our exposure to changes in interest rates.  In addition, management believes that offering consumer loan products helps to expand and 
 
 9
 

create stronger ties to our existing customer base by increasing the number of customer relationships and providing cross-marketing opportunities.
 Our underwriting standards for consumer loans include a determination of the applicant's credit history and an assessment of the applicant's ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan.  The stability of the applicant's monthly income may be determined by verification of gross monthly income from primary employment, and additionally from any verifiable secondary income.
 Consumer and other loans generally entail greater risk than do one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, particularly in the case of consumer loans that are secured by rapidly depreciable assets, such as manufactured homes, automobiles, boats and other recreational vehicles.  In these cases, any repossessed collateral for a defaulted loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment of the outstanding loan balance.  As a result, consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower's continuing financial stability and, thus, are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy.
 Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales, Repayments and Servicing
 We originate both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans.  Our ability to originate loans, however, is dependent upon customer demand for loans in our market area.  Demand is affected by competition and the interest rate environment.  During the past few years, we, like many other financial institutions, have experienced significant prepayments on loans due to the low interest rate environment prevailing in the United States.  In periods of economic uncertainty, the ability of financial institutions, including us, to originate large dollar volumes of real estate loans may be substantially reduced or restricted, with a resultant decrease in interest income.  We have not purchased loans or loan participations recently, but we may do so in the future.   We also originate single family mortgage loans for sale to Freddie Mac and third party investors with servicing retained without recourse, subject to a provision for repurchase upon breach of representation, warranty or covenant.  The sale of mortgage loans provides a source of non-interest income through the gain on sale, reduces our interest rate risk, and provides a stream of servicing income.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, loan sales totaled $1.2 million.  Our loan servicing portfolio as of December 31, 2016 consisted of 223 loans totaling $29.4 million.
 In addition to interest earned on loans and loan origination fees, we receive fees for loan commitments, late payments and other miscellaneous services.  The fees vary from time to time, generally depending on the supply of funds and other competitive conditions in the market.

Asset Quality
 Loan Delinquencies and Collection Procedures.  The borrower is notified by both mail and telephone when a loan is four to nine days past due.  If the delinquency continues, subsequent efforts are made to contact the delinquent borrower and additional collection notices and letters are sent.  When a loan is 90 days delinquent, we commence repossession or a foreclosure action.  Reasonable attempts are made to collect from borrowers prior to referral to an attorney for collection.  In certain instances, we may modify the loan or grant a limited moratorium on loan payments to enable the borrower to reorganize their financial affairs, and we attempt to work with the borrower to establish a repayment schedule to cure the delinquency.  At December 31, 2016, 17 loans totaling $2.7 million were classified as troubled debt restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings are loans where the Company, for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower's financial condition, has granted a concession to the borrower that it would otherwise not consider. A TDR typically involves a modification of terms such as a reduction of the stated interest rate or face amount of the loan, a reduction of accrued interest, or an extension of the maturity date(s) at a stated interest rate lower than the current market rate for a new loan with similar risk.
 As to mortgage loans, if a foreclosure action is taken and the loan is not reinstated, paid in full or refinanced, the property is sold at judicial sale at which we may be the buyer if there are no adequate offers to satisfy the debt.  Any property acquired as the result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure is carried as foreclosed real estate and held for sale at fair value less estimated selling costs.  The initial write-down of the property is charged to the allowance for loan losses.  Adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines occur.

Loans are reviewed on a regular basis and are placed automatically on non-accrual status when they are 90 days or more delinquent.  Loans may also be placed on a non-accrual status at any time if, in the opinion of management, the collection of additional interest is doubtful.  Interest accrued and unpaid at the time a loan is placed on non-accrual status is charged against interest income.  Subsequent payments are either applied to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income, depending on the assessment of the ultimate collectability of the loan.  At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $2.5 million of loans that were held on a non-accrual basis. These loans were considered when calculating the allowance for loan losses.  As of December 31, 2016, we had $301,000 in loans that were less than 90 days past due, but were on nonaccrual status.  Our procedures for repossession and sale of consumer collateral are subject to various requirements under the applicable consumer protection laws as well as other applicable laws and the determination by us that it would be beneficial from a cost basis.  At December 31, 2016, we had $141,000 in foreclosed real estate.
 The following table sets forth our loan delinquencies by type, by amount and by percentage of type at December 31, 2016.

 Nonperforming Assets.  The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of nonperforming assets in our loan portfolio.  Loans are placed on non-accrual status when the loan becomes over 90 days delinquent and the collection of principal and/or interest become doubtful.  We had $----2.0 million and $2.7 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, in troubled debt restructurings, of which $699,000  and $227,000 were in nonaccrual status, respectively.  We had $7,000 in accruing loans 90 days or more delinquent as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.

 For the year ended December 31, 2016, gross interest income which would have been recorded had all nonaccruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms amounted to approximately $150,000, of which $149,000 was included in interest income based on cash received.
 Other Loans of Concern.  In addition to the nonperforming assets set forth in the table above, as of December 31, 2016, there were seven loans totaling $1.0 million with respect to which known information about the possible credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and which may result in the future inclusion of such items in the nonperforming asset categories.  These loans have been considered in management's determination of our allowance for loan losses.
 Classified Assets.  Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets (such as foreclosed real estate and repossessed assets) of lesser quality, as "substandard," "doubtful" or "loss."  An asset is considered "substandard" if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any.  "Substandard" assets include those characterized by the "distinct possibility" that the insured institution will sustain "some loss" if the deficiencies are not corrected.  Assets classified as "doubtful" have all of the weaknesses in those classified "substandard," with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make "collection or liquidation in full," on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions and values, "highly questionable and improbable."  Assets classified as "loss" are those considered "uncollectible" and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted.
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management.  General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to recognize the risk associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets.  When an insured institution classifies problem assets as "loss," it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge off such amount.  An institution's determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by our bank regulators, which may order the establishment of additional general or specific 
  13
 

loss allowances. Assets which do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but require additional management oversight or possess minor credit weakness are designated by us as "special mention."  We regularly review the problem assets in our portfolio to determine whether any assets require classification in accordance with applicable regulations.  On the basis of management's review of our assets, at December 31, 2016, we had classified $2.7 million of our loans as substandard, none as doubtful and none as loss, of which $2.5 million was included in non-accruing loans. This total amount of classified loans represented 12.99% of our equity capital plus allowance for loan losses and 1.56% of our assets at December 31, 2016.  We also had designated $811,000 of our loans as special mention at December 31, 2016.
 Allowance for Loan Losses.  The allowance for loan losses is a valuation account that reflects our estimation of the losses in our loan portfolio to the extent they are reasonable to estimate.  The allowance is maintained through provisions for loan losses that are charged to operations in the period they are established.  We charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely.  Recoveries on loans previously charged off are added back to the allowance.
 At December 31, 2016, our allowance for loan losses was $924,000, or 0.69% of our net loan portfolio and 36.3% of total nonperforming loans.  This estimation is inherently subjective as it requires estimates and assumptions that are susceptible to significant revisions as more information becomes available or as future events change.  The level of allowance is based on estimates and the ultimate losses may vary from these estimates.  Large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans, such as residential real estate, small commercial real estate, home equity and consumer loans, are evaluated in the aggregate using historical loss factors adjusted for current economic conditions.  Assessing the allowance for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires making material estimates, including the amount and timing of future cash flows expected to be received.  In the opinion of management, the allowance, when taken as a whole, reflects estimated loan losses in our loan portfolio.
 A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due.  Troubled debt restructurings are also considered impaired loans. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower's prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for residential mortgage loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan's effective interest rate, the loan's obtainable market price, or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent.
 Future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary if economic and other conditions in the future differ substantially from the current operating environment.  The Financial Accounting Standards Board has adopted a new accounting standard update ("ASU") that will be effective for our first fiscal year after December 15, 2019.  This standard, referred to as Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses.  This will change the current method of providing allowances for credit losses that are probable, which may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses, and may greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses.  For more on this ASU, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements contained in Item 8 of this report. In addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for possible loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management.  If charge-offs in future periods exceed the allowance for loan losses, we may need additional provisions to replenish the allowance for loan losses.  Any increases in the 
 
 14
 

allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and, most likely, capital, and may have a material negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
 
The following table sets forth an analysis of our allowance for loan losses at the date indicated.

Investment Activities
 Federal savings banks have the authority to invest in various types of liquid assets, including United States Treasury obligations, securities of various federal agencies, including callable agency securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured banks and savings institutions, certain bankers' acceptances, repurchase agreements and federal funds.  Subject to various restrictions, federal savings banks may also invest their assets in investment grade commercial paper and corporate debt securities and mutual funds whose assets conform to the investments that the institution is otherwise authorized to make directly.  See "How We Are Regulated - Sunshine Community Bank – Florida Office of Financial Regulation" for a discussion of additional restrictions on our investment activities.
 Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have the basic responsibility for the management of our investment portfolio, subject to the direction and guidance of the Board of Directors.  These officers consider various factors when making decisions, including the marketability, maturity and tax consequences of the proposed investment.  The maturity structure of investments will be affected by various market conditions, including the current and anticipated slope of the yield curve, the level of interest rates, the trend of new deposit inflows, and the anticipated demand for funds via deposit withdrawals and loan originations and purchases.
 We may utilize our borrowing capacity at the Federal Home Loan Bank ("FHLB") Atlanta to purchase investment grade securities to leverage our balance sheet and increase our net interest income.  The general objectives of our investment portfolio will be to provide liquidity when loan demand is high, to assist in maintaining earnings when loan demand is low and to maximize earnings while satisfactorily managing risk, including credit risk, reinvestment risk, liquidity risk and interest rate risk.  Our investment quality will emphasize safer expected average life short term investments with the yield on those investments secondary to not taking unnecessary risk with the available funds of Sunshine Community Bank.  See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Asset/Liability Management."

We do not currently participate in hedging programs, interest rate caps, floors or swaps, or other activities involving the use of off-balance sheet derivative financial instruments and have no present intention to do so.  Further, we do not invest in securities which are not rated investment grade.
 The following table sets forth the composition of our securities portfolio and other investments at the dates indicated.  All securities at the dates indicated have been classified as held to maturity.  At December 31, 2016, our securities portfolio did not contain securities of any issuer with an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity capital, excluding those issued by the United States Government or its agencies or United States government sponsored entities.

Sources of Funds
 General.  Our sources of funds are primarily deposits, borrowings, payments of principal and interest on loans and funds provided from operations.
 Deposits.  Our current deposit products include checking, savings, individual retirement savings accounts, money market accounts, and certificates of deposit accounts ranging in terms from seven months to 60 months, and individual retirement certificate of deposit accounts with terms starting at 12 months.  Deposit account terms vary, primarily as to the required minimum balance amount, the amount of time that the funds must remain on deposit and the applicable interest rate.  We solicit deposits primarily in our market area.  At December 31, 2016, we had no brokered, Internet or wholesale deposits.  We primarily rely on competitive pricing policies, marketing and customer service to attract and retain these deposits.  As of December 31, 2016, core deposits, which we define as our non-certificate or non-time deposit accounts, represented approximately 85.5% of total deposits.
 
 17
 



The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and prevailing interest rates and competition.  The variety of deposit accounts we offer has allowed us to be competitive in obtaining funds and to respond with flexibility to changes in consumer demand.  We have become more susceptible to short-term fluctuations in deposit flows as customers have become more interest rate conscious.  We try to manage the pricing of our deposits in keeping with our asset/liability management, liquidity and profitability objectives, subject to competitive factors.  Based on our experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable sources of funds.  Despite this stability, our ability to attract and maintain these deposits and the rates paid on them has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions.
 Certificates of deposit represent 14.5% of our deposits at December 31, 2016.  Our liquidity could be reduced if a significant amount of certificates of deposit, maturing within a short period of time, were not renewed.  Historically, a significant portion of the certificates of deposit remain with us after they mature and we believe that this will continue.  However, the need to retain these time deposits could result in an increase in our cost of funds.
 The following table sets forth our deposit flows during the periods indicated.

We are a member of and may obtain advances from the FHLB of Atlanta, which is part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The twelve regional Federal Home Loan Bank's provide a central credit facility for their member institutions.  These advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate, range of maturities and call features.  At December 31, 2016, the Company had an unsecured federal funds line of credit for $6.0 million with a correspondent bank and a $41.8 million line with the FHLB collateralized by a blanket lien on qualifying loans.  At that date the Company had $12.8 million outstanding in FHLB advances that mature in 2017 at a weighted average fixed rate of 0.63% and no outstanding balance on the federal funds line of credit.  We may rely in part on long-term FHLB advances to fund asset and loan growth.  We are required to own stock in the FHLB of Atlanta based on the amount of our advances and total assets.  At December 31, 2016, we had $684,000 in FHLB stock.
 Subsidiary and Other Activities
 Sunshine Community Bank is permitted to invest up to 10% of its assets, or $17.3 million at December 31, 2016, in the stock, obligations or securities of subsidiaries (with certain exceptions). Sunshine Community Bank has one subsidiary, Sunshine Member Insurance Services, Inc. ("SMSI"), which was established to sell automobile warranty and credit life and disability insurance products associated with loan products.  Our investment in SMSI as of December 31, 2016 was $100.
Competition
 We face strong competition in attracting deposits.  Competition in originating real estate loans comes primarily from other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions, life insurance companies and mortgage bankers.  Other savings institutions, commercial banks, credit unions and finance companies provide vigorous competition in consumer lending.  Commercial business competition is primarily from local commercial banks.  We compete because we believe we consistently deliver high-quality, personal service to our customers that result in a high level of customer satisfaction.
 Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions, many of which are branches of large money center and regional banks that have resulted from the consolidation of the banking industry in Florida and other eastern states.  These include large national lenders and others in our market area that have greater resources than we do and offer services that we do not provide.  For example, we do not offer trust services and do not actively seek out multifamily loans.  Customers who seek "one-stop shopping" may be drawn to institutions that offer services that we do not.
 We attract our deposits through our branch office system.  Competition for those deposits is principally from other savings institutions, commercial banks and credit unions located in the same community, as well as mutual funds and other alternative investments.  We compete for these deposits by offering superior service and a variety of deposit accounts at competitive rates.  Based on the most recent branch deposit data provided by the FDIC, Sunshine Community Bank's share of deposits in the Tallahassee, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area was approximately 2.16%.

How We Are Regulated
 General. Set forth below is a brief description of certain laws and regulations that are applicable to Sunshine Financial and Sunshine Community Bank. The description of these laws and regulations, as well as descriptions of laws and regulations contained elsewhere herein, does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable laws and regulations. Legislation is introduced from time to time in the United States Congress and the Florida Legislature that may affect the operations of Sunshine Financial and Sunshine Community Bank.  In addition, the regulations governing us may be amended from time to time.  Any such legislation or regulatory changes in the future could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.
 The FDIC and the FOFR have extensive enforcement authority over Florida-chartered commercial banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System, including Sunshine Community Bank, and the Federal Reserve has enforcement authority over their holding companies, including Sunshine Financial.  This enforcement authority includes, among other things, the ability to assess civil monetary penalties, to issue cease-and-desist or removal orders, and to initiate injunctive actions.  In general, these enforcement actions may be initiated for violations of laws and regulations and unsafe or unsound practices.  Other actions or inactions may provide the basis for enforcement action, including misleading or untimely reports filed with the FDIC or Federal Reserve.  Except under certain circumstances, public disclosure of final enforcement actions by the FDIC or the Federal Reserve is required by law.
 On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the "Dodd-Frank Act") was signed into law.  This law significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and affected the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies.  This law also established the Consumer Protection Bureau ("CFPB").  The following discussion summarizes significant aspects of the Dodd Frank Act that may affect Sunshine Community Bank and Sunshine Financial.  The following aspects of the Dodd Frank Act are related to the operations of Sunshine Community Bank:
  
· | The CFPB is empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. Smaller financial institutions, like Sunshine Community Bank, are subject to supervision and enforcement by their primary federal banking regulator with respect to federal consumer financial protection laws.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The Federal Reserve must require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deposit insurance was permanently increased to $250,000.
--+---------------------------------------------------------


· | The deposit insurance assessment base for FDIC insurance is the depository institution's total average assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") increased to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits; however, the FDIC is directed to offset the effect of the increased reserve ratio on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sunshine Community Bank.  Sunshine Community Bank is subject to regulation and oversight by the FDIC and FOFR extending to all aspects of its operations. This regulation of Sunshine Community Bank is intended for the protection of depositors and not for the purpose of protecting shareholders. Sunshine Community Bank is required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital and is subject to some limitations on the payment of dividends to Sunshine Financial See "- Capital Requirements for Sunshine Community Bank" and "-Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions." Sunshine Community 
 
 21
 

Bank also is subject to examination by the FOFR by the FDIC, which insures the deposits of Sunshine Community Bank to the maximum extent permitted by law.
 Florida Office of Financial Regulation. The investment and lending authority of Sunshine Community Bank is prescribed by Florida federal laws and regulations and Sunshine Community Bank is prohibited from engaging in any activities not permitted by such laws and regulations.
 Prior to July 1, 2016, Sunshine Community Bank was a federal-chartered savings bank known as Sunshine Savings Bank.  As a federally chartered savings bank, Sunshine Community Bank was required to meet a qualified thrift lender ("QTL") test. This test required Sunshine Community Bank to have at least 65% of its portfolio assets, as defined by statute, in qualified thrift investments on a monthly average for nine out of every 12 months on a rolling basis or meet an alternative test. Under either test, Sunshine Community Bank was required to maintain a significant portion of its assets in residential-housing-related loans and investments.  In addition, Sunshine Community Bank was subject to a 35% of total assets limit on consumer loans, commercial paper and corporate debt securities, and a 20% limit on commercial non-mortgage loans. This test and these asset limits do not apply to Sunshine Community Bank as a Florida-chartered commercial bank.
 Sunshine Community Bank's relationship with its depositors and borrowers is regulated to a great extent by federal and Florida laws and regulations, especially in such matters as the ownership of savings accounts and the form and content of our mortgage requirements. In addition, the branching authority of Sunshine Community Bank is regulated by the FDIC and the FOFR.  Sunshine Community Bank is generally authorized to branch nationwide.
 Sunshine Community Bank is subject to a statutory lending limit on aggregate loans to one person or a group of persons combined because of certain common interests. That limit is generally equal to 15% of our unimpaired capital and surplus, except that for loans that are fully secured, the limit is increased to 25%. At December 31, 2016, Sunshine Community Bank's lending limit under this restriction was $4.6 million. We have no loans or lending relationships in excess of our lending limit.
 Sunshine Community Bank is subject to periodic examinations by the FDIC and the FOFR.  During these examinations, the examiners may require Sunshine Community Bank to provide for higher general or specific loan loss reserves, and/or recognized additional charge-offs based on their judgment, which can impact our capital and earnings.  As a Florida-chartered commercial bank, Sunshine Community Bank is subject to a semiannual assessment, based on its assets, to fund the operations of the FOFR.
 The FDIC has adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards on such matters as loan underwriting and documentation, asset quality, earnings standards, internal controls and audit systems, interest rate risk exposure and compensation and other employee benefits. Any institution that fails to comply with these standards must submit a compliance plan.
 Insurance of Accounts and Regulation by the FDIC. The FDIC insures deposit accounts in Sunshine Community Bank up to applicable limits.  The FDIC assesses deposit insurance premiums quarterly on each FDIC-insured institution applied to its deposit base, which is its average consolidated total assets minus its Tier 1 capital.  No institution may pay a dividend if it is in default on its federal deposit insurance assessment.
 Prior to July 1, 2016, each institution with less than $10 billion in assets (a small institution) was assigned to one of four risk categories based on its capital levels, supervisory ratings and other factors.  The assessment rates ranged from approximately 5 basis points to 35 basis points, subject to certain adjustments.
 Effective July 1, 2016, the FDIC changed the method of calculating assessments for small institutions so that assessment rates for small institutions are based on an institution's weighted average CAMELS component ratings and certain financial ratios.  Assessment rates range from 1.5 to 16 basis points for institutions with CAMELS composite ratings of 1 or 2, 3 to 30 basis points for those with a CAMELS 
 
 22
 

composite score of 3, and 11 to 30 basis points for those with CAMELS Composite scores of 4 or 5, subject to certain adjustments.  Assessment rates are expected to decrease in the future as the reserve ratio increases in specified increments to the 1.35% ratio required by the Dodd-Frank Act.
 As required by the Dodd Frank Act, the FDIC has adopted a rule to offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio of the DIF on small institutions by imposing a surcharge on institutions with assets of $10 billion or more commencing on July 1, 2016 and ending when the reserve ratio reaches 1.35%.  This surcharge period is expected to end by December 31, 2018.  Small institutions will receive credits for the portions of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15% and 1.35%.  The credits will apply to reduce regular assessments by 2.0 basis points for quarters when the reserve ratio is at least 1.40%.
 FDIC-insured institutions are required to pay an additional quarterly assessment called the FICO assessment in order to fund the interest on bonds issued to resolve thrift failures in the 1980s.  This assessment rate is adjusted quarterly to reflect changes in the assessment base, which is average assets less tangible equity, and is the same base as used for the deposit insurance assessment.  These assessments are expected to continue until the bonds mature in the years 2017 through 2019.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, Sunshine Community Bank paid $8,000 in FICO assessments. 
 Transactions with Affiliates. Transactions between Sunshine Community Bank and its affiliates are required to be on terms as favorable to the institution as transactions with non-affiliates; certain of these transactions, such as loans to an affiliate, are restricted to a percentage of Sunshine Community Bank's capital, and loans to affiliates require eligible collateral in specified amounts. In addition, Sunshine Community Bank may not lend to any affiliate engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company or acquire the securities of most affiliates. Sunshine Financial is an affiliate of Sunshine Community Bank.  Sunshine Community Bank's authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% shareholders of the bank or its holding company ("insiders"), as well as entities such persons control, is limited.  There are limits on both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that Sunshine Community Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on Sunshine Community Bank's capital level and certain board approval procedures must be followed.  Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated parties and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment.  There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees.  Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved.
 Capital Rules.  Sunshine Financial and Sunshine Community Bank are subject capital regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve and the FDIC that became effective January 1, 2015 (with some provisions transitioned into full effectiveness over several years).  Under these capital regulations, the minimum capital ratios are: (1) a common equity Tier 1 ("CET1") capital ratio of 4.5% of risk-weighted assets; (2) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6.0% of risk-weighted assets; (3) a total capital ratio of 8.0% of risk-weighted assets, and (4) a leverage ratio (the ratio of Tier 1 capital to average total adjusted assets) of 4.0%.  CET1 generally consists of common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income ("AOCI") unless an institution elects to exclude AOCI from regulatory capital, as discussed below, and certain minority interests, all subject to applicable regulatory adjustments and deductions.  Tier 1 capital generally includes CET1 and noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, less most intangible assets, subject to certain adjustments.  Total capital consists of Tier 1 and Tier 2 Capital.  Tier 2 capital, which is limited to 100 percent of Tier 1 capital, includes such items as qualifying general loan loss reserves, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible debt, term subordinated debt and limited life preferred stock; however, the amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that may be included in Tier 2 capital is limited to 50 percent of Tier 1 capital.  Risk-weighted assets are determined under the capital regulations, which assign risk-weights to all assets and to certain off-balance sheet items.
 These regulations include the phasing-out of certain instruments as qualifying capital.  Mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets over designated percentages of CET1 are deducted from capital.  In addition, Tier 1 capital includes AOCI, which includes all unrealized gains and losses on available for sale debt and 
 
 23
 

equity securities, unless an institution elects to opt out of such inclusion, if eligible to do so.  We have elected to permanently opt-out of the inclusion of AOCI in our capital calculations.
 The capital regulations include a 150% risk weight for certain high volatility commercial real estate acquisition, development and construction loans and for non-residential mortgage loans that are 90 days past due or otherwise in nonaccrual status; a 20% risk weight for the unused portion of a commitment with an original maturity of one year or less that is not unconditionally cancellable; and a 250% risk weight for mortgage servicing and deferred tax assets that are not deducted from capital.
 In addition to the minimum CET1, Tier 1 and total capital ratios, Sunshine Financial and Sunshine Community Bank must maintain a capital conservation buffer consisting of additional CET1 capital greater than 2.5% of risk-weighted assets above the required minimum levels in order to avoid limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses.  The capital conservation buffer requirement is phased in beginning on January 1, 2016 when a buffer greater than 0.625% of risk-weighted assets will be required which amount will increase each year until the buffer requirement is fully implemented on January 1, 2019.
 Under the FDIC's prompt corrective action standards, in order to be considered well-capitalized, a bank must have a ratio of CET1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 6.5%, a ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of 8%, a ratio of total capital to risk-weighted assets of 10%, and a leverage ratio of 5%.  In order to be considered adequately capitalized, a bank must have the minimum capital ratios described above.  Institutions with lower capital ratios are assigned to lower capital categories.  Based on safety and soundness concerns, the FDIC may assign an institution to a lower capital category than would originally apply based on its capital ratios.
 The FDIC is also authorized to require Sunshine Community Bank to maintain additional amounts of capital in connection with concentrations of assets, interest rate risk and certain other items.  The FDIC has not imposed such a requirement of Sunshine Community Bank.
 An institution that is not well capitalized is subject to certain restrictions on brokered deposits and interest rates on deposits.  An institution that is not at least adequately capitalized is subject to numerous additional restrictions, and a guaranty by its holding company is required.  An institution with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets of 20% or less is subject to appointment of the FDIC as receiver if its capital level does not improve in timely fashion.  When the FDIC as receiver liquidates an institution, the claims of depositors and the FDIC as their successor have priority over other unsecured claims against the institution.
 As of December 31, 2016, Sunshine Financial and Sunshine Community Bank are considered well-capitalized under applicable rules and meet the capital conservation buffer requirement.  Regulatory capital is discussed further in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Report.
 Community Reinvestment and Consumer Protection Laws.  In connection with its lending and other activities, Sunshine Community Bank is subject to a number of federal laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population.  These include the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Truth-in-Lending Act, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the Secure and Fair Enforcement for Mortgage Licensing Act of 2008, and the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA").  In addition, federal banking regulators have enacted regulations limiting the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic consumer information to non-affiliated third parties.  The regulations require disclosure of privacy policies and allow consumers to prevent certain personal information from being shared with non-affiliated parties.
   The CRA requires the appropriate federal banking agency, in connection with its examination of an FDIC-insured institution, to assess its record in meeting the credit needs of the communities served by the institution, including low and moderate income neighborhoods.  The federal banking regulators take into account the institution's record of performance under the CRA when considering applications for mergers, acquisitions and branches.  Under the CRA, institutions are assigned a rating of outstanding, satisfactory, 
 
 24
 

needs to improve, or substantial non-compliance.  Sunshine Community Bank received a "satisfactory" rating in its most recent CRA evaluation.
 Bank Secrecy Act / Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  Sunshine Community Bank is subject to the Bank Secrecy Act and other anti-money laundering laws and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001.  These laws and regulations require Sunshine Community Bank to implement policies, procedures, and controls to detect, prevent, and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers.  Violations of these requirements can result in substantial civil and criminal sanctions.  In addition, provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act require the federal financial institution regulatory agencies to consider the effectiveness of a financial institution's anti-money laundering activities when reviewing mergers and acquisitions.
 Limitations on Dividends and Other Capital Distributions.  Generally, a Florida-chartered commercial bank that meets the capital conservation buffer requirement may make capital distributions during any calendar year equal to retained net profits of the previous two calendar years and the current year-to-date earnings. For additional information, see "– New Capital Rules."  In addition, under the terms of the FOFR approval of the conversion to a Florida-chartered commercial bank, Sunshine Community Bank must obtain the prior approval of the FOFR before declaring any dividend during the three years following July 1, 2016.
 
The long-term ability of Sunshine Financial to pay dividends to its stockholders is based primarily upon the ability of Sunshine Community Bank to make capital distributions to Sunshine Financial.  So long as Sunshine Community Bank continues to meet the applicable capital conservation buffer requirement (discussed above) after each capital distribution and operates in a safe and sound manner, it is management's belief that the FOFR will continue to allow Sunshine Community Bank to distribute its net income to Sunshine Financial, although no assurance can be given in this regard. 
 Federal Home Loan Bank System.  Sunshine Community Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, one of the 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System.  The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility for member institutions.  As a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, Sunshine Community Bank is required to hold shares of capital stock in that Federal Home Loan Bank.  Sunshine Community Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock at December 31, 2016 of $684,000.
Regulation of Sunshine Financial
 General.   Sunshine Financial, as the sole shareholder of Sunshine Community Bank, is a bank holding company registered with the Federal Reserve.  Bank holding companies are subject to comprehensive regulation by the Federal Reserve under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and the regulations promulgated thereunder.  This regulation and oversight is generally intended to ensure that Sunshine Financial limits its activities to those allowed by law and that it operates in a safe and sound manner without endangering the financial health of Sunshine Community Bank.
 As a bank holding company, Sunshine Financial is required to file quarterly and annual reports with the Federal Reserve and any additional information required by the Federal Reserve and is subject to regular examinations by the Federal Reserve.
 A merger or acquisition of Sunshine Financial, or an acquisition of control of Sunshine Financial, is generally subject to approval by the Federal Reserve.  In general, control for this purpose means 25% of voting stock, but such approval can be required in other circumstances, including but not limited to an acquisition of as low as 5% of voting stock.
 The Dodd-Frank Act and Federal Reserve policy require a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks, with the ability to provide financial assistance to a subsidiary bank in financial distress. Regulations to implement this provision of the Dodd-Frank Act are required, but to date, none have been promulgated.
 
 25
 

Permissible Activities. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve may approve the ownership of shares by a bank holding company in any company the activities of which the Federal Reserve has determined to be so closely related to the business of banking or managing or controlling banks as to be a proper incident thereto.  The Bank Holding Company Act prohibits a bank holding company, with certain exceptions, from acquiring ownership or control of more than 5% of the voting shares of any company that is not a bank or bank holding company and from engaging in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks, or providing services for its subsidiaries.  A bank holding company that meets certain supervisory and financial standards and elects to be designed as a financial holding company may also engage in certain securities, insurance and merchant banking activities and other activities determined to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities.
 The Federal Reserve must approve an application of a bank holding company to acquire control of, or acquire all or substantially all of the assets of, a bank, and may approve an acquisition located in a state other than the holding company's home state, without regard to whether the transaction is prohibited by the laws of any state, but may not approve the acquisition of a bank that has not been in existence for the minimum time period, not exceeding five years, specified by the law of the host state, or an application where the applicant controls or would control more than 10% of the insured deposits in the United States or 30% or more of the deposits in the target bank's home state or in any state in which the target bank maintains a branch. Federal law does not affect the authority of states to limit the percentage of total insured deposits in the state that may be held or controlled by a bank holding company to the extent such limitation does not discriminate against out-of-state banks or bank holding companies.  Individual states may also waive the 30% state-wide concentration limit contained in the federal law.
 Capital Requirements for Sunshine Financial.  Effective January 1, 2015, Sunshine Financial became subject to the capital rules described under the caption "Capital Rules" above.  The Federal Reserve expects a holding company's subsidiary banks to be well capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations.  In addition, a bank holding company must serve as a source of financial strength for its depository institution subsidiaries.
 Federal Securities Law.  The stock of Sunshine Financial is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Sunshine Financial is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements of the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
 Sunshine Financial stock held by persons who are affiliates of Sunshine Financial may not be resold without registration unless sold in accordance with certain resale restrictions. Affiliates for this purpose are generally considered to be officers, directors and principal shareholders. If Sunshine Financial meets specified current public information requirements, each affiliate of Sunshine Financial will be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a limited number of shares in any three-month period.
 The SEC has adopted regulations and policies under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that apply to Sunshine Financial as a registered company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The stated goals of these Sarbanes-Oxley requirements are to increase corporate responsibility, provide for enhanced penalties for accounting and auditing improprieties at publicly traded companies and to protect investors by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures pursuant to the securities laws. The SEC and Sarbanes-Oxley-related regulations and policies include very specific additional disclosure requirements and new corporate governance rules.
 Volcker Rule Regulations.  Regulations were adopted by the federal banking agencies to implement the provisions of the Dodd- Frank Act commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule.  The regulations contain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of FDIC-insured institutions and their holding companies and affiliates to engage in proprietary trading and to hold certain interests in, or to have certain relationships with, various types of investment funds, including hedge funds and private equity funds, and certain other investments, including certain collateralized mortgage obligations, collateralized debt obligations and 
 

 26
 



collateralized loan obligations and others.  We are currently in compliance with the various provisions of the Volcker Rule regulations.
 
Federal Taxation
 General.  Sunshine Financial and Sunshine Community Bank will be subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below.
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, Sunshine Financial and Sunshine Community Bank currently report their income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a fiscal year ending on December 31 for filing its federal income tax return.
 Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, called alternative minimum taxable income. The alternative minimum tax is payable to the extent such alternative minimum taxable income is in excess of the regular tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative minimum taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. We have not been subject to the alternative minimum tax, nor do we have any such amounts available as credits for carryover.
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may carryback net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. This provision applies to losses incurred in taxable years beginning after August 6, 1997.  At December 31, 2016, we had approximately $3.7 million in net operating loss carry forwards for federal income tax purposes.
 Corporate Dividends-Received Deduction.  Sunshine Financial has elected to file consolidated return with Sunshine Community Bank.  As a result, any dividends Sunshine Financial receives from Sunshine Community Bank will not be included as income to Sunshine Financial.  The corporate dividends-received deduction is 100%, or 80% in the case of dividends received from corporations with which a corporate recipient does not file a consolidated tax return, depending on the level of stock ownership of the payer of the dividend.
State Taxation
 Sunshine Community Bank is subject to a franchise tax imposed under Florida Statutes. For Florida, banks and savings associations pay a franchise tax measured by net income. This tax is imposed in lieu of the corporate income tax and is measured by net income of the bank or savings association for the tax year at a rate of 5.5%.
