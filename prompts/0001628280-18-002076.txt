Item 1. Business.
Overview
As the rise of new communication channels and ubiquitous access to information have made customer relationships increasingly complex, we believe that expanding beyond customer service to address customer journeys more broadly matters more than ever. Customers have individual channel preferences, and they want to be recognized across any and all channels they choose. To address these trends, organizations ranging from the smallest startups to the largest businesses must deliver the best omnichannel customer experience possible, from creating a more unified customer experience to simplifying the buying experience across products.
The Zendesk product family is purpose-built to unify disparate channels and departments and to simplify the process of providing great customer service, whether that is through self-service, a phone call, live chat, messaging, or a simple email. Our product family is built upon a modern architecture that enables us and our customers to rapidly innovate, adapt our technology in novel ways, and easily integrate with other products and applications. With our origins in customer service, we have evolved our offerings over time to help even the largest organizations understand their customers, improve communications across all channels, and engage where and when it’s needed most. 
We are a software development company founded in Copenhagen, Denmark in 2007. We reincorporated in Delaware in 2009. Our principal executive offices are located at 1019 Market Street, San Francisco, California 94103, and our telephone number is (415) 418-7506. Our website address is www.zendesk.com. Information contained on or that can be accessed through our website does not constitute part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and inclusions of our website address in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are inactive textual references only. Unless expressly indicated or the context requires otherwise, the terms “Zendesk,” “company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K refer to Zendesk, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries.
The Zendesk Approach
We believe that building software for the customer journey first requires an approach to both product design and delivery that is unified, unique, and innovative. As software continues to evolve to become central to the customer experience, we strive to design products which are proactive, contextual, and integrated by design. We believe in developing products that serve organizations of all sizes and across all industries. Our focus on these core principles has led us to design a family of products that share the following characteristics:

• | A unified omnichannel experience: Through our innovative products we seek to be channel agnostic, allowing even the largest organizations to transform how they engage with customers regardless of how and when those customers want to communicate. As we expand the reach of our technology, we recognize the critical importance of having our products work cohesively together. All of our products share a common interface and we are continuing to invest significantly in supporting our product family on a shared services platform.


• | Open and extendable: We view the internet as our platform and believe that all business applications should be able to connect and integrate with one another through standard protocols that are easily accessible. Zendesk products are built upon a foundation of open and powerful application program interfaces, or APIs, which enable them to integrate with each other and with outside services and applications. Our architecture seamlessly supports customizations, integrations, and the development of broadly available apps, and allows for our software to be embedded directly into other products, websites, and mobile applications.


• | Making analytics and data science accessible: We are committed to enabling organizations to better understand their customers through powerful analytics that unify the data across our product family and connect easily to outside data sources. We believe in our continued investment in building machine learning and artificial intelligence into the fabric of our products, empowering organizations to harness the power of data science and be more efficient, informed, and proactive with their customers.

We have witnessed business software undergo a dramatic shift toward consumerization over the past decade. Zendesk has embraced this shift with an approach to delivering its family of products that is dramatically different from earlier 
4

generations of business software. Our goal is to remove barriers that make business software difficult to buy, deploy, and use. Our approach to software delivery focuses on the following key elements:

• | Elastic and agile: Our software products can easily grow and scale with customers, and be used in new departments and use cases without the massive and expensive deployment projects required in the past. Zendesk products are flexible by design and easy to configure and use.


• | Trial experience: We believe customers should be able to try our products before they commit to a purchase. Our free trials are core to the marketing of all of our products. They offer our small and large customers alike with access to the same fully functioning product experience as paying customers and the ability to begin a complete implementation during the evaluation period.


• | Pay as you go: We offer our customers a wide variety of subscription plans for our products and flexible payment options that enable them to buy those products and with different agent levels without being locked-in. Each of our products has subscription plans that can be purchased online and deployed and modified without the need to engage sales or enablement professionals.

Growth Strategy
Zendesk was founded with a mission to help organizations build better relationships with their customers. We have continued to pursue that mission by focusing on building and delivering software for relationships first. We believe our future growth will be a natural extension of that mission, focusing on the following key growth drivers:

• | Building out an expansive and cohesive product family: Through our original product, Zendesk Support, we began to democratize customer service for organizations large and small, helping to reveal the opportunities that simplifying and improving customer experiences could provide. Our research and development efforts are highly focused on building on this success and expanding our product family to serve other aspects of the customer relationship. These will involve extending into areas of the customer experience beyond traditional customer support to help organizations better understand customer behavior and support proactive and predictive engagement. The extension of our product family will be supported by a continually evolving shared services platform that seeks to provide a unified view of the customer and unlock the possibilities of a truly seamless experience for organizations and their customers.


• | Enabling customer innovation: We have attracted some of the world’s most innovative companies across a broad range of industries to our family of products. We have seen our most forward-looking customers put a premium on their own customer relationships. Rather than viewing their customers as needing to be managed and automated, they focus on creating innovative customer experiences that are simple and effortless. Many of these organizations have taken advantage of the scalability and flexibility of our products, with subscription plans to suit any stage of business and operational maturity, and the capacity to grow easily into broader and more complex use cases. We also have invested in a highly extendable developer platform to drive further innovation through our technology. Through our powerful and open APIs, our substantial library of ready to deploy integrations, and embeddables that enable our software to run directly within our customers’ applications, we believe we will continue to empower our customers to develop new and innovative ways to transform customer experiences.


• | Expanding our markets: We have been built on the premise that our products should be easy to discover, deploy, and purchase so that any organization, from startup to large enterprise, can realize its value. That principle of democratizing software has developed into a highly efficient business model represented by short sales cycles, significant expansion within customer accounts, and organic growth through promotion by our customers. This model has enabled us to build a compelling brand and leadership position among both small-to-medium sized organizations and larger enterprises for which our ease of use, quick return on investment, and flexible pricing are important differentiators. Ultimately, we believe in closely working with a growing number of forward-thinking enterprises to implement this democratized approach and more broadly transform their customer experience across a broad range of potential use cases.

Zendesk has always served a global market and, for the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated 47% of our revenue outside of the United States. We will continue to expand our global footprint, particularly in those markets where we have demonstrated significant customer traction with our democratized approach or which represent particularly strategic opportunities.
The Zendesk Family of Products and Developer Platform
5

The Zendesk family of products is built to work together to help organizations understand and improve customer relationships. Zendesk products share a common interface and are being developed to support a shared services infrastructure and common customer data platform.
Zendesk’s products are developed using agile software techniques, and are designed to quickly incorporate and innovate on customer feedback obtained through extensive Early Access Programs, or EAPs. This approach allows us to share our newest technology with customers, and quickly adapt our products to address customer needs.
Our current family of products includes:

• | Zendesk Support, the flagship product in our family, is a beautifully simple system for tracking, prioritizing, and solving customer support tickets across multiple channels, bringing customer information and interactions into one place.


• | Zendesk Chat is live chat software that provides a fast and responsive way to connect with customers in the moment, on websites, in applications, and on mobile devices. Zendesk Message, available through Zendesk Chat, is customer messaging software that helps companies engage customers on their favorite messaging apps.


• | Zendesk Talk is cloud-based call center software for more personal and productive phone and SMS support conversations and enables organizations to provide phone support from the same platform they use to manage all other support channels.


• | Zendesk Guide is a knowledge base that powers both customer self-service and support agent productivity through content that is created and organized by companies. Guide content is available via self-service website, accessible through APIs on websites, in apps and mobile devices, and surfaced to agents within Zendesk Support and Zendesk Chat. Additionally, Answer Bot is a feature within Guide which uses machine learning to automatically answer customers’ questions by suggesting content from the Guide knowledge base.


• | Zendesk Explore, currently available through an EAP, powers analytics and unifies data for Zendesk’s products and a vast number of third-party sources. It makes customer data accessible across an organization, so organizations can measure and understand the entire customer experience.

Zendesk’s developer platform allows organizations to extend the functionality of our family of products, integrate into internal and third-party systems, and customize the experience for their employees and customers. Key components of Zendesk’s developer platform include:

• | Zendesk Embeddables, a combination of our APIs, Web Widget, and Mobile SDKs, allow developers to embed Zendesk Support, Chat, and Guide experiences natively on the web and within mobile applications.


• | Zendesk APIs are extensible and built on open standards, allowing users to build custom integrations and interact with Zendesk data using over 400 different API endpoints.


• | Zendesk Apps enable organizations to customize Zendesk product interfaces and optimize workflow through powerful plug-ins. Our customers can build custom apps or select from over 640 pre-built apps on the Zendesk App Marketplace.

Technology
We employ a modern technology architecture in which our products are built upon a set of core APIs that enable rapid innovation and deep integration. The technology infrastructure used for the Zendesk family of products is designed to provide a highly available and scalable cloud-based platform with industry-standard security measures. The architecture and deployment of our software are described and guided by the following key characteristics:

• | Reliability. Our customers are highly dependent on our products, which are designed to be available 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. We provide transparency to customers on availability and technical operations matters that impact them through our website and other channels.


• | Scalability. Our application infrastructure is highly scalable and regularly processes more than 100 million data driven requests that require the processing of specific data, on a daily basis.


• | Security. Each of our products are designed to host a large quantity of customer data. We maintain a comprehensive security program designed to help safeguard the security and integrity of our customers’ data. We regularly review our security program. In addition, we regularly obtain third-party security audits and examinations of our technical operations and practices covering data security.

6

Part of our evolving operations strategy is the continued refinement of our hosting infrastructure to optimize for reliability, performance, and cost. We provide our services through a combination of cloud infrastructure providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform and co-located managed data centers.
Customers
As of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of approximately 118,900 paid customer accounts using our family of products. This includes approximately 64,100 customer accounts for paid subscription plans for Zendesk Support (other than our legacy Starter plan) and approximately 47,000 customer accounts for paid subscription plans of Zendesk Chat. In addition, we had approximately 7,800 paid customer accounts on our other products, collectively, as of December 31, 2017.
Prior to purchase, we generally provide our prospective customers with the opportunity to try fully-functioning versions of our products for a free trial period. This is a central part of our business model as we believe customers should have the right to try products before being locked-into a subscription. Providing our customers with a free trial period exposes customers to our brand and establishes a relationship that can facilitate further adoption of our products as organizations grow in size and their needs become more complex.
Our customers are located in over 160 countries and territories and represent organizations across a broad array of sizes, industries, and geographies.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the development, design, and testing of all aspects of our products. We invest heavily in these efforts to continuously improve and innovate. In addition to our hosted software solution, we have developed multi-functional APIs that we utilize to build our products as well as facilitate integrations of our products with third-party applications.
Our global research and development team is primarily based in San Francisco, California; Copenhagen, Denmark; Melbourne, Australia; Dublin, Ireland; Singapore; Montpellier, France; and Metro Manila, Philippines. To foster rapid innovation, our research and development team is further apportioned into smaller, agile development teams.
We deploy new features, functionality, and technologies across our products through frequent software releases or updates in order to minimize disruption and provide for constant improvement.
To create a product roadmap that meets our customers’ needs, we emphasize collaboration during the development process. Customers provide input through feedback forums, dialogue with our product support and research and development teams, and feature utilization. As a result of using our products internally to support our customers, we also develop new or improved features based on our own employees’ feedback.
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 530 employees in our research and development organization. Our research and development expenses were $115.3 million, $91.1 million, and $62.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Sales and Marketing
Subscriptions to our products are designed to be easy to purchase. A substantial number of our customers subscribe to our products with limited or no direct interaction with our sales team.
We also deploy a direct sales approach, which includes a sales team based in four regional hubs: North America, LATAM (Latin America), EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa), and APAC (Asia-Pacific). This team manages prospective and current customers, aiming to initiate, retain, and expand their use of our family of products over time, and is responsible for driving expansions and renewals of existing contracts. Our sales team also partners with sales and product engineers to provide pre-sales technical support to prospective customers.
We expect to continue increasing penetration into larger organizations through a land and expand strategy whereby we attempt to capitalize on the use of our products by a functional or geographic department to expand the use of our products throughout the organization. Through our sales team, we also seek to discover and work with a growing number of forward-thinking enterprises on larger initiatives to transform their approach to customer experience.
7

We also utilize indirect sales channels, including referral partners and resellers, as well as implementation partners. These channel partners provide additional sales coverage, particularly in geographic markets where we may have limited presence, as well as implementation services to our customers. Sales from indirect channels have not been significant to date, but we plan to continue investing in these relationships to help us in certain markets and to complement our direct sales efforts.
Our marketing efforts are focused on generating awareness of our products, creating sales leads, nurturing prospective customers through the process of product discovery and evaluation, establishing and promoting our brand, and cultivating a community of successful and vocal customers. Based on our belief that the best method to sell subscriptions to our products is to provide customers with the opportunity to actively use and explore our products’ capabilities, one focus of our marketing team is to drive and encourage free trials and the successful conversion of free trials to paid subscriptions. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, display and video advertising, blogs, corporate communications, whitepapers, case studies, user events, conferences, and webinars.
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 660 employees in our sales and marketing organizations. Our sales and marketing expenses were $220.7 million, $167.0 million, and $114.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
Product Support, Customer Success, and Professional Services
We strive to exemplify the great customer service that organizations of all sizes can provide with our products by offering multi-channel service from our product support team, a rich self-help knowledge base with detailed product guides, and active community forums for agents, managers, and developers.
We offer different levels of product support based upon the subscription plans purchased by our customers. Regardless of the plan purchased, our products provide a unified intuitive interface, connectivity to our self-help knowledge base and community forums, and step-by-step tutorials to help users learn, use, and deploy our products effectively.
We additionally offer a variety of customer success initiatives aimed to address customer needs with varying levels of complexity, from our small business customers to even our largest enterprise customers. These initiatives are designed to ensure that our customers are best equipped to meet their business goals and to realize the full value of the implementation of our products.
Along with our global partners, our professional services team assists our customers in implementing more complex deployments of our products. These services include mapping our products to new and existing business processes, data migration, and integration with existing systems. Service engagements are typically scoped on a time and materials or project milestone basis and billed separately from the subscription to our products.
Through our training platform, we offer courses to help our customers quickly learn how to effectively use our products as well as implement best practices. Courses are available online, in-person at events, and, as requested by certain customers, on-site. Our training sessions are typically targeted at specific levels of employee seniority and product experience, such as agent essentials or administrator expert, to more effectively tailor training to intended audiences.
Seasonality
Historically, we have experienced the highest demand for our products and services in our fourth quarter, which we believe is a result of industry buying patterns. For a more detailed discussion of the seasonality impacting our business, see the “Seasonality” discussion in the "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
There are a number of established and emerging competitors in the broad market of customer engagement software. This market is fragmented, rapidly evolving, and highly competitive, with relatively low barriers to entry in some segments. We consider the principal competitive differentiators in our market to include:

• | Ease-of-deployment and use;


• | Time to value realization;


• | Enablement of customer communications across channels;


• | Availability of self-service options;

8


• | Data analytics and performance recommendations;


• | Mobile and multi-device capabilities;


• | Proactive outreach tools;


• | Customization and integration with third-party applications;


• | Brand recognition and thought leadership; and


• | Total cost of ownership for the customer (including software updates, ongoing maintenance, and consulting and system integration fees).

While we believe that we successfully compete with respect to these dynamics, given the large number, disparate sizes, and varying areas of focus of other companies with which we compete in the provision of customer engagement software, we may not always compare favorably with respect to some or all of the foregoing factors.
For small to medium-sized organizations, we often compete with general use computer applications and other tools that organizations have adapted for managing relationships with their customers, including shared accounts for email communication, phone banks for voice communication, and pen and paper, text editors, and spreadsheets for tracking and management. For larger organizations, we compete with custom software systems and large enterprise software vendors, including salesforce.com, Inc., Oracle Corporation, Microsoft Corporation, and ServiceNow, Inc. In addition, we compete with a number of other SaaS providers with focused applications competitive to one or more of our products, including applications developed by Freshworks, Inc. and desk.com (a salesforce.com service) that compete with Zendesk Support. Pricing pressures and increased competition generally could result in reduced sales, reduced margins, losses, or the failure of our family of products to achieve or maintain more widespread market acceptance, any of which could harm our business.
In order to maintain and improve our competitive position in the market, we remain focused in our development, operations, and sales and marketing efforts on the evolving customer service needs of all organizations.
Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business. 
We have developed a patent program, and a strategy to identify, apply for, and secure patents for innovative aspects of our platform and technology. We have two issued U.S. patents and ten U.S. patent applications pending. We intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost-effective.
We actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks, and domain names in the United States and in other key jurisdictions. We are the registered holder of a variety of United States and international domain names that include the term Zendesk or certain variations. Our products and services utilize our “Zendesk” trademark as well as our logo and images.
We also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. Though such third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available to us.
Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments, and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information, and all of our key employees and contractors have done so. In addition, we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our vendors and customers. We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of, our software, documentation, and other proprietary information. 
Although we rely on intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, a variety of contractual arrangements, and confidentiality procedures, we believe that factors such as the technical and creative skills of our personnel, development of new features and functionality, and frequent enhancements to our products are more fundamental to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Culture and Employees
As a company we are highly focused on our customers and their success. To support this focus, we highly value simplicity, agility, sincerity, as well as a sense of humor and humility often absent from enterprises that sell business software. 
9

These values guide our communication, work, and company culture and are a cornerstone of the team of employees that we have assembled and seek to develop. We are a global and diverse group of individuals that strive to balance work with play and that focus on big-scale thinking.
We believe strongly in our obligation to participate in and improve the communities in which we work and live. We do this by offering an active roster of corporate social responsibility engagements. In 2015, we launched the Zendesk Neighbor Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing financial and strategic support to organizations that operate near our offices around the world. We have committed to provide a $1 donation to the Zendesk Neighbor Foundation for every new agent added during their first year of a new paid subscription plan on either Zendesk Support or Chat. In addition to our extensive volunteer efforts, we have continued to offer workforce development and training, financial support for critical community programs, and promotion of local arts and culture, with the communities in which our offices are located and our employees live and work.
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 2,060 employees, including approximately 940 employees located outside the United States. Although we have statutory employee representation obligations in certain countries, our U.S. employees are not represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Regulatory Considerations
The legal environment of Internet-based businesses is evolving rapidly in the United States and elsewhere. The manner in which existing laws and regulations are applied in this environment, and how they will relate to our business in particular, both in the United States and internationally, is often unclear. For example, we sometimes cannot be certain which laws will be deemed applicable to us given the global nature of our business, including with respect to such topics as data privacy and security, pricing, credit card fraud, advertising, taxation, content regulation, and intellectual property ownership and infringement.
Our customers, and those with whom they communicate using our products, upload and store customer service and other data into our products and provide access to their data sources to our products, generally without any restrictions imposed by us. This presents legal challenges to our business and operations, such as rights of privacy related to the content loaded into our products. Both in the United States and internationally, we must monitor and comply with a host of legal concerns regarding the data stored and processed in our products as well as the operation of our business.
We are subject to data privacy and security regulation by data protection authorities in countries throughout the world, by the U.S. federal government, and by the states in which we conduct our business. In recent years, there have been a number of well-publicized data breaches involving the improper use and disclosure of personal information of individuals. Many governing authorities have responded to these incidents by enacting laws requiring holders of personal information to maintain safeguards and to take certain actions in response to a data breach, such as providing prompt notification of the breach to affected individuals and public officials or amending existing laws to expand compliance obligations. In the European Union, U.S. companies must meet specified privacy and security standards, such as the Directive 95/46/EC, or the Directive, and, upon its effectiveness in May 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which govern the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personally identifiable information, or PII, and on the free movement of such data established in the European Union to certain non-EU countries, such as the United States. Additionally, the data protection laws of each of the European Member countries require comprehensive information privacy and security protections for consumers with respect to PII collected about them. In February 2016, European Union and U.S. officials announced an agreement, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, or the Privacy Shield, as a means for legitimating the transfer of PII by U.S. companies doing business in Europe from the European Economic Area to the U.S. We have certified compliance with the Privacy Shield. In June 2017, we announced that we completed the EU approval process for our global Binding Corporate Rules ("BCRs") as a data processor and controller. This significant regulatory approval validated our implementation of the highest possible standards for protecting PII globally, covering both the PII of our customers and employees. We have and expect to continue to engage in efforts to ensure that data transfers from the European Economic Area comply with the Directive, the GDPR, the Privacy Shield, our BCRs, and the data protection legislation of individual member states.
