ITEM 1.  BUSINESS.
Company History
 
Vican Resources, Inc. (hereafter, “we”, “our”, “us”, or the “Company”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 5, 2002. From July 2009 until May 2011, we operated as a real estate services firm, seeking to capitalize on the real estate opportunities resulting from the dislocation in the credit markets, and by extension, the multifamily housing market, by acquiring, rehabilitating, stabilizing and selling distressed multifamily properties in the southern United States, predominantly in Texas.
 
On May 26, 2011, we changed our business when we sold our real estate services division and acquired all of the outstanding shares of Vican Trading, Inc., a Montreal-based purchaser and seller of metals, ores, and other commodities (hereafter, “Vican Trading”). Upon the acquisition of Vican Trading, there was an implied option for either party to rescind the original acquisition. During the year that option was exercised and on December 20, 2011, we again changed our business when we unwound the acquisition of Vican Trading and acquired all of the assets of Med Ex Direct, Inc., a Florida-based provider of management services in respect of the distribution of diabetic supplies, principally to Hispanic patients (hereafter, “Med Ex Florida”). On March 21-22, 2012, we again changed our business to become an oil & gas exploration, development, and distribution company when we unwound the purchase of the assets of Med Ex Florida and acquired three separate working interests in two oil & gas wells located in Jefferson County, Mississippi.
 
Operations
 
Until May 2011, we operated as a real estate investment services and management company focusing on distressed multifamily properties in select U.S. markets. We managed limited partnerships that invest in residential multifamily real property in the southern United States and we received management fees and carried interests from the operations, sale or refinancing of these properties. We also managed the tenancy, redevelopment, and repairs of these properties through the Company or an affiliate from which we also received fees and other compensation. Our future business is based on the exploration, development, drilling, and production of various oil and gas properties. We expect to align with industry partners in respect of the drilling and operation of these wells. Our long-term focus is to grow and develop existing oil and gas leasehold interests and acquire new interests within and without the continental United States. In addition, we intend to acquire interests in older wells that, with the application of newer technologies, may increase production and reserves.
Market
 
Generally. Global demand for energy continues to grow, especially in developing countries such as China and India, as the oil and gas industry continues to search for new sources of energy. Increasingly, oil and gas are found in challenging areas, such as deep water, arctic regions and politically challenged regions of the world. For the past five years, however, the headline for the industry has been the dramatic development of unconventional oil and gas in the U.S., such as shale gas and tight oil. Unlocked by technological advancements, development of these resources continues to change the global landscape of oil and gas. The downturn in commodity prices which began in late 2014 has had a significant negative effect on shale oil and gas producers, which has continued to the present.

The oil and gas industry is highly susceptible to extreme fluctuations in energy-related commodity prices, which in turn has a corresponding effect on the level of drilling and exploration activity and the costs associated therewith. Such volatility is also represented in the trends, however disparate, of supplies, demand, and price movements of crude oil and natural gas. Due to the global recession, oil and gas revenues were moderate in 2013 and 2014 and curtailed sharply in late 2014 due to the steep drop in oil and gas prices. Nevertheless, the EIA projects that despite lower crude oil prices, U.S. crude oil production is expected to grow in 2016 to meet with moderately rising global demand.
 
Crude Oil. Despite the recent decline in oil prices, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) still projects global oil production will grow significantly in 2016. As energy prices begin to recover, U.S. oil production is projected to grow by 1.1 million barrels a day, while Brazilian and Canadian production together is expected to grow by 200,000 barrels a day, with North Sea and Saudi production declining by 300,000 barrels a day. According to data in the EIA's Drilling Productivity Report, 70 percent of new production in the Bakken shale, and 77 percent of new production in the Eagle Ford shale, will be needed just to make up for the decline of rapidly depleting legacy wells, and unless drilling rates increase substantially from current levels, supply growth is set to moderate considerably.
Natural Gas. Unlike crude oil, the natural gas market has suffered from a glut of excess production and protracted price declines. However, the EIA recently adjusted its price forecasts for natural gas from $4.44 per million British thermal units this year and $4.14 in 2015, from its previous estimates of $4.17 and $4.11, due to a winter of prolonged, widespread, bitter cold weather throughout much of the United States which led to a record-breaking natural gas withdrawal season in 2014, bringing inventories of natural gas to a 11-year low. In 2015, total natural gas consumption declined as lower residential and commercial consumption offset increases in the electric power and industrial sectors. Increased government regulation and requirements associated with natural gas development (specifically hydraulic fracturing) remains a constant concern affecting pricing and industry forecasts.
Regulation
 
Federal and state regulations control various aspects of drilling and operating oil and gas wells, including care of the environment, the safety of workers and the public, and the relations with the owners and occupiers of surface lands within or near the leasehold acreage. The effect of these regulations is, invariably, to increase the cost of operations. The costs of compliance with state regulations include a permit for drilling a well before beginning a project. Other compliance matters have to do with keeping the property free of oil spills and the plugging of non-productive wells.
 
Oil and gas exploration, drilling, and production activities are also subject to private property rights. Owners of real property also own the rights to the minerals underneath the surface, unless such mineral rights have been sold or transferred by a previous landowner. Oil and gas rights held by the United States government are managed by the Bureau of Land Management in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service pursuant to a variety of federal statutes.
 
Environmental impacts of oil and gas production include produced water and drilling waste. Wastes that cannot be reused or recycled must be stored or disposed of in some manner, increasing the land area affected by oil and gas extraction and raising concerns over potential leaking of drilling fluids and other wastes from storage sites. Some petroleum industry operations have been responsible for water pollution through by-products of refining and oil spills. The combustion of fossil fuels produces greenhouse gases and other air pollutants as byproducts. Pollutants include nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and heavy metals.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had 1 employee, although we intend to hire additional personnel in the future to pursue our business plan. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants, contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.
