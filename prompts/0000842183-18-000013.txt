Item 1. Business
The terms “Company,” “we,” “our,” or “us” refer to Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust, Ramco-Gershenson Properties, L.P., and/or its subsidiaries, as the context may require.
General
Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust is a premier, national publicly-traded shopping center real estate investment trust (REIT) based in Farmington Hills, Michigan. The Company’s primary business is the ownership and management of regional town centers and urban-infill properties in key growth sub-markets in the 40 largest metropolitan markets in the United States.  Our target submarkets are affluent communities where our centers can offer value, variety, convenience, entertainment, and an experience for the consumer. 
As of December 31, 2017, our property portfolio consisted of 56 wholly-owned shopping centers comprised of approximately 13.5 million square feet.  We also have ownership interests of 7%, 20%, 30%, and 30% in four joint ventures. Our joint ventures are reported using the equity method of accounting.  We earn fees from certain of these joint ventures for managing, leasing and redeveloping the shopping centers they own.  In addition, we own various parcels of land available for development or for sale, the majority of which are adjacent to certain of our existing developed properties.
We conduct substantially all of our business through our operating partnership, Ramco-Gershenson Properties, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership” or “OP”), a Delaware limited partnership.  The Operating Partnership, either directly or indirectly through partnerships or limited liability companies, holds fee title to all owned properties.  As the sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, we have the exclusive power to manage and conduct the business of the Operating Partnership.  As of December 31, 2017, we owned approximately 97.7% of the Operating Partnership.  The interests of the limited partners are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements and the limited partners are generally individuals or entities that contributed interests in certain assets or entities to the Operating Partnership in exchange for units of limited partnership interest (“OP Units”).  The holders of OP units are entitled to exchange them for our common shares on a 1:1 basis or for cash.  The form of payment is at our election.
We operate in a manner intended to qualify as a REIT pursuant to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”).  Certain of our operations, including property and asset management, as well as ownership of certain land parcels, are conducted through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”), which are subject to federal and state income taxes.

Business Objectives, Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our business objective is to own and manage market dominant shopping centers that generate cash flow for distribution to our shareholders and that have the potential for capital appreciation.  To achieve this objective, we seek to acquire, develop, or redevelop shopping centers that meet our investment criteria.  We also seek to recycle capital through the sale of land or shopping centers that we deem to be fully valued or that no longer meet our investment criteria.  We use debt, equity and operating cash flow to finance our activities and focus on managing the amount, structure and terms of our debt to limit the risks inherent in debt financing.  From time to time, we enter into joint venture arrangements where we believe we can benefit by owning a partial interest in shopping centers and by earning fees for managing the centers for our partners.
We invest primarily in regional town centers and urban-infill properties that include national chain store tenants, market leading supermarket tenants, as well as a strong line-up of smaller national retailers to optimize the overall merchandise mix. Our centers also include entertainment components, including theaters, fitness centers and restaurants, which, in addition to supermarkets, are daily drivers of consumer traffic at our properties.  National chain anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, TJ Maxx/Marshalls, Bed Bath and Beyond, Dick's Sporting Goods, and Home Depot.  Supermarket anchor tenants in our centers include, among others, Publix Super Market, Whole Foods, Kroger, Aldi, and Sprouts.  Theater, fitness and restaurant tenants include, among others, Regal Cinema, LA Fitness, Starbucks, Panera, and Rusty Bucket. Our shopping centers are primarily located in metropolitan markets such as Metro Detroit, Southeast Florida, Greater Denver, Cincinnati, St. Louis, Jacksonville, Tampa/Lakeland, Milwaukee, Chicago, Atlanta, and Minneapolis - St. Paul.
We also own land which is available for development or sale.  At December 31, 2017, the three largest development sites, Hartland Towne Square, Lakeland Park Center and Parkway Shops, had phase one completed. We estimate that if we proceed with the development of the projects, up to approximately 510,000 square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA") could be developed, excluding various out parcels of land. It is our policy to start vertical construction on new development projects only after the project has received entitlements, significant anchor commitments and construction financing, if appropriate.
Our development and construction activities are subject to risks and uncertainties such as our inability to obtain the necessary governmental approvals for a project, our determination that the expected return on a project is not sufficient to warrant continuation of the planned development or our change in plan or scope for the development.  If any of these events occur, we may record an impairment provision.
Operating Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our operating objective is to maximize the risk-adjusted return on invested capital at our shopping centers.  We seek to do so by increasing the property operating income of our centers, controlling our capital expenditures, monitoring our tenants’ credit risk and taking actions to mitigate our exposure to that tenant credit risk.
During 2017, our consolidated properties reported the following leasing activity:

 | Leasing Transactions | Square Footage | Base Rent/SF (1) | | Prior Rent/SF(2) | | Tenant Improvements/SF(3) | | Leasing Commissions/SF | 
Renewals | 162 | 949,579 | $ | 16.12 | | $ | 15.00 | | $ | 0.66 | | $ | 0.15
New Leases - Comparable | 24 | 123,618 | 19.38 | | 16.42 | | 23.84 | | 4.15 | 
New Leases - Non-Comparable (4) | 51 | 287,877 | 12.40 | | N/A | | 35.73 | | 5.01 | 
Total | 237 | 1,361,074 | $ | 15.63 | | N/A | | $ | 10.18 | | $ | 1.54 | 

(1) Base rent/sf (square foot) represents contractual minimum rent under the new lease for the first 12 months of the term.
(2) Prior rent represents minimum rent, if any, paid by the prior tenant in the final 12 months of the term.
(3) Includes tenant improvement cost, tenant allowances, and landlord costs. Excludes first generation space and new leases related to development and redevelopment activity.
(4) Non-comparable lease transactions include leases for space vacant for greater than 12 months, leases for space which has been combined from smaller spaces or demised from larger spaces and leases structured differently from the prior lease. As a result, there is no comparable prior rent per square foot to compare to the base rent per square foot of the new lease.

Investing Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our investing objective is to generate an attractive risk-adjusted return on capital invested in acquisitions, developments, and redevelopments.  In addition, we seek to sell land or shopping centers that we deem to be fully valued or that no longer meet our investment criteria.  We underwrite acquisitions based upon current cash flow, projections of future cash flow and scenario analyses that take into account the risks and opportunities of ownership.  We underwrite development of new shopping centers on the same basis, but also take into account the unique risks of entitling land, constructing buildings and leasing newly built space.  
In February 2017, we acquired Providence Marketplace, a 632,000 square foot shopping center in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee and Webster Place, a 135,000 square foot shopping center in Chicago, Illinois for $115.1 million and $53.2 million, respectively. In addition, we sold eleven shopping centers and several land outparcels for gross proceeds of $229.0 million. Refer to Note 4 for additional information related to acquisitions and dispositions.
At December 31, 2017, we had seven redevelopment, expansion or re-anchoring projects in process with an anticipated cost of $73.7 million, of which $33.9 million remained to be invested. Completion dates are anticipated throughout 2018.
Financing Strategies and Significant Transactions
Our financing objective is to maintain a strong and flexible balance sheet to ensure access to capital at a competitive cost.  In general, we seek to increase our financial flexibility by increasing our pool of unencumbered properties and borrowing on an unsecured basis.  In keeping with our objective, we routinely benchmark our balance sheet on a variety of measures to our peers in the shopping center sector and to REITs in general.  
Specifically, we completed the following financing transactions:
Debt
During 2017, we amended and restated our $350.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that extended the maturity date from October 2018 to September 2021, we amended and repriced our $75.0 million term loan due in 2021 by reducing the interest rate 35 basis points, we issued $75.0 million in senior unsecured notes in three tranches with a weighted average interest rate of 4.46%, and we repaid $49.2 million in mortgage notes. Refer to Note 8 for additional information related to our debt.
Equity
In June 2016, we terminated our previous controlled equity offering arrangement and commenced a new distribution agreement that registered up to 8.0 million common shares for issuance from time to time, in our sole discretion. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not issue any common shares through either arrangement. The shares issuable in the new distribution agreement are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") on our registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-211925).
As of December 31, 2017 we had net debt to total market capitalization of 43.5% as compared to 41.0%, at December 31, 2016.  At December 31, 2017 and 2016 we had $318.7 million and $263.5 million, respectively, available to draw under our unsecured revolving line of credit, subject to compliance with applicable covenants.
Competition
See page 6 of Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a description of competitive conditions in our business.
Environmental Matters
See page 12 of Item 1A. "Risk Factors" for a description of environmental risks for our business.
Employment
As of December 31, 2017, we had 122 full-time employees. None of our employees is represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe that our relations with our employees are good.
