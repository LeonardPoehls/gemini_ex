ITEM 1. BUSINESS
(All dollar amounts are presented in millions, unless otherwise noted)
Advanced Disposal Services, Inc. (hereafter referred to as the "Company") is a leading integrated provider of non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services operating primarily in secondary markets or under exclusive arrangements. We have a presence in 16 states across the Midwest, South and East regions of the United States as well as in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas, serving approximately 2.8 million residential customers and over 200,000 commercial and industrial ("C&I") customers through our extensive network of 93 collection operations, 73 transfer stations, 22 owned or operated recycling facilities and 40 owned or operated active landfills. Our headquarters are located in Ponte Vedra, Florida.
Our Strategy
We seek to drive financial performance in markets in which we own or operate a landfill or in certain disposal-neutral markets, where the landfill is owned by a municipality. In markets in which we own or operate a landfill, we aim to create and maintain vertically integrated operations through which we manage a majority of our customers' waste from the point of collection through the point of disposal, a process we refer to as internalization. By internalizing a majority of the waste in these markets, we are able to deliver high quality customer service while also ensuring a stable revenue stream and maximizing profitability and cash flow from operations. In disposal-neutral markets, we focus selectively on opportunities where we can negotiate exclusive arrangements with a municipal owned disposal site, facilitating highly-efficient and profitable collection operations with lower capital requirements. Geographically, we focus our business principally in secondary, or less densely populated non-urban, markets where the presence of large national providers is generally more limited. We also compete selectively in primary, or densely populated urban, markets where we can capitalize on opportunities for vertical integration through our high-quality transfer and disposal infrastructure and where we can benefit from highly-efficient collection route density.
Operations
Our vertically integrated environmental services operations can be broadly classified into three lines of business: (i) collection services; (ii) disposal services, which include transfer stations and landfills; and (iii) recycling services. The solid waste management business is locally executed where the geographic footprint, density of collection routes, degree of vertical integration, and regional demographic trends drive success. We serve both primary (densely populated) and secondary (less populated) markets. While primary markets typically offer highly efficient route densities, secondary markets provide other important advantages, such as less large national provider presence, greater opportunities to gain market share through new business and consolidation, and generally higher and more stable pricing.
Our operations are managed through three regional offices located in the South, Midwest and East regions of the United States. Each of the regions has a diversified portfolio of collection, transfer, landfill and recycling operations. The collection, transfer, landfill, and recycling operations within each of these operating regions are supervised by regional vice presidents with extensive experience in growing, operating and managing solid waste management companies within their local markets. Each regional vice president works with and supervises several district and general managers who manage facilities and operations.
The services we provide include non-hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services for residential, commercial and industrial customers, as described below. The following table shows revenues contributed by these services for each of the three years presented:

 | Year ended December 31,
 | 2017 | | 2016 | | 2015

Collection Services
We serve approximately 2.8 million residential customers, over 200,000 C&I customers and over 800 municipalities through our 93 collection operations. We internalized 63% of the waste collected into our own landfills for the year ended December 31, 2017. A total of 18% of our routed fleet uses compressed natural gas ("CNG"), which significantly reduces carbon emissions compared to diesel-fueled collection trucks. A total of 57% of our routed residential collection fleet uses automated side load trucks, which helps to reduce employee injuries. Collection revenue represents approximately 68% of our overall revenue.
Our residential collection operations consist of curbside collection of residential refuse from small carts or containers into collection vehicles for transport to a disposal/recycling site. These services are typically performed either under long-term contracts with local government entities or on a subscription basis, whereby individual households contract directly with us for our collection services. Our municipal residential contracts generally allow for annual rate increases.
We generally secure our contracts with municipalities through a competitive bid process and such contracts give us exclusive rights to service all or a portion of the homes in the respective municipalities. These contracts generally range in term from three to ten years. Municipal contracts can be designed as either mandatory or non-mandatory franchises. Mandatory franchises allow us to become the exclusive provider of waste management services for the areas of the municipality included in the contract, which requires all residential customers within those areas to use our services for solid waste collection and disposal. Non-mandatory franchises allow us to retain the exclusive right to service the specified areas of the municipality, with no competitor permitted to offer services to residential customers, but residential customers may choose not to use our services.
The fees that we receive for residential collection on an individual subscription basis are based primarily on market factors, frequency and type of service, the distance to the disposal facility and the cost of disposal. In general, subscription residential collection fees are paid quarterly or monthly in advance by the residential customers receiving the service and other residential services are paid in arrears. Residential revenue represents approximately 39% of our collection revenue.
For C&I operations, we supply our customers with waste containers suitable for their needs and rent or sell compactors to large waste generators. Standard service agreements with C&I customers are typically three to five years in length with pricing based on estimated disposal weight and time required to service the account. We generally bill commercial customers monthly in advance. Industrial customers are generally billed in arrears for our services. The customer generally may not cancel C&I standard service agreements for a period of five years from the start of service without incurring a cancellation penalty. In addition, contracts typically are renewed automatically unless the customer specifically requests cancellation. Our standard C&I service contracts generally allow for rate increases and represent approximately 37% of our overall collection revenue.
Our construction and demolition ("C&D") waste services provide C&D sites with rolloff containers and waste collection, transportation and disposal services. C&D services are typically provided pursuant to arrangements in which the customer provides 24-hour advance notice of its disposal needs and is billed on a "per pull" plus disposal basis. While the majority of our rolloff services are provided to customers under long-term contracts, we generally do not enter into contracts with our C&D customers that utilize temporary rolloff containers due to the relatively short-term nature of most C&D projects. Our temporary rolloff customers pay us in arrears for our services. Our construction and demolition ("C&D") waste services represent approximately 24% of our overall collection revenue.
Disposal Services
Landfill disposal services represent the final stage in our vertically integrated waste collection and disposal services solution. We own or operate 33 active municipal solid waste ("MSW") landfills, and 7 active C&D landfills as of December 31, 2017, enabling us to offer comprehensive service to our customers. For the year ended December 31, 2017, our landfills accepted 16.8 million tons of waste. We charge tipping fees to third parties. Third party disposal revenue represents approximately 18% of our overall revenue.
As of December 31, 2017, our landfills had approximately 351.3 million cubic yards of utilized airspace and total permitted and deemed permitted airspace of approximately 990.9 million cubic yards. Our active landfills that are currently accepting waste have an average of 36.7 years of aggregate remaining permitted and deemed permitted life. The in-place capacity of our landfills is subject to change based on engineering factors, requirements of regulatory authorities, our ability to continue to operate our landfills in compliance with applicable regulations and our ability to successfully renew operating permits and obtain expansion permits at our sites. Some of our landfills accept non-hazardous special waste, including utility ash, asbestos and contaminated soils.
6

We monitor the availability of permitted disposal capacity at each of our landfills and evaluate whether to pursue an expansion at a given landfill based on estimated future waste volumes and prices, market needs, remaining capacity and the likelihood of obtaining an expansion. To satisfy future disposal demand, we are currently seeking to expand permitted capacity at 15 of our landfills and we may seek expanded permitted capacity at other landfills in the future. However, we cannot assure you that all proposed or future expansions will be permitted as designed.
We also have responsibility for 3 C&D and 2 MSW closed landfills, for which we have associated closure and post-closure obligations. The post-closure period generally runs for 30 years after final site closure for landfills. 
As part of our vertically integrated solid waste disposal services, we operate 73 transfer stations. Transfer stations receive, consolidate and transfer solid waste to landfills and recycling facilities. Transfer stations enable us to:


• | increase the operational reach of our landfill operations;


• | increase the volume of disposal revenue at our landfills;


• | achieve greater leverage in negotiating more favorable disposal rates at landfills that we do not operate;


• | improve efficiency of collection, personnel and equipment; and


• | build relationships with municipalities and other operators that deliver waste to our transfer stations, leading to additional growth and acquisition opportunities.

Revenue at transfer stations is primarily generated by charging tipping or disposal fees. Our collection operations deposit waste at these transfer stations, as do other private and municipal haulers, for compaction and transfer to disposal sites or material recycling facilities ("MRFs"). Transfer stations provide collection operations with a cost-effective means to consolidate waste and reduce transportation costs while providing our landfill sites with an additional “gate” to extend the geographic reach of a particular landfill site with the goal of increased internalization.
Recycling Services
We are focused on opportunistically developing our base of recycling facilities. There has been a growing interest in recycling, which is driven by public and private markets that are placing environmental stewardship as a top priority. This is evidenced by requests for proposals that incorporate alternate methods to manage the collection, processing and disposal of waste. 
We have a network of 22 recycling facilities that we manage or operate. These facilities generate revenue through the collection, processing and sale of old corrugated cardboard, old newspaper, mixed paper, aluminum, glass and other materials. These recyclable materials are internally collected by our residential, commercial and industrial collection operations as well as third-party haulers.
Fuel and Environmental Charges
The amounts charged for collection, disposal, transfer, and recycling services may include fuel charges and environmental charges. Fuel charges and environmental charges are not designed to be specific to the direct costs to service an individual customer’s account, but rather are designed to help recover changes in our overall cost structure and to achieve an acceptable operating margin.
Other Services
Other revenue is comprised of ancillary revenue-generating activities, such as landfill gas-to-energy operations at MSW landfills, management of third-party owned landfills, customer service charges relating to overdue payments and customer administrative fees relating to customers who request paper copies of invoices rather than opting for electronic invoices, and broker revenue.
Customers
We provide services to a broad base of commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. No single customer individually accounted for more than 2% of our consolidated revenue in fiscal 2017.
Competition
Although we operate in a highly competitive industry, entry into our business and the ability to operate profitably requires substantial amounts of capital and managerial experience. Competition in the non-hazardous solid waste industry comes from a few large, national publicly owned companies, several regional publicly and privately owned solid waste companies, and thousands of small privately owned companies. In any given market, competitors may have larger operations and greater resources. In addition to national and regional firms and numerous local companies, we compete with municipalities that maintain waste collection or disposal operations. These municipalities may have financial advantages due to the availability of tax revenue and tax-exempt financing.
7

We compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and the quality of our services. From time to time, our competitors reduce the price of their services in an effort to expand market share or to win a competitively bid municipal contract. Our ability to maintain and increase prices in certain markets may be impacted by our competitors’ pricing policies. This may have an impact on our future revenue and profitability.
Seasonality and Severe Weather
Based on historic trends, we expect our operating results to vary seasonally, with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter, higher in the second and third quarters, and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters. This seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall, winter and early spring because of decreased construction and demolition activities during the winter months in the U.S. and reduced drilling activity during harsh weather conditions. Conversely, mild winter weather conditions may reduce demand for oil and natural gas, which may cause some of our mining and exploration customers to curtail their drilling programs, which could result in production of lower volumes of waste.
Adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities, resulting in higher labor and operational costs. Greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected waste, resulting in higher disposal costs, which are calculated on a per ton basis and increased leachate disposal costs. Certain destructive weather conditions that tend to occur during the second half of the year, such as hurricanes that most often impact the South region, can increase the Company’s revenues in the areas affected. While weather-related and other occurrences can boost revenues through additional work, the earnings generated can be moderated as a result of higher labor costs and other factors, resulting in earnings at comparatively lower margins. These destructive weather conditions can result in higher fuel costs, higher labor costs, reduced municipal contract productivity and higher disposal costs in disposal neutral markets. These factors impact period-to-period comparisons of financial results.
Regulation
Our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of federal, state and local requirements that regulate the environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use. Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals are required for landfills and transfer stations, recycling facilities, certain solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other facilities that we own or operate. These permits are subject to denial, revocation, suspension, modification and renewal in certain circumstances. Federal, state and local laws and regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict powers of enforcement, which include the ability to revoke or decline to renew environmental or other permits, obtain injunctions, or impose fines or penalties in the event of violations, including criminal penalties. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and various other federal, state and local authorities administer these regulations.
We strive to conduct our operations in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits. However, from time to time we have been issued notices and citations from governmental authorities that have resulted in fines, penalties, the need to expend funds for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, remedial work and related activities at various landfills and other facilities. We cannot assure you that citations and notices will not be issued in the future or that any such notice or citation will not have a material effect on our operations or results.
Federal Regulation
The following summarizes the primary federal environmental and occupational health and safety-related statutes that affect our facilities and operations:

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), as amended, regulates handling, transporting and disposing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and delegates authority to states to develop programs to ensure the safe disposal of solid waste. In 1991, the EPA issued its final regulations under Subtitle D of RCRA, which set forth minimum federal performance and design criteria for solid waste landfills. These regulations are typically implemented by the states, although states can impose requirements that are more stringent than the Subtitle D standards. Occasionally, the condensates or other materials generated during our operations may be classified as a "regulated hazardous waste," and require special handling, transport and treatment. As a result, some of our operations are subject to RCRA, and comparable state laws, which impose requirements for the handling, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste. Owners and operators of facilities that generate hazardous waste must obtain an EPA ID number and comply with generator requirements, including proper containerization, storage, handling, transportation and disposal. RCRA also imposes extensive recordkeeping and reporting obligations. We incur costs in complying with these standards in the ordinary course of our operations.

The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, ("CERCLA") which is also known as Superfund, provides for authorized federal authorities to respond directly to releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances into the environment that have created actual or potential environmental hazards. CERCLA's primary means for addressing such releases is to impose strict liability for cleanup of certain contaminated or disposal sites upon current and former site owners and operators, generators of the hazardous substances at the site and transporters who selected the disposal site and transported substances thereto. Liability under CERCLA is strict, joint and several and not dependent on the intentional release of hazardous substances; it can be based upon the release or threatened release, even as a result of lawful, unintentional and non-negligent action, of hazardous substances as the term is defined by CERCLA and other applicable statutes and regulations. The EPA may issue orders requiring responsible parties to perform response actions at sites, or the EPA may seek recovery of funds expended or to be expended in the future at sites. Liability may include contribution for cleanup costs incurred by a defendant in a CERCLA civil action or by an entity that has previously resolved its liability to federal or state regulators in an administrative or judicially-approved settlement. Liability under CERCLA could also include obligations to a potentially responsible party that voluntarily expends site clean-up costs. Further, liability for damage to publicly-owned natural resources may also be imposed. We are subject to potential liability under CERCLA as an owner or operator of facilities at which hazardous substances have been disposed and as an arranger, generator or transporter of hazardous substances disposed of at other locations.
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended, known as the Clean Water Act, regulates the discharge of pollutants into streams, rivers, groundwater, or other surface waters from a variety of sources, including solid and hazardous waste disposal sites. If run-off from our operations may be discharged into surface waters, the Clean Water Act requires us to apply for and obtain discharge permits, conduct sampling and monitoring, and, under certain circumstances, reduce the quantity of pollutants in those discharges. In 1990, the EPA issued additional standards for management of storm water runoff that require landfills and other waste-handling facilities to obtain storm water discharge permits. In addition, if a landfill or other facility discharges wastewater through a sewage system to a publicly-owned treatment works, the facility must comply with discharge limits imposed by the treatment works. Also, before the development or expansion of a landfill can alter or affect wetlands, a permit may have to be obtained providing for mitigation or replacement wetlands. The Clean Water Act provides for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for violations of its provisions.
The Clean Air Act provides for increased federal, state and local regulation of the emission of air pollutants. Certain of our operations are subject to the requirements of the Clean Air Act, including large MSW landfills and landfill gas-to-energy facilities. In 1996 the EPA issued new source performance standards (“NSPS”) and emission guidelines (“EG”) controlling landfill gases from new and existing large landfills. In January 2003, the EPA issued Maximum Achievable Control Technology (“MACT”) standards for MSW landfills subject to the NSPS. These regulations impose limits on air emissions from large MSW landfills, subject most of our large MSW landfills to certain operating permit requirements under Title V of the Clean Air Act and, in many instances, require installation of landfill gas collection and control systems to control emissions or to treat and utilize landfill gas on- or off-site. The EPA entered into a settlement agreement with the Environmental Defense Fund to evaluate the 1996 NSPS for new landfills as required by the Clean Air Act every eight years and revise them if deemed necessary. The EPA issued a new NSPS rule in fiscal 2016. In May 2017, EPA issued a 90-day administrative stay of these new NSPS rules, but after environmental groups challenged the stay in the D.C. Court of Appeals, EPA decided not to further extend the stay. The new NSPS rule applies to landfills constructed or modified after July 17, 2014, and imposes requirements on independent operators of landfill gas and renewable natural gas facilities. We assessed the capital and operating cost impact to our operations of the new NSPS rule. The regulatory changes did not have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole.
In 2010, the EPA issued the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) and Title V Green House Gases (“GHG”) Tailoring Rule, which expanded the EPA’s federal air permitting authority to include the six GHGs, including methane and carbon dioxide. The rule sets new thresholds for GHG emissions that define when Clean Air Act permits are required. The requirements of these rules have not significantly affected our operations or cash flows, due to the tailored thresholds and exclusions of certain emissions from regulation.
In June 2014, however, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a decision that significantly limited the applicability and scope of EPA permitting requirements for GHGs from stationary sources, concluding that the EPA may not treat GHGs as an air pollutant for purposes of determining whether a source is required to obtain a PSD or Title V permit, although the court also concluded that the EPA can continue to require that PSD permits, which are otherwise required based on emissions of conventional pollutants, contain limitations on GHG emissions based on Best Available Control Technology. In November 2014, the EPA issued a policy memorandum advising that it intends to propose exempting biogenic carbon dioxide emissions from waste-derived feedstocks (MSW and landfill gas) from PSD and Title V air permitting. The EPA based this proposal on the rationale that those emissions are likely to have minimal or no net atmospheric contributions, or even reduce such impacts, when compared to an alternate method of disposal. In August 2017, EPA’s Science Advisory Board announced in the Federal Register a public meeting to discuss a draft report on the November 2014 policy memorandum. As a result of this U.S. Supreme Court ruling and EPA 
9

policy action, the anticipated impact of the PSD and Title V GHG Tailoring Rule on our air permits, compliance and results of operations is not expected to have a material impact on our operations or results.
On August 3, 2015, the EPA published the final Clean Power Plan setting C02 emission performance standards for affected electric generating units and requiring states to submit State Implementation Plans for reducing GHG emissions from affected sources and for meeting their C02 emission reduction goals. At the time, the Clean Power Plan contemplated that states may choose to meet their emission reduction obligations through a variety of measures including landfill gas. The final Clean Power Plan and the Proposed Federal Implementation Plan notes that states may choose to rely on waste derived biogenic feedstocks in their future proposed compliance plans, which, if it went forward, could create new or expanded opportunities for renewable energy projects.
There is a great deal of uncertainty, however, regarding the fate of the Clean Power Plan and, more broadly, the future of the regulation of GHG emissions from electric generating units. On February 10, 2016, the Supreme Court granted a petition to stay the plan pending the resolution of challenges being heard in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed an executive order that called for the review of the plan. In October 2017, the EPA took the first administrative steps to repeal the plan, and, in December 2017, the EPA announced it would also replace the plan. It is anticipated that the EPA’s efforts to repeal and replace the Clean Power Plan will be challenged by various states and environmental groups. At this time, it is unclear to us whether the Clean Power Plan will be implemented or effectively repealed and replaced, what the provisions of any replacement might require, and how any replacement might treat waste derived biogenic feedstocks or otherwise impact our business.
Other recent final and proposed rules to increase the stringency of certain National Ambient Air Quality Standards, such as the Ozone rule promulgated in October 2015, and related PSD increment/significance thresholds could affect the cost, timeliness and availability of air permits for new and modified large MSW landfills and landfill gas to energy facilities. In general, controlling emissions involves installing collection wells in a landfill and routing the gas to a suitable energy recovery system or combustion device. As of December 31, 2017, we owned five landfill gas to energy facilities and we had eleven active projects at solid waste landfills where landfill gas is captured and utilized for its renewable energy value rather than flared. Efforts to curtail the emission of GHGs and to ameliorate the effect of climate change may require our landfills to deploy more stringent emission controls, with associated capital or operating costs; however, we do not believe that such regulations will have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole. The adoption of climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs could increase our costs to operate.
Potential climate change and GHG regulatory initiatives have influenced our business strategy to provide low-carbon services to our customers, and we increasingly view our ability to offer lower carbon services as a key component of our business growth. If the U.S. were to impose a carbon tax or other form of GHG regulation increasing demand for low-carbon service offerings in the future, the services we are developing will be increasingly valuable.
In 2011, the EPA published the Non-Hazardous Secondary Materials (“NHSM”) Rule, which provides the standards and procedures for identifying whether NHSM are solid waste under RCRA when used as fuels or ingredients in combustion units. The EPA published clarifications and amendments to these rules in February 2013, and then issued a further amendment in February 2016, adding three additional categories of non-waste fuels. In 2011, the EPA also published NSPS and EGS for commercial and industrial solid waste incineration units (CISWI), and MACT Standards for commercial and industrial boilers. As a result of litigation surrounding the CISWI rules, EPA took additional regulatory actions in 2013 and 2016. Although the recently published amendments are generally favorable to our industry, some of the potential regulatory interpretations are undergoing review and other regulatory outcomes may be dependent on case-by-case administrative determinations. These could have a significant impact on some of our projects in which we are seeking to convert biomass or other secondary materials into products, fuels or energy. Therefore, it is not possible to quantify the financial impact of these rulemakings or pending administrative determinations at the present time. However, we believe the rules and administrative determinations will not have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole and are more likely to facilitate our efforts to reuse or recover energy value from secondary material streams.
In April 2015, the EPA issued a final rule regulating the disposal and beneficial use of coal and combustion residuals (“CCR”) as a solid waste (as opposed to a hazardous waste) under the Resource Conservations and Recovery Act. Then, in July 2016, EPA issued a related direct final rule on CCR. In September 2017, EPA announced it would reconsider parts of the rule and litigation is currently pending in the D.C. Court of Appeals as a result of lawsuits brought by both industry and environmental groups. The regulations encourage beneficial use of CCR in encapsulated uses (e.g. used in cement or wallboard), and use according to established industry standards (e.g. application of sludge for agricultural enrichment). The EPA also deemed disposal and beneficial use of CCR at permitted MSW landfills exempt from the new regulations because the RCRA Subtitle D standards applicable at MSW landfills provide at least equivalent protection. The new standards are consistent with our approach to handling CCR at our sites currently, and we believe the new standards will provide a potential growth opportunity for us. States may impose standards more stringent than the federal program, and we will be monitoring state implementation to determine impact.
10

Additionally, emission and fuel economy standards have been imposed on manufacturers of transportation vehicles (including waste collection vehicles). The EPA continues to evaluate and develop regulations to increase fuel economy standards and reduce vehicle emissions. Such regulations could increase the costs of operating our fleet, but we do not believe any such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole.
The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, as amended, establishes certain employer responsibilities, including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), and various reporting and record keeping obligations as well as disclosure and procedural requirements. Various standards for notices of hazards, safety in excavation and demolition work and the handling of asbestos, may apply to our operations. The Department of Transportation and OSHA, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, including safety, movement and disposal. Various state and local agencies with jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste may seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.
State and Local Regulation
Each state in which we operate has its own laws and regulations governing solid waste disposal, water and air pollution, and, in most cases, releases and cleanup of hazardous substances and liabilities for such matters. States also have adopted regulations governing the design, operation, maintenance and closure of landfills and transfer stations. Some counties, municipalities and other local governments have adopted similar laws and regulations. In addition, our operations may be affected by the trend in many states toward requiring solid waste reduction and recycling programs. For example, several states have enacted laws that require counties or municipalities to adopt comprehensive plans to reduce, through solid waste planning, composting, recycling or other programs, the volume of solid waste deposited in landfills. Additionally, laws and regulations restricting the disposal of certain waste in solid waste landfills, including yard waste, newspapers, beverage containers, unshredded tires, lead-acid batteries, electronic wastes and household appliances, have been adopted in several states and are being considered in others. Legislative and regulatory measures to mandate or encourage waste reduction at the source and waste recycling also have been or are under consideration by the U.S. Congress and the EPA.
To construct, operate and expand a landfill, we must obtain one or more construction or operating permits, as well as zoning and land use approvals. These permits and approvals may be burdensome to obtain and to comply with, are often opposed by neighboring landowners and citizens’ and environmental groups, may be subject to periodic renewal, and are subject to denial, modification, non-renewal and revocation by the issuing agency. Significant compliance disclosure obligations often accompany these processes. In connection with our acquisition of existing landfills, we may be required to spend considerable time, effort and money to bring the acquired facilities into compliance with applicable requirements and to obtain the permits and approvals necessary to increase their capacity. While we typically take into account the costs to bring an asset into compliance with applicable requirements during the acquisition process, we may incur costs beyond those estimated in the pre-acquisition stage.
Other Regulations
Many of our facilities own and operate above ground or underground storage tanks that are generally used to store petroleum-based products. These tanks are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations that mandate their periodic testing, upgrading, closure and removal. In the event of leaks or releases from these tanks, these regulations require that polluted groundwater and soils be remediated. While we believe that all of our underground storage tanks currently meet applicable regulatory requirements in all material respects, there can be no guarantee that some tanks will not fail to meet such requirements in the future. We maintain a storage tank liability policy which, subject to limitations and exclusions, provides coverage for first-party remediation and third-party claims.
With regard to our solid waste transportation operations, we are subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board and are regulated by the Federal Highway Administration, Office of Motor Carriers, and by regulatory agencies in states that regulate such matters. Various state and local government authorities have adopted, or are considering adopting, laws and regulations that would restrict the transportation of solid waste across state, county, or other jurisdiction lines. In 1978, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a law that restricts the importation of out-of-state solid waste is unconstitutional; however, states have attempted to distinguish proposed laws from those involved in and implicated by that ruling. In 1994, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a flow control law, which attempted to restrict solid waste from leaving its place of generation, imposes an impermissible burden upon interstate commerce and is unconstitutional. However, in 2007, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the right of a local government to direct the flow of solid waste to a publicly owned and publicly operated waste facility. A number of county and other local jurisdictions have enacted ordinances or other regulations restricting the free movement of solid waste across jurisdictional boundaries. Other governments may enact similar regulations in the future. These regulations may, in some cases, cause a decline in volumes of waste delivered to our landfills or transfer stations and may increase our costs of disposal.

Emissions from Natural Gas Fueling and Infrastructure
We operate a fleet of 444 CNG vehicles and we plan to continue to transition a portion of our collection fleet from diesel fuel to CNG, in locations where it is cost beneficial. We have constructed and operate natural gas fueling stations. Concerns have been raised about the potential for emissions from the fueling stations and infrastructure that serve natural gas-fueled vehicles. Additional regulation of, or restrictions on, CNG fueling infrastructure could increase our operating costs. We are not yet able to evaluate potential operating changes or costs associated with such regulations, but we do not anticipate that such regulations would have a material adverse impact on our business as a whole or our current plan to continue transitioning to CNG vehicles.
Liabilities Established for Landfill and Environmental Costs
We have established reserves for landfill and environmental costs, which include landfill site final capping, closure and post-closure costs and costs for contamination-related obligations. We periodically reassess such costs based on various methods and assumptions regarding landfill airspace and the technical requirements of Subtitle D of RCRA, and we adjust our rates used to expense final capping, closure and post-closure costs accordingly. Based on current information and regulatory requirements, we believe that our recorded reserves for such landfill and environmental expenditures are adequate. However, environmental laws and regulations may change, and we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover requirements under existing or new environmental laws and regulations, future changes or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, or adverse environmental conditions previously unknown to us.
Liability Insurance and Bonding
The nature of our business exposes us to the risk of liabilities arising out of our operations, including possible damages to the environment. Such potential liabilities could involve, for example, claims for remediation costs, personal injury, property damage and damage to the environment, claims of employees, customers or third parties for personal injury or property damage occurring in the course of our operations, or claims alleging negligence or other wrongdoing in the planning or performance of work. We also could be subject to fines and civil and criminal penalties in connection with alleged violations of regulatory requirements which could be significant. Our solid waste operations have third-party environmental liability insurance with limits in excess of those required by permit regulations, subject to certain limitations and exclusions. However, we cannot assure you that our environmental liability insurance would be adequate, in scope or amount, in the event of a major loss, nor can we assure you that we would continue to carry excess environmental liability insurance should market conditions in the insurance industry make such coverage costs prohibitive.
We maintain general liability, vehicle liability, employment practices liability, fiduciary liability, pollution liability, directors and officers’ liability, workers’ compensation and employer’s liability coverage, as well as umbrella liability policies to provide excess coverage over the underlying limits contained in these primary policies. We also carry property insurance. Although we try to operate safely and prudently and we have, subject to limitations and exclusions, substantial liability insurance, we cannot assure you that we will not be exposed to uninsured liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
Our insurance programs for workers’ compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and employee-related health care benefits are effectively self-insured. Claims in excess of self-insurance levels are insured subject to the excess policy limits and exclusions. Accruals are based on claims filed and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported ("IBNR"). Due to the variable condition of the insurance market, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, increased self-insurance retention levels and increased premiums. As we assume more risk for self-insurance through higher retention levels, we may experience more variability in our self-insurance reserves and expense.
In the normal course of business, we post performance bonds, insurance policies, letters of credit, or cash or marketable securities deposits in connection with municipal residential collection contracts, closure and post-closure of landfills, environmental remediation, environmental permits and business licenses and permits as a financial guarantee of our performance. To date, we have satisfied financial responsibility requirements by making cash or marketable securities deposits or by obtaining bank letters of credit, insurance policies or surety bonds. The amount of surety bonds issued by third parties at December 31, 2017 was $749.2 and our outstanding letters of credit amounted to $39.3.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 5,939 employees, approximately 14% of whom were covered by collective bargaining agreements. From time to time, our operating locations may experience union organizing efforts. We have not historically experienced any significant work stoppages. We currently have no disputes or bargaining circumstances that we believe could cause significant disruptions in our business. Our management believes we have good relations with our employees.
