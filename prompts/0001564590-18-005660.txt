Pipeline of Development Programs and Commercial Products
 Below is a summary of our internally developed, proprietary portfolio: 

In addition, we have several other partnered programs. We discovered and developed lorcaserin (BELVIQ and BELVIQ XR), which is currently marketed by Eisai or its distributors in the United States, or US, and certain other countries for weight loss. Lorcaserin is also being tested in an ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT, for the reduction of major cardiovascular events and progression to type 2 diabetes. We also discovered nelotanserin which is partnered with Axovant Sciences and currently in Phase 2 development for various neurologic disorders. We also maintain a preclinical collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim for undisclosed orphan targets in central nervous system disorders.
 We also own and have rights to other clinical and preclinical stage compounds that were internally discovered by us.
 Ralinepag Program
 Ralinepag is a next, generation potent, highly selective oral IP receptor agonist intended for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Ralinepag was designed by us to deliver intravenous prostacyclin-like potency and pharmacokinetics in an oral tablet. In non-clinical experiments, ralinepag demonstrated potentially best-in-class activation of the IP receptor resulting in vasodilation, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Additionally, early stage studies of ralinepag pharmacokinetics in humans revealed an approximately 24-hour half-life and a low peak-to-trough ratio supporting therapeutic blood levels with once daily dosing.  
 In September 2014, ralinepag was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of PAH by the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. 
 PAH is a progressive, life-threatening disorder characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. PAH occurs when the pulmonary arteries thicken or grow rigid. This makes blood flow more difficult. The heart must work harder to push blood through the arteries, and the arteries are unable to carry adequate blood to the lungs. The increased pressure strains the heart, which can limit physical activity, result in heart failure and reduce life expectancy. PAH will continue to worsen over time, even with proper treatment. Based on data from the Registry to EValuate Early And Long-term PAH disease management, or REVEAL, of patients in the US, there is an estimated five-year survival rate of 57% from diagnosis. The reported prevalence of PAH varies widely. One estimate is 15-50 cases/million with a higher female preponderance (approximately 3:1). More recently, the prevalence of PAH in the US among the privately insured (under age 65) and Medicare (age 65 and over) populations was estimated using administrative claims data in accordance with the current clinical classification of PAH. This analysis suggests PAH prevalence was 109 (71–146) cases/million among the under age 65 population, and 451 (384–519) cases/million for age 65 and over population or Medicare patients. Another estimate is that PAH affects about 500,000 individuals worldwide. A recent report characterizes the global market sales of PAH therapies as $5.8 billion in 2015, which are expected to increase to $6.7 billion by 2025.
PAH involves several interrelated mechanisms, with prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 playing a major role in maintaining pulmonary vascular tone through their balanced activity. Prostacyclin, released by endothelial cells, promotes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation. Prostacyclin also has antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle. Despite treatment guidelines, targeting the prostacyclin pathway has been primarily reserved for patients with advanced disease due to limitations of currently available options including parenteral prostacyclins which are the only PAH treatment that have demonstrated a mortality benefit.

Ralinepag Development
 We are currently preparing for a Phase 3 program for ralinepag.
 In 2017, we announced topline results from a 22-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial evaluating the effectiveness in reducing pulmonary vascular resistance, or PVR, improving exercise capacity, tolerability and safety of ralinepag. In this trial, 40 patients with PAH received ralinepag and 21 received placebo. Topline results showed statistically significant improvement of both absolute and percentage change from baseline in PVR. Ralinepag also demonstrated numerical improvement in six-minute walk distance, or 6MWD, but as the study was not powered to show a difference in 6MWD from placebo, this was a not a statistically-significant finding. The safety and tolerability profiles were in line with other oral prostacyclins. 

In 2013, we announced topline results from a multiple-dose, randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating multiple-ascending doses of ralinepag in healthy volunteers. In this trial, 40 healthy volunteers received ralinepag and 15 received placebo. The safety profile of ralinepag in this trial was characteristic of IP receptor agonists: the most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were headache, nausea and jaw pain. One serious adverse event, transient atrial fibrillation, occurred in a single subject, and the study investigator considered it to be possibly treatment related. Further review revealed that the subject had multiple characteristics predisposing the patient to atrial fibrillation, including cardiac abnormalities prior to study start.
 In 2011, we announced topline results of a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of ralinepag. The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial evaluated 32 healthy volunteers in four cohorts of eight participants each, with six randomized to ralinepag and two to placebo. Ralinepag was rapidly absorbed and demonstrated dose-proportional pharmacokinetic exposure over the tested dose range. Consistent with the expected pharmacology of ralinepag, the most common adverse events were headache, vomiting, nausea, jaw pain and flushing.
 Ralinepag intellectual property
 As of March 2, 2018, we owned issued patents covering compositions of matter for ralinepag and related compounds and methods of treatment utilizing ralinepag and related compounds, synthetic routes, and various solid state forms of ralinepag in 61 jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, Russia, South Korea and Australia, and we had applications pending in three other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets were Brazil and India. The patent on ralinepag issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office has serial number US 8,895,776, while the corresponding patent granted by the European Patent Office has serial number EP 2280696 B2. We also own issued patents and/or pending applications directed to synthetic processes and dosage regimens of ralinepag. The earliest priority date for the patents on ralinepag is 2008. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2029 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.
 Etrasimod Program
 Etrasimod (APD334), is an oral, next generation, selective sphingosine 1-phosphate, or S1P, receptor modulator, discovered by Arena, designed to provide systemic and local cell modulation by selectively targeting S1P receptor subtypes 1, 4 and 5, while avoiding subtypes 2 and 3. In early stage studies, etrasimod exhibited potentially best-in-class pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with rapid onset of action and rapid recovery of T lymphocytes. Selective binding with S1P receptor subtype 1 is believed to inhibit a specific subset of activated lymphocytes from migrating to sites of inflammation. The result is a reduction of circulating T and B lymphocytes that leads to anti-inflammatory activity and immune surveillance is maintained. The receptor 
 4


subtypes 4 and 5 exhibit similar activity on additional proliferating immune cell types. Optimized pharmacology and pharmacokinetics may allow improved clinical utility across a broad range of immune-inflammatory conditions.
 Ulcerative Colitis
 Inflammatory bowel diseases, or IBD, like ulcerative colitis, or UC, and Crohn’s disease, or CD, are chronic inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that affect approximately 1.6 million people in the US alone. The prevalence of UC and CD in the US are currently estimated at 914,000 and 684,000 patients, respectively. The prevalence of IBD in European Union, or EU, is estimated at 2.6 million with 1.1 million persons with CD and 1.5 million persons with UC. Both conditions have a significant impact on the patient’s quality of life and can in many cases be very aggressive and disabling.
 UC is characterized by mucosal inflammation limited to the colon which involves the rectum in about 95% of cases and may extend to involve parts or all of the large intestine. In contrast, CD is characterized by full thickness inflammation that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract but most typically involves the terminal ileum and colon; and causes fistulation and scarring. Symptoms for UC and CD can vary, depending on the location and severity of inflammation, but some of the most common are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and rectal bleeding. 
 Important goals of therapy for UC are to induce and maintain remission while improving the patient’s quality of life. Currently available treatment options have limitations in terms of long-term efficacy and side effects, have complicated administration regimens, and often fail to induce or maintain remission. Therefore, we believe a significant unmet need remains for differentiated oral agents that are efficacious for induction and maintenance therapy with a favorable side effect profile. We believe that the oral once-daily dosing, selectivity, mechanism of action, and emerging clinical profile of etrasimod may represent a significant opportunity to provide patients with an effective treatment for UC with an improved safety and dosing profile over current therapies.
 Primary Biliary Cholangitis
 Primary biliary cholangitis, or PBC (previously referred to as primary biliary cirrhosis), is a chronic liver disease which is classified as a rare disease. The prevalence in the US is approximately 40 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The incidence and prevalence of PBC in European countries are similar to those seen in the US.
 Progressive bile-duct injury from portal and periportal inflammation could result in progressive fibrosis, cholangitis and eventually cirrhosis. Evidence to date suggests that immunological and genetic factors might cause the disease. Current treatment attempts to slow the progression rate of the disease and to alleviate the symptoms. Currently liver transplantation appears to be the only life-saving procedure for PBC patients.
 Inflammation, the underlying cause of PBC, is believed to be T lymphocyte mediated. In research models with etrasimod, we have demonstrated modulation of the specific subtypes of T lymphocytes believed to be implicated in PBC. 
 Pyoderma Gangrenosum
 Pyoderma gangrenosum, or PG, is a rare inflammatory skin disease characterized by painful recurrent ulcerations. Lesions may occur either in the absence of any apparent underlying disorder or in association with other diseases, such as UC, CD, and other conditions. The clinical course can be mild or malignant, and chronic or relapsing.
 The etiology of PG has not yet been clearly determined, although it is suspected to be an autoimmune disease caused by dysregulation of the immune system. Approximately 50% of cases of PG are associated with other disorders, especially UC or CD.
Based upon the US Department of Health and Human Services' National Institutes of Health's Office of Rare Disease Research, the incidence of PG each year in the US has been estimated to be 1 person per 100,000 people. 
 Treatment is challenging, and the prognosis of PG remains unpredictable. Current treatments involve wound care and the use of anti-inflammatory agents, including antibiotics, corticosteroids, immune-suppressants and biologics, and attempts to target a broad spectrum of immunologic mediators and inflammatory cells, including T lymphocytes shown to be involved in PG. We believe reduction of lymphocytes by S1P receptor modulators such as etrasimod may represent a novel therapeutic approach in PG.

Etrasimod Development
 Ulcerative Colitis
 We are conducting a dose finding 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational Phase 2 clinical trial of etrasimod in moderate to severe UC. The aim of the trial includes investigating a clear dose response and establishing a clinically meaningful signal for the active arm(s) from placebo. The trial is expected to evaluate the effects of etrasimod at 1mg and 2mg versus placebo on multiple efficacy measures including a three-component partial Mayo Clinic Score, clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement in up to 160 patients. Patients from this study have the possibility to continue after the initial 12-week study in an open-label extension study for up to 46 weeks with the focus on safety and maintenance of therapeutic effect. 
Primary Biliary Cholangitis
 We are conducting a 24-week open-label multinational Phase 2 trial of etrasimod in PBC. The aim of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of etrasimod in this patient population as well as evaluate the effect of etrasimod on alkaline phosphatase, a key diagnostic marker of PBC, as well as other laboratory parameters. 
Pyoderma Gangrenosum
 We are conducting a Phase 2, proof of concept, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in patients with PG. The objective is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of etrasimod in patients with PG over a 12-week treatment period. The study includes patients with diagnosed PG independent of IBD as a background disease. 
 Dermatologic Extraintestinal Manifestations of IBD
 In March 2017, we initiated a Phase 2, proof of concept, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of etrasimod in IBD patients with active dermatologic extraintestinal manifestations, or EIM. In November 2017, we announced that we decided to conclude the study since the UC study also includes patients with dermatological manifestations. We intend to assess the impact of etrasimod on EIMs of IBD in a combined data set from the two trials.
 Prior Development
 In January 2015, we announced top-line results from a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for etrasimod. In the trial, etrasimod demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on lymphocyte count lowering in blood, with mean decreases from baseline of up to 69%. Lymphocyte counts, on average, recovered to baseline within one week of conclusion of dosing. There was a modest impact on heart rate, but none of the changes were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. There were also no findings with respect to pulmonary function or liver enzyme tests that were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate contact dermatitis, headache, constipation and diarrhea, with none being clearly drug related. There were no discontinuations for adverse events, and no serious adverse events were observed. 
 The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of etrasimod. In five different dosing cohorts, 50 healthy volunteers received etrasimod and 10 healthy volunteers received placebo for 21 days.
 Prior to commencing the Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for etrasimod, we completed a Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of the compound. This randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of etrasimod in 40 healthy adult volunteers. In the trial, etrasimod demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects, a dose-responsive reduction in blood lymphocyte count and a slowing of heart rate that appears comparable to other S1P receptor modulators. The terminal half-life was approximately 35 hours.
 Etrasimod intellectual property
 As of March 2, 2018, we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for etrasimod and related compounds, methods of treatment utilizing etrasimod and related compounds, and various salts of etrasimod and crystalline forms thereof in 61 jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom,  Spain, Canada, India, Russia, South Korea and Australia, and had applications pending in one other jurisdiction (Brazil). The patents on etrasimod issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office have serial numbers US 8,580,841 and US 9,126,932, while the corresponding patent granted by the European Patent Office has serial number EP 2326621 B2. We also own issued patents and/or pending applications directed to solid-state forms of etrasimod, dosage regimens for etrasimod and synthetic routes and intermediates useful in the manufacturing of etrasimod. The earliest priority date for the patents on etrasimod is 2008. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 
 6


2029 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.
 APD371 Program
 
APD371, an orally available, potent, peripherally restricted, highly selective, full agonist of the CB2 receptor, is an internally discovered investigational drug candidate we are exploring for the treatment of visceral pain, specifically pain associated with CD. 
 Visceral pain is defined as pain that originates within muscle, pleura, connective tissue, nervous system or solid organs within the abdomen or peritoneum. It is distinct from somatic or neuropathic pain, and is perceived as stretching, pulling and distention, rather than by cutting, crushing, or burning more commonly associated with neuropathic pain. Visceral pain is one of the most common types of pain. For example, abdominal pain affects approximately 20% of the general population. Visceral pain may be caused by a diverse set of organic causes, such as inflammation (e.g., IBD (including CD and UC), pancreatitis, prostatitis, and vaginitis), obstruction (e.g., bowel obstruction, and nephrolithiasis), ischemia, and malignancy, among others. Visceral pain may also be caused by functional disorders such as interstitial cystitis, dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and vulvodynia.
 A specific type of visceral pain, pain associated with CD, affects a significant portion of patients with underlying CD. CD affects approximately 684,000 patients in the US, and 20% of patients suffer from residual pain even while in remission.
 Common treatments for visceral pain range from non-invasive, conservative approaches (e.g., physical therapy or acupuncture), to pharmacologic (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants acting as neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors), and invasive interventions (e.g., bowel resection). Potent analgesics, such as opioids, can adversely affect GI function. Other commonly prescribed analgesics are often not potent enough and may lead to other GI side effects such as bleeding. Apart from linaclotide and lubiprostone, prescribed for IBS, no visceral-specific analgesics are available. Approximately one in eight CD patients is chronically treated with opioids.
 The CB2 receptor is expressed in the GI nervous system, and in many tissues and organs of the abdomen. CB2 receptors are found peripherally on immune cells but also on microglia, terminal neurons, dorsal root ganglia, and on visceral sensory neurons. We believe selectively targeting the CB2 receptor may provide therapeutic benefit for visceral pain without the potential for dependence, abuse, and GI and cardiovascular side effects associated with opiates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which are among the most common pain relievers. In addition to analgesic effects, APD371 may have anti-inflammatory properties. 
 APD371 is designed to be a peripherally restricted and selective CB2 receptor agonist, and is intended to provide pain relief without the unwanted side effects associated with CB1 receptor activation.
 APD371 Development
 We are conducting a Phase 2a clinical trial to evaluate APD371 in pain associated with CD. This exploratory study is an open‑label investigation to evaluate safety and tolerability of APD371 in this patient population and to gain initial insights into its efficacy via a pain visual analog scale, or VAS. 
 In April 2016, we announced favorable results from a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial of APD371. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial enrolled 36 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of APD371. Cohorts of 12 subjects (9 active, 3 placebo) were administered doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg of APD371 or placebo three times daily for 10 days and, in connection with the pharmacokinetic evaluation, one time on the 11th day. The most common adverse events were headache and nausea. All adverse events were classified as mild, and there were no serious adverse events reported. There was one discontinuation in the high-dose group due to an adverse event of mild thirst and somnolence. Reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were observed, but none were symptomatic or resulted in an adverse event. Drug levels at all doses tested in the trial, including the lowest dose, were well above those believed to be needed to stimulate the CB2 receptor.
 In April 2015, we announced favorable top-line results from a Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of APD371. The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial enrolled 56 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of APD371. Dose-responsive exposure was observed over the explored dose range of 10-400 mg with good tolerability at all doses administered.
 APD371 intellectual property
 As of March 2, 2018, we owned issued patents covering compositions of matter for APD371 and related compounds in 21 jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, Canada, Russia, South Korea and Australia, and we had applications pending in 10 other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets were Europe, Venezuela, Brazil and India. The 
 7


patent on APD371 issued by the US Patent and Trademark Office has serial number US 8,778,950. We also own issued patents and/or pending applications directed to various solid-state forms of APD371. The earliest priority date for the patents on APD371 is 2009. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2030 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.
 Additional Internal Preclinical and Clinical Programs 
 We have additional clinical and preclinical assets, including temanogrel and APD597, which we are evaluating for future development. We are also evaluating additional delivery forms of the products in our pipeline to extend clinical utility or improve the product profile.
Collaborations
 In addition to our primary focus on internally developing our clinical pipeline, we have entered into strategic collaborations with pharmaceutical companies, including Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest, Axovant Sciences GmbH, or Axovant, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, Beacon Discovery, Inc., or Beacon, and Eisai. 
Everest Collaboration
 In December 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Everest Agreement, with Everest. 
 Under the Everest Agreement, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize two of our product candidates, ralinepag (in any formulation) and etrasimod (in oral formulations only), in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or the Everest Territories.
 Everest will be responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products in the Everest Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Everest Territories. 
 In addition to an upfront payment of $12.0 million, we are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Everest of up to $212.0 million for both licensed products, as well as tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. Following an initial royalty term, we are eligible to receive a lower trademark royalty if Everest continues to use our licensed product-related trademarks.
 Nelotanserin Collaboration
 Nelotanserin, an orally available potent and selective inverse agonist of the 5-HT2A receptor, is an investigational drug candidate that has been implicated in the pathophysiology underlying psychosis. Nelotanserin was discovered by Arena, and we previously completed Phase 1 trials in healthy volunteers and Phase 2 trials in subjects with insomnia before development was discontinued for that indication.
Development, Marketing, and Supply Agreement
 In May 2015, we entered into a Development, Marketing and Supply Agreement with Roivant Sciences Ltd., or Roivant, for nelotanserin. Roivant subsequently assigned all of its rights to develop and commercialize nelotanserin to its subsidiary, Axovant. Under our collaboration, Axovant has exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize nelotanserin, and we are required to manufacture or have manufactured clinical supply and commercial product to sell to Axovant. We received a $4.0 million upfront payment and are eligible to receive $41.5 million in regulatory and development milestone payments. We are also eligible to receive 15% of net sales of nelotanserin in exchange for the manufacture and supply of finished commercial drug product, and up to a total of $60.0 million in one-time purchase price adjustment payments tied to certain commercial sales milestones.
 Axovant has agreed to indemnify us for losses resulting from certain third-party claims, including for (i) Axovant’s negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law, (ii) Axovant’s breach of the development, marketing and supply agreement or related agreements, (iii) any product liability claim, (iv) certain uses or misuses of nelotanserin, (v) certain infringement of intellectual property rights, and (vi) product manufactured according to the product warranty. We have agreed to indemnify Axovant for losses resulting from certain third-party claims, including for our negligence, willful misconduct or violation of law, and for losses resulting from our breach of the agreement or related agreements.

Axovant has the right to terminate the agreement on a compound-by-compound basis or in its entirety upon 90 days’ prior written notice to us. We have the right to terminate the agreement upon certain intellectual property concerns. Either party has the right to terminate the agreement early in certain circumstances, including if the other party is in material breach.
 Nelotanserin development 
 Under our Development, Marketing and Supply Agreement, Axovant will be responsible for funding the development and commercialization of nelotanserin. In January 2018, Axovant reported results for a pilot Phase 2 Visual Hallucination study of nelotanserin in patients with Lewy body dementia. Additionally, Axovant is studying nelotanserin in patients with dementia with Lewy Bodies or Parkinson’s disease dementia who are experiencing rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep behavior disorder. Axovant will determine the overall development strategy for nelotanserin once its ongoing clinical, regulatory and commercial review is completed.
 Orphan GPCR Collaboration
In December 2015, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, to conduct joint research to identify drug candidates targeting a GPCR that belongs to a group of orphan central nervous system, or CNS, receptors. An “orphan receptor” is structurally related to a family of proteins that are known to act as functional cell-surface receptors but whose ligand has not yet been identified.
 We contracted with Beacon to perform our research obligations under the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. In exchange, we agreed to share limited near term milestones with Beacon as well as the full-time equivalent funding paid to us by Boehringer Ingelheim. We have retained the longer-term success milestones and all royalties.
 Beacon Discovery Agreements
 In September 2016, we entered into a series of agreements with Beacon. Beacon was founded and is owned by several of our former employees. 
 We entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Beacon, pursuant to which we granted Beacon a non-exclusive, non-assignable and non-sublicensable license to certain database information relating to compounds, receptors and pharmacology, and transferred certain equipment to Beacon. Beacon will seek to engage global partners to facilitate discovery and development. Beacon has agreed to assign to us any intellectual property relating to our existing research and development programs developed in the course of performing research for us, and grant us a non-exclusive license to any intellectual property developed outside the course of performing work for us that is reasonably necessary or useful for developing or commercializing the products under our research and development programs. We are also entitled to rights of negotiation and rights of first refusal to potentially obtain licenses to certain compounds discovered and developed by Beacon. In addition, we are entitled to receive (i) a percentage of any revenue received by Beacon on or after the second anniversary of the effective date of the agreement from any third party pursuant to a third-party license, including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties; (ii) single-digit royalties on the aggregate net sales of any related products sold by Beacon and its affiliates; and (iii) in the event that Beacon is sold, a percentage of the consideration for such sale transaction.
 We also entered a Master Services Agreement with Beacon, pursuant to which Beacon performs certain research services for us relating to our proprietary pipeline, as well as a services agreement to support our research obligations under our collaboration with Boehringer Ingelheim.
 BELVIQ (lorcaserin) Collaboration
 Lorcaserin is approved for marketing in the United States, South Korea, Brazil, Mexico, Israel, and Taiwan for the indication of weight management, and is being commercialized by Eisai or its distributors in the United States, South Korea, Israel, and Taiwan. BELVIQ was made available by prescription in the United States in June 2013 and in South Korea in February 2015. Eisai also has launched of a once-daily formulation of lorcaserin in the United States, which is marketed under the brand name BELVIQ XR. Lorcaserin has not yet been launched in Brazil or Mexico. In December 2016, we entered into a Transaction Agreement and a Supply Agreement with Eisai, which replaced our prior marketing and supply agreement with Eisai for lorcaserin. 
 Transaction Agreement
 Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we granted Eisai an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, or transferred intellectual property, to develop, manufacture and commercialize lorcaserin in all countries and territories of the world. In consideration for the 
 9


rights granted to Eisai under the Transaction Agreement, Eisai has agreed to make tiered royalty payments to us on the net sales of lorcaserin. The royalty rates range from 9.5% on annual global net sales less than or equal to $175.0 million, 13.5% on annual global net sales greater than $175.0 million but less than or equal to $500.0 million and 18.5% on annual global net sales greater than $500.0 million.
 We are eligible to receive a milestone payment of $25.0 million upon the achievement of global net sales of lorcaserin for a calendar year first exceeding $250.0 million.
 Eisai is solely responsible for all costs and expenses in connection with the development of lorcaserin, and our wholly owned subsidiary, Arena Pharmaceuticals GmbH, or Arena GmbH, was relieved of its obligation under the former marketing and supply agreement to pay for its share of development costs for lorcaserin. Eisai has the exclusive right and responsibility to plan and implement all research and development of lorcaserin at its own cost and expense, including conducting all regulatory activities and all clinical and development activities. Additionally, Eisai has agreed to (i) conduct all studies required by the FDA as a condition of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of lorcaserin in the United States (otherwise known as the cardiovascular outcomes trial, or CVOT), (ii) continue the current study assessing whether lorcaserin reduces the incidence of major cardiovascular events, (iii) continue the current study assessing whether lorcaserin reduces the incidence of conversion to Type 2 diabetes mellitus, and (iv) use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and seek regulatory approval of lorcaserin in each of China, Japan and the European Union.
 Eisai is solely responsible, and has the exclusive rights, for commercializing lorcaserin and is responsible for manufacturing lorcaserin, except for any manufacturing to be conducted by Arena GmbH under the Supply Agreement. Eisai is responsible for using commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize lorcaserin products in the United States, the European Union, China and Japan (collectively, the Major Markets) after regulatory approval in the applicable market. 
 We and Eisai will each bear 50% of losses arising from any alleged defective manufacturing of lorcaserin by Arena GmbH under the Supply Agreement, and Eisai will be solely responsible for any expenses and losses associated with other product liability claims. 
 The Transaction Agreement will remain in effect until terminated by us or Eisai with respect to all countries in the world. We may terminate the Transaction Agreement with respect to a Major Market if Eisai permanently ceases development and commercialization of lorcaserin products in such Major Market, or in its entirety if Eisai permanently ceases development and commercialization of lorcaserin products in the world. We may also terminate the Transaction Agreement if Eisai challenges any patent controlled by us related to lorcaserin as of the effective date of the Transaction Agreement, or Licensed Patents, if Eisai is debarred under the US Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or if Eisai is in material breach of the standstill provisions. Eisai may terminate the Transaction Agreement if as a result of its change of control, it would be in breach of certain competition restrictions.
 In the event the Transaction Agreement is terminated by us due to Eisai’s failure to develop and commercialize lorcaserin products, Eisai’s challenging of any of the Licensed Patents or Eisai’s debarment or material breach of the standstill provisions, or by Eisai after a change of control that would result in Eisai being in breach of certain competition restrictions, Eisai will grant Arena an exclusive, royalty-free license to certain patent rights and know-how necessary or useful for the development and commercialization of lorcaserin products, re-assign the assets purchased by Eisai under the Transaction Agreement and Supply Agreement, and provide certain other transition assistance.
 Supply Agreement
 Under the Supply Agreement, Arena GmbH agreed to manufacture and supply, and Eisai agreed to purchase, all of Eisai’s requirements (or specified minimum quantities if such quantities are greater than Eisai’s requirements), subject to certain exceptions, for BELVIQ and BELVIQ XR for the development and commercial use of such products in all countries and territories of the world for an initial two-year period, which initial period may be extended by Eisai for an additional payment. Eisai will pay Arena GmbH agreed upon prices to deliver finished drug product during this time. Additionally, Eisai agreed to pay up to CHF 13.0 million in payments to Arena GmbH to support the maintenance of Arena GmbH’s manufacturing facility in Switzerland during the initial two-year supply period, and an additional amount during the extension period, if any.
 Pursuant to the Supply Agreement, Arena GmbH agreed to transfer to Eisai all know-how and materials necessary for Eisai to manufacture BELVIQ at the facility in accordance with Arena GmbH’s manufacturing processes used at the effective date of the Supply Agreement or 24 months prior. Arena GmbH also assigned its agreements with distributors in South Korea, Taiwan and Israel to Eisai, and Eisai agreed to assume responsibilities under such agreements.
 10


On the effective date of the Supply Agreement, Eisai purchased Arena GmbH’s entire inventory of the precursor materials for manufacturing lorcaserin then in Arena GmbH’s possession. In exchange for these materials Eisai made a one-time payment to Arena GmbH of $10.0 million.
 Absent early termination, the Supply Agreement will remain in effect until (i) the last day of the initial two-year supply period, or the last day of the six-month extension period (if any), or up to two weeks thereafter if so requested by Eisai, or (ii) in the event of an acquisition of Arena or Arena GmbH by a third party, or of an assignment of the Supply Agreement by Arena GmbH to a third party, five years after the effective date of the Supply Agreement. After the initial two-year period of the Supply Agreement, either Arena GmbH or Eisai may terminate the Supply Agreement upon the other party’s material breach that remains uncured 60 days after receiving written notice thereof. The Supply Agreement will also terminate automatically upon termination of the Transaction Agreement.
 On March 9, 2018, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement, or Sale Agreement, with Siegfried Pharma AG and Siegfried AG (collectively and individually, Siegfried). Under the Sale Agreement, we agreed to sell and assign to Siegfried, and Siegfried agreed to purchase and assume from Arena GmbH, certain drug product finishing facility assets and know-how, including fixtures, equipment, other personal property and real estate assets located in Zofingen, Switzerland, related contracts and certain related liabilities after the closing as well as to the transfer of all of Arena GmbH’s approximately 50 current employees, or collectively, Manufacturing Operations. We refer to this transaction as Siegfried Transaction. Under the Sale Agreement, at the closing, Arena GmbH will assign to Siegfried Pharma the Supply Agreement. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our compounds and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection for our key inventions, including drug candidates we identify, routes for chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical formulations and methods of treatment.
 There is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue, or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method. In addition, we regularly review our patent portfolio to identify patents and patent applications for potential abandonment that we deem to have relatively low value to our ongoing business operations. There is also no assurance that we will correctly identify which of our patents and patent applications should be maintained and which should be abandoned. The term of most of our other current patents commenced, and most of our future patents, if any, will commence, on the date of issuance and terminate 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. Because any marketing and regulatory approval for a drug often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting market exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates will likely be substantially less than 20 years.
 In the United States, patent term adjustment is available for certain delays in patent office proceedings. In addition, under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE. PTE permits patent term restoration of a US patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an Investigational New Drug, or IND (falling after issuance of the patent), and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. The Improving Regulatory Transparency for New Medical Therapies Act was signed into law in 2015 to prevent the loss of PTE (and market exclusivity) for drugs for which the FDA recommends scheduling under the Controlled Substances Act. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. The application for PTE is subject to approval by the PTO in conjunction with the FDA.
 Outside of the United States, similar provisions may be available in the European Union, Japan, South Korea and some other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. The length of any such extension would vary by country. Our European patents may be eligible for supplemental protection certificates of up to five years in one or more countries.
 Due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions, there is no assurance that our patents will be afforded extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval.
 In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information, all of our employees are required to enter into and adhere to an employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement, and invention disclosure procedures as a condition of employment. Additionally, our employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreements 
 11


require that our employees not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third-party proprietary technology. We also generally require our consultants and collaborators that have access to proprietary property and information to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements in our favor before beginning their relationship with us. While such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf, they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and significant change. We face significant competition from many organizations with drugs or drug candidates that do or may compete drug candidates we are developing. We may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations, which include many large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. Developments by others may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, and we or our collaborators may not be successful in developing either first or best in class drugs.
 Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater drug development capabilities and financial, scientific and marketing resources than we do. Additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated with our competitors. As a result, our competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the research, development, marketing and promotion of therapeutic products or drug discovery techniques, or to adapt more readily to technological advances than we can. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving regulatory approval or commercializing drugs before we do.
 We expect to encounter significant competition in the therapeutic areas targeted by our principal drug candidates. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their drug candidates before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may be competing against companies with substantially greater manufacturing, marketing, distribution and selling capabilities, and any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have longer histories of safe and effective use.
 We may rely on collaborators for support of development programs and for the manufacturing and marketing of drug candidates. Such collaborators may be conducting multiple drug development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subject of their agreements with us, which may negatively impact the development of drugs that are subject to our agreements. In addition, we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for such collaboration arrangements, and technological and other developments by others may make it more difficult for us to establish such relationships.
 Government Regulation
 We and our collaborators are subject to significant governmental regulation. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical and clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, import, export, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, tracking, recordkeeping, advertising, pricing and promotion of drug candidates and commercialized drugs. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements may result in inspectional notices of violation, warning letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of a product from the market or other negative consequences.
 In the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, many of which are required to be performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and be updated annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 12


 
• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, generally accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prior to commercialization, centrally acting drugs may be subject to review and potential scheduling by the DEA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial expertise, time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular drug candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA. During the 30-day time period the FDA may require additional information. The FDA may institute a clinical hold at the 30-day time period if any questions are not fully addressed or because of other concerns about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may place an IND on partial or full clinical hold at any time during a product candidate’s development. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
 Clinical trials. For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, typically in healthy volunteers, but in some cases in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies or adequate and well-controlled studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 clinical trials. The FDA may approve an NDA for a drug candidate, but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved an NDA. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 New drug applications. The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, information. An NDA is usually accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission by the NDA sponsor. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within 10 months from its acceptance of the filing or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from its acceptance of the filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA by issuing a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A CRL may require additional 
 13


clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Data are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Approval may occur with Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that may limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs or other information.
 Other US regulatory requirements. Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections (which may be unannounced) by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection or after the appropriate FDA office review of the Establishment Inspection Report prepared by the investigator, can list conditions the FDA believes may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter be issued for violations of “regulatory significance,” also known as Official Action Indicated, or OAI. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in regulatory action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and warning letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, recall of product, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for healthcare professional marketing activities and materials, direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the confines of the pivotal studies and the approved label. Further, we may be required to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA for changes to, among other things, the indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities of a drug. Failure to comply with these requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, corrective advertising, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA, if in their professional medical judgment, the physicians deem such use to be appropriate. Such off-label uses are common across certain medical specialties. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
 To distribute products commercially, we or our collaborators, as applicable, must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution.
 Drug Enforcement Administration regulation. The DEA regulates drugs that are controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. The CSA governs, among other things, the inventory, distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. Any drug that acts on the central nervous system has the potential to become a controlled substance based on an evaluation of its abuse potential, and scheduling by the DEA is a separate process that may delay the commercial launch of a drug even after FDA approval of the NDA. Companies with a scheduled drug are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA’s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation or a denial of renewal of any DEA registration, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.

Outside of the United States
Outside of the United States, the ability to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. Approval in the United States does not guarantee approval in other countries and vice-versa.
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity. Market exclusivity provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act can delay the submission or approval of applications seeking to rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved NDA. A new chemical entity, or NCE, subject to an NDA is entitled to a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of patents listed with the FDA by the NDA holder. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active ingredient. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication or the same product for the same indication if demonstrated to be clinically superior. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 Drug product manufacturing. Our Swiss subsidiary, Arena GmbH operates a drug product manufacturing facility in Zofingen, Switzerland. Swissmedic, a public service organization of the Swiss federal government, is the central Swiss agency for the authorization and supervision of therapeutic products. Our Swiss manufacturing facility has been inspected by the competent regional authorities (Regionales Heilmittelinspektorat der Nordwestschweiz, Basel, Switzerland), acting on behalf of Swissmedic, which issued GMP and production licenses to Arena GmbH for the production of drugs.
 Prescription drug reimbursement. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of prescription drug products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are less likely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is 
 15


adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement are important to new product acceptance.
 If a drug is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 as well as the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort, which has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, was enacted in the United States in March 2010 and contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain ACA-mandated fees, including the so-called “Cadillac” tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. The extent to which any of these, or additional, changes to the ACA may impact our business remains uncertain, but it is clear that concrete steps are being taken by Congress and the Trump administration to further repeal and replace certain aspects of the ACA. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. In the case of BELVIQ, Medicare explicitly excludes coverage of drugs for weight loss.
 In countries outside the United States, pricing of pharmaceutical products may be subject to governmental control. Evaluation criteria used by many government agencies for the purposes of pricing and reimbursement typically focus on a product’s degree of innovation and its ability to meet a clinical need unfulfilled by currently available therapies. Some countries operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Healthcare fraud and abuse. Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims laws.
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or provide any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, service or item, including the prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and 
 16


Medicaid. Some of the state prohibitions are broader in scope and apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 In the course of practicing medicine, physicians may legally prescribe FDA-approved drugs for an indication that has not been approved by the FDA and which, therefore, is not described in the product’s approved labeling, so-called “off-label use” or “the practice of medicine,” if deemed appropriate in the physicians’ professional medical judgment. The FDA does not ordinarily regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA and other government agencies do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use by a manufacturer or those acting on behalf of a manufacturer. Companies may not promote FDA-approved drugs for off-label uses. The FDA and other governmental agencies do permit a manufacturer (and those acting on its behalf) to engage in some limited, non-misleading, non-promotional exchanges of scientific information regarding unapproved indications.
 There are numerous federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws that forbid, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal, civil and/or administrative sanctions, including individual imprisonment, disgorgement, criminal fines and civil monetary penalties, possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), and integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. In addition, under certain healthcare fraud and abuse laws, there is an ability for private individuals to bring similar actions. Additionally, many states have analogous fraud and abuse laws, some of which may be broader in scope. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. The federal transparency requirements under the ACA require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests. Additionally, recent federal legislation imposes additional obligations on certain pharmaceutical manufacturers, among others, regarding drug product tracking and tracing.
 Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
 Healthcare privacy and security laws. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition, many state laws apply to the use and disclosure of health information. We may be subject to, or our collaborators’ marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA and its implementing regulations. In addition, the European Union has established its own data security and privacy legal framework, including but not limited to Directive 95/46/EC, or the Data Protection Directive. The Data Protection Directive will be replaced starting in May 2018 with the recently adopted European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which contains new provisions specifically directed at the processing of health information, higher sanctions and extra-territoriality measures intended to bring non-EU companies under the regulation. We may in the future expand our business operations to include additional operations in the EU, including potentially conducting preclinical and clinical trials. With such expansion, we would be subject to increased governmental regulation, including the GDPR, in the EU countries in which operate.
 Manufacturing, Revenues from External Customers, Sources and Availability of Materials, and Long-Lived Assets
 We have certain drug product facility assets, including manufacturing facility production licenses, fixtures, equipment, other personal property and real estate assets in Zofingen, Switzerland. We are using this facility to manufacture and package BELVIQ as well as for toll manufacturing of certain drug products for Siegfried and other customers. Under the Sale Agreement with Siegfried, we expect to transfer such manufacturing facility and related assets to Siegfried, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary closing conditions specified in the Sale Agreement.
 Our revenues of $21.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, included $12.0 million, or 56.2%, from Everest, $5.1 or 23.8%, from Boehringer Ingelheim and $1.7 million, or 8.0%, from Eisai. Our revenues of $92.2 million for the year ended December 
 17


31, 2016, included $78.4 million, or 85.1%, from Eisai, $5.1 million, or 5.5%, from Boehringer Ingelheim and $4.2 million, or 4.6%, from Ildong. Our revenues of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, included $8.6 million, or 64.0%, from Eisai, $3.4 million, or 25.0%, from Ildong and $1.1 million, or 8.5%, from Axovant. This information excludes revenue activity reported within discontinued operations. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information.
  We purchase raw materials, starting materials, intermediates, active pharmaceutical ingredients, excipients and other materials from commercial sources. To decrease the risk of an interruption to our supply, when we believe it is reasonable for us to do so, we source these materials from multiple suppliers so that, in general, the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on commercial production. However, currently we have only one or a limited number of suppliers for some of these materials. The loss of a primary source of supply would potentially delay our production. Our facility in Zofingen, Switzerland is currently the only manufacturer of finished drug product for BELVIQ. 
 The carrying value of long-lived assets located in the United States and Switzerland were $30.1 million and $8.7 million, respectively, at December 31, 2017. The carrying value of long-lived assets located in the United States and Switzerland were $35.1 million and $11.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2016. The carrying value of long-lived assets located in the United States and Switzerland were $41.5 million and $38.1 million, respectively, at December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2017, the long-lived assets located in Switzerland are reported under assets of disposal group held for sale in our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
 Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 Our research and development programs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. In the United States, we are subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the CSA and other federal, state or local regulations.
 With regard to Arena GmbH’s drug product manufacturing facility, Arena GmbH has contracted with Siegfried to provide certain safety, health and environmental services. Arena GmbH is subject to regulation under the Environmental Protection Act (Umweltschutzgesetz, USG), the Chemicals Act (Chemikaliengesetz, ChemG), and the Federal Act on the Protection of Waters (Gewässerschutzgesetz, GSchG), which refer to several ordinances such as the Ordinance on Air Pollution Control (Luftreinhalte-Verordnung, LRV), the Ordinance on Incentive Taxes on Volatile Organic Compounds (Verordnung über die Lenkungsabgabe auf flüchtigen organischen Verbindungen, VOCV), the Water Protection Ordinance (Gewässerschutzverordnung, GSchV), the Ordinance of the Handling of Wastes (Verordnung über den Verkehr mit Abfällen, VeVA), the Chemicals Ordinance (Chemikalienverordnung, ChemV), the Chemical Risk Reduction Ordinance (Chemikalien-Risikoreduktions-Verordnung, ChemRRV) and the Ordinance on Protection against Major Accidents (Störfallverordnung, StFV). The competent authorities in Switzerland for the implementation of environmental regulations are BAFU (Bundesamt für Umwelt / Federal Office for the Environment), which is the Swiss federal agency for the environment, and the respective authorities of the Canton of Aargau (Abteilung für Umwelt, AfU). Furthermore, the BAFU and the BAG (Bundesamt für Gesundheit / Federal Office of Public Health) share authorities with regard to the implementation and, together with the respective authority of the Canton of Aargau (Amt für Verbraucherschutz), the supervision of compliance with the laws and regulations related to chemicals. Occupational health and safety is regulated, in particular, by the EKAS (Eidgenössische Koordinationskommission für Arbeitssicherheit) guideline No. 6508 (ASA), governing the evaluation of worker safety and the reporting to the relevant authorities. The competent authority for the implementation of occupational health and safety regulations is the Canton of Aargau (Amt für Wirtschaft und Arbeit), whereby exposure limits are set by SUVA (Schweizerische Unfallversicherungsanstalt), which is the Swiss Accident Insurance Fund.
 We may be subject to further such regulations in the future. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
 Research and Development Expenses
 Research and development activities are the primary source of our expenses. Our research and development expenses include personnel costs, facility and equipment costs, clinical and preclinical study fees, research supplies, and manufacturing costs for non-commercial products. Such expenses totaled $71.0 million, $63.8 million, and $83.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. For research and development sponsored by collaborators for which we initially incur the costs, we record the costs within research and development expenses and record the reimbursements we receive from the collaborators for these

costs within revenues; these expenses and revenues totaled $2.9 million, $2.8 million, and $1.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.
 Employees
 As of March 9, 2018, we had a total of 159 employees, including 122 in research, development and manufacturing and 37 in administration, which includes finance, legal, facilities, information technology and other general support areas. This includes the approximately 50 employees that we expect will be transferred to Siegfried as part of the sale of our manufacturing operations in Switzerland.
