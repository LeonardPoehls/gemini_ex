ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Overview
 ShoreTel is a leading provider of brilliantly simple business communication solutions. We focus on the small and medium sized businesses seeking a Unified Communications (UC) solution allowing them to communicate anytime, anyplace and through any device that they chose.
 We provide this to the market via two solutions: ShoreTel Connect, our UC solution, and Contact Center offering and ShoreTel Summit, our platform for creating microservices. ShoreTel Connect delivers a fully featured UC solution and applications such as mobility, collaboration, and workgroups. ShoreTel Connect is unique in that it offers three different delivery models including cloud, onsite and hybrid. Connect Cloud provides a hosted voice solution to our customers. Connect Onsite provides our customers the ability to independently own and operate their equipment. Connect Hybrid enables our customers to use both our cloud and onsite offerings while still delivering the same user experience and providing our customers increased choice and flexibility. Summit, our Communications Platform as a Service (CPaaS) offering, delivers the option to create microservices or deeply integrate communications into any application or workflow.
 We believe our solutions address changes in the UC market being driven by both technological advances and new workplace trends. We believe some of the current factors affecting the UC market include: the shift to consuming communications from the cloud, addressing an increasingly mobile workforce, the ongoing need for collaboration, a desire for multiple forms of communication and a need to integrate communications into workflows and applications. Our solutions are sold through our extensive network of over 1,100 authorized resellers and value-added distributors throughout the world served either by national distributors or by ShoreTel directly. 
 We were originally incorporated in California in September 1996 and reincorporated in Delaware in 2007. ShoreTel is based in Sunnyvale, California, and has regional offices in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia.
 Pending Merger
 On July 26, 2017, we entered into a definitive Agreement and Plan of Merger (Merger Agreement) with Mitel US Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation, Shelby Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (Merger Sub) and, with respect to certain obligations set forth in the Merger Agreement, Mitel Networks Corporation, a Canadian corporation. Pursuant to and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub has commenced an all-cash tender offer for any and all of ShoreTels outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, at a purchase price of $7.50 per share, net to the seller in cash, without interest, and subject to any required withholding of taxes. The transaction is subject to certain conditions, including the tender of at least one share more than half of all our common stock outstanding as well as regulatory and other related approvals. We have agreed to operate our business in the ordinary course during the period between the execution of the Merger Agreement and the effective time of the merger and have agreed to certain other customary restrictions on its operations, as set forth in the Merger Agreement.

  Evolution of Business Communications
 We believe ShoreTel is at the forefront of the UC industry that is in transition. We believe customers seek flexibility and choice when making a purchase decision relating to Business Communications. We also deliver the ability to deeply integrate into an existing workflow or application. Providing our customers the capability to create communications-focused microservices or integrate communications affords us a unique differentiator in the UC market.

 Hosted Architecture and Services for Hosted Customers
 Our hosted services offer a secure and reliable business communications solution to organizations with minimal capital investment. At the heart of the hosted service is our call control technology, designed and developed by ShoreTel, culminating decades of our telephony experience. This technology was specifically designed to meet the unique requirements of the hosted communications market, offering a full portfolio of services to customers, including soft-switch services for ShoreTel Internet Protocol (IP) Telephony, as well as integrated software modules for ShoreTel Unified Communications, ShoreTel Contact Center, Business Intelligence Analytics and Reporting. By taking advantage of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), we can focus on delivering multi-tenant software serving many customers simultaneously. Hosted technologies are complemented by a series of service modules that enable billing, diagnostics, system monitoring, Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA) regulatory compliance, emergency call routing and other related operational services. A variety of customer selectable network services are also available, including local and long distance network services, toll-free numbers, number porting, circuits from carriers and other value-added network services.
Hosted Operations
 We have a centrally managed platform consisting of data management, monitoring and security, control and billing systems that support our hosted services. This platform consists of a customer quotation portal, customer provisioning, customer access, fraud control, network security, call routing, call monitoring, media processing and normalization, call reliability, call record storage and billing. Our platform monitors our process of digitizing and compressing voice and video into packets and transmitting these packets over data networks around the world. We maintain a call switching platform that manages call control and routes calls.

We serve a wide range of vertical markets, including professional services, financial services, government, education, health care, sports and entertainment, manufacturing, non-profit organizations and technology industries.
Focus on Customer Satisfaction 
 We conduct formal customer reviews that involve our internal staff and third-party technical personnel to ensure smooth implementations and to resolve any issues that may arise. We follow up with ongoing check-ins to ensure customers are satisfied with their solution, surveying them regarding various aspects of the experience with ShoreTel. We use industry-recognized Net Promoter ScoreSM customer loyalty metrics to help ensure that we are meeting our customers expectations. Through this process, we gain valuable insights into the existing and future requirements of our customers activities and this helps us develop product enhancements that address the evolving requirements of customers.
 Additionally, to promote high-quality support throughout our services organization, we measure performance indicators of our services organization, including call answer times, call abandon rates, customer satisfaction with technical support, time to issue resolution, first contact resolution, call interaction quality, as well as customer satisfaction with system implementation, training services and technical support, and use the results to direct the management of our services organization.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  We also monitor our customers satisfaction with our channel partners by surveying our customers after the system is installed.
 Sales and Marketing
 We sell our onsite products, support and services primarily through an extensive network of channel partners that include value-added resellers, service providers, direct market resellers and value-added distributors. Our hosted services are sold through channel partners and our direct sales force. As of June 30, 2017, we had over 1,100 channel partners in our network. These channel partners range in size from single-site, regional firms with specialized products and services to multi-national firms that provide a full range of IT products and services. They also include top U.S. telecommunication carriers: AT&T and CenturyLink. Our channel partners market and sell our products into both the small-to-medium and mid-enterprise markets. Our channel partners in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia may offer both onsite and cloud solutions to their customers. In addition to our network of channel partners we utilize master agents and through them thousands of agents to promote and sell our hosted services.
 We maintain a sales organization that manages the business relationship between ShoreTel and our partner network and master agents, recruiting, training and enabling them to market, sell and support ShoreTel solutions. In addition, we also have a ‘Client Sales team of sales personnel to assist our channel partners in selling to and providing support for customer accounts.
 Research and Development
 We have assembled a team of engineers with expertise in collaboration and UC technology, such as voice, messaging, conferencing, video, mobility, file sharing, contact center and workspaces. We have invested significant time and financial resources into the development of our architecture, including ShoreTel Connect, ShoreTel Summit, ShoreTel Connect Contact Center and ShoreTel Connect appliances which are available for both hosted and onsite customers.
Manufacturing and Suppliers
 We outsource the manufacturing of our hardware products. 
 Currently, we have arrangements for the production of our phones, switches and mobility routers with a contract manufacturer with multiple locations including the United States and China. We also rely on a sole or limited number of suppliers for several key components utilized in the assembly of our products. 
 We regularly provide forecasts for orders, and we order products from our contract manufacturers based on our projected sales levels, which is in advance of receiving customer orders. However, customers may generally cancel or reschedule orders without penalty, and delivery schedules requested by customers for these orders frequently vary based upon each customers particular needs.
 For more information on risks related to products and components, see Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - Our business may be harmed if our contract manufacturers are not able to provide us with adequate supplies and Risks Related to Our Business and Industry - Our products incorporate some sole sourced components and the inability of these sole source suppliers to provide adequate supplies of these components may prevent us from selling our products for a significant period of time or limit our ability to deliver sufficient amounts of our products.
 We typically fulfill product orders out of our California, New York, United Kingdom, Australia or Singapore warehouses.

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  Competition
 The market for business communication solutions is quickly evolving, highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change. As a result of the convergence of voice, video, messaging, mobility and data networking technologies that characterize IP enterprise UC solutions, we compete against vendors of hosted solutions and premise-based solutions, some of which have solutions in both markets and CPaaS providers.

• | Providers of cloud services include Tier 1 service providers such as AT&T, Telstra, British Telecom, Verizon, incumbent local exchange carriers, competitive local exchange carriers, and independent providers such as 8x8, RingCentral, Mitel, West IP Communications, Fuze, Vonage and Amazon Connect.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers of hosted communication services based on technologies from Avaya, Broadsoft, Cisco, Microsoft, Mitel, Unify and other technology platform vendors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers of premise-based business communication equipment include Avaya, Cisco, Mitel, NEC and Unify.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers of Unified Communications software applications, include Avaya, Cisco, Interactive Intelligence, Microsoft, Mitel, NEC and Unify.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providers of CPaaS include Twilio, Plivo, Vonage with Nexmo, Avaya Zang, Cisco Tropo and other API based technology platform vendors.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


In addition, because the market for our products is subject to rapid technological change as the market evolves, we may face competition in the future from companies that do not currently compete in the enterprise unified communications market, including companies that currently compete in other sectors of the information technology, communications and software industries, Infrastructure-as-a-Service companies or communications companies that serve consumer rather than enterprise customers.
 We may also face increased competition from Internet portal-focused providers who extend their portfolio to include business communications solutions, such as Amazon, Skype/Microsoft and Google.
 As more enterprises converge their voice and data networks, the business information technology and communication applications deployed on converged networks will become more integrated. We may face increased competition from current leaders in information technology infrastructure, information technology, personal and business applications and the software that connects the network infrastructure to those applications.
 We could also face competition from new market entrants, whether from new ventures or from established companies moving into the market. Competition from these other potential market entrants may take many forms, including offering products and applications like those we offer as part of a larger, bundled offering or as a cloud-based or hosted services offering. In addition, technological developments and consolidation within the communications industry result in frequent changes to our group of competitors.
 Many of our current and potential competitors are substantially larger than we are and have higher brand familiarity with buyers, and significantly greater financial, sales, marketing, distribution, technical, manufacturing and other resources. We believe that we currently compete favorably with regard to the principal competitive factors applicable to our solutions, which include price, portfolio, feature set, reliability, scalability, usability, simplicity, total cost of ownership, customer satisfaction and service.
 For more information concerning competition, please see Risk Factors Risks Related to Our Business and Industry – The market in which we operate is intensely competitive, and many of our competitors are larger, more established and better capitalized than we are and – As voice, video, messaging and data networks converge, we are likely to face increased competition from companies in the information technology, personal and business applications and software industries.
 Regulatory
 Voice over IP (VoIP) communication services, like ours, have been subject to less regulation at the state and federal levels than traditional telecommunications services. Providers of traditional telecommunications services are subject to the highest degree of regulation, while providers of information services are largely exempt from most federal and state regulations governing traditional common carriers. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has subjected VoIP service providers to a smaller subset of regulations 


 9

 TABLE OF CONTENTS
  that apply to traditional telecommunications service providers and have not yet classified VoIP services as either telecommunications or information. However, the FCC reviews the status of VoIP service providers and the services they provide and may increase regulations that apply to hosted services.
 The effect of any future laws, regulations and orders on the hosted offering is unknown at this time. But as a general matter, increased regulation and the imposition of additional funding obligations increases service costs that may or may not be recoverable from our customers. This increased regulation could result in making our services less competitive with traditional telecommunications services if we increase our retail prices or decreasing our profit margins if we attempt to absorb such costs.
 Intellectual Property
 A factor of our success as a company is our ability to protect our core technology and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections.
 As of June 30, 2017, we had 157 patents issued in the United States, and had 30 patent applications in the United States. Our patents have been both internally developed and externally acquired. Our patents have a range of expiration dates. The earliest patent expired in 2016, and the last to expire will do so in 2035.
 The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not be adequate. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights and may challenge our issued patents. In addition, other parties may independently develop similar or competing technologies designed around any patents that are or may be issued to us. We intend to enforce our intellectual property rights vigorously, and from time to time, we may initiate claims against third parties that we believe are infringing on our intellectual property rights if we are unable to resolve matters satisfactorily through negotiation. If we fail to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could offer similar products, potentially significantly harming our competitive position and decreasing our revenue.
 Employees
 As of June 30, 2017, we had 1,158 employees in North America, Europe, Asia and Australia, of which 357 were in sales and marketing, 401 were in research and development, 262 were in global support and services, and 138 were in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by labor unions and we consider current employee relations to be good.
