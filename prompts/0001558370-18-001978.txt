 ITEM 1.       BUSINESS
 Overview
 We are a leading provider of application-specific, ultra-low power non-volatile memory, or NVM, products. We optimize our NVM products for Internet of Things, or IoT, applications including current and next-generation Internet-connected devices in the consumer, industrial, medical and wearables markets. We combine our NVM design capabilities with proprietary intellectual property and differentiated technology platforms to deliver high-performance products that dramatically reduce the overall energy consumption of our customers’ systems and extend battery life. Our products feature embedded intelligence in a small form factor and high reliability.
 We sell our products directly to leading original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers, or OEMs and ODMs, respectively, that manufacture products for our end customers. In general, we work directly with our customers to have our NVM devices designed into and qualified for their products, which we refer to as design wins. Although we maintain direct sales, support and development relationships with our end customers, most of our products are sold to those end customers through distributors.
 We were originally incorporated in California in January 2006, and reincorporated in Delaware in October 2015. We completed our initial public offering, or IPO, of common stock in October 2015.Our principal executive offices are located at 3600 Peterson Way, Santa Clara, California 95054 and our telephone number is (408) 400‑0578. Our website is www.adestotech.com. The contents of our website are not incorporated into, or otherwise to be regarded as part of, this Annual Report on Form 10‑K.
 Our Products
 We offer six product families, DataFlash, Fusion Serial Flash, Standard Serial Flash, EcoXiP, Mavriq and Moneta, which are manufactured using two technology platforms: industry-standard “floating gate” technology and our proprietary Conductive Bridging Random Access Memory, or CBRAM, technology. We optimize our products to operate at a wide voltage range, allowing continued operation even as the battery discharges and reaches very low power levels, where commodity NVM devices typically fail. Operating intelligence, such as low power mode, is designed into our products to help systems save energy. Our products allow for greater storage efficiency than competing commodity NVM products in logging small packets of data for the IoT. This reduces microcontroller unit burden on system resources and allows for less frequent re-write cycles, enabling dramatic increases in battery life and enhancing the reliability of the flash memory components. By incorporating power management features in our NVM products, we enable our customers to reduce the number of included components and the overall footprint of their systems, thereby lowering the total cost of their systems. Some of our new products can significantly improve system performance and power consumption by enabling the use of intelligent design to accelerate data handling capability between microprocessor and memory components.

EcoXiP also features the ability to perform concurrent read and write functions to improve system performance. EcoXiP also includes configurable strength input/output pins and a range of power management features to enable reduced device and system power consumption.
 Key components of our Mavriq and Moneta architectures include low-energy read and ultra-fast direct write capability and the ability to switch to deep power down between transactions to extend battery life. In addition, the Moneta memory products’ low power capability is ideal for energy harvesting applications.
 Customers
 Our end customers include leading tier‑1 OEMs and ODMs that use our products across multiple industries and applications, including next-generation Internet-connected appliances, wearables, smart meters, sensors and medical devices. We have also secured a number of reference design wins for Bluetooth 4.0 and Z-Wave products for Home Automation applications. During the year ended December 31, 2017, more than 2,000 end customers purchased our products. We generate most of our revenue from sales of our products to two independent, non-exclusive distributors, which many of our end customers use as an alternative means of fulfillment to direct purchases from us. For the year ended December 31, 2017, sales of our products to Arrow Electronics and SAS Electronic Company accounted for approximately 18% and 10%, respectively, of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales of our products to Arrow Electronics and SAS Electronic Company accounted for approximately 14% and 11%, respectively, of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, sales of our products to Arrow Electronics, SAS Electronic Company, and Avnet Inc. accounted for approximately 17%, 12% and 11%, respectively, of our revenue. While no end customers accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in 2017 through direct sales, one end customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenue in 2016 and 2015 through sales to distributors. A majority of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017 was generated by approximately 45 end customers. Sales
 We sell our products through our worldwide sales organization and through our channel of representatives and distributors to OEMs and ODMs. End customers primarily fulfill and procure product orders through our distribution partners. We have sales personnel covering three primary regions, the Americas, Asia Pacific and Europe, Middle East and Africa. Manufacturing
 We employ a fabless manufacturing business model and rely on third-party suppliers for all phases of the manufacturing process, including fabrication, assembly and testing. Our fabless business model allows us to leverage the expertise of industry-leading suppliers in such areas as fabrication, assembly, quality control and assurance, reliability and testing, and avoid the significant costs and risks associated with owning and operating such manufacturing operations. These suppliers also are responsible for procurement of raw materials used in the production of our products. As a result, we are able to focus our resources on product design, additional quality assurance, marketing and customer support.
 We do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity from any of our suppliers’ facilities for the production of our products. We carefully qualify each of our suppliers and their subcontractors and processes to ensure they meet our standards for quality and reliability.
 Wafer Fabrication
 We currently manufacture the majority of our floating gate solutions in 110nm silicon wafer production process geometries utilizing the services of United Microelectronics Corporation in Taiwan. In early 2015, we commenced developing our first floating gate technology-based flash products in a 65nm process node at XMC, a foundry in Wuhan, China. Our CBRAM-based products are manufactured in 130nm silicon wafer production process geometries by Altis Semiconductor S.N.C., or Altis, in Corbeil-Essonnes, France (acquired by X-FAB Silicon Foundries in 2016). In February 2016, we entered into an agreement with TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Company, or (TPSCo), to manufacture our 45 nm CBRAM products at TPSCo’s 300 nm fabrication facility in Hokuriku, Japan which was subsequently amended in November 2016, February 2017 and December 2017. Assembly, Testing and Wafer Probe
 We maintain multiple sources for assembly and final testing of our products. Amkor Technology, Inc. in Taiwan, Korea and the Philippines as well as Greatek Electronics Inc. in Taiwan currently provide substantially all of our assembly and final test services. Our wafer probing is performed by King Yuan Electronics Co., Ltd. in Taiwan. We continually monitor the manufacturing and testing of our products at all of our contractors to ensure that our manufacturing and testing procedures are properly implemented. As part of our total quality assurance program, our quality management system has been certified to ISO 9001:2008 standards. Our foundry, assembly and test vendors are also ISO 9001 certified. Research and Development
 We believe that our continued success depends on our ability to both introduce improved versions of our existing solutions and to develop new solutions for the markets that we serve. Through our research and development efforts, we intend to continually expand our portfolio of patents to enhance our intellectual property position. As of December 31, 2017, we had a core team of 49 engineers involved in research and development primarily located in our research and development design center at our headquarters in Santa Clara, California. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, our research and development expense was $14.1 million, $15.9 million and $12.8 million, respectively. Competition
 We operate in the highly competitive global semiconductor market in general and the semiconductor memory market in particular. We expect competition to increase and intensify as more and larger semiconductor companies enter our markets. Increased competition could result in price pressure, reduced profitability and loss of market share, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, revenue and operating results.
 Currently, our competitors range from large, international companies offering a wide range of commodity NVM products to companies specializing in other alternative, specialized emerging memory technologies. Our primary competitors in the NVM market include Macronix International Co. Ltd., Micron Technology, Inc., Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, Winbond Electronics Corp., and several China based suppliers who primarily cater to the local markets. Among these large memory suppliers, we compete primarily on an overall value proposition and not on a product or technology basis. We expect competition in our current markets to increase in the future as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings and as new companies enter these markets.
 Our ability to compete successfully depends on elements both within and outside of our control, including industry and general economic trends. Many of our competitors are substantially larger, have greater financial, technical, marketing, distribution, customer support and other resources, are more established than we are, and have significantly better brand recognition and broader product offerings which may enable them to better withstand adverse economic or market conditions in the future.
 Our ability to compete successfully in the rapidly evolving memory market depends on several factors, including:

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | the design, manufacture, commercialization and market adoption of our CBRAM technology that anticipate the power, performance, reliability and integration needs of our customers’ next-generation and application-specific products and applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  We believe we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors.
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our products and technologies from unauthorized third-party copying and use. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trade secrets, copyrights and trademarks, as well as customary contractual protections. As of December 31, 2017, we held 121 patents that expire at various times between June 2020 and March 2036 and had 18 U.S. patent applications pending. We also held 26 foreign patents that expire at various times between May 2021 and July 2032 and had 32 foreign patent applications pending.
 We seek to file for patents that have broad application in the semiconductor industry and that would provide a competitive advantage. However, there can be no assurance that our pending patent application or any future applications will be approved, that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties, or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business. In addition, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property, or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets, or that we can effectively protect our intellectual property.
 In addition to the intellectual property that we developed, we have acquired and licensed technology from third parties for incorporation in our products. In January 2007, we entered into a license agreement with Axon Technologies Corp. Pursuant to this license agreement, we have rights in Axon’s patents and trade secrets covering, among other things, Axon’s programmable metallization cell, or PMC, technology, which is a component of our CBRAM technology. This license provides us with broad rights to use and sub-license this technology, and we have the exclusive right to make, have made by authorized foundries or integrated device manufacturers, use, sell, lease, offer for sale, and import products covered by Axon’s licensed patents and trade secrets in certain fields of use. The license will last for the lifetime of the licensed patents, which currently ends in September 2026. We pay a royalty for use of the licensed intellectual property in our products. In July 2012, we purchased certain flash memory product assets from Atmel Corporation. As part of the asset purchase, Atmel granted us non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable licenses to its patent portfolio for development of flash memory products. In December 2017, we entered into a license agreement with TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Company. The license is for two years and is a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable license to use and evaluate certain TowerJazz technologies.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we had 102 employees. Of these full-time employees, 49 were engaged in research and development, 34 in sales and marketing, nine in operations and support and 10 in general and administrative capacities. The substantial majority of our employees are based in the United States, although we have small numbers of personnel in Europe and Asia. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
