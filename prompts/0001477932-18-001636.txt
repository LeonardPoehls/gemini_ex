ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
New Global Energy, Inc. ("NGE," the "Company," “we,” or “our”) is a sustainable agriculture and aquaculture company organized as a Wyoming corporation on January 24, 2012 with executive offices located in Brevard County, Florida. The Company focuses on the use of advanced technology and farming techniques to decrease its costs while accelerating its ability to meet and exceed production targets in its aquaculture and agriculture divisions. The Company is focused on optimizing internal growth as well as completing acquisitions of high-growth firms, assets and properties in the Green market space that will generate incremental revenue and value for NGE. The industry segments of interest to the Company include: aquaculture, sustainable agriculture, solar, biofuels and carbon credits. Management is targeting growth stage assets, operations and companies that possess a proprietary market edge and demonstrate solid opportunities to scale their business. 
 
The Company’s development plan includes aquaculture (the processes of farming of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, aquatic plants and shrimp) and sustainable agriculture (practice of farming using principles of ecology, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment) . Its development plans also utilize non centralized solar panels to produce power for the Company’s own use and to potentially feed any excess power into the grid serving local power needs.
 
As of May 20, 2013, the Company had completed an incremental acquisitions totaling 30.74% of Aqua Farming Tech, Inc. (“AFT”), a California corporation with aquaculture and agriculture operations in the Coachella Valley in Southern California, from unrelated parties. By the end of 2013, the Company had completed additional incremental acquisitions from unrelated parties bringing its total ownership to in AFT to 36.69%. 
 
In the process of development of its business and during the last two fiscal years, the Company acquired a non-controlling interest in Aqua Farming Tech, Inc. (“AFT”), a California corporation with aquaculture and agriculture operations in the Coachella Valley in Southern California. During 2014, the Company acquired and maintained an equity interest of 36.69% in AFT.
 
On July 15, 2014, the Company for and in consideration of 1,250,043 shares of New Global Energy Inc. common stock, Aquaculture Joint Venture, a Nevada General Partnership, assigned a 43.66% Net Revenue Interest in and to the net revenues from the operations of AFT aquaculture operations in Southern California over a period of time. Cash allocable to the Net Revenue Interest is calculated and distributed on a quarterly basis within forty five (45) days after the end of each calendar quarter.
 
The Company has determined that the acquisition of this 43.6% net revenue interest, considering its previously held equity interest (PHEI), the outstanding debt owed by AFT to the Company and implicit variable interest resulting from the Net Revenue Interest, that AFT was a variable interest entity, of which the Company was considered the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, the Company consolidated AFT as of July 15, 2014.

The Company relies on unpatented proprietary know-how and other trade secrets, and employs various methods, including confidentiality agreements where deemed appropriate, with employees and consultants, customers and suppliers to protect its know-how and trade secrets. However, these methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop the know-how and trade secrets or develop better production methods than us. Further, we may not be able to deter current and former employees, contractors and other parties from breaching confidentiality agreements and misappropriating proprietary information and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our information and proprietary technology licensed, without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. Additionally, we may license in the future, trade secrets, and similar proprietary rights to third parties. While we attempt to ensure that our intellectual property and similar proprietary rights are protected when entering into business relationships, third parties may take actions that could materially and adversely affect our rights or the value of our intellectual property, similar proprietary rights or reputation. In the future, we may also rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights and contractual rights, and, if not successful, we may not be able to protect the value of our intellectual property. Any litigation could be protracted and expensive and funds may not be available to pursue it.

The Company’s focus during the reported period has been on the development of the optimum organizational environment for the growth of food fish and for the growth of agricultural products on adjacent lands. The major impediments to the successful development and operation of aquaculture and agricultural projects has been the difficulty in controlling feed prices, energy costs and control over the price and availability of water.
 
With regard to the control over feed prices in establishing the Company’s optimal farm environment, we have developed a new aquaculture feed regimen which, while using no antibiotics or chemicals, utilizes the superfood Moringa and green algae for Tilapia nutrition during their first four months in grow-out ponds. These nutrient rich algae and other aquatic plants represent a natural environment and provides better cost controls over the feed during Tilapia’s growing cycle.
 
We continue to grow Moringa for use as fish food as well as evaluating opportunities in the multi billion dollar market for this superfood as a human nutritional product. Research from the National Institutes of Health, a part of the US Department of Health and Human Services indicates that “scientists agree this is the most nutrient dense botanical on earth” weighing in with over 92 verifiable cell-ready nutrients including 46 antioxidants, 36 anti-inflammatories, vitamins, minerals, omega oils and 18 amino acids including nine that are rarely found intact within our present food chain. In 2008, the National Institutes of Health named Moringa the “Botanical of the Year” in celebration of Earth Day. In addition to other content, gram for gram Moringa leaves contain: 4 times the calcium of milk; 3 times the Potassium of bananas; 4 times the vitamin A of carrots; 7 times the Vitamin C of Oranges and 2 times the protein of yogurt. In addition of agricultural feed, it can be used as fertilizer, as pulp wood in making paper as well as in making other products. And, it is used in water purification, killing bacteria and pathogenic germs in polluted water.
 
Although the primary use of Moringa grown by the Company to date will be its use in feed for fish, the Company plans to exploit other global opportunities to generate sales. Moringa is sold around the world as a nutraceutical because of it high nutritional and medicinal value.
 
Integration of Aquaculture & Agriculture
 
The NGE business model addresses the need to maximize the cost savings available from alternative energy sources and to use alternative food sources to create a more viable environment for aquaculture operations.
Fish: Aquaculture operations are designed to yield a sustainable food source in a global marketplace where live catches decline each year due to overfishing and other environmental factors. Processing the fish on site yields both a food fish product and SFO (Straight Fish Oil) which can be used to power Diesel generators or sold. Residue from fish processing is sun-dried and used as fish meal. Fish oil can also be used in the nutritional industry. Effluent from the fish tanks and ponds are used to irrigate the on-site crops with a nutrient-rich broth of fertilizer.
Agriculture: Moringa or other products grown on site are currently used primarily in feed for aquaculture operations. The Company’s business plan includes expansion of Moringa cultivation with additional crops to be sold into the nutraceutical market and/or as biomass feed stock. Certain agricultural crops are fertilized with fish effluent using nutrient rich water to increase yields of these crops.

Solar: Electrical power is produced onsite from photovoltaic (“solar cell”) arrays used during daylight hours, to power all plantation operations including pumps, lighting and processing equipment. Should the Company reach levels of power generation beyond that required for operations, any excess power will be fed into the power grid where it will be “banked” under the “net metering” provisions established by the U.S. Energy Policy Act 2005 which requires all public electric utilities to offer net metering on request to their customers. To date, the Company has not reached such power generation levels.
 
Market for Products and Services
 
There is no assurance that expected production levels will be achieved or that there will be any revenues forthcoming.
 
Food Fish: The Company believes that the primary market advantaged aquaculture product in the US is the sale of live fish and shrimp, and non-frozen fish fillets, limiting preferred geographic locations to those near major market areas where established markets now exist. To the extent the market dictates, the Company may enter the frozen fish fillet market. The Company believes there is a significant market for it’s fish production and while it doesn’t have purchase agreements or sales arrangements in place, the initial sales program has shown moderate success with sales in fiscal 2017 reaching $553,000. Prices for fish sold have been determined based on current market pricing for the products with Company’s products being sold at competitive prices. 
 
The Company expects that its primary fish products will continue to include Tilapia (both red and black Tilapia), Catfish and Silver Carp which are currently sold live. The American Tilapia Alliance reports that Tilapia is the 4th most popular seafood in the US. It reports that the US annually imports nearly $1 billion worth of tilapia while producing another 30 million pounds in the US. Worldwide farm raised tilapia is nearly an $8 billion industry. In 2016 the US per capita consumption of tilapia was 1.18 pounds per person of the total US per capita fish consumption of 14.9 pounds per person.
 
GLOBEFISH, of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the UN reported that International demand for tilapia was steady, though the US market was weak. During the first half of 2017, approximately 170,000 tons of tilapia entered the international market. It also reported that during the first half of 2017, total imports of frozen tilapia fillets into the US fell by 15 percent when compared with the same period in 2016. Despite this decline, the US still represents 70 of the tilapia market. Fresh tilapia fillets increased by 3%. In terms of pricing, wholesale prices for fresh chilled tilapia fillets from Latin America have declined by 9.4 percent to USD 3.58 per lb. while prices of frozen fillets from Asia strengthened by 2.6 percent to USD 1.95 per lb. China continues to be the main supplier of tilapia to the US market. Industry sources in Latin America indicate that negative press about tilapia from Asia has contributed to the declining Latin American demand and likely prompted more interest in fresh tilapia fillets from neighboring countries.
 
Moringa: The market for Moringa has been fragmented and is developing with methods of farming, use and proximity of biomass plants to production. The global market for Moringa products was estimated at the recent 3d Global Moringa Meet International Workshop to be over $7 billion by 2020.

Electricity: A secondary market opportunity for the Company is to provide electric power generated onsite from both solar power systems and onsite diesel-powered generators fired by renewable, sustainable biofuel. The Company believes that excess power over what it uses could be sold through net metering agreements and/or power purchase agreements with commercial power providers. These agreements are generally site specific and since the Company has not yet reached power generation levels resulting in excess capacity, it does not yet have any such agreements in place and there is no assurance that sufficient power will be produced beyond that required for its own use.
 
The Company has done an extensive reviews of solar technologies to determine the best currently available technology. It has done initial review and testing of solar technology used with concentrated solar power “CSP” generation and comparison reviews of photovoltaic panel technology. It has developed proposed layouts for CSP systems with thermal storage units which can be used for solar energy production both on and off grid.
