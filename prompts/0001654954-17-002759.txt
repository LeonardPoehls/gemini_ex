  THE CORPORATION
  
  OVERVIEW
  
  We are a vaccine company and are focused on developing next generation vaccines for infectious diseases, with several vaccine candidates in our pipeline: HIV-1/AIDS, intra nasal Influenza, Malaria, Chikungunya, Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) and the Respiratory Syncitial Virus (RSV) vaccine. Our core technology and expertise lays in the use of virosomes, lipid-based carriers containing functional fusion viral proteins and natural membrane proteins, in combination with rationally designed antigens. Our vaccines are designed to induce protection against early transmission and infection, focusing on the mucosal immune response as a first-line defense in combination with humoral and cellular immune responses as a second-line defense, which, for some pathogens, may be essential for the development of an effective prophylactic vaccine We believe that virosomes are the most promising vaccine delivery systems since they do not use live attenuated or killed pathogens and increase the immunogenicity and stability of the vaccine.
  
  We currently do not make, market or sell any products, but we generate some revenue through collaboration projects, grant funding and R&D services. We believe that our research and development activities will result in valuable intellectual property and know-how that can generate significant revenues for us in the future such as by licensing. Vaccines are one of the fastest growing markets in the pharmaceutical industry. Vaccines have evolved from being an exclusively low price sector to one where substantial prices may be paid for some vaccine products that address unmet medical needs.
  
  HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE COMPANY
  
  We were incorporated in July 1994 pursuant to the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania under the name "PDG Remediation, Inc." In November 1996, we reincorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware and changed our name to "ICHOR Corporation." In July 2001, we changed our name to "Mymetics Corporation."
  
  In March 2001, we acquired 99.9% of the outstanding shares of the French registered company Mymetics S.A. in consideration for shares of our common stock and shares of Class B Exchangeable Preferential Non-Voting Stock of 6543 Luxembourg S.A., which were convertible into shares of our common stock. In 2002, we acquired all but 0.01% of the remaining outstanding common stock of Mymetics S.A. pursuant to share exchanges with the remaining stockholders of Mymetics S.A. The terms of these share exchanges were substantially similar to the terms of the share exchange that occurred in March 2001. In 2004, all the remaining convertible shares of 6543 Luxembourg S.A. not already held by Mymetics Corporation were converted into shares of Mymetics Corporation. On February 7, 2006, the Tribunal de Commerce in Lyon, France placed the French subsidiary Mymetics S.A., under receivership ("Redressement Judiciaire") and this subsidiary was subsequently officially closed by the Tribunal de Commerce in Lyon on March 21, 2012.
  
  We own all of the outstanding voting stock of: (i) Mymetics S.A., a company originally organized as Mymetics Management Sаrl in 2007 under the laws of Switzerland, (ii) Bestewil Holding B.V. and (iii) Bestewil Holding B.V’s subsidiary Mymetics B.V. (formerly Virosome Biologicals B.V.) both of which are organized under the laws of The Netherlands and were acquired in 2009. In this document, unless the context otherwise requires, "Mymetics" and the "Corporation" refer to Mymetics Corporation and its subsidiaries.
  
  MYMETICS S.A.
  
  Our Swiss subsidiary Mymetics S.A. was founded in 2007 as Mymetics Management Sàrl to facilitate the conduct of our business in Switzerland. This includes managing our staff retirement and social security contributions, leasing our Swiss premises and other such local tasks which a U.S. registered company cannot easily conduct without significant legal and organizational costs. The change in name and bylaws affected in 2009, from “Société à Responsabilité Limitée » (SàRL) to “Société Anonyme” (SA) is indicative of the transition from a pure service company status of this unit to a development company in its own rights within Mymetics Corporation.

  BESTEWIL HOLDING B.V. and its subsidiary MYMETICS B.V.
  
  On April 1, 2009 we entered into an agreement with Norwood Immunology Limited (“NIL”) for the acquisition of Bestewil Holding B.V. (“Bestewil”) from its parent, NIL, under a Share Purchase Agreement pursuant to which we agreed to purchase all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock (the “Bestewil Shares”) of Bestewil from its parent, NIL, and all issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Virosome Biologicals B.V. which were held by Bestewil. Virosome Biologicals B.V., the name of which was subsequently changed to Mymetics B.V., continues to be engaged in research and development activities in its own facilities in Leiden (Netherlands) under the management of its founder, the original inventor of the virosome technology.
 STRATEGY
  
 With only 26 diseases addressed by vaccines in the world today, it is a well-known fact that the world needs many more vaccines and focus on prevention.
  
  Our vision is to become the market leader in the research and development of new generation virosome and membrane protein based vaccines for infectious diseases.
  
  By using virosomes as a delivery platform, Mymetics vaccine candidates do not use live attenuated or killed pathogens, while increasing the immunogenicity and stability of the vaccine.
  
 Moreover, the company’s vaccines are designed to induce protection against early transmission and infection, focusing both on the mucosal immune response as a first-line defense and on the systemic humoral (blood) immune response, which, for some pathogens, may be essential for the development of an effective prophylactic vaccine.
  
  Our strategy is to strengthen our virosome and membrane protein know how, expertise and intellectual property and extend the application of our key scientific approaches to new vaccines by:
  
   ●
 Leveraging the effective and safe virosome vaccine technology and know-how

   ●
 Building on our leading expertise in membrane proteins and lipid membranes

   ●
 Leveraging our expertise in incorporating adjuvants and antigens in the lipid membranes

   ●
 Advancing existing vaccine candidates through Phase II clinical trials with our partners

   ●
 Maintaining a comprehensive IP portfolio

   ●
 Adopting a flexible cost model based on a combination of in-house expertise and best-in-class outsourcing

   ●
 Entering into strategic partnerships with leading pharmaceutical companies and research organizations

 
 This approach has resulted in the development of a rich pipeline of promising vaccine candidates in either the pre-clinical or Phase I stage of development and a strong validation through world leading partnerships.
  
  PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT
  
  Our current pipeline has proprietary vaccines in development: HIV-1, malaria, Chikungunya, herpes simplex virus type I and II (HSV-1 and HSV-II), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and intra-nasal influenza vaccine. The vaccines in our portfolio are primarily prophylactic. The current stage of development of these vaccines is shown in the table below:

Vaccine | Pre-Clinical | Phase I
------------+--------------+--------
HIV-1 | | X 
RSV | On hold | 
HSV | On hold | 
Malaria | | X 
Influenza | | X

  HIV-1 and AIDS
  
  HIV-1 (human immunodeficiency virus type 1) is a retrovirus that gradually destroys the immune system and ultimately leads to AIDS. HIV-1 is among the pathogens harboring the highest genetic variation, leading to millions of variants, each rapidly mutating. Indeed, HIV-1 exists under many different versions (aka “clades”), like members of a large family; they are different from, but related to each other.
  
  Our current prophylactic HIV-1 vaccine candidate is constituted of virosomes linked to conserved antigens (epitopes) derived from the HIV-1 gp41 proteins from the clade B, the dominant clade found in Europe and North America. The vaccine is designed to trigger blood and mucosal antibodies of both isotype IgG and IgA, for example in the vaginal and intestinal tracts. The rationale for the design of the vaccine was based on the observation that certain people who are repeatedly exposed to HIV-1 do not contract infection; they were shown to have mucosal antibodies in the semen or vaginal secretions against the HIV-1 gp41 that apparently protect them. We intend for our vaccine to imitate “Mother Nature”.
  
  Key scientific results with the HIV vaccine to date:
  
  2005: “Proof of Concept” for inducing mucosal antibodies. Vaccination of rabbits with virosomes-P1 elicited mucosal antibodies in the vagina and intestinal mucosa. P1 is a synthetic peptide corresponding to the C-terminal end of the C-helix ectodomain of the gp41. In a laboratory test, these antibodies strongly inhibited HIV-1 passage through the mucosal tissues, also called trancytosis, confirming the potential of developing an HIV-1 vaccine that prevents infection at the mucosal layer.
  
  2006/2007: Mucosal antibodies in monkeys. Macaque monkeys (Macaca Mulatta), from Chinese origin, showed after vaccination with virosomes-P1, specific mucosal antibodies, which were detected in more than 90% of the animals and harboring the potential to block in-vitro HIV-1 trancytosis, confirming the rabbit data.
 
  2008: Full protection of monkeys against multiple vaginal challenges with live heterologous clade B virus. Macaque monkeys from Chinese origin were vaccinated with both virosomes-modified P1 and virosomes-rgp41 (vaccine MYM-V201.) One month after the last vaccination, animals received multiple intra-vaginal challenges with the live SHIVSF162P3 virus. The vaccinated animals that developed mucosal antibodies with trancytosis inhibition activity were not infected with the virus, while the placebo vaccinated control group was fully infected.
  
  Dec 2008: Approval to start Phase I clinical trials. After the ground breaking results of the monkey study in 2006 and 2008, a Phase I study proposal (IMPD, IB, clinical protocol, etc.) was submitted and approved by the Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) of the Ghent University Hospital. Mymetics received the approval and authorization from the Federal Agency for Medicines and Health Products (FAGG) in Belgium to conduct the clinical trial MYM-V101-CT08-101 (EudraCT number 2008-007306-10) for testing the drug product MYM-V101 (virosomes with the modified and lipidated P1).
  
  Sep.- Oct. 2009: Production of the GMP-grade vaccine (MYMV101: virosomes-modified P1) for a Phase I clinical trial in Belgium. European competent authorities require GMP-grade products for clinical phase I. GMP-grade products are notoriously more difficult and costly to produce than GLP-grade ones. Succeeding in the GMP production is considered a major achievement.
  
  Dec. 2009 - Sep. 2010: Phase I clinical trial –“proof of principle” with the final signed report in July 2011. The trial demonstrated that virosomes-modified P1 can induce mucosal antibodies in the genital tract of women, and confirmed the immunogenicity data previously obtained on monkeys. The drug product MYMV-101 was used as a vaccine in a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase I study at CEVAC (Ghent, Belgium), involving 24 healthy women randomized in two Panels to monitor safety and mucosal immunogenicity. In each Panel, eight subjects received the vaccine and four subjects received the placebo through intra-muscular and intra-nasal administrations. The Phase I clinical trial achieved its primary objective and showed that the HIV vaccine MYMV101 was safe and well tolerated by healthy women. The secondary objective was also met as the presence of IgG and IgA antibodies in the serum of all vaccinated women was detected. Further, samples showed that mucosal antibodies in the vaginal and rectal secretions were present. Tested vaginal secretions could block in vitro the HIV-1 transcytosis, confirming the previous pre-clinical work. Mymetics could claim a shelf life of nine months for its MYM-V101 drug product. Results were published in PlosOne, February 20, 2013.

  Oct. 2014 – to date: Start of a non-human primate study in collaboration with Texas Biomedical Research Institute in San Antonio, Texas which is funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Objective of the study is to confirm the results obtained in previous pre-clinical studies and investigate the role of the two antigens. On April 11, 2016, the Company announced results that its HIV vaccine candidate was shown to generate significant protection in groups of 12 female monkeys against repeated AIDS virus exposures during part of the preclinical study. During the first part of the study the Mymetics’ two-component virosome-based HIV vaccine was able to show significant efficacy of 87% in delaying the time to persistent infection versus the control group after seven intravaginal virus challenges. The study aimed to mimic the exposure of women to semen from HIV-infected men, although the viral dose of each of these seven animal challenges represented about 70,000 times the average human HIV dose passed during sexual intercourse from an HIV-infected male to an uninfected female. During the second part of the study the animal viral challenge dose was increased by 50% starting from the 8th challenge onward, reaching more than 100,000 times the average amount of virus passed from an infected man to a female partner. At this virus dose, the vaccine did not show significant protection in the animals as the immune system was overloaded. The Company is continuing its collaboration with the Texas Biomedical Research Institute and Gates Foundation funded laboratories to analyze the serum and mucosal samples to better understand the mechanisms of action of the vaccine.
  
  The Company was selected to receive project grants funded as part of Horizon 2020, the European Union research and innovation framework program and by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) for the Swiss based consortium partners. The grant will fund the evaluation, development and manufacturing scale-up of thermos-stable and cold-chain independent nano-pharmaceutical virosome-based vaccine candidates. The consortium partners are Catalent UK Swindon Zydis Ltd, Chimera Biotec GmbH (Germany), Upperton Ltd. (UK) and Bachem AG (Switzerland). The project duration is 42 months and started on May 4, 2015.
  
  Next steps:
   Depending on the findings from the Texas Biomedical Research Institute regarding the mechanismsm of actions of our vaccine candidate, we will start the planning of the clinical trial development for the Mymetics HIV vaccine candidate, building on the previous Phase I that already showed a good safety and tolerance profile and the induction of mucosal and humoral antibodies. Funding for the clinical trial development will be sought from partners and grant funding organizations. A combined Phase I/II on women and men might start by the end 2018 and an eventual market launch is not anticipated before 2025.
  
  Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV)
  
 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a disease that causes infections of the lower respiratory tract, mainly in infants and young children. The virus, which belongs to the Paramyxoviridae family, can cause symptoms similar to the common cold, but can also lead to otitis media (middle ear infection), pneumonia, and bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung). Infection with RSV early in life can increase the chances of developing recurrent wheezing and asthma. Globally, RSV is responsible for over 30 million new acute lower respiratory infection episodes annually and up to 199,000 deaths in children under five years old, with 99 percent of these deaths occurring in low-resource countries. It’s so widespread in the United States that nearly all children become infected with the virus before their second birthdays. The elderly population is also at risk of severe RSV disease.
  
  Approach: The RSV vaccine consists of the reconstituted membrane of RSV containing the native viral proteins, which can be adjuvanted with a lipopeptide or other adjuvants. In mice, our RSV vaccine was shown to induce cellular and humoral immunity to the virus, with a balanced Th1/Th2 response, resulting in protection against a live virus challenge, and without inducing “enhanced disease” (a skewed Th1/Th2 response being the hallmark of enhanced disease). In cotton rats, a better model than mice for RSV, the vaccine protected against a live virus challenge, without inducing enhanced disease. In a direct comparison with the 1960’s vaccine of another pharmaceutical company that caused severe safety issues in infants, another group of cotton rats was immunized with formaldehyde-inactivated virus, and developed enhanced disease after vaccination and challenge. Mymetics focuses on developing an RSV vaccine for elderly followed by a vaccine for children.
  
  Key Results to date:
  
  2007: First pre-clinical research on our RSV vaccine.
  
  2008 and 2009: MedImmune repeated key experiments in order to obtain their own validation of the results. Results were beyond their expectation but MedImmune decided not to continue the program.
  
  2010: Conducting additional pre-clinical research and improving the manufacturing procedure of the RSV virosomes and
   publication of Mymetics RSV results in scientific journal “Vaccine.

  2011: Improved the understanding of the adjuvant ratio in different formulations and continued further tests on cotton rats and mice at the University of Groningen, Netherlands, showing that a different adjuvant ratios still triggered protection and the absence of enhanced disease and the vaccine could trigger systemic and mucosal antibodies.
  
  May 2012: Publication of Mymetics RSV vaccine results in scientific journal “PLOS ONE”.
  
  2013: Improved up-scale capabilities and up and down stream process of vaccine production and tested different formulations.
   March 2013: Publication of Mymetics RSV vaccine results in scientific journal “Vaccine”.
  
  April 2013: Publication of Mymetics RSV vaccine results in scientific journal “Influenza Journal”
  
  Dec. 2013: Mymetics signed a License and Collaboration Agreement with RSV Corporation (RSVC), a dedicated entity specifically set-up for developing the Mymetics RSV vaccine. Under this agreement Astellas Pharma Inc. agreed to fund RSVC’s development of the virosome vaccine technology, licensed from Mymetics for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) through completion of a Phase 2b human proof‐of‐concept study. Based on the strategic partnership, Astellas received exclusive rights to acquire RSVC as well as further develop and commercialize the vaccine product. We provided research and development activities for the pre-clinical phases, prepared for the upscale production and assay developments and provided further scientific advice on the development of the RSV virosome vaccine.
  
 Jan. 2016: Mymetics received notice from RSV Corporation (RSVC) that it would no longer pursue the development of a vaccine technology for Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in order to focus on other infectious therapies. The LCA which was signed on December 27, 2013, between Bestewil Holding BV and RSVC, was formally terminated as of July 25, 2016. Mymetics has regained all the rights, results and data related to the research, development and commercialization of this vaccine candidate and has currently put its further development on hold.
  
  Next steps:
   Following the termination of the license and collaboration agreement with RSVC, Mymetics has currently put the further development of this vaccine candidate on hold.
 
 
  Intranasal Influenza
  
  Approach: The intranasal influenza vaccine consists of the reconstituted membrane of influenza virus, also containing a lipopeptide adjuvant. In mice, intranasal application of virosomes without adjuvant does not induce immunity to influenza; however, incorporation of the lipopeptide in the virosomes produces a candidate vaccine that does induce cellular immunity, as well as serum and mucosal antibodies to the virus. The vaccine was licensed to Solvay Pharmaceuticals, a major European pharmaceutical company, which was acquired by Abbott Laboratories. Since October 2011, Mymetics has been able to reclaim the intra-nasal influenza vaccine in its portfolio as Abbott decided not to continue the product due to strategic decisions.
 
  Key results to date:
  
  2005: The vaccine completed pre-clinical trials. A first milestone payment was received from Solvay in the same year.
  
  2006: Successful completion of Phase I trial. The vaccine was shown to be safe and well tolerated and induced an immune response which met and exceeded CHMP (European regulatory) criteria for an off-the-shelf injected vaccine. Subsequent milestone payment was received.
  
  Dec. 2016: Mymetics B.V., the 100% subsidiary of Mymetics Corporation, agreed on a research project with Sanofi Pasteur, the vaccine division of Sanofi (SNY). The project will investigate the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines based on Mymetics’ proprietary virosome technology platform in pre-clinical settings. If this project is successful it could result in a further and more extensive collaboration between the two companies. Results are not expected before October 2017.

  Malaria
  
 Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites that are transmitted to people through the bites of infected female mosquitoes.
  About 3.2 billion people – almost half of the world’s population – are at risk of malaria. Young children, pregnant women and non-immune travellers from malaria-free areas are particularly vulnerable to the disease when they become infected. Malaria is preventable and curable, and increased efforts are dramatically reducing the malaria burden in many places. Between 2000 and 2015, malaria incidence among populations at risk (the rate of new cases) fell by 37% globally. In that same period, malaria death rates among populations at risk fell by 60% globally among all age groups, and by 65% among children under 5. Sub-Saharan Africa carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2015, the region was home to 88% of malaria cases and 90% of malaria deaths.. (Source: WHO).
  
 Malaria is caused by a parasite called Plasmodium, which is transmitted via the bites of infected mosquitoes. In the human body, the parasites multiply in the liver, and then infect red blood cells.
 
 Malaria being an extremely climate-sensitive disease, a potential risk exists that Global Warming leads Malaria towards areas in higher latitudes.
 
  Approach: The malaria vaccine design is based on optimized mimicry of the native parasite protein structure and eliciting antibodies against two stages of the parasite life cycle, unlike 70% of vaccine candidates, which target only one or the other parasite. It is today among the rare malaria vaccine candidates able to also boost existing malaria immune responses (it has both prophylactic and therapeutic effects) in subjects that were previously exposed to malaria. A second malaria vaccine candidate is under development as Mymetics virosome technology and know-how had been selected to collaborate with PATH-MVI and the LMIV (NIAID) to develop a transmission blocking malaria vaccine candidate based on the virosome technology and two antigens provided by LMIV.
  
  Key results to date:
  
  2007: Mymetics acquired a Malaria vaccine project from Pevion Biotech (Ittigen, Switzerland). A human clinical trial Phase Ia for the vaccine with two antigens (AMA-1 and CSP-1) anchored to virosomes was successfully completed on adults in Switzerland. Results showed good safety and tolerability, and the induction of blood antibodies.
  
  2008 - 2009: Phase Ib in Tanzania on children and young adults. The clinical trial Phase Ib in Tanzania evaluated the safety of the same antigens with virosomes on children and young adults under “native” (endemic) conditions. The final report showed that the vaccine induced specific AMA and CSP antibodies in the majority of children and the CSP antibodies have remained up 12 months. The overall malaria clinical episodes were reduced by 50% in vaccinated group compared to the placebo group.
  
  Nov. 2014: Mymetics signed an agreement with PATH Malaria Vaccine Initiative (MVI) and the Laboratory of Malaria Immunology and Vaccinology (LMIV) of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), where Mymetics will develop and produce virosome based vaccine formulations for a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidate which will be based on two antigens provided by LMIV. The vaccine formulations will then be tested in animal models. PATH MVI will fund all activities under this project, which started in January 2015. The Company recognizes revenue under the proportional performance method and recognized E8 for the year ending December 31, 2016. In addition, fees received in advance for research and development services are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the period that the services are provided.
  
  Apr. 2016: The Company announced that the preclinical study funded by PATH-MVI and in collaboration with LMIV where Mymetics’ virosome based formulations for a malaria transmission-blocking vaccine candidate were tested and compared with other vaccine formulations, had been successful. The study showed that the virosome vaccine candidates, at the highest dose tested, generate high antibody titers against the required antigens and they were able to significantly reduce (97-100%) the transmission of the Plasmodium falciparum parasite. The Company is currently evaluating funding opportunities for the next steps of development.
  
  Next steps:
  Mymetics is currently evaluating possible the further development of a malaria vaccine in collaboration with PATH-MVI and LMIV. In parallel, Mymetics is collaboration with the Swiss Tropical and Public Health Institute to add two important antigens for a possible malaria vaccine candidate, the RH5 and the CyRPA peptides.

  Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV)
  
 Herpes simplex viruses (HSV) type 1 and 2 cause lifelong latent infections that can lead to recurrent painful blisters. HSV-1 is common (infecting 40-60% of people) and predominantly induces lip, mouth and facial blisters, or the genitalia. HSV-2 is more usually sexually transmitted and affects the genitalia in about 20% of the population, but can also infect the oral mucosa. Although the disease is more a social burden than a serious disease, primary herpes infection can be devastating for babies, and HSV can cause serious complications in immune-compromised individuals, especially HIV/AIDS patients.
  
 Both viruses are closely related immunologically and infection with one type partially protects against the other.
  
 Infection leads to life-long latency and periodic reactivations occur that can lead to the shedding of live virus. Although therapeutic drugs are available, their efficacy is limited and there is not currently a vaccine against these viruses.
 
 
 
  Approach: The current HSV vaccine candidate consists of the reconstituted membrane of HSV-1 or HSV-2, also containing a lipopeptide, or other adjuvant. In mice, the virosome vaccine induces better immunity than repeated near-lethal live virus infections, resulting in the induction of neutralizing antibodies, with predominantly a Th1 profile, cellular immunity, and vaginal IgA. Different routes of application are possible (intranasal, intramuscular).
 
 
 
  Next steps:
   Mymetics is seeking partners to further advance this vaccine candidate.
  
  Chikungunya virus (CHIKV):
  
  Chikungunya is a mosquito-borne, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus (family Togaviridae, genus Alphavirus) that has caused sporadic outbreaks every 2-50 years of predominantly rheumatic disease, primarily in Africa and Asia. CHIKV recently (2004-2016) produced the largest epidemic recorded for an alphavirus with an estimated 1.4 to 6 million patients, and imported cases reported in nearly 40 countries including Europe, Japan and the Americas (since 2013). The first autochthonous CHIKV infections in Europe (Italy in 2007 and France in 2010) were also seen during this epidemic. Although Aedes aegypti is the traditional vector for CHIKV, the recent outbreak was associated with the emergence of a new clade of CHIKV viruses, which were efficiently transmitted by Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, a vector that has seen a dramatic global expansion in its geographic distribution is a viral disease transmitted to humans by infected mosquitoes, of the type aug (same type as Zika and Dengue) . It causes fever and severe joint pain. Other symptoms include muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can vary in duration.
  
  Approach: There are no vaccines available for Chiklungunya although there are several in development, ofwhich one is in a clinical trial Phase II. Mymetics novel approach in CHIKV vaccine development is the generation of virosomal vaccines using the CHIKV envelope glycoproteins produced in insect cells. Virosomes are reconstituted viral envelopes, consisting of membrane lipids and viral spike glycoproteins. The external surface of the virosome resembles that of a virus particle, with spike (glyco)proteins protruding from the lipid membrane. Virosomes lack viral genetic material. The advantage is that highly purified CHIKV spikes (expressed in insect cells) will be used to constitute the virosomes. Thus, insect cell material (DNA, proteins) will be completely absent from the virosomal vaccine material. CHIKV spikes can be obtained from different sources: VLPs, from baculovirus virions or from the plasma membrane of insect cells.
  
 Jan. 2016 to date: Mymetics has started the discovery phase of this project where we are assessing the overall CHIKV glycoprotein yields in scale up insect cell culture. In this project we are working together with the University of Wageningen in the Netherlands that has extensive expertise in this field. The objective is to start preclinical animal studies by mid 2017.

  HORIZON 2020-SERI
  
  In April 2015, the Company was selected to receive project grants with a total of E8.4 million. A total of E5.3 million is funded as part of Horizon 2020, the European Union research and innovation framework program and up to E3.1 million of funding will be provided by the Swiss State Secretariat for Education, Research and Innovation (SERI) for the Swiss based consortium partners. The grant will fund the evaluation, development and manufacturing scale-up of thermos-stable and cold-chain independent nano-pharmaceutical virosome-based vaccine candidates. Of the total amount, E3.4 million is directly attributable to Mymetics activities, with the remaining balance going to the consortium partners, Catalent UK Swindon Zydis Ltd, Chimera Biotec GmbH (Germany), Upperton Ltd. (UK) and Bachem AG (Switzerland). The project duration is 42 months and started on May 4, 2015. In May 2015, the Company has received a pre-payment from the two granting organizations for a total value of E1.5 million. In December 2016, the Company received a second tranche of E917 thousand from the EU which will be used to finance the next reporting covering the period of November 2016 to October 2017. Afterwards another tranche of funding from the EU will be received which cannot exceed 90% of the agreed budget, overall the payments received.
 MATERIAL THIRD PARTY AGREEMENTS
  
  For the development of its vaccines the Company has entered into several agreements in the form of license agreements, exploitation agreements or co-ownership agreements with third parties. These third parties provide specific experience and capabilities or provide access to specific know how, which are not the core competence of Mymetics. The Company believes that the following third party agreements are material. The following summaries of their material terms are qualified in their entirety by reference to the agreements filed as exhibits to prior SEC filings by the Company as set forth under Item 15 (Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules).

  The Exploitation Agreement terminates upon the later of: the expiration date of the longest-lived patent, or, 10 years after the first date of commercialization of the product, unless terminated by INSERM following market approval of the HIV products in the event (i)Mymetics does not develop the product for a period more than six months, (ii) the exploitation of the product is interrupted for a period of more than twelve months, or (iii) there is an absence of sales for twelve months starting from the date of market approval.
  
  RSV CORPORATION
  
  On December 27, 2013 Mymetics signed a License and Collaboration Agreement with RSV Corporation (RSVC), a dedicated entity specifically set-up for developing the Mymetics RSV vaccine. Under this agreement Astellas Pharma Inc. will fund RSVC’s development of the virosome vaccine technology, licensed from Mymetics for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) through completion of a Phase 2b human proof‐of‐concept study. Based on the strategic partnership, Astellas received exclusive rights to acquire RSVC as well as further develop and commercialize the vaccine product. We continued to provide research and development activities for the pre-clinical phases and prepared for the upscale production, assay developments and provided further scientific advice on the development of the RSV virosome vaccine.

 On January 25, 2016 Mymetics received notice from (RSVC) that it will no longer pursue the development of a vaccine technology for RSV in order to focus on other infectious therapies. The LCA which was signed on December 27, 2013, between Bestewil Holding BV and RSVC, has formally terminated as of July 25, 2016. Mymetics has regained all the rights, results and data related to the research, development and commercialization of the RSV vaccine candidate.
  
 SANOFI PASTEUR BIOLOGICS
   On December 1, 2016, Mymetics Corporation entered into a material definitive Research Agreement with Sanofi Pasteur Biologics, LLC, the vaccine division of Sanofi (SNY). The project will investigate the immunogenicity of influenza vaccines based on Mymetics’ proprietary virosome technology platform in pre-clinical settings. If this project is successful it could result in a further and more extensive collaboration between the two companies. The project duration is 6 to 12 months and started in January 2017.

  COMPETITION
  
  We have not yet developed an actual product. Our future competitive position depends on our ability to successfully develop our intellectual property, and to license or sell such intellectual property to third parties on financially favorable terms. Although we believe that the results of our research and development activities have been favorable, there are numerous entities and individuals conducting research and development activities in the area of human biology and medicine, all of which could be considered competitors.
  

  The worldwide vaccine market is dominated by five large multinational companies: Sanofi Pasteur S.A. (formerly Aventis Pasteur S.A.), Merck & Co., GlaxoSmithKline Plc, Pfizer-Wyeth and Seqirus - CSL. Smaller and mid-size companies such as Crucell (acquired by Johnson & Johnson) and Novavax and PaxVax are developing vaccines in the same area as Mymetics.
  
  While many of these entities have greater financial and scientific capabilities, and greater experience in conducting pre-clinical and clinical trials, the Company believes that its innovative approach to vaccine development is very competitive.

  GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION
  
  Our strategy was crafted in part to minimize the risks usually associated with Phase III clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing, which are expected to be borne by one or more future partners.
  
  We contract with third parties to perform research projects related to our business. These third parties are located in various countries and are subject to the applicable laws and regulations of their respective countries. Accordingly, regulation by government authorities in the United States, the European Union and other foreign countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of our proposed products by our future partners and therefore has a direct impact on our ongoing research and product development activities.
  
  Any products that will be developed by our future partners based on our technology will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, like human therapeutic products, vaccines are subject to rigorous pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. In addition, various federal and state statutes and regulations will also govern, or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage and record keeping related to such products and their marketing. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent substantial compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Obtaining royalties in the future will depend on our future partners' ability to obtain and maintain the necessary regulatory approvals.
  
  Pre-clinical studies are generally conducted on laboratory animals to evaluate the immunogenicity (induction of antibodies of the cellular response), first proof of potential efficacy and safety of a product. In light of our limited financial resources, clinical trials of our vaccines are conducted first in Europe under the European Union (“EU”) guidelines, a quicker and less expensive approach than seeking FDA approval, which we intend to do after EU approval is granted and we expect our financial resources to be greater. There is however no certainty that such EU approval will be granted. The Phase I, II and III EU clinical trials are similar to those required for FDA approval. The FDA requirements are addressed in this discussion.
  
  The process which is described below is therefore to be considered as generic background information which is relevant to the industry as a whole. As such process applies to drugs as well as vaccines, the term “drugs” as used hereafter refers also to vaccines.
  
  In the United States, any company developing new drugs must submit the results of pre-clinical studies to the FDA as a part of an investigational new drug application, or IND, which application must become effective before it can begin clinical trials in the United States. An IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA objects to it and the IND must be annually updated. Typically, clinical evaluation involves a time-consuming and costly three-phase process.
 
  Phase I refers typically to closely monitored clinical trials and includes the initial introduction of an investigational new drug into human patients or normal healthy volunteer subjects. Phase I clinical trials are designed to determine the safety (metabolic and pharmacologic actions of a drug in humans), the side effects associated with increasing drug doses and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness (inductions of antibodies in our case). Phase I trials also include the study of structure-activity relationships and mechanism of action in humans, as well as studies in which investigational drugs are used as research tools to explore biological phenomena or disease processes. During Phase I clinical trials, sufficient information about a drug's pharmacokinetics and pharmacological effects should be obtained to permit the design of well-controlled, scientifically valid, Phase II studies. The total number of subjects and patients included in Phase I clinical trials varies but is generally in the range of 20 to 80 people. Bioanalyses on the clinical trial samples in different in vitro assays must be conducted under good laboratory practice (GLP). At this stage, all techniques must be qualified according to standard operating procedures (SOPs) but it is not required to have the assays validated. Validating an assay consists of analyzing or verifying the 8 or 9 assay parameters as described in the US pharmacopeia or the ICH guidelines: 1) accuracy; 2) precision; 3) limit of detection; 4) limit of qualification; 5) specificity; 6) linearity and range; 7) robustness; and 8) system suitability.
  
  Phase II refers to controlled clinical trials conducted to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a drug for a particular indication or indications in patients with a disease or condition under study and to determine the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. These clinical trials are typically well-controlled, closely monitored and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. For prophylactic vaccines, a fraction of the enrolled subjects for the Phase II trials should ideally correspond to people at higher risk to contract the infection due to their social and/or sexual behaviors. At this stage, all identified and relevant techniques must be qualified and validation should be initiated prior starting the phase II and full validation must be achieved at the end of the phase II, prior launching Phase III. Completion of Phase II trials generally corresponds to the “stage of development” where big Pharma have a high interest for the drug product.

  Phase III refers to expanded controlled clinical trials, which many times are designated as "pivotal trials" designed to reach end points that the FDA has agreed in advance, if met, would allow approval for marketing. These clinical trials are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness of a drug has been obtained. Meanwhile, prophylactic vaccines are different because the true evidence of effectiveness is obtained during the Phase III trials involving an important fraction of the enrolled subjects with high risk of contracting the pathogen, providing more statistical power. Depending on the vaccine tested, vaccinated subjects are monitored over a period of few months to several years and the infection rate (protection) of this group is compared to the placebo treated group. Phase III trials are intended to gather additional information about the effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling. Phase III clinical trials can include from several hundred to tens of thousands of subjects depending on the specific indication being tested.
  
  The FDA closely monitors the progress of each of the three phases of clinical trials that are conducted in the United States and may, at its discretion, re-evaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based upon the data accumulated to that point and the FDA's assessment of the risk/benefit ratio to the patient. Once Phase III trials are completed, drug developers submit the results of pre-clinical studies and clinical trials to the FDA, in the form of a new drug application, or NDA, for approval to commence commercial sales. In response, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information or deny the application if the FDA determines that the application does not meet the predetermined study goals and other regulatory approval criteria.
  
  Furthermore, the FDA may prevent a drug developer from marketing a product under a label for its desired indications, which may impair commercialization of the product.
  
  If the FDA approves the new drug application, the drug becomes available for physicians to prescribe in the United States. After approval, the drug developer must submit periodic reports to the FDA, including descriptions of any adverse reactions reported. The FDA may request additional studies, known as Phase IV clinical trials to evaluate long-term effects.
 
  We will be required to comply with similar regulatory procedures in countries other than the United States.
  
  In addition to studies requested by the FDA after approval, a drug developer may conduct other trials and studies to explore use of the approved compound for treatment of new indications. The purpose of these trials and studies and related publications is to broaden the application and use of the drug and its acceptance in the medical community.
  
  At this time, neither we nor any of our partners have submitted any of its pre-clinical results to the FDA. Our partners and future partner(s) will have to complete an approval process, similar to the one required in the United States, in virtually every foreign target market in order to commercialize product candidates based on our technology in those countries. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional testing. Approvals (both foreign and in the United States) may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, regulatory approval of prices is required in most countries other than the United States. We face the risk that the resulting prices would be insufficient to generate an acceptable return to our partner(s).
