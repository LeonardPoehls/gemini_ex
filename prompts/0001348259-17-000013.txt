Item 1.    Business
Overview 
Validus Holdings, Ltd. was incorporated under the laws of Bermuda on October 19, 2005. Hereinafter, the “Company”, “us” or “we” are used to describe any or all of Validus Holdings, Ltd. and its subsidiary companies. The Company conducts its operations worldwide through four operating segments which have been determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) segment reporting: Validus Re, Talbot, Western World, and AlphaCat. Validus Re is a global reinsurance segment focused primarily on treaty reinsurance. Talbot is a specialty insurance segment, primarily operating within the Lloyd’s insurance market through Syndicate 1183. Western World is a U.S. based specialty excess and surplus lines insurance segment operating within the U.S. commercial market. AlphaCat is a Bermuda based investment adviser, managing capital for third parties and the Company in insurance linked securities (“ILS”) and other property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance investments. 
We seek to establish ourselves as a leader in the global insurance and reinsurance markets. Our principal operating objective is to use our capital efficiently by underwriting primarily short-tail insurance and reinsurance contracts with superior risk and return characteristics. Our primary underwriting objective is to construct a portfolio of short-tail insurance and reinsurance contracts that maximizes our return on equity subject to prudent risk constraints on the amount of capital we expose to any single event. We manage our risks through a variety of means, including contract terms, portfolio selection, diversification, including geographic diversification, and proprietary and commercially available third-party vendor catastrophe models.
Since our formation in 2005, we have been able to achieve substantial success in the development of our business. Selected examples of our accomplishments are as follows:

• | Raising approximately $1.0 billion of initial equity capital in December 2005 and underwriting $217.4 million in gross premiums written for the January 2006 renewal season;


• | Building a risk analytics staff comprised of over 50 experts, many of whom have PhDs and Masters degrees in related fields;


• | Developing Validus Capital Allocation and Pricing System (“VCAPS”), a proprietary computer-based system for modeling, pricing, allocating capital and analyzing catastrophe-exposed risks;


• | Acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Talbot Holdings Ltd. (“Talbot”) on July 2, 2007;


• | Completing an initial public offering (“IPO”) on July 30, 2007;


• | Acquiring all of the outstanding shares of IPC Holdings Ltd. (“IPC”) on September 4, 2009;


• | Acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings, S.A. (“Flagstone”) on November 30, 2012;


• | Acquiring all of the outstanding shares of Western World Insurance Group, Inc. (“Western World”) on October 2, 2014;


• | Successfully launching a series of AlphaCat sidecars and ILS funds beginning on May 25, 2011 and managing third party capital of $2.5 billion as at January 1, 2017;


• | Delivering an 11.6% compounded annual growth in book value per diluted common share plus accumulated dividends from formation to December 31, 2016;


• | Repurchasing approximately 80.5 million common shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2,704.4 million and paying an aggregate amount of $1,175.5 million in common share dividends from formation to February 22, 2017.


• | Raising $150.0 million of additional equity capital through the issuance of preferred shares in June 2016 and paying an aggregate amount of $4.5 million in preferred dividends to February 22, 2017.

Operating Segments 
Validus Re
The Validus Re segment operates as a global provider of reinsurance products. The segment operates primarily through two reinsurance companies; Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. and Validus Reinsurance (Switzerland) Ltd. (“Validus Re Swiss”). Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. was registered as a Class 4 insurer under The Insurance Act 1978 of Bermuda, amendments thereto and related regulations (the “Insurance Act”) in November 2005. It commenced operations with approximately $1.0 billion of equity capital and a balance sheet unencumbered by any historical losses relating to the 2005 hurricane season, the events of September 11, 2001, asbestos or other legacy exposures affecting our industry.
Validus Re Swiss is based in Zurich, Switzerland. Validus Re Swiss is licensed by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority, or FINMA, in Switzerland. Validus Re Swiss is also licensed as a permit company in Bermuda under the Companies Act and is registered in Bermuda as a Class 4 insurer under the Insurance Act, operating through its Bermuda branch, which complements our Swiss-based underwriters with a separate Bermuda underwriting platform.
Validus Re concentrates on first-party property and other reinsurance risks commonly referred to as short-tail in nature due to the relatively brief period between the occurrence and payment of a claim. During 2006, Validus Re entered the global reinsurance market during a period of imbalance between the supply of underwriting capacity available for reinsurance on catastrophe-exposed property, marine and energy risks and demand for such reinsurance coverage. 
The following are the primary lines in which Validus Re conducts its business. Details of gross premiums written by line of business, are provided below:

Property:    Validus Re underwrites property catastrophe reinsurance, property per risk reinsurance and property pro rata reinsurance.
Property catastrophe:  Property catastrophe reinsurance provides reinsurance for insurance companies’ exposures to an accumulation of property and related losses from separate policies, typically relating to natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Property catastrophe reinsurance is generally written on an excess of loss basis, which provides coverage to insurance companies when aggregate claims and claim expenses from a single occurrence for a covered peril exceed a certain amount specified in a particular contract. Under these contracts, the Company provides protection to an insurer for a portion of the total losses in excess of a specified loss amount, normally up to a maximum amount per loss and/or an aggregate amount across multiple losses, as specified in the contract. In the event of a loss, most contracts provide for coverage of a second occurrence following the payment of a premium to reinstate the coverage under the contract, which is referred to as a reinstatement premium. The coverage provided under excess of loss reinsurance contracts may be on a worldwide basis or limited in scope to specific regions or geographical areas. Coverage can also vary from “all property” perils, which is the most expansive form of coverage, to more limited coverage of specified perils such as windstorm-only coverage. Property catastrophe reinsurance contracts are typically “all risk” in nature, providing protection against losses from earthquakes and hurricanes, as well as other natural and man-made catastrophes such as floods, tornadoes, fires and storms. The predominant exposures covered are losses stemming from property damage and business interruption coverage resulting from a covered peril. Certain risks, such as war or nuclear contamination may be excluded, partially or wholly, from certain contracts. Gross premiums written on property catastrophe business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $345.5 million.
Property per risk:  Property per risk reinsurance provides reinsurance for insurance companies’ excess retention on individual property and related risks, such as highly-valued buildings. Per risk reinsurance protects insurance companies on their primary insurance risks on a “single risk” basis. A “risk” in this context might mean the insurance coverage on one building or a group of buildings or the insurance coverage under a single policy which the reinsured treats as a single risk. Coverage is usually triggered by a large loss sustained by an individual risk rather than by smaller losses which fall below the specified retention of the reinsurance contract. Such property per risk coverages are generally written on an excess of loss basis, which provides the reinsured with protection beyond a specified amount up to the limit set within the reinsurance contract. Gross premiums written on property per risk business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $26.8 million.
2

Property pro rata:    Property pro rata contracts require that the reinsurer share the premiums as well as the losses and loss expenses in an agreed proportion with the reinsured. Gross premiums written on property pro rata business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $100.6 million.
Marine:    Validus Re underwrites reinsurance on marine risks covering damage to or losses of marine vessels and cargo, third-party liability for marine accidents and physical loss and liability from principally offshore energy properties. Validus Re underwrites marine risks on an excess of loss basis and on a pro rata basis. Gross premiums written on marine business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $105.7 million.
Specialty:    Validus Re underwrites other lines of business depending on an evaluation of pricing and market conditions, which include aerospace and aviation, accident and health, agriculture, casualty, composite, contingency, crisis management, financial, life, technical, terrorism, trade credit and workers’ compensation lines. The Company seeks to underwrite specialty lines with very limited exposure correlation with its property and marine portfolios. With the exception of the aerospace and aviation, agriculture, financial and trade credit lines of business, which have a meaningful portion of their gross premiums written volume on a proportional basis, the Company’s specialty lines are written on an excess of loss basis. Gross premiums written on specialty business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $532.4 million.
Talbot 
Talbot writes primarily short-tail lines of business and focuses mostly on insurance, as opposed to reinsurance risks which are generally written by Validus Re, however, Talbot does have a short-tail treaty reinsurance portfolio. In addition, Talbot provides the Company with access to the Lloyd’s marketplace where Validus Re does not operate. As a London-based insurer, Talbot also writes the majority of its premiums on risks outside the United States. Talbot’s team of underwriters have, in many cases, spent most of their careers writing niche, short-tail business and bring their expertise to bear on expanding the Company’s short-tail insurance franchise.
The Company has expanded and diversified its business through Syndicate 1183’s access to Lloyd’s license agreements with regulators around the world. Talbot Underwriting Risk Services, Ltd. (London), Validus Specialty Underwriting Services, Inc. (New York), Talbot Underwriting (MENA) Ltd. (Dubai), Validus Reaseguros, Inc. (Miami), Talbot Underwriting (LATAM) S.A. (Chile), Talbot Risk Services (Labuan) Pte. Ltd. (Malaysia), and Talbot Risk Services Pte. Ltd. (Singapore and Australia) act as approved Lloyd’s coverholders for Syndicate 1183.
The following are the primary lines in which Talbot conducts its business. Details of gross premiums written by line of business are provided below:

Property:    The main sub-classes within the property class are International and North American direct and facultative contracts, lineslips and binding authorities, together with a book of business written on a treaty reinsurance basis. The business written is mostly commercial and industrial insurance. Coverage provided includes all risks of direct physical loss or damage, business interruption and natural catastrophe perils. Property also includes downstream energy and construction business. Within the downstream energy sector, covered occupancies include oil, gas, petrochemicals, chemical, power generation and utilities and process industries. Coverage is typically all risks and includes machinery breakdown and business interruption where required. The primary focus within the construction line is on major capital projects, placed on a direct or facultative subscription basis. The property business is mainly short-tail with premiums for reinsurance and direct and facultative business substantially earned within 12 months and premiums for lineslips and binding authorities mainly earned within 12 months of the expiry of the contract, however there are a minority of risks, particularly construction, with long-term policies. Gross premiums written on property business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $317.1 million, including $40.4 million of treaty reinsurance.
Marine:    The main types of business within the marine class are hull, cargo, upstream energy, marine and energy liabilities and a book of business written on a treaty reinsurance basis. Hull consists primarily of ocean going vessels and covers worldwide risks on an all risks or total loss only basis together with yachts. Cargo consists of worldwide transits with a particular emphasis on oil cargo, project cargo, pre-launch satellite and space risks, specie, fine art and high value motor vehicles. Upstream energy

covers a variety of oil and gas industry exploration and production risks. The marine and energy liability account provides cover for protection and indemnity clubs and a wide range of companies operating in the marine and energy sectors. Most business written is short-tail, enabling a quicker and more accurate picture of expected profitability than is the case for long-tail business, however the marine and energy liability account, which makes up $53.5 million of gross premiums written during the year ended December 31, 2016, is the primary long-tail business in this class. Gross premiums written on marine business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $261.9 million.
Specialty:    This class consists of political lines (comprising marine & aviation war, political risks and political violence, including war on land), aviation direct, aviation treaty, financial lines, accident and health, and contingency. With the exception of aviation treaty, most of the business within the specialty class is written on a direct or facultative basis or under a binding authority through a coverholder. Gross premiums written on specialty business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $391.7 million.
Political Lines:    The marine and aviation political lines account covers physical damage to aircraft and marine vessels caused by acts of war and terrorism. The political risk account deals primarily with expropriation, contract frustration/trade credit, kidnap and ransom, and malicious and accidental product tamper. The political violence account mainly insures physical loss to property or goods anywhere in the world, caused by war, terrorism or civil unrest. This class is often written in conjunction with cargo, specie, property, upstream energy, contingency and political risk. The period of the risks can extend up to 36 months and beyond. Gross premiums written on political lines business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $191.6 million.
Aviation:    The aviation account insures major airlines, airport operations, aviation products and airports, general aviation, satellites and a book of business written on a treaty reinsurance basis. The coverage includes excess of loss treaties with medium to high attachment points. Gross premiums written on aviation business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $84.8 million.
Financial Lines:    Talbot’s financial lines team underwrites bankers blanket bond, commercial crime, computer crime, cyber- crime, professional indemnity and directors’ and officers’ coverage for various types of financial institutions and similar companies. The team also provides professional indemnity, directors’ and officers’ and cyber liability coverage to a more general selection of commercial clients. Bankers blanket bond and commercial crime insurance products are specifically designed to protect against direct financial loss caused by fraud/criminal actions and to mitigate the damage such activities may have on the asset base of the insured. Computer crime insurance protects against the misappropriation of funds and assets via the insured’s computer system. Professional indemnity insurance protects businesses in the event that legal action is taken against them by third parties claiming a breach of professional duty. Directors’ and officers’ insurance protects the personal liability of directors and officers or policyholder costs for indemnification arising out of an alleged breach of a fiduciary duty. The financial lines account is on a claims made basis; however, it is deemed to be longer tail business due to claims development patterns. Gross premiums written on financial lines business for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $50.5 million.
Accident and Health:    The accident and health account provides insurance in respect of individuals in both their personal and business activity together with corporations where they have an insurable interest relating to death or disability of employees or those under contract. Gross premiums written on accident and health business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $29.3 million.
Contingency:    The main types of covers written under the contingency account are event cancellation, non-appearance and prize indemnity business. Gross premiums written on contingency business during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $35.4 million.
Western World
On October 2, 2014, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Western World, a U.S. based specialty excess and surplus lines insurance company. The acquisition provided the Company with enhanced access to the specialty U.S. commercial insurance market, the world’s largest short-tail market, complementing the Company’s existing market positions in both Bermuda reinsurance and the Lloyd’s marketplace and increasing the Company’s ability to leverage operational strengths in short-tail classes of business. In addition, the acquisition improves the Company’s ability to manage (re)insurance cycles. 
Western World primarily insures small to medium size commercial and institutional risks covering general liability, professional liability, product liability, miscellaneous malpractice and property classes through three wholly owned insurance subsidiaries: Western World Insurance Company (“WWIC”), Tudor Insurance Company (“Tudor”) and Stratford Insurance Company (“Stratford”). WWIC, Tudor and Stratford are domiciled in New Hampshire. WWIC operates as a surplus lines insurer in all U.S. jurisdictions other than New Hampshire. Tudor is licensed as a domestic surplus lines insurer in New Hampshire and is authorized to conduct business as a surplus lines insurer in all other U.S. jurisdictions. Stratford is an admitted insurer in 50 U.S. jurisdictions.
The following are the primary lines in which Western World conducts its business. Details of gross premiums written by line of business are provided below:

(a) | The results of Western World have been included in the Company’s consolidated results from the October 2, 2014 date of acquisition.

Property:    This class consists of building, business personal property, and business income (with or without extra expense) coverages, including catastrophe, for small to medium size commercial habitational, industrial, service, and mercantile risks. Gross premiums written on property lines during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $94.4 million.
Liability:    This class consists of general liability, professional liability, product liability, and miscellaneous malpractice occurrence-based coverage for contractors, dwellings, special events, manufacturers, social workers, drug clinics and exercise and health facilities. Coverage is also provided on a claims-made basis for lines such as directors’ and officers’ and errors and omissions liability for small to medium size enterprises and financial institutions. Gross premiums written on liability lines during the year ended December 31, 2016 were $228.8 million.
AlphaCat
AlphaCat Managers Ltd. (“AlphaCat Managers”) is an asset manager that leverages the Company’s underwriting and analytical expertise primarily for third party investors. Validus Re also has a direct investment in certain AlphaCat funds and sidecars. As an asset manager, AlphaCat Managers’ primary sources of income are management and performance fees.
The AlphaCat segment is a core element of the Company’s strategy to expand in capital markets activities by participating in the market for ILS. ILS are financial instruments, the fundamental value of which is determined by insurance losses caused primarily by natural catastrophes such as major earthquakes and hurricanes. As such, the returns on ILS are generally uncorrelated with the overall financial markets, making ILS an attractive asset class for capital markets investors. AlphaCat leverages the Company’s extensive business sourcing, underwriting, research and analytic capabilities to construct ILS portfolios subject to prudent risk constraints.
AlphaCat investors access this uncorrelated asset class through various AlphaCat funds and sidecars that participate in the market via AlphaCat Reinsurance Ltd. (“AlphaCat Re”), a Bermuda provider of fully collateralized property catastrophe and specialty reinsurance and retrocession capacity and AlphaCat Master Fund Ltd. (“AlphaCat Master Fund”), a Bermuda investment fund investing in reinsurance related capital markets transactions (collectively the “master funds”). AlphaCat Re also enters into transactions on behalf of third party investors on a direct basis whereby all of the risks and rewards of the underlying transactions are transferred to the investors using notes payable to AlphaCat investors. Furthermore, certain of the funds and direct third party investors purchase catastrophe bonds (“Cat bonds”) directly under instruction from AlphaCat Managers. 
BetaCat investors access the market through the BetaCat funds that participate in the market via BetaCat Fund Ltd., a Bermuda investment fund exclusively invested in Cat bonds. Cat bonds purchased by BetaCat are principal-at-risk variable rate notes and other event-linked securities focused on property and casualty risks and issued under Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, following a passive buy-and-hold investment strategy. 
The Company is considered to be the primary beneficiary of the AlphaCat master funds, the AlphaCat sidecars, the AlphaCat ILS funds and the BetaCat ILS funds and therefore the Company is required to consolidate these entities. For further details, refer to Notes 2 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Basis of preparation and consolidation,” and “Variable interest entities,” respectively, in Part II, Item 8.
As at December 31, 2016, the AlphaCat segment included the AlphaCat master funds, the AlphaCat sidecars, the AlphaCat ILS funds and a BetaCat ILS fund.

Enterprise Risk Management 
Risk Management Framework: The Company believes in having a culture that embraces sound risk management practices at all levels of the organization. We have therefore implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (“ERM”) framework (the “Framework”) that is aligned with the Company’s culture and responds to the needs of the business. The Framework has been established to identify, assess, quantify and manage risks and opportunities. In particular it is designed to: 

• | Establish the principles by which the Company can evaluate the risk/reward trade-offs associated with key strategic and tactical decisions.


• | Establish a risk governance structure that, in respect of all activities related to ERM, operates with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.


• | Establish minimum requirements that must be met by each of the Company’s segments.


• | Identify and assess all risks and causes of risks arising out of the Company’s strategic initiatives, internal processes and external environment.


• | Establish a set of responses to manage the Company’s risks within its stated risk appetite and risk tolerances.


• | Establish procedures through which near-miss and actual incidents, that either have the potential to impact or have impacted the Company, are reported and reviewed in order to inform the risk identification and assessment process.

Risk Governance: Our risk governance philosophy reflects the overall governance of the Company, with the segments given broad autonomy over the management of their business, while adhering to the overall strategy of the Company. Similarly, the segments have broad operational latitude over their risk management functions while staying within the parameters set by the Company. 
The Company’s Board of Directors has established a separate Risk Committee (“RC”) that is governed by a charter which is updated and reviewed periodically by the Board of Directors. The RC is responsible for, among other things, approving the Framework, working with management to ensure ongoing, effective implementation of the Framework and reviewing the Company’s specific risk limits as defined in the Framework, including limits related to major categories of risk. The implementation of risk policies and oversight of risk management is the responsibility of the Group Risk Management Committee (“GRMC”). The GRMC reports to the RC and is governed by a charter that is reviewed and approved annually by the RC. The GRMC also has two subcommittees, the Model Risk Subcommittee and the Operational Risk Subcommittee, both of which are governed by charters that are reviewed annually by the RC. Various risk policies are in place to facilitate consistent risk assessment across the Company and to ensure that strategic business decisions are supported by effective modeling and analysis. 
 Risk Appetite: The Company’s risk appetite is expressed through a series of qualitative and quantitative statements, principles, limits, and tolerances that, in the aggregate, convey the Company’s risk and reward preferences and set the risk parameters within which the Company and its segments operate. The risk appetite is proposed by management and approved by the Board of Directors.
The significant quantitative measures include meeting minimum returns on capital and risk-adjusted capital over a full insurance industry cycle, managing the probability of break-even or better, meeting or exceeding budgeted net income over a calendar year, and managing the probability of losing specified percentages of shareholders’ equity in a calendar year. They also include probability thresholds in respect of maintaining a buffer above regulatory and rating agency capital levels.
The Company also sets levels of concentration risks within its risk appetite, including those related to probable maximum losses, zonal aggregates and the contribution of various risk categories to the overall assessment of the Company’s risk capital.
Risk Classification: Risks are broadly divided into those that the Company assumes explicitly and from which it derives income and those that are a by-product of the operating and business environment, from which the Company does not earn income.
The risks assumed are categorized as catastrophe, reserve and premium risks (also together referred to as insurance risk), market (or investment) risk and credit risk. The Company’s goal is to get adequately compensated for these risks, while creating optimal insurance and investment portfolios subject to the constraints of the Company’s risk appetite. The remaining risks are categorized as operational and strategic risks, which typically include emerging risks, for which the Company’s goal is to identify, assess and mitigate to the extent considered appropriate.
Risk Ownership: The Company’s risk management philosophy is to entrust risk identification and control activities with the employees who have the responsibility for and expertise in the areas giving rise to each risk. This not only creates workflow efficiencies but also promotes awareness of and accountability for risk at all levels of the Company. As such, primary risk ownership is assigned to the managers of functional areas. The risk identification and control activities are embedded in the job descriptions of risk owners and control operators and monitored by the GRMC.
Risk Assessment, Control and Mitigation: The Company performs a regular risk assessment process that considers the likelihood and impact of causes of risk, both before and after the existence of relevant controls. The approaches used to identify 
7

and update causes of risk include scenario building, incident and near-miss reporting and market intelligence. Controls have been established to appropriately manage the likelihood and impact of risks, focused on those with the most significance and after considering the tolerance level established for each risk. New controls may also be designed as a result of the incident reporting process.
The Company also has in place policies, including underwriting, investment, and credit policies, to manage the assumption of risk. These policies provide for the Company’s risk limits, tolerance levels and other guidelines, as well as the processes for ensuring compliance with the desired risk profile of the Company. The Company has at its disposal a variety of risk mitigation tools, including the purchase of reinsurance and retrocessional coverage, which it uses to ensure that its risk profile stays within prescribed limits and tolerance levels.
Exposure Management: In order to manage the assumption of insurance risk, the Company has established risk limits through both qualitative and quantitative considerations, including market share, history of and expertise in a class of business or jurisdiction, transparency and symmetry of available information, reliability of pricing models and availability and cost of reinsurance. These limits are reviewed at least annually and aligned to the overall risk appetite established by the Company’s Board of Directors. In addition, a group exposure management policy is in place to ensure appropriate and consistent risk assessment and aggregation of exposures that accumulate between the operating companies in the group. 
Three tools are used to measure and manage exposures:

• | Absolute maximum limits - these are defined based on the underlying peril or coverage and include measures such as zonal aggregates, which convey the maximum contractual loss exposure.


• | Probable maximum loss - these are defined where probabilistic event sets exist for underlying perils and are established for most natural catastrophe, aviation and upstream energy coverage, and convey an extreme but likely loss exposure.


• | Realistic disaster scenarios (“RDSs”) - these are either prescribed by third parties or developed internally and convey a more intuitive view of potential loss outcomes.

The Company will often use multiple tools to validate its exposure measurement and ensures that at least one of these tools is available for each class of business. 
Model Validation Framework: The Company relies extensively on a wide range of models to support key decisions made across the business. We have therefore implemented a Model Validation Framework to establish a uniform set of validation and governance standards that ensure the quality and reliability of key models across the Company. 
Portfolio Optimization: The Company has developed a comprehensive and integrated Economic Capital Model (“ECM”) framework to facilitate the consistent assessment of risk, including risks classified as operational. This framework includes assessment at the individual operating company level, as well as across the Company. Using the ECM framework, the Company is able to assess the impact on risk appetite metrics of key strategic and tactical decisions as well as the risk return trade-offs associated with these decisions, including growth strategy, new product launch, business mix and retrocession strategy, mergers and acquisitions, planning and budgeting, investment strategy and capital management.
It is the goal of the Company to make the most efficient use of its capital and to achieve an adequate return for its shareholders. To that end, the Company seeks to maximize net income given the amount of capital at risk and subject to the risk limits, tolerance levels and other constraints that are imposed by our business, regulatory, and rating agency environments. The Company has therefore put in place portfolio optimization procedures, including the integrated use of the ECM within the annual planning process, in order to help shape portfolios that optimize their respective risk return profiles.
Underwriting Risk Management 
The Company’s underwriters manage risk by monitoring a number of qualitative and quantitative indicators. Our in-house pricing platform, VCAPS, provides reinsurance underwriters with a real-time view of the risk-adjusted profitability of each account. This allows them to examine the effects of contract terms and conditions as well as analyze the contribution of a contract to our overall risk capital and its impact on the projected incurred loss for one of our key stress scenarios. The Company’s insurance operations also use sophisticated pricing platforms. Talbot maintains a suite of pricing models for the direct and facultative underwriting teams that includes VCAPS and other proprietary models, as well as models licensed from third parties. Western World is also able to leverage VCAPS for real-time, location level catastrophe pricing, and also utilizes proprietary and vendor developed rating tools through the Western World Integrated Platform (“WWIP”). The Company believes that giving our underwriters the tools to make sound decisions is critical to our long-term success. To that end, we strive to create an environment that promotes close cooperation between our underwriting, catastrophe modeling, risk, claims, and actuarial functions.

All of the Company’s underwriters adhere to a strict set of underwriting guidelines and letters of authority that specifically address the limits of their underwriting authority and their referral criteria. The Company’s current underwriting guidelines and letters of authority include:

• | Lines of business that a particular underwriter is authorized to write;


• | Exposure limits by line of business;


• | Contractual exposures and limits requiring mandatory referrals; and


• | Levels of analysis to be performed by lines of business.

In general, our underwriting approach is to:

• | Seek high quality clients who have demonstrated superior performance over an extended period;


• | Evaluate our clients’ exposures and make adjustments where their exposure is not adequately reflected;


• | Apply the comprehensive knowledge and experience of our entire underwriting team to make progressive and cohesive decisions about the business they underwrite; and


• | Employ our well-founded and carefully maintained market contacts within the Company to enhance our robust distribution capabilities.

Our underwriters have the responsibility to analyze all submissions and determine if the related potential exposures meet with both the Company’s risk profile line size and aggregate limitations, in line with the business plan. In order to ensure compliance, we run appropriate management information reports and all lines are subject to regular audits. 
All of the companies managed by AlphaCat are subject to investment or underwriting guidelines. These guidelines are established in the offering documentation of each AlphaCat company. AlphaCat manages investment portfolios in accordance with guidelines, which are subject to oversight by the respective company’s board of directors.  AlphaCat leverages the Company’s underwriting and analytical resources. However, all investment and underwriting decisions are ultimately made by AlphaCat. When services are provided to AlphaCat by the Company’s underwriting teams, the relevant underwriting risk management framework outlined in this section applies.
Use of Models 
A pivotal factor in determining whether to found and fund the Company was the opportunity for differentiation based upon superior risk management expertise; specifically, managing catastrophe risk and optimizing our portfolio to generate attractive returns on capital while controlling our exposure to risk, and assembling a management team with the experience and expertise to do so. The Company’s proprietary models are updated to reflect the latest science and data for the given peril-region of interest. This has enabled the Company to gain a competitive advantage over those reinsurers who rely exclusively on commercial models for pricing and portfolio management. The Company has made a significant investment in expertise in the risk modeling area to capitalize on this opportunity. The Company has assembled an experienced group of professional experts with a wide range of advanced degrees in the physical sciences/mathematics who are operating in an environment designed to enable them to use their expertise as a competitive advantage. While the Company uses both proprietary and commercial probabilistic models, catastrophe risk is ultimately subject to absolute aggregate limitations as discussed above.
Commercial Vendor Models: The Company licenses two major commercial vendor models (RMS and AIR) to assess the adequacy of risk pricing and to monitor its overall exposure to risk in correlated geographic zones for various natural catastrophe perils. The vendor models provide information that enables the Company to aggregate exposures by correlated event loss scenarios, which are probability-weighted. This enables the generation of exceedance probability curves for the portfolio and major geographic areas. All models have their strengths and weaknesses; our internal research efforts target a greater understanding of, and if necessary, changes to frequency and severity for key peril-regions.
The Company also uses its quantitative expertise to improve the reliability of the vendor model outputs and expedite scientific review and operationalization of their findings to formulate its view of risk in the following areas:

• | Ceding companies may often report insufficient data and many reinsurers may not be sufficiently critical in their analysis of this data. The Company generally scrutinizes data for anomalies that may indicate insufficient data quality. These circumstances are addressed by either declining the program or, if the variances are manageable, by modifying the model inputs and outputs, and ultimately, pricing to reflect insufficient data quality;


• | Performing independent checks on the accuracy of reported building characteristics through third-party tools and the use of licensed data sources;


• | Prior to making overall adjustments for changes in variable metrics, the Company carefully examines the adjustment against the latest scientific studies and technology available to ensure its impact to the business is thoroughly evaluated before adopting it into its systems; and

9


• | To properly quantify risk, the Company frequently adjusts vendor models in advance of their updates based on the latest scientific studies and claims data from recent events.

In addition, many risks, such as second-event covers, aggregate excess of loss, or attritional loss components, cannot be fully evaluated using the vendor models. In order to better evaluate and price these risks, the Company has developed proprietary analytical tools, such as VCAPS and other models and data sets.
Proprietary Models: In addition to making frequency and severity adjustments to the vendor model outputs, the Company has implemented a proprietary pricing and risk management tool, VCAPS, to assist in pricing submissions and monitoring risk aggregation.
VCAPS uses the output of catastrophe models to generate a 100,000-year simulation set, which is used for both pricing and risk management. This approach allows more precise measurement and pricing of risk given the underlying exposures. The two primary benefits of this approach are:

• | VCAPS takes into account annual limits, event/franchise/annual aggregate deductibles, and reinstatement premiums. This allows for more accurate evaluation of treaties with a broad range of features, including both common (reinstatement premium and annual limits) and complex features (second or third event coverage, aggregate excess of loss, attritional loss components, covers with varying attachment across different geographical zones or lines of businesses and covers with complicated structures); and


• | VCAPS use of 100,000-year simulations enables robust pricing of catastrophe-exposed business. This is possible in real-time operation because the Company has designed a computing hardware platform and software environment to accommodate the significant computing needs.

In addition to VCAPS, the Company uses other proprietary models and other data in evaluating exposures. 
Geographic Diversification
The Company actively manages its aggregate exposures by geographic or risk zone to maintain a balanced and diverse portfolio of underlying risks. The coverage the Company is willing to provide for any risk located in a particular zone is limited to a predetermined level, thus limiting the net aggregate loss exposure from all contracts covering risks believed to be located in any zone. Contracts that have “worldwide” territorial limits have exposures in several geographic zones. Generally, if a proposed contract would cause the limit to be exceeded, the contract would be declined, regardless of its desirability, unless the Company buys reinsurance or retrocessional coverage, thereby reducing the net aggregate exposure to the maximum limit permitted or less. 
For further details on gross premiums written allocated by the territory of coverage exposure refer to Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Segment Information,” in Part II, Item 8. 
The effectiveness of geographic zone limits in managing risk exposure depends on the degree to which an actual event is confined to the zone in question and on the Company’s ability to determine the actual location of the risks believed to be covered under a particular insurance or reinsurance contract. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that risk exposure in any particular zone will not exceed that zone’s limits. Further control over diversification is achieved through guidelines covering the types and amount of business written in product classes and lines within a class.
Reinsurance Management 
The Company enters into reinsurance agreements in order to mitigate its accumulation of loss, reduce its liability on individual risks and enable it to underwrite policies with higher limits. The ceding of the insurance risk does not legally discharge the Company from its primary liability for the full amount of the policies, and the Company is therefore required to pay the loss and bear collection risk if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement.
Validus Re Retrocession:  Validus Re monitors the opportunity to purchase retrocessional coverage on a continual basis and employs the VCAPS modeling system to evaluate the effectiveness of risk mitigation and exposure management relative to the cost. This coverage may be purchased on an indemnity basis as well as on an index basis (e.g., industry loss warranties (“ILWs”)). Validus Re also considers and at times uses alternative retrocessional structures, including collateralized quota share facilities (“sidecars”) and other capital markets products (e.g., catastrophe bonds), where the pricing and terms are attractive.
When Validus Re buys retrocessional coverage on an indemnity basis, payment is for an agreed upon portion of the losses actually suffered. In contrast, when Validus Re buys an ILW cover, which is a reinsurance contract in which the payout is dependent on both the insured loss of the policy purchaser and a measure of the industry-wide loss, payment is made only if both Validus Re and the industry suffer a loss, as reported by one of a number of independent agencies, in excess of specified threshold amounts. 
10

With an ILW, Validus Re bears the risk of suffering a loss while receiving no payment under the ILW if the industry loss was less than the specified threshold amount.
Talbot Ceded Reinsurance: The reinsurance program is reviewed by the reinsurance purchasing team on an on-going basis in line with the main business planning process. This process incorporates advice and analytical work from our brokers, actuarial and capital modeling teams.
The review and any subsequent modification to the program is based upon the following:

• | budgeted underwriting activity for the coming year;


• | loss experience from prior years;


• | loss information from the coming year’s individual capital assessment calculations;


• | expected changes to risk limits and aggregation limits and any other changes to Talbot’s risk tolerance;


• | scenario planning;


• | changes to capital requirements; and


• | RDSs prescribed by Lloyd’s.

The main type of reinsurance purchased is losses occurring; however, for a few lines of business, where the timing of the loss event is less easily verified or where such cover is available, risk attaching policies are purchased.
The type, quantity and cost of cover of the proposed reinsurance program is reviewed by the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of the Talbot group, and ultimately authorized by the Talbot Underwriting Ltd. (“TUL”) Board.
All reinsurance contracts arranged are authorized for purchase by the Talbot CEO. Slips are developed prior to inception to ensure that optimum cover is achieved. After purchase, cover notes are reviewed by the relevant class underwriters and presentations are made to all underwriting staff to ensure they are aware of the boundaries of the cover.
Western World Ceded Reinsurance: The reinsurance program is managed by senior management. Western World uses brokers to provide guidance on modeling, prices and preparing contract terms and conditions. The main type of reinsurance purchased is excess of loss on a risk attaching basis. Western World utilizes reinsurance to reduce earnings volatility, protect capital and to limit its exposure to risk concentration.
AlphaCat: AlphaCat has ceded only a minimal level of business to third parties and will typically write contracts on a net retention basis only.
Distribution
Although we conduct some business on a direct basis with our treaty and facultative reinsurance clients, most of our business is derived through insurance and reinsurance intermediaries (“brokers”), who access business from clients and coverholders. We are able to attract business through our recognized lead capability in most classes we underwrite, particularly in classes where such lead ability is rare.
Currently, our largest broker relationships, as measured by gross premiums written, are with Marsh & McLennan Companies, Inc., Aon Benfield Group Ltd. and Willis Towers Watson plc. The following table sets forth the Company’s gross premiums written by broker:

Reserve for Losses and Loss Expenses 
For insurance and reinsurance companies, a significant judgment made by management is the estimation of the reserve for losses and loss expenses. The Company establishes its reserve for losses and loss expenses to cover the estimated incurred liability for both reported and unreported claims.
Loss reserves are established due to the significant periods of time that may lapse between the occurrence, reporting and payment of a loss. To recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses, the Company estimates future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses with respect to insured events. The Company’s reserving practices and the establishment of any particular reserve reflects management’s judgment concerning sound financial practice and does not represent any admission of liability with respect to any claim. Unpaid losses and loss expense reserves are established for reported claims (“case reserves”) and incurred but not reported (“IBNR”) claims. For information regarding the Company’s unpaid losses and loss expense reserves on both a gross and net basis see Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Loss Reserves.”
The nature of the Company’s high excess of loss and catastrophe business can result in loss expenses and payments that are both irregular and significant. Such losses are part of the normal course of business for the Company. Adjustments to reserves for individual years can also be irregular and significant. Conditions and trends that have affected development of liabilities in the past may not necessarily occur in the future. Accordingly, it is inappropriate to extrapolate future redundancies or deficiencies based upon historical experience. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.”
During the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2015-09, “Financial Services - Insurance (Topic 944) - Disclosures about Short-Duration Contracts” issued by the United States Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), which enhance the annual disclosures relating to the Company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses. For further information regarding the Company’s reserves for losses and loss expenses refer to Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Reserve for losses and loss expenses,” in Part II, Item 8, Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates,” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”
Investment Management 
The overriding goal of our investment management is capital preservation, such that the assets of the Company are invested to provide for the timely payment of all contractual obligations of policyholders and creditors, ensuring our ability to underwrite future business and to satisfy all regulatory and rating agency requirements. We aim to achieve these objectives through a clearly defined process that is driven by the enterprise-wide risk and capital position of the Company to ensure assets are invested in accordance with our defined financial objectives and risk tolerances. Our approach considers the joint impact of underwriting and investment risks to the Company, in the context of clear prioritization of underwriting needs and opportunities. As such, we structure our investment portfolio to support policyholder reserves and contingent risk exposures with a liquid portfolio of high quality fixed-income investments with a comparable duration profile. 
The Board of Directors, advised by our Finance Committee, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Investment Officer, oversees our investment strategy and has established the Company’s Investment Policy Statement (“IPS”). The IPS provides a framework for the management and oversight of the Company’s managed investment portfolio (“managed investments”), which excludes investments held in support of consolidated AlphaCat VIEs (“non-managed investments”). The purpose of the IPS is to:

• | Communicate and align the Company’s investment philosophy and goals;


• | Provide transparency regarding investment policies, procedures and controls;


• | Set expectations and priorities of our third party investment managers;


• | Establish a framework for integrating investment management into our overall ERM process;


• | Mandate our investment parameters, including permissible asset classes and portfolio constraints, and governance structure for portfolio oversight and management;


• | Establish formalized criteria to measure, monitor, and evaluate investment performance and risk exposures on a regular basis; and


• | Ensure assets are invested in accordance with the overall financial goals and risk tolerances of the Company.

The IPS is updated annually or as otherwise appropriate to reflect changes to the Company, the economy, the regulatory environment or other factors.
12

Claims Management 
Claims management includes the receipt of initial loss notifications, generation of appropriate responses to claim reports, identification and handling of coverage issues, determination of whether further investigation is required and, where appropriate, retention of legal representation, establishment of case reserves, approval of loss payments and notification to brokers and reinsurers. 
Our claims departments are responsible for the investigation, evaluation and, if validated, efficient payment of claims. We maintain claims handling guidelines and reporting and control procedures across all of our claims departments. Our primary objective is to ensure that each claim is evaluated, processed and appropriately documented in a timely and efficient manner and to retain information relevant to the management of the claim. 
For business written in the Lloyd’s market, claims handling and case reserves are established in accordance with the applicable “Lloyd’s Claims Scheme” and “Lloyd’s Claims Management Principles and Minimum Standards.” 
Competition
The insurance and reinsurance industries are highly competitive. We compete with major U.S., Bermuda, European and other international insurers and reinsurers and certain underwriting syndicates and insurers. We encounter competition in all of our classes of business but there is less competition in those of our lines where we are a specialist underwriter. The Company competes with insurance and reinsurance providers such as:

• | Allied World Assurance Company Holdings, Limited., Arch Capital Group, Limited., Argo Group International Holdings, Ltd., Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited, AXIS Capital Holdings Limited, Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd., Everest Re Group Limited and RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd.;


• | MS Amlin plc, Beazley plc, Brit plc, Hiscox Ltd., Novae Group plc and others in the Lloyd’s market;


• | Scottsdale Insurance Company, Burlington Insurance Company, Nautilus Insurance Company, Essex Insurance Company, Penn-America Group, Inc., Colony Specialty Insurance Company, RSUI Group, Inc., and others in the U.S. excess and surplus market;


• | Asset managers and reinsurers who provide collateralized reinsurance and retrocessional coverage;


• | Treaty and direct insurers, in not only the London but also the global market, that compete with Lloyd’s on a worldwide basis;


• | Various capital markets participants who access insurance and reinsurance business in securitized form, including through special purpose entities or derivative transactions; and


• | Government-sponsored insurers and reinsurers.

Competition varies depending on the type of business being insured or reinsured and whether the Company is in a leading or following position. Competition in the types of business that the Company underwrites is based on many factors, including:

• | premiums charged and other terms and conditions offered;


• | services provided;


• | financial ratings assigned by independent rating agencies;


• | speed of claims payment;


• | reputation;


• | perceived financial strength; and


• | the experience of the underwriter in the line of insurance or reinsurance written.

Increased competition could result in fewer submissions, lower premium rates, lower share of allocated cover, and less favorable policy terms, which could adversely impact the Company’s growth and profitability. Capital market participants have created alternative products such as catastrophe bonds that are intended to compete with reinsurance products. The Company is unable to predict the extent to which these new, proposed or potential initiatives may affect the demand for products or the risks that may be available to be underwritten.
Regulation
The following is a discussion of the regulatory environment and certain key requirements in the jurisdictions of our significant operating subsidiaries.
Bermuda
General: The Insurance Act 1978 and its related regulations (the “Insurance Act”) regulates the Company’s operating insurance subsidiaries in Bermuda as well as the insurance group, the Validus Holdings Group, which the Bermuda Monetary Authority (the “BMA”) is the group supervisor of. The Company has five Bermuda licensed insurance subsidiaries: Validus Reinsurance, Ltd., a Class 4 insurer; Validus Reinsurance (Switzerland) Ltd (Bermuda Branch), a Class 4 insurer; IPCRe Limited (“IPCRe”), a Class 
13

3A insurer; AlphaCat Reinsurance Ltd., a Class 3 insurer; and Mont Fort Re Ltd., a Class 3 insurer. The Company also has two Bermuda-based insurance subsidiaries, AlphaCat Re 2011, Ltd. and AlphaCat Re 2012, Ltd., each licensed as a Special Purpose Insurer (“SPI”) under the Insurance Act and one licensed insurance manager, AlphaCat Managers Ltd. The summary below is limited to Class 3, 3A and 4 insurers and insurance groups.
Annual Requirements: Class 3, 3A and 4 insurers’ significant requirements include: the appointment of an approved independent auditor; the appointment of a principal representative in Bermuda; maintenance of a principal office in Bermuda; the appointment of a loss reserve specialist; the filing of annual Statutory Financial Returns; the filing of annual GAAP financial statements; the filing of an annual Capital and Solvency Return; compliance with minimum enhanced capital requirements; and compliance with the Insurance Code of Conduct. Class 3A and 4 insurers must also maintain their head office in Bermuda.
Statutory Financial Return: The statutory financial return for Class 3 insurers includes the statutory financial statements, and among other items, an auditor’s report, a cover sheet, a general business solvency certificate in relation to any general business undertaken, statutory declaration, statement of changes of control, own risk statement, underwriting analysis, schedule of segregated accounts where applicable, the opinion of the loss reserve specialist and a special purpose business solvency certificate in relation to any special purpose business undertaken.
The statutory financial return for Class 3A and 4 insurers includes the statutory financial statements, and among other items, an auditor’s report and an insurer information sheet. Class 3, 3A, and 4 insurers are also required to submit a declaration of compliance to the BMA together with the statutory financial statements. In addition, Class 3A and 4 insurers are required to file a capital and solvency return in respect of their general business which include, amongst other items, the regulatory risk based capital model, the opinion of the loss reserve specialist, commercial insurer solvency self-assessment, catastrophe risk return, reconciliation of net loss reserves or schedule of loss triangles and an eligible capital and operational risk assessment.
GAAPs: Class 3A and 4 insurers must prepare and submit, on an annual basis, audited financial statements, including notes, prepared under GAAP standards (“GAAP Financial Statements”). The GAAP Financial Statements must be audited annually by the insurer’s approved auditor who must prepare an auditor’s report in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. The insurer is required to file with the BMA annually the audited GAAP Financial Statements within four months from the end of the relevant financial year (unless specifically extended) which are published by the BMA on its website.
Minimum Solvency Margins: The value of the general business assets of licensed insurers must exceed the amount of its general business liabilities by an amount greater than its prescribed minimum solvency margin (“MSM”). The MSM for a Class 4 insurer is the greater of (i) $100.0 million, or (ii) 50% of net premiums written (with a deduction for reinsurance premiums ceded not exceeding 25% of gross premiums written) or (iii) 15% of aggregate net loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) 25% of the enhanced capital requirement. The MSM for a Class 3 & 3A insurer is the greater of (i) $1.0 million, or (ii) 20% of the first $6.0 million of net premiums written or where net premiums written exceed $6.0 million, $1.2 million plus 15% of net premiums written in excess of $6.0 million, or (iii) 15% of aggregate net loss and loss expense provisions and other insurance reserves, or (iv) in the case of Class 3A insurers only 25% of the insurer’s enhanced capital requirement.
Enhanced Capital Requirement: Class 3A and 4 insurers are required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus with respect to its general business at an amount that is equal to or exceeds the value of the enhanced capital requirement (“ECR”) which is calculated at the end of its relevant year by reference to the Bermuda Solvency Capital Requirement (“BSCR”) model or an approved internal capital model, provided that the ECR must always equal or exceed the MSM. The BMA expects Class 3A and 4 insurers to operate at or above a target capital level (“TCL”) which exceeds the insurer’s ECR. The TCL for a Class 3A and 4 insurer is set at 120% of its ECR.
Minimum Liquidity Ratio: The Insurance Act provides a minimum liquidity ratio for general business insurers. An insurer engaged in general business is required to maintain the value of its relevant assets at not less than 75% of the amount of its relevant liabilities.
Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions: A Class 3A and 4 insurer must not declare or pay any dividends of more than 25% of its total statutory capital and surplus as shown on its previous financial year statutory balance sheet, unless at least seven days before payment of the dividend it files with the BMA an affidavit confirming that it will continue to meet its relevant margins following such dividend payment. If it failed to meet any of its relevant margins on the last day of any financial year, a Class 3, 3A and 4 insurer shall not, without the approval of the BMA, declare or pay any dividends during the next financial year. In addition, Class 3, 3A and 4 insurers must obtain the BMA’s prior approval before reducing its total statutory capital, as shown in its previous year’s financial statements, by 15% or more. Furthermore, under the Companies Act, a Bermuda company may only declare or pay a dividend, or make a distribution out of contributed surplus as the case may be, if the company has no reasonable grounds for believing that it is, or would after the payment be, unable to pay its liabilities as they become due, or if the realizable value of its assets would be less than its liabilities.
14

BMA Insurance Code of Conduct: All insurers are required to comply with the BMA’s Insurance Code of Conduct which establishes duties, requirements and standards to be complied with to ensure each insurer implements sound corporate governance, risk management and internal controls. Failure to comply with these requirements may be taken into account by the BMA in determining whether an insurer is conducting its business in a sound and prudent manner.
Group Supervision: The BMA may, in respect of an insurance group, determine whether it is appropriate for it to be the group supervisor of that group. For purposes of the Insurance Act, an insurance group is defined as a group of companies that conducts insurance business. Where the BMA determines that it is the group supervisor, it shall designate a specified insurer that is a member of the insurance group to be the “designated insurer” in respect of that insurance group and it shall give written notice to the designated insurer and other competent authorities that it is the group supervisor. The BMA is the group supervisor of the Validus Holdings Group and has designated Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. as the “designated insurer” of the group. The designated insurer is required to ensure that the Validus Holdings Group complies with the provisions of the Insurance Act pertaining to groups comprising primarily the Insurance (Prudential Standards) (Insurance Group Solvency Requirement) Rules 2011 and Insurance (Group Supervision) Rules 2011 (together, “Group Rules”).
Group Annual Requirements: Every insurance group is required to submit consolidated audited financial statements prepared under International Financial Reporting Standards or any GAAP recognized by the BMA, submit an annual group statutory financial return and a group capital and solvency return including the annual group actuarial opinion. The designated insurer is required to ensure that the group appoints an actuary approved by the BMA to provide an opinion on the insurance group’s insurance technical provisions in accordance with the Group Rules. In addition to the annual filings every insurance group is required to prepare and file quarterly financial returns for the first, second and third financial quarters. The quarterly financial return comprises unaudited consolidated group financial statements, a schedule of material intra-group exposures and risk concentrations.
Group Solvency Margin: An insurance group must ensure that the value of the insurance group’s total statutory economic capital and surplus calculated in accordance with the Group Rules exceeds the aggregate of: (i) the aggregate MSM of each qualifying member of the group controlled by the parent company; and (ii) the parent company’s percentage shareholding in the member multiplied by the member’s MSM, where the parent company exercises significant influence over a member of the group but does not control the member (the “Group MSM”). A member is a qualifying member of the insurance group if it is subject to solvency requirements in the jurisdiction in which it is registered.
Group Enhanced Capital Requirements: Insurance groups are required to maintain available statutory economic capital and surplus to an amount that is equal to or exceeds the value of its group enhanced capital requirement (“Group ECR”) which is calculated at the end of its relevant year by reference to the Group BSCR model or an approved internal capital model provided that the Group ECR shall at all times be an amount equal to or exceeding the Group MSM.
Eligible Capital: To enable the BMA to better assess the quality of an insurer’s capital resources, Class 3A and 4 insurers and insurance groups must maintain available statutory capital and surplus in accordance with a ‘3 tiered capital regime’. All capital instruments are classified as either basic or ancillary capital which in turn are classified into one of three tiers (Tiers 1, 2 and 3) based on their loss absorbency and other characteristics (“Tiered Capital Requirements”). Eligibility limits are then applied to each tier in determining the amounts eligible to cover regulatory capital requirement levels. The highest capital is classified as Tier 1 Capital; lesser quality capital is classified as either Tier 2 Capital or Tier 3 Capital. Under this regime, not more than certain specified percentages of Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3 Capital may be used to satisfy the Class 3A and 4 insurers’ MSM and ECR requirements and Group’s MSM and Group’s ECR requirements.
Public Disclosures: Commercial insurers and insurance groups are required to prepare and publish, on an annual basis, a Financial Condition Report (“FCR”). The FCR provides details of measures governing the business operations, corporate governance framework, solvency and financial performance.
BMA’s Powers of Investigation, Intervention and Obtaining Information: The BMA may require a registered person or a designated insurer to provide such information the BMA may reasonably require with respect to matters that are likely to be material to the performance of its functions under the Insurance Act. In addition, it may require such person’s or designated insurer’s auditor, underwriter, accountant or any other person with relevant professional skill to prepare a report on any aspect pertaining thereto. The BMA has certain powers of investigation relating to insurers and insurance groups which it may exercise in the interest of such insurer’s policyholders or potential policyholders. The BMA has certain powers of intervention relating to registered persons including insurers, if amongst other things, there is any significant risk of insolvency or risk of not being able to meet its policyholders’ obligations, or a breach of the Insurance Act or the registered person’s license conditions or a registered insurer is in breach of its ECR.
The BMA has the power to assist foreign regulatory authorities which have requested assistance in connection with inquiries being carried out by it or on its behalf in certain circumstances.

Shareholder Controller and other Notifications: Under the Insurance Act each shareholder controller or prospective shareholder controller will be responsible for notifying the BMA in writing if the shareholder controller becomes a controller, directly or indirectly, of 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% (“shareholder controller”) of the Company or any of its insurance subsidiaries . Such notification must be made within 45 days of the acquisition in respect of the Company or Validus Re, and either in advance or no later than 45 days after the acquisition, in respect of the Company’s other insurance subsidiaries depending upon the insurer to which the notification relates.
In addition, where a shareholder controller reduces its shareholding to or past such noted shareholding thresholds in any of the Company’s Class 3A or Class 4 insurance subsidiaries such shareholder controller must notify the BMA either in advance or no later than 45 days after the reduction or disposal depending upon the insurer to which the notification relates. The BMA may serve a notice of objection on any controller of the Company’s Bermuda insurance subsidiaries if it appears to the BMA that the person is not or is no longer a fit and proper person to be such a controller.
The Company’s Bermuda insurance subsidiaries are required to notify the BMA in writing in the event of any person becoming or ceasing to be a controller of the insurer. A controller includes a managing director or a chief executive of the insurer or of another company of which it is a subsidiary, or any other person in accordance with whose directions or instructions the directors or controllers of the insurer or a company of which the insurer is a subsidiary are accustomed to act, including any person who holds, or is entitled to exercise, 10% or more of the voting shares or voting power or is able to exercise a significant influence over the management of the insurer or a company of which the insurer is a subsidiary pursuant to the provisions of the Insurance Act. In addition an insurer and a designated insurer in respect of the parent company of the insurance group is required to notify the BMA in the event of any person becoming or ceasing to be an officer of the insurer or of the parent company of the group. An officer includes a director, chief executive or senior executive performing duties of underwriting, actuarial, risk management, compliance, internal audit, finance or investment matters.
Material Change Notifications: All insurers are required to give 30 days’ notice to the BMA of their intention to effect a material change within the meaning of the Insurance Act. Designated insurers are also required to give notice to the BMA if any member of its group intends to give effect to certain material changes within 30 days of such material change taking effect.
United States
General: Western World’s operating subsidiaries are domiciled in the state of New Hampshire. Western World Insurance Company operates as a surplus lines insurer in all U.S. jurisdictions other than New Hampshire. Tudor Insurance Company is licensed as a domestic surplus lines insurer in New Hampshire and is authorized to conduct business as a surplus lines insurer in all other U.S. jurisdictions. Stratford Insurance Company operates as an admitted insurer in 50 U.S. jurisdictions. Talbot operates within the Lloyd’s insurance market through Syndicate 1183, and Lloyd’s operations are subject to regulation in the United States in addition to being regulated in the United Kingdom, as discussed further below. The Lloyd’s market is licensed to engage in insurance business in Illinois, Kentucky and the U.S. Virgin Islands and operates as an eligible excess and surplus lines insurer in all states and territories except Kentucky and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Validus Reaseguros, Inc. and Validus Specialty Underwriting Services, Inc. are licensed reinsurance intermediaries in Florida and New York, respectively. Validus Re America (New Jersey) Inc. is a licensed reinsurance intermediary in New Jersey and New York. 
Much of state insurance regulation follows model statutes or regulations developed or amended by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) which is governed by the chief insurance regulators of each U.S. jurisdiction. Through the NAIC, state insurance regulators establish standards, best practices and coordinate regulatory oversight. 
Holding Company Regulation: Western World’s operating subsidiaries are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of New Hampshire. These regulations generally provide that each insurance company in the system is required to register with the state insurance department and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system which may materially affect the operations, management or financial condition of the insurers within the system. All transactions within a holding company system affecting insurers must be fair and reasonable and notice to the state insurance department is required prior to the consummation of certain material transactions between an insurer and any entity in its holding company system. In addition, certain of such transactions cannot be consummated without prior approval from the state insurance department, or its failure to disapprove after receiving notice. The holding company acts also prohibit any person from directly or indirectly acquiring control of a U.S. insurance company unless that person has filed an application with specified information with the insurance company’s domiciliary commissioner and has obtained the commissioner’s prior approval. Under most states’ statutes, including New Hampshire, acquiring 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered an acquisition of control of the insurance company, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person or entity that acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities a U.S. insurance company without the prior approval of the commissioner will be in violation of these laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities by the commissioner or prohibiting the voting of those securities, or to other actions that may be taken by the commissioner.

In 2010, the NAIC adopted amendments to the Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation, which, among other changes, introduce the concept of “enterprise risk” within an insurance holding company system. If and when the amendments are adopted by a particular state, the amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation would impose more extensive informational requirements on parents and other affiliates of licensed insurers or reinsurers with the purpose of protecting them from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to the licensed companies. The amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act also requires any controlling person of a U.S. insurance company seeking to divest its controlling interest in the insurance company to file with the commissioner a confidential notice of the proposed divestiture at least 30 days prior to the cessation of control; after receipt of the notice, the commissioner shall determine those instances in which the parties seeking to divest or to acquire a controlling interest will be required to file for or obtain approval of the transaction. The amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation must be adopted by the individual states for the new requirements to apply to U.S. domestic insurers and reinsurers. To date, only certain states, including New Hampshire, have enacted legislation adopting the amended Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act in some form. 
Enterprise Risk: The NAIC has increased its focus on risks within an insurer’s holding company system that may pose enterprise risk to the insurer. “Enterprise risk” is defined as any activity, circumstance, event or series of events involving one or more affiliates of an insurer that, if not remedied promptly, is likely to have a material adverse effect upon the financial condition or the liquidity of the insurer or its insurance holding company system as a whole. As noted above, the NAIC recently adopted amendments to its Model Insurance Holding Company System Regulatory Act and Regulation, which include, among other amendments, a requirement for the ultimate controlling person to file an enterprise risk report. In 2012, the NAIC adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”) Model Act, which requires domestic insurers to maintain a risk management framework and establishes a legal requirement for domestic insurers to conduct an ORSA in accordance with the NAIC’s ORSA Guidance Manual. The ORSA Model Act provides that domestic insurers, or their insurance group, must regularly conduct an ORSA consistent with a process comparable to the ORSA Guidance Manual process. The ORSA Model Act also provides that, no more than once a year, an insurer’s domiciliary regulator may request that an insurer submit an ORSA summary report, or any combination of reports that together contain the information described in the ORSA Guidance Manual, with respect to the insurer and/or the insurance group of which it is a member. If and when the ORSA Model Act is adopted by a particular state, the ORSA Model Act would impose more extensive filing requirements on parents and other affiliates of domestic insurers.
Statutory Accounting Practices: Statutory accounting practices, or “SAP,” are a basis of accounting developed to assist U.S. insurance regulators in monitoring and regulating the solvency of insurance companies. It is primarily concerned with measuring an insurer’s surplus to policyholders. Accordingly, statutory accounting focuses on valuing assets and liabilities of insurers at financial reporting dates in accordance with appropriate insurance law and regulatory provisions applicable in each insurer’s domiciliary state. U.S. GAAP concerns an insurer’s solvency, but it also concerns other financial measurements, such as income and cash flows. Accordingly, U.S. GAAP gives more consideration to appropriate matching of revenue and expenses and accounting for management’s stewardship of assets than does SAP. As a direct result, different assets and liabilities and different amounts of assets and liabilities will be reflected in financial statements prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP as opposed to SAP. 
Statutory Accounting Practices established by the NAIC and adopted, in part, by the New Hampshire insurance regulator, determine, among other things, the amount of statutory surplus and statutory net income of Western World’s insurance company subsidiaries and thus determine, in part, the amount of funds they have available to pay dividends. 
Restrictions on Dividends and Distributions: The ability of an insurer to pay dividends or make other distributions is subject to insurance regulatory limitations of the insurance company’s state of domicile. Generally, such laws limit the payment of dividends or other distributions above a specified level. Dividends or other distributions in excess of such thresholds are “extraordinary” and are subject to prior regulatory approval. Such dividends or distributions may be subject to applicable withholding or other taxes. Refer to Note 27 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Statutory and regulatory requirements,” in Part II, Item 8. 
Insurance Regulatory Information System Ratios: The NAIC Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is intended primarily to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states. IRIS identifies 13 industry ratios (referred to as “IRIS ratios”) and specifies “usual values” for each ratio. Departure from the usual values of the IRIS ratios can lead to inquiries from individual state insurance commissioners as to certain aspects of an insurer’s business. Our insurance subsidiaries have consistently met the majority of the IRIS ratio tests.
Risk-Based Capital Requirements: In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the NAIC adopted in December 1993 a formula and model law to implement risk-based capital requirements for property and casualty insurance companies. These risk-based capital requirements are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policyholder obligations. The risk-based capital model for property and casualty insurance companies measures three major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers:
17

•underwriting, which encompasses the risk of adverse loss developments and inadequate pricing;
•declines in asset values arising from credit risk; and
•declines in asset values arising from investment risks.
An insurer will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action depending on how its statutory surplus compares to its risk-based capital calculation. For equity investments in an insurance company affiliate, the risk-based capital requirements for the equity securities of such affiliate would generally be our U.S.-based subsidiaries’ proportionate share of the affiliate’s risk-based capital requirement.
Under the approved formula, an insurer’s total adjusted capital is compared to its authorized control level risk-based capital. If this ratio is above a minimum threshold, no company or regulatory action is necessary. Below this threshold are four distinct action levels at which a regulator can intervene with increasing degrees of authority over an insurer as the ratio of surplus to risk-based capital requirement decreases. The four action levels include:
•insurer is required to submit a plan for corrective action;
•insurer is subject to examination, analysis and specific corrective action;
•regulators may place insurer under regulatory control; and
•regulators are required to place insurer under regulatory control.
Western World’s surplus (as calculated for statutory purposes) is above the risk-based capital thresholds that would require either company or regulatory action.
Guaranty Funds: Most states require all admitted insurance companies to participate in their respective guaranty funds which cover certain claims against insolvent insurers. Solvent insurers licensed in these states are required to cover the losses paid on behalf of insolvent insurers by the guaranty funds and are generally subject to annual assessments in the states by the guaranty funds to cover these losses. 
Federal Regulation: Although state regulation is the dominant form of regulation for insurance business, the federal government in recent years has shown some concern over the adequacy of state regulation. It is not possible to predict the future impact of any potential federal regulations or other possible laws or regulations on our U.S. based subsidiaries’ capital and operations, and such laws or regulations could materially adversely affect their business. In addition, a number of federal laws affect and apply to the insurance industry, including various privacy laws and the economic and trade sanctions implemented by the Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). OFAC maintains and enforces economic sanctions against certain foreign countries and groups and prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in certain transactions with certain persons or entities. OFAC has imposed civil penalties on persons, including insurance companies, arising from violations of its economic sanctions program. 
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the Department of Treasury, which is not a federal regulator or supervisor of insurance, but monitors the insurance industry for systemic risk, consults with the states regarding insurance matters and develops federal policy on aspects of international insurance matters. The Dodd-Frank Act also created a uniform system for non-admitted insurance premium tax payments based on the home state of the policyholder and provides for single state regulation for financial solvency and credit for reinsurance as discussed below.
Credit for Reinsurance: Certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, which became effective on July 21, 2011, provide that only the state in which a primary insurer is domiciled may regulate the financial statement credit for reinsurance taken by that primary insurer. U.S. domiciled ceding companies typically receive full credit for outwards reinsurance protections in their statutory financial statements with respect to liabilities ceded to admitted U.S. domestic reinsurers. However, most states in the U.S. do not confer full credit for outwards reinsurance protections for liabilities ceded to non-admitted or unlicensed reinsurers, unless the reinsurer specifically collateralizes its obligations to the ceding company or is an authorized or trusteed reinsurer in the ceding company’s state of domicile through the establishment of a Multi-Beneficiary Reinsurance Trust (“MBRT”).  
In December 2014, Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. established a MBRT to collateralize its (re)insurance liabilities associated with and for the benefit of U.S. domiciled cedants, and was approved as a trusteed reinsurer in the State of New Jersey. As a result, cedants domiciled in that state will receive automatic credit in their regulatory filings for the reinsurance provided prospectively by the Company. Following the approval by the State of New Jersey, the Company submitted applications in most other U.S. states and territories, respectively, to become a trusteed reinsurer. As of December 31, 2016, Validus Reinsurance, Ltd. was approved as a trusteed reinsurer in 48 states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. In addition, Validus Re Swiss established a MBRT in December 2015 and was approved as a trusteed reinsurer in 44 states as well as Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia 
18

as of December 31, 2016. It is our intention over time to transition U.S. domiciled cedants with outstanding letters of credit to the MBRT and therefore reduce our reliance on letters of credit. Through Lloyd’s, Talbot is also an accredited reinsurer in all states and territories of the United States. Lloyd’s maintains various trust funds in the state of New York to protect its U.S. business and is therefore subject to regulation by the New York Department of Financial Services, which acts as the domiciliary department for Lloyd’s U.S. trust funds. There are deposit trust funds in other states to support Lloyd’s reinsurance and excess and surplus lines insurance business.
As a result of the requirements relating to the provision of credit for reinsurance, our reinsurance companies are indirectly subject to certain regulatory requirements imposed by jurisdictions in which ceding companies are approved as trusteed reinsurers. In addition, the insurance and reinsurance regulatory framework of Bermuda and the insurance of U.S. risk by companies based in Bermuda and not licensed or authorized in the United States recently has become the subject of increased scrutiny in many jurisdictions, including the United States. We are not able to predict the future impact of changes in the laws and regulation to which we are or may become subject on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations.
Tax Regulations: Talbot is subject to a Closing Agreement between Lloyd’s and the U.S. Internal Revenue Service pursuant to which Talbot is subject to U.S. federal income tax to the extent its income is attributable to U.S. agents who have authority to bind Talbot. Specifically, U.S. federal income tax is imposed on 35% of its income attributable to U.S. binding authorities (70% for Illinois or Kentucky business).
Other Regulations: AlphaCat Managers Ltd. is a licensed insurance manager and is registered as an investment adviser with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under the U.S. Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. AlphaCat Managers Ltd. is also registered as a “commodity pool operator” with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) and is a member of the National Futures Association.
United Kingdom
U.K. regulation of insurance is provided for by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 and operated, following the Financial Services Act 2012, by two focused regulators; the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”) and the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”).
The FCA has a strong mandate for promoting confidence and transparency in financial services and gives greater protection for consumers of financial services. The PRA is responsible for the day-to-day supervision of financial institutions that are subject to significant prudential risk. It adopts a more judgment-based approach to regulation so that business models can be challenged, risks identified and action taken to preserve financial stability. The PRA also has an insurance objective of contributing to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for those who are or may become policyholders. 
In relation to insurance, the FCA and PRA both regulate insurers, insurance intermediaries and Lloyd’s itself. The FCA, PRA and Lloyd’s have common objectives in ensuring that the Lloyd’s market is appropriately regulated. To minimize duplication, there are arrangements with Lloyd’s for co-operation on supervision and enforcement.
Talbot’s underwriting activities are therefore regulated by both the FCA and PRA as well as being subject to the Lloyd’s “franchise” rules. All three have powers to remove their respective authorization for Talbot to manage Lloyd’s syndicates. Lloyd’s approves Syndicate 1183’s business plan annually as well as any subsequent material changes, together with the amount of capital (known as Funds at Lloyd’s or “FAL”) required to support that plan. Lloyd’s may require changes to any business plan presented to it or additional FAL to be provided to support the underwriting. 
Talbot Risk Services Pte, Ltd. operates in Singapore and Australia to source business in the Far East and Australia. In Singapore, Talbot Risk Services Pte, Ltd. operates under the Lloyd’s Asia Scheme which permits underwriters to write Singaporean business and non-Singaporean business locally through service companies in Singapore. In Australia, Talbot Risk Services Pte, Ltd sources business from the local region and holds an Australian Financial Services License which is issued by Australian Securities & Investments Commission. Talbot Underwriting (MENA) Ltd. operates in Dubai to source business from the Middle East and North Africa and is regulated by the Dubai Financial Services Authority.
An EU directive covering the capital adequacy, risk management and regulatory reporting for insurers, known as Solvency II was adopted by the European Parliament in April 2009. Solvency II came into force on January 1, 2016. Insurers and reinsurers have been and continue to undertake a significant amount of work to ensure that they meet the new requirements and this may divert resources from other operational roles. The Lloyd’s Solvency II internal model, which covers all members at Lloyd’s, in aggregate, was approved by the PRA in December 2015. Talbot is currently in compliance with all Solvency II requirements.

Switzerland
Our Swiss reinsurance subsidiary, Validus Re Swiss, is a company limited by shares and headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland. Validus Re Swiss maintains a branch office in Bermuda, Validus Reinsurance (Switzerland) Ltd. (Bermuda Branch), a Class 4 insurer.
Regulation and Supervision: Validus Re Swiss obtained its reinsurance license from the Swiss Federal Office of Private Insurance (now the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority or “FINMA”) in December 2006.
Under Swiss rules and regulations, Swiss reinsurance companies are generally subject to many, but not all, of the same provisions that apply to direct insurers, and include the following obligations:
Adequacy of Financial Resources: The minimum capital for the reinsurance license that Validus Re Swiss holds is CHF 10 million. In addition, Validus Re Swiss must maintain adequate solvency and disposable and unencumbered capital resources to cover its entire activities in accordance with solvency requirement as stipulated by Swiss insurance legislation. 
Solvency is determined based on the Swiss Solvency Test (“SST”). Under this approach, a company’s capital is considered adequate if its risk bearing capital (“RBC”) exceeds its target capital (“TC”). RBC is defined as the difference between assets at a market-consistent value and discounted best estimated liabilities. TC is defined as the sum of a market value margin and the difference between the discounted one-year RBC and the current year RBC. The SST involves a sophisticated analysis to calculate the market-consistent valuation of all assets and liabilities with a methodological approach to risk categories (insurance risk, credit risk, etc.) subjecting them to scenario stress tests at a basic level in the context of the standard regulatory approach but, where appropriate, permitting the use of internal models in the overall management of risk, once such models are validated. 
The SST is very close to the “Solvency II” standard of the European Union. On June 5, 2015, Switzerland was granted full equivalence by the European Commission in all three areas of Solvency II: solvency calculation, group supervision and reinsurance. This decision was the outcome of a detailed assessment conducted by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“EIOPA”).
For the SST all assets of Validus Re Swiss are considered.  There is no direct constraint on permitted investments since the provisions regarding assets linked to reserves in the Swiss insurance legislation do not apply to reinsurance firms. However, the use of derivative instruments is required to be fully considered as part of the risk management processes and limited to reducing investment or insurance risk or to secure investment efficiencies.
Annual Reporting and Disclosure: Validus Re Swiss is required to prepare an annual report at the end of each financial year on the solvency margins available, as well as an annual report on the calculation of target capital and on risk bearing capital. Validus Re Swiss also files a corporate report incorporating audited financial statements prepared in accordance with Swiss law and a supervisory report in the prescribed format.
In addition and as a result of the Solvency II equivalence achievement, effective January 1, 2016, FINMA implemented new supervisory regulations resulting in new reporting and disclosure requirements with the most important requirements for Validus Re Swiss being the following:
Own Risk and Solvency Assessment (“ORSA”): The new requirements provide that Swiss domiciled reinsurance companies must maintain a risk management framework and ORSA process which is defined in an internal “ORSA policy.” The ORSA policy must outline all the processes and procedures undertaken to identify, evaluate, monitor and manage risks during the course of business as well as the processes and procedures performed to determine capital adequacy. The ORSA process is required to be performed on a yearly basis and an ORSA report has to be submitted to FINMA no later than January 31 of each year.
Public Disclosure: The new legislation requires Swiss domiciled reinsurance companies to publish a report on their financial situation. Going forward, the report needs to be submitted to FINMA and made accessible to the public. It requires companies to provide details on their business activities, company results, corporate governance and risk management, risk profile, the valuation basis for assets and liabilities, capital and solvency.
Capital Structure and Dividends: Validus Re Swiss is funded by equity in the form of paid in share capital and share premium. Under Swiss corporate law as modified by insurance supervisory law, a non-life insurance company is obliged to contribute to statutory legal reserves a minimum of 20% of any annual profit up to 50% of statutory capital, being paid in share capital (or capital contribution reserves). Validus Re Swiss has been substantially funded by share premium, exceeding 50% of the company’s share capital. As of the date of this Annual Report, capital contribution reserves can be distributed to shareholders without being subject to withholding tax. However, the distribution of any dividend to shareholders remains subject to the approval of FINMA which has regard to the maintenance of solvency and the interests of reinsureds and creditors.
