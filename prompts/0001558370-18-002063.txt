 Item 1. Business
 Overview
     We are a healthcare technology company disrupting the field of medication safety. For over thirty years, traditional pharmacy software systems have offered clinicians a binary view of drug-to-drug interactions, presenting an assessment of one single drug against one single drug. These legacy systems may be adequate to assess the safety of a medication regimen consisting of only one or two medications. However, the elderly, the chronically ill and those with behavioral health challenges, who are more often times more likely to be subject to a medication profile of more than two medications, are typically at high risk of an adverse drug effect, or ADE. In these cases, the average patient often takes over 10 different medications a day and the current technologies are inadequate to optimize safety and minimize risk.  Our novel and proprietary Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix, or MRM Matrix, delivers a simultaneous, multi-drug review which identifies medication-related risks across a variety of safety factors and presents meaningful opportunities to mitigate such risks. We partner with health plans and provider groups in comprehensive medication management and care transitions programs to identify and substantially mitigate the risks associated with ADEs and to promote adherence to personalized medication regimens. By working with us, health plans and provider groups have reduced their pharmacy spend and admissions rates.  
     We are a leader in providing patient-specific, data-driven technology and solutions that enable healthcare organizations to optimize medication regimens to improve patient outcomes, reduce hospitalizations, lower healthcare costs and manage risk. We deliver our solutions through a comprehensive suite of technology-enabled products and services for medication risk management, which includes bundled prescription fulfillment and reminder packaging services for client populations with complex prescription needs. We also provide risk adjustment services and pharmacy cost management services, which help our clients to properly characterize a patient's acuity, or severity of health condition, and optimize the associated payments for care. With 4.1 billion outpatient prescriptions filled in the United States in 2017, medication treatment is the most common medical intervention, and its imprecise use represents the fourth leading cause of death and contributes to an estimated 45 to 50 million ADEs annually with 2.5 to 4.0 million of those ADEs considered serious, disabling or fatal. The incidence of ADEs is highly correlated to the number of medications an individual is taking and non-adherence to prescribed regimens, and thus is particularly relevant to populations with complex healthcare needs. Our technology-driven approach to medication risk management represents an evolution from prevailing non-personalized approaches that primarily rely on single drug-to-drug interaction analysis. We currently serve approximately 170 healthcare organizations that focus on populations with complex healthcare needs and extensive medication requirements.
     Our suite of cloud-based software solutions provides prescribers, pharmacists and healthcare organizations with sophisticated and innovative tools to better manage the medication-related needs of their patients. We believe we offer the first prospective clinical approach to medication risk management, which is designed to increase patient safety and promote adherence to a patient's personalized medication regimen. Furthermore, our medication risk management technology helps healthcare organizations lower costs by reducing ADEs, enhancing quality of care and avoiding preventable hospital admissions. Most of our products and services are built around our novel and proprietary MRM Matrix which enables optimization of a patient's medication regimen, involving personalizing medication selection, dosage levels, time-of-day administration and reducing the total medication burden by eliminating unnecessary prescriptions. The MRM Matrix analyzes a combination of clinical and pharmacology data, population-based algorithms and extensive patient-specific data, including medical history, lab results, medication lists and individual genomic data, to deliver "precision medicine" decision support. We provide software-enabled solutions that can be bundled with prescription fulfillment and reminder packaging services, which are informed by a patient's personalized MRM Matrix to increase adherence to a patient's optimized regimen, through our three prescription fulfillment pharmacies. Our prescription fulfillment pharmacies are strategically located to efficiently distribute medications nationwide for our clients and medications are packaged to promote adherence to their patients' personalized regimens and dosing schedules. Our team of clinical pharmacists, located in five call centers throughout the U.S., is available to support prescribers at the point of care through our proprietary technology platform, including real-time secure messaging, with more than 150,000 messages exchanged during December 2017, and support health plan members and prescribers with telephonic outreach and interventions based on drug therapy problems identified through the review of historical claims data.
     Total spending in the United States on prescription medicines will increase 4 percent to 7 percent through 2021, reaching $580 billion to $610 billion, according to a report issued by the QuintilesIMS Institute. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in any given month, 48% of Americans take a prescription medication, and 

 
  5

 
11% take five or more prescription medications. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, ADEs result in more than 100,000 deaths annually in the United States, and a study by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, notes that ADEs cause approximately 125,000 hospitalizations, one million emergency room visits, two million affected hospital stays and 3.5 million physician office visits every year. According to a book published by the National Academy of Sciences in 2000, for every dollar spent on ambulatory medications, another dollar is spent to treat new health problems caused by the medication. These statistics indicate that medication treatment is complex, and current tools available to healthcare organizations have been largely unsuccessful in mitigating ADEs.
     To enhance healthcare outcomes and better control costs, employers, health insurers and government agencies are restructuring health coverage and care models to make healthcare providers more accountable for healthcare utilization and quality of care. As the U.S. healthcare market continues to evolve from a fee-for-service to a value-based model of care, healthcare organizations require new and emerging technologies to optimize treatment and manage risk on a patient-specific, customized basis. Our solutions are targeted currently to "at-risk" healthcare organizations that are clinically and financially responsible for the populations they serve, receiving a fixed payment for the care provided to each patient for an entire episode of care or enrollment period. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, there were approximately 138 million people in the United States covered under government-sponsored programs in 2016, and this number is expected to reach 154 million by 2020. Government-sponsored programs are leading the shift to value-based healthcare. Our solutions support our clients in achieving the Institute for Healthcare Improvement, or IHI, "Triple Aim" of improving a patient's experience, while managing the health of a client's population and controlling costs.
     We are led by highly experienced and entrepreneurial executive officers with more than 70 years of cumulative experience in the healthcare industry. Our co-founder, Dr. Calvin H. Knowlton, founded excelleRx, Inc., and along with Dr. Orsula Knowlton and other members of our management team, built it into the largest national hospice medication management pharmacy in the United States servicing approximately 400 hospice agencies with approximately 48,000 patients in 46 states, at the time it was sold to Omnicare, Inc. in 2005.
     Since our first year of active operations in 2011, our revenue has grown to $134.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, with a net income of $14.3 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $18.3 million. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures — Adjusted EBITDA" for our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, why we present Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. We had an annual revenue retention rate of 99% and client retention rate of 95% in 2017. See "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Key Business Metrics" for our definitions of revenue retention rate and client retention rate.

an aggregate of 5,089,436 million shares of common stock, par value $.0001 per share. Our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “TRHC.”
     On December 8, 2017, we closed an underwritten public offering, or the Offering, of 1,350,000 shares of our common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at an issuance price of $27.50 per share, or $25.85 per share after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. We received net proceeds of $34.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of $2.2 million but before deducting other offering expenses. The net proceeds were used to repay outstanding indebtedness under our Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit.
     Acquisitions
     On September 6, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Sinfonía HealthCare Corporation, pursuant to which we acquired the SinfoníaRx business, which we refer to as SRx. SRx is a provider of Medication Therapy Management, or MTM, technology and services for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans. The consideration for the acquisition was comprised of (i) cash consideration of $35.0 million paid upon closing, subject to certain customary post-closing adjustments; (ii) the issuance of $10.0 million of our common stock, or 520,821 shares, calculated based on the arithmetic average of the day volume-weighted average (rounded to two decimal places) trading price per share of our common stock for the 20 trading days ended on and including the trading day prior to the closing of the acquisition, using trading prices reported on the NASDAQ Global Market; and (iii) contingent purchase price consideration with a preliminary estimated acquisition date fair value of $38.1 million to be paid 50% in cash and 50% in our common stock based on the achievement of certain performance goals for each of the twelve-month periods ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2018. The stock consideration issued upon closing had a value of $11.5 million. In addition, we are not obligated to pay more than $35.0 million in cash and our common stock for the first contingent payment, or more than $130.0 million for the aggregate overall closing consideration and contingent payments.
     In September 2016, we acquired certain assets, consisting primarily of intellectual property and software assets of 9176-1916 Quebec Inc. The intellectual property and software assets were previously licensed by us and are integrated into the MRM Matrix. The acquisition consideration consisted of cash consideration of up to $6.0 million, consisting of $1.0 million which was paid upon closing, $4.4 million paid on during the fourth quarter of 2016, $550 thousand paid on September 15, 2017, and $50 thousand paid on October 13, 2017. In addition to the cash consideration, the purchase price included $5.0 million of common stock, consisting of $2.5 million, or 201,353 shares, of common stock issued on November 15, 2016 and $2.5 million, or 194,054 shares, of common stock issued on December 29, 2016. The stock consideration issued was calculated based on the arithmetic average of the daily volume-weighted average price of our common stock for the 30 business days ending on, and including, the 30th and 60th business day, respectively, following the completion of the IPO.
     We account for acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. We allocated the purchase price to the assets acquired, including intangible assets and liabilities assumed, based on estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. The results of operations from the acquisition are included in our consolidated financial statements from the acquisition date.
     Financing
     On September 6, 2017, we entered into an Amended and Restated Loan and Security Agreement, or the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit, whereby we amended and restated our revolving line of credit, which was originally entered into on April 29, 2015 and amended on July 1, 2016.  The Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit provides for borrowings in an aggregate amount up to $40.0 million to be used for general corporate purposes, with a $1.0 million sublimit for cash management services and letters of credit and foreign exchange transactions. We may also request an increase in the size of the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit by up to $10.0 million upon the successful syndication of such additional amounts. As of December 31, 2017, we had no amount outstanding under the Amended and Restated 2015 Line of Credit.

 Our Solutions
     Medication risk management is our leading offering, and our cloud-based software applications, including EireneRx and MedWise Advisor, together with our bundled prescription fulfillment and reminder packaging services, provide solutions for a range of payors, providers and other healthcare organizations. Our products and services are built around our proprietary MRM Matrix, which combines clinical and pharmacology data, population-based algorithms and extensive patient-specific data, including medical history, lab results, medication lists and personal genomic information, to deliver what the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, refers to as "precision medicine." Precision medicine combines traditional evidence-based medication selection with new patient-specific medication selection to better optimize a patient's medication therapy. Our suite of technology products is built on a powerful rules engine that houses comprehensive pharmacotherapy profiles, provides risk alerts and includes a combination of proprietary decision-support tools, real-time secure messaging, e-prescribing and advanced precision-dosing functionality, among other functions. Our software applications help reduce ADEs, enhance medication adherence and quality of care, improve medication safety at the individual patient level and reduce the total medication burden by eliminating unnecessary prescriptions.
     We also provide risk adjustment services and pharmacy cost management services to help our clients achieve correct reimbursement, maintain regulatory compliance and optimize pharmacy spend.
     The following chart sets forth the environment within which our solutions, enabled by our personalized MRM Matrix, apply precision medicine practices to collect, analyze and process patient information to accurately inform each patient's medication regimen.

     Our Strategy
     Further Penetrate and Grow with the Expansion of Our Current At-Risk Markets
     By leveraging our industry expertise and thought leadership and expanding our sales and marketing efforts, we believe that we can increasingly penetrate the market for existing and new at-risk clients. We are the market leader in providing medication risk management to Programs of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, or PACE, a CMS sponsored program through which participating healthcare organizations provide fully integrated healthcare delivery on an at-risk basis for elderly adults, most of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid. Our PACE clients cover approximately 25% of the total PACE enrollees nationwide. We believe that we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow within this market. According to the National PACE Association, currently, there are 123 PACE programs operating 250 PACE centers in 31 states serving over 45,000 participants, a 46% increase over the 84 PACE organizations in 2012. The number of participants enrolled in PACE organizations, who have a typical length of stay exceeding four years, has doubled over the last five years, yet, according to a study we commissioned from AEC Consulting, LLC, represents only 4% of the total eligible individuals within current PACE service areas.
     We expect our PACE clients to continue to grow to cover more eligible lives. This growth may be facilitated by existing state and federal initiatives that present expansion opportunities for PACE, including recently allowing the formation of PACE organizations by for-profit providers, and the creation of other PACE-like, at-risk organizations, many of which would be targets for our solutions. For example, the PACE Innovation Act of 2015 allows CMS to develop pilot programs using the PACE model of care to serve individuals under age 55 and at risk of needing nursing home care as well as other patients with chronic diseases. Working with our scalable solutions can help PACE organizations facilitate their growth.
     Furthermore, in Medicare Advantage and similar value-based care models, patients are assigned relative risk scores based on diagnosis, which need to be documented accurately each year for proper reimbursement. We are also the market leader in risk adjustment and front-end coding for PACE organizations, and we plan to continue to expand these services to other Medicare Advantage programs as well as at-risk provider groups.
     On January 1, 2017, we launched our Enhanced Medication Therapy Management, or EMTM, program, with a large, regional Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plan, or Regional PDP. To execute this EMTM program, we are using our MRM Matrix and certain other services to perform medication risk stratification and reviews and safety assessments of complex medication regimens, providing an innovative, alternative approach to pharmacotherapy to the highest risk of the 240,000 members of this Regional PDP, representing less than one percent of the entire eligible Part D market. We believe if we are successful in developing and delivering an EMTM program to the Regional PDP, we will be able to expand into a greater portion of the Part D market. There can be no assurances that our EMTM program will be successful or we will actually be able to expand this program as currently contemplated.
     Continue Expansion into Emerging At-Risk Provider and Payor Markets
     We intend to leverage our expertise and experience from our existing clients to expand to other at-risk providers and payors through increased investment in our sales force and marketing efforts.
     We believe that the growth in government healthcare programs and the shift to value-based care models are creating opportunities for many organizations to capture growing portions of the expanding healthcare market. Accordingly, we are actively targeting at-risk, value-based markets, including managed care organizations, physician provider groups, self-insured companies and Accountable Care Organizations, or ACOs, which are healthcare organizations characterized by a payment and care delivery model that ties provider reimbursement to quality metrics and the total cost of care for an assigned population. We also target post-acute healthcare organizations, which provide a range of medical services to support an individual's recovery or manage chronic illness after a period of in-patient care. We believe non-PACE ACOs offer another large market for our solutions, as they operate under a similar at-risk reimbursement model. The number of ACOs in the United States has increased from 64 in 2011 to 923 in the third quarter of 2017, collectively covering approximately 32.4 million individuals. Many physician provider groups are moving to at-risk, capitated payment models in response to incentives from managed care organizations and government programs.

 Many post-acute healthcare services are also transitioning to value-based care models. On April 1, 2015, the CMS Innovation Center's Bundled Payments for Care Improvement, or BPCI, initiative began, which comprises four broadly defined models of care designed to improve the coordination and quality of care at a lower cost to Medicare. In the BPCI initiative, post-acute care facilities and home health agencies receive bundled payments for episodes of care. According to CMS, there are approximately 2,300 organizations participating in the BPCI program as of January 2018. As the market leader in pharmacy cost management solutions in the post-acute market, we believe we are also well positioned to further serve these organizations with medication risk management solutions as they continue migrating to an at-risk reimbursement structure.
     Continue to Innovate and Expand Platform Offerings to Meet Evolving Market Needs
     We believe our investments in human capital, technology and services capabilities position us to continue to pursue rapid innovation and expand our medication risk management solutions and other platform offerings to the broader healthcare marketplace. For example, we have developed and launched high-throughput medication risk stratification technology for identification of high-risk patients in need of clinical intervention, and we are developing a patient engagement application of our MRM Matrix solution. In addition, to further our commitment to innovation in the healthcare technology sector, we have established the Jack Russell Software Innovation Center which works collaboratively with our corporate university, TRHC University, to provide technology leadership, creative problem solving skills and training to our employees as well as the healthcare community more broadly. We also believe there is a substantial opportunity in our existing client base to cross-sell our full set of solutions.     Selectively Pursue Strategic Acquisitions and Partnerships
     Since our founding in 2009, we have successfully completed and integrated seven acquisitions, which have significantly expanded our market footprint and broadened our medication risk management and risk adjustment offerings. We plan to continue to acquire assets and businesses and may enter into strategic partnerships that strengthen or expand our service offerings, capabilities and geographic reach and facilitate our entry into new markets. Our acquisition strategy is driven by our commitment to serving client needs, and we are continuously assessing the market for potential opportunities. On September 6, 2017, we acquired the SRx business, a provider of MTM technology and services for Medicare, Medicaid, and commercial health plans. The SRx business will give us exposure to a larger customer base that will enable us to leverage our technology in the broader market, as well as offer cross-selling market exposure opportunities.     Develop International Market Opportunities
     We believe we are well positioned to provide our products and services to international healthcare organizations that face challenges similar to those that our clients face domestically. Our solutions are readily scalable and can be utilized by healthcare organizations abroad seeking to achieve the IHI Triple Aim. We believe our solutions would provide significant value to the international healthcare landscape, which is frequently characterized by single-payor government-administered healthcare.     Our Core Technology
     ADEs often result from unintended drug overdoses due to factors such as multi-drug interactions, impaired renal function, medication-related genomic variants and the cumulative impact of drug-related sensitivities, such as excess sedation and increased risk of falls and injury. Combining medications with anticholinergic drugs, which are drugs that block the action of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to the nervous system, increases the likelihood of these and other similar ADEs. The risk of ADEs resulting from combining certain drugs with those that have anticholinergic properties is high given the fact that many common over-the-counter and prescription medications contain anticholinergic ingredients. Our goal is to enable prescribers to optimize the use of medications using a prospective approach to medication risk management in order to avoid ADEs and improve patient outcomes. Our technology suite enables a novel approach to optimize the medication regimen of individual patients and address the issues with prevailing prescribing methodologies.
     Utilizing our technology, prescribers obtain real-time information about the factors impacting a medication's effectiveness and safety for a particular patient grounded in evidence-based clinical data and extensive patient-specific data. Our technologies deliver prospective intervention and are designed to reduce ADEs, increase medication adherence and quality of care and improve medication safety at the individual patient level. Our cloud-based applications are 

 
  10

 
scalable, easily accessible to healthcare organizations, seamlessly integrated with client applications and databases and customized for use across the healthcare continuum of care. Our software systems provide secure communication between prescribers and our pharmacists, and our sophisticated medication decision-support tools are interoperable with many industry-leading electronic health record systems, or EHRs. We believe our innovative technology platform offers a means of improving patient outcomes while mitigating medication-related and financial risk for healthcare organizations.
     Our suite of cloud-based software solutions incorporates comprehensive pharmacotherapy profiles, a combination of proprietary decision-support tools, risk alerts, e-prescribing, advanced precision-dosing functionality, real-time secure messaging and health literacy aids, among other functions. At the core of our technology platform is our proprietary MRM Matrix. Through a sophisticated rules engine, the MRM Matrix combines patient-specific data with the science of pharmacokinetics, the effects of what the body does to drugs, and pharmacodynamics, the effects of what the drug does to the body, to enable our clients to personalize the medication regimen of each patient. The MRM Matrix also draws upon pharmacoevidence, which considers published guidelines that denote potentially inappropriate medications for older adults such as the Beers Criteria and potentially unsafe medications in various age groups such as the FDA's Black Box warnings, as well as pharmacoeconomics, which compares the cost, expressed in monetary terms, and effects, expressed in terms of monetary value, efficacy or enhanced quality of life, of one pharmaceutical drug or drug therapy to another.

     We have a team of pharmacists available to perform medication risk analysis and offer guidance, including the clinical application of pharmacogenomic test results and data application, to the prescriber based upon their assessment of the MRM Matrix and the individual patient's medical history. Our clinical pharmacists provide these personalized medication recommendations predominantly through secure real-time messaging. Available 24/7, 365 days per year, this service supports the medication risk management clinical decision making process with medication safety recommendations, including to eliminate unnecessary prescriptions, and execution of the optimized medication regimen. We exchanged over 150,000 secure real-time messages in December 2017.        Prescription Fulfillment and Reminder Packaging
     We operate three prescription fulfillment pharmacies strategically located to efficiently distribute medications nationwide for our clients. Informed by each patient's personalized MRM Matrix, we package, synchronize and aggregate medications by day, time-of-day and dosage to increase the ease of adherence by patients to their optimized medication regimens. Using automated, robotic dispensing machines, our scalable, high-performance systems allow for an array of medication packaging options, including multi-dose deep well cards and multi-dose pouches.
     Effective March 2016, we entered into a prime vendor agreement with AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation, or AmerisourceBergen, a drug wholesaler, to provide us with the pharmaceutical products we sell. The prime vendor agreement was subsequently amended and restated effective May 1, 2016. As part of this agreement, we are obligated to purchase at least 95% of the total dollar amount of prescription pharmaceutical products we sell from AmerisourceBergen. The contract also commits us to a monthly minimum purchase obligation of approximately $1.75 million. Our amended and restated contract with AmerisourceBergen has an initial term of three years expiring April 30, 2019, and can be terminated by, among other things, either party's material breach that continues for 30 days. Pursuant to the terms of a security agreement entered into in connection with the prime vendor agreement, AmerisourceBergen also holds a subordinated security interest in all of our assets.
     The reason we purchase large quantities of pharmaceutical products from a single wholesaler is primarily for ease of administration and pricing. In the event of a termination of our relationship with AmerisourceBergen, we believe that there is typically at least one alternative drug wholesaler from whom we could source each non-limited distribution drug we dispense. We further believe that we could replace the inventories without a material disruption to our operations.
     Risk Adjustment
     We take a prospective approach to risk adjustment, going beyond the typical strategy of providing retrospective reviews and claims data analysis. We identify opportunities for efficiency and performance improvement in coding patterns, data integrity and diagnosis volumes and trends. Our consultants help clients to refine processes and systems to capture timely, complete and accurate claims data. Our team of expert physicians and nurse consultants trains client staff 

 
  15

 
and providers about documentation and diagnosis coding, analyzes client data collection and submission processes and delivers meaningful analytics for understanding reimbursement complexities.
     Long-term optimization of risk adjustment outcomes is complex and, for many organizations, significantly affects financial performance. We specialize in helping clients optimize processes and systems to capture timely, complete and accurate data. Through these services, we currently help PACE and other healthcare organizations remain compliant with regulations, make reliable comparisons to internal and external benchmarks and identify high-volume/high-cost issues for quality program initiatives.
     Pharmacy Cost Management
     We design, implement and manage pharmacy cost-containment strategies for our post-acute care clients. Pharmacy cost management services help our clients reduce risk, increase compliance and optimize spending. For many of our clients, excessive pharmacy costs are a common driver of shrinking profit margins. Complex contract language, atypical dispensing practices and a lack of recourse for pricing errors contribute to inaccurate pharmacy budgets, improper reimbursement and waste. Our analytics provide real-time reporting, simplify drug-spend data and are designed to create contract transparency for our clients. By simplifying and adding oversight to the adjudication process, we help clients avoid risks associated with managing pharmacy costs by preventing overpayments and ensuring appropriate reimbursements.     Our Clients
     Our clients are typically at-risk healthcare organizations, primarily PACE organizations, managed-care organizations, including government and commercial plans, post-acute care facilities, pharmacies and other provider groups. We have strong and long-standing relationships with our clients, providing services under multi-year contracts. At the end of 2015, 2016, and 2017, we were serving 119, 133, and 170 healthcare organizations, respectively. Our annual revenue retention rate was 99%, 98%, and 99% for 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and our client retention rate was 95%, 93% and 96%, respectively, which we believe reflects strong client satisfaction with our solutions. During 2017, we signed a master agreement with Trinity Health Corporation covering 11 PACE facilities, which represented 18% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. Prior to signing this master agreement, each of these PACE facilities had separate contracts with us and were considered separate, individual, clients. For the year ended December 31, 2016 no single client accounted for greater than 10% of revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2015, one client accounted for 10% of total revenue. On a combined basis, the 11 PACE facilities, now covered by the master agreement with Trinity Health Corporation, represented 17% and 15% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We believe our clients view us as a trusted partner that shares their commitment to improving medication-related health outcomes and reducing overall healthcare costs.
     PACE Organizations
     PACE, a federal and state collaboration, is one growing model serving the dual-eligible patient population that focuses on averting institutional-based placement. PACE embodies many of the characteristics and trends affecting the healthcare industry as a whole. Our proof of concept was to provide medication risk management technology and services to PACE organizations, which are responsible for elderly patients, typically with complex medication regimens. Over the past seven years, we have become the market-leader in providing PACE with medication risk management. Our PACE clients cover approximately 25% of the total PACE enrollees nationwide. However, the existing PACE enrollees represent only 4% of the 900,000 total eligible individuals within current PACE service areas, according to a study we commissioned from AEC Consulting, LLC. In addition to personalized medication management, we also provide risk adjustment services to PACE organizations.
     Managed Care Organizations
     Since 2004, the number of beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare Advantage, or MA, plans has more than tripled from 5.3 million to 19.0 million in 2017 and is expected to grow to 22 million by 2020. MA is a capitated program with payment rates that are calculated based on the acuity of the patients served. Accordingly, patients are assigned relative risk scores based on diagnosis, which need to be documented accurately each year for appropriate reimbursement. We have become the market leader in risk adjustment and front-end coding for PACE organizations and we plan to continue 

 
  16

 
to expand these services to other MA programs. Furthermore, we believe our solutions are broadly applicable throughout the managed care landscape, including to the self-funded employer groups.
     Acute and Post-Acute Care Providers
     Acute and post-acute care providers are increasingly operating in value-based care models. Under the BPCI, providers such as hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, in-patient rehabilitation facilities and home health agencies began to receive bundled payments for episodes of care. According to CMS, there are approximately 2,300 organizations participating in the BPCI program as of January 2018.
     We are the market leader in pharmacy cost management solutions in the post-acute arena, helping facilities manage their pharmacy spend for their capitated patients. Our clients include approximately 1,500 of the more than 15,400 post-acute facilities in the United States. We believe there are significant opportunities to cross-sell our medication risk management solutions within this client base.
     At-Risk Provider Groups
     We contract with at-risk provider groups across the country for care transitions support and comprehensive medication management services.  We risk-stratify patient cohorts for these groups and identify patients at risk of an ADE. We then collaborate with these groups on appropriate levels of intervention to mitigate that risk.     Intellectual Property
     We create, own and maintain various intellectual property assets which, in the aggregate, are of material importance to our business. Our intellectual property assets include: one patent and three pending patent applications related to our innovations, products and services; trademarks related to our brands, products and services; copyrights in software, documentation, content and databases; and trade secrets relating to data processing, statistical methodologies, data security and other aspects of our business. We are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others, and, similarly, other companies are licensed on a non-exclusive basis to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us.
     We rely on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws as well as confidentiality agreements, licenses and other agreements with employees, consultants, vendors and clients. We also seek to control access to and distribution of our proprietary software, confidential information and know-how, technology and other intellectual property. We have one issued patent for our medication management system and method (U.S. Pat. No. 8,392,220, issued March 2013) and three patent applications pending in the United States, the first, filed in December 2014, relates to our Medication Risk Mitigation System and Method and the second and third, filed in January 2016 and May 2017, respectively, relate to our MRM Matrix. We also have four pending provisional applications. Our issued patent expires on November 8, 2031. We own one registered copyright protecting the code and documentation related to EireneRx, initially filed in 2012 and updated in 2015.
     We own and use trademarks in connection with products and services, including both unregistered common law marks and issued trademark registrations in the United States. Our material trademarks, service marks and other marks include: EireneRx®, Medication Risk Mitigation by CareKinesis®, MedWise Advisor®, NiaRx®, CareVentions™, Tabula Rasa HealthCare®, SinfoniaRx®, SinfoniaRx Medication Management®, Medliance®, Capstone Performance System®, Medication Risk Mitigation™ and Medication Risk Mitigation Matrix™.
     Our Competitive Landscape
     We compete with a broad and diverse set of businesses. We believe the competitive landscape is highly fragmented with no single competitor offering similarly expansive capabilities and solution offerings in medication risk management. Our competitive advantage is largely based on our analytical capabilities, healthcare industry expertise, breadth and depth of services, intellectual property, the size and quality of our underlying datasets and benchmarks, ease of use, reputation, innovation, security, price, reliability and client service. Our primary competitive challenge is to demonstrate to our existing and potential clients the value of utilizing our platforms rather than developing or assembling their own alternative capabilities or utilizing providers offering a subset of our services. However, we believe that the combination of our competitive strengths and successful culture of innovation, including our industry-leading analytics, 

 
  17

 
the real-world-tested nature of our platforms and subject matter expertise of our associates, make it time and cost prohibitive for our clients or competitors to replace or replicate all that we offer without facing material risk.
     Current industry players providing medication risk management and related service offerings include large and small healthcare data analytics and consulting companies, community or long-term care pharmacies, national pharmacy providers, health plans, genomic testing labs and healthcare information technology companies, among others. Many of our competitors' solutions are regulatory-driven, retrospective in nature and offer no intervention at the point of care. The services offered by these organizations may include e-prescribing and EHRs utilizing single drug-to-drug interaction analysis, lab-based genomic evaluation, basic risk stratification solutions and other prevailing approaches to medication therapy management. Many health plans attempt to address non-adherence through outreach efforts, which often require the intervention of in-house or third-party consultants and have low success rates. Some healthcare information technology providers offer risk adjustment and pharmacy cost management services, but lack the comprehensive solutions we provide. Many genomic testing labs lack the ability to apply patient test results in a useful way at the point of care. Post-acute providers typically employ pharmacist consultants to review prescription regimens every 30 days, which is retrospective in nature and generally ineffective in improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, typical prescription fulfillment models are reimbursed on a fee-for-service basis and are incentivized based on prescription dispensing volumes. Our clients partner with us in order to prospectively address ADEs, lower healthcare costs and improve overall health outcomes, which often involves utilizing our software to reduce the number of prescriptions per patient to optimize prescription regimens.
     While we believe that no competitor provides the breadth of our suite of solutions, we nevertheless compete with other companies with regards to specific products or solutions and markets or care settings. We expect that competition will continue to increase as a result of consolidation in both the information technology and healthcare industries. The anticipated growth in healthcare spending, the shift to a value-based payment model, the rise of consumerism and changes in government regulation may draw increasing attention to healthcare data and analytics, and new competitors, such as management consultants, technology companies and start-ups may enter the market, and we may face increased competition from these sources.
     Healthcare Regulatory Environment
     We operate in a highly regulated industry and our business operations must comply with a number of complex and evolving federal and state agency requirements. While we believe we comply in all material respects with applicable healthcare laws and regulations, these laws can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and the state and federal interpretation of existing laws and regulations, and their enforcement, may change from time to time. Additionally, a state or federal government enforcement body may disagree that we are in material compliance with applicable healthcare laws and regulations. Federal and state legislatures also may enact various legislative proposals that could materially impact certain aspects of our business.
     A non-exhaustive list of federal and state statutes, regulations, sub-regulatory guidance and contractual provisions that may apply to our business activities include:
     Healthcare Legislation
     In 2010, Congress passed major health reform legislation, mostly through the ACA. Generally, the ACA was designed to expand coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. While not all of these reforms affect our business directly, many affect the coverage and plan designs that are or will be provided by many of our clients. Consequently, these reforms could impact some or many of our business arrangements directly or indirectly.
     Given that certain regulations implementing ACA are still being formulated and finalized, and given that sub-regulatory guidance is still being promulgated by federal agencies, such as HHS and the Internal Revenue Service, and state agencies, we cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of any future legislation, regulation or litigation related to healthcare reform.
     President Trump and the United States Congress are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals which could impact the healthcare system, the ACA, and/or the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  While not all of the contemplated changes, if enacted, would affect our business directly, many could impact some or many of our 

 
  18

 
business arrangements directly or indirectly.  Given that legislative and regulatory change is still being formulated, we cannot predict with any certainty the outcome of any future legislation or regulation.
     PACE Organizations
     Our partnership with PACE organizations is a significant source of our current revenue stream. The PACE program is a unique, comprehensive managed care benefit for certain frail elderly individuals, most of whom are dually eligible for Medicare and Medicaid benefits, provided by a not-for-profit or public entity. The PACE program features a comprehensive medical and social service delivery system using an interdisciplinary team approach in an adult day health center that is supplemented by in-home and referral services in accordance with participants' needs. Financing for the program is capped, which allows providers to deliver all services participants need rather than only those reimbursable under Medicare and Medicaid fee-for-service plans. PACE is a program under Medicare, and states can elect to provide PACE services to Medicaid program beneficiaries as an optional Medicaid benefit. The PACE program becomes the sole source of Medicaid and Medicare benefits for PACE participants.
     As PACE organization contractors, we are subject to numerous contractual obligations imposed by our partner organizations, as well as to various audit and certification requirements.
     HIPAA Healthcare Fraud Provisions
     HIPAA also created additional federal criminal statutes regarding fraud. Specifically, the HIPAA healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, or to obtain by false or fraudulent pretenses any of the money or property owned by a healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, and willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense. The HIPAA healthcare fraud statutes also prohibit, among other things, concealing a material fact or making a materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. The ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA, like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Those found to have aided in a violation of these prohibitions are deemed by statute to have committed the offense and are punishable as a principal offender.     State and Federal Data Privacy and Security Laws
     We process, collect, use and disclose individual patient data for patients directly or for our clients and therefore, are subject to various laws protecting privacy and security of the patient information. Certain segments of our company qualify as a "Covered Entity" under HIPAA, and others qualify as a "Business Associate" to our partners who are Covered Entities and as such we are required to comply with HIPAA and HITECH, as implemented through regulations promulgated thereunder by HHS, including the HIPAA Omnibus Final Rule, the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the HIPAA Security Rule. HIPAA generally requires Covered Entities and their Business Associates to adopt certain safeguards to ensure the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, and to limit uses and disclosures of such PHI to those permissible under the law. When Covered Entities utilize Business Associates to provide services, pursuant to which the Business Associate may access the Covered Entity's PHI, the parties must enter into a Business Associate agreement through which the Business Associate must contractually agree to safeguard PHI in certain ways and to notify the Covered Entity of improper uses or disclosures of PHI.
     Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to have written policies and procedures addressing HIPAA compliance and must designate a Security Officer to oversee the development and implementation of the policies and procedures related to the safeguards to protect privacy of electronic PHI. Covered Entities must also designate a Privacy Officer, although the Privacy Officer and the Security Officer may be the same person. As part of their security policies and procedures, Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to conduct periodic risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities to electronic PHI. Additionally, Covered Entities and Business Associates are required to train all employees on their HIPAA policies and procedures. Further, in the event of a breach of PHI as defined by HIPAA, Covered Entities must notify affected individuals, HHS and sometimes the media, as well as take steps to mitigate damage, and they may be subject to fines and penalties. HIPAA violations can result in significant civil monetary penalties and/or imprisonment for up to ten years depending on the facts surrounding the violation.
    
 
  19

 

 Many states also have similar data privacy and security laws that track federal requirements or impose different and/or more stringent conditions for use and disclosure of PHI. Failure to comply with these laws may also result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties.
     Federal and State Oversight of Medical Devices, Genomic Testing, Drugs, and Controlled Substances 
     Some technologies and software applications used in connection with healthcare analytics and genomic testing and analysis are considered medical devices and are subject to regulation by the FDA. The 21st Century Cures Act (Pub. L. 114-255), enacted in December 2016, included certain changes to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to exempt certain medical-related software from FDA regulation. In December 2017, FDA issued a draft guidance document, Clinical and Patient Decision Support Software, which set forth FDA’s proposed interpretation of the exemption under the 21st Century Cures Act for clinical decision support, or CDS, software. Although we believe that our technologies and software are not subject to active FDA regulation, there is a risk that the FDA could disagree. There is also a risk that FDA could final finalize its guidance for Clinical and Patient Decision Support Software in such a way that it excludes our software and technologies from the scope of the CDS exemption under the 21st Century Cures Act. If the FDA determines that any of our current or future services, technologies or software applications are regulated by the FDA as medical devices, we would become subject to various statutes, regulations and policies enforced by the FDA and other governmental authorities including both premarket and post-market requirements, and we would need to bring the affected services, technologies, and/or software into compliance with such requirements. FDA could also require that we cease marketing and/or recall the affected services, technologies, and software unless and until we bring them into compliance with FDA’s requirements.
     Clinical laboratories that perform human genomic testing are subject to oversight by CMS and state regulators.  The laboratories that we partner with for genomic testing must comply with the relevant CMS and state laws and regulations applicable to clinical laboratories and genomic testing.
     The Drug Enforcement Administration, or DEA, the FDA, and state regulators, such as state boards of pharmacy, regulate drug and controlled substance packaging, repackaging, purchasing, handling, storage, distribution, security, and dispensing activities. Our prescription fulfillment pharmacies must comply with the applicable FDA, DEA, and state statutes, regulations, and policies.  In addition, our prescription fulfillment pharmacies may be subject to periodic audits by state regulators, the DEA, and/or the FDA to assess our compliance with these requirements. 
     Noncompliance with applicable federal or state requirements, as described above, can result in an enforcement action that could substantially harm our business.
     Anti-Kickback Laws
     The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or AKS, makes it unlawful for individuals or entities, among other things, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or pay any kickback, bribe or other remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in exchange for or to induce or reward the referral of an individual to a person for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing of any item or service for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program, or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering, any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part under a federal healthcare program. Penalties for violations include criminal penalties and civil sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs. The federal AKS is an intent-based statute, but following amendment from the ACA, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Further, the failure of an arrangement to satisfy all elements of an AKS safe harbor will not necessarily make it illegal, but it may subject that arrangement to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities. The federal AKS is applicable to us as operators of specialty pharmacies, contractors to health plans and providers, as well as contractors to various federal healthcare program payors. When our compensation arrangements implicate the AKS and/or state anti-kickback laws we evaluate whether we believe they fall within one of the safe harbors. If not, we consider the factors to identify the intent behind such arrangements and the relative risk of fraud and abuse. We also design business models that seek to reduce the risk that any such arrangements might be viewed as abusive and trigger AKS scrutiny or claims.
     In addition to the federal AKS, many states have anti-kickback prohibitions that may apply to arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors.

     Federal and State Self-Referral Laws
     The federal physician self-referral law, often referred to as the Stark Law, with limited exceptions, prohibits physicians from referring Medicare Program or Medicaid patients to an entity for the provision of certain designated health services, among them outpatient prescription medications, if the physician or a member of such physician's immediate family has a direct or indirect financial relationship (including an ownership or investment interest or a compensation arrangement) with the entity. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from billing Medicare or Medicaid for such designated health services. A referral that does not fall within a statutory exception is strictly prohibited by the Stark Law. A violation of the Stark Law is punishable by civil sanctions, including overpayment liability, significant fines and exclusion from participation in Medicare and Medicaid Programs.
     We evaluate when these physician (or immediate family member) financial arrangements are created to strive to ensure we do not enter into a prohibited financial relationship and design structures that satisfy exceptions under the Stark Law.
     Our business may implicate federal and state physician self-referral laws to the extent our pharmacy, a designated health services entity, has financial arrangements in the form of ownership, investment or compensation with referring physicians or a referring physician's immediate family member. No physician has an ownership or investment interest in our business, but our pharmacy may have compensation arrangements with physicians who serve on its Clinical Advisory Panel and who order designated health services for patients enrolled in a PACE program. If any such compensation arrangements exist, we believe such compensation arrangements fall within an exception to the physician self-referral prohibition.
     A number of states have statutes and regulations that prohibit the same general types of conduct as those prohibited by the Stark Law, but some have even broader application, extending beyond Medicare and Medicaid Programs and including commercial and self payors.
     Federal and State False Claims Acts
     The federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act, impose criminal and civil liability on individuals and entities that, among other things, knowingly submit, or cause to be submitted, false or fraudulent claims for payment to the federal government or knowingly make, or cause to be made, a false statement in order to have a false claim paid. The civil False Claims Act provides for treble damages and mandatory and significant minimum penalties per false claim or statement ($10,781.40 to $21,562.80 per false claim). The qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the civil False Claims Act permit a private individual to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has submitted a false claim to the federal government, and to share in any monetary recovery. Our future activities relating to the manner in which we sell and market our services may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. False Claims Act qui tam lawsuits in healthcare are common, although the government often declines to pursue such actions following investigation. Analogous state false claims laws also may apply to our sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors.     Other State Laws
     The vast majority, if not all states have laws regulating licensure, registration and certification of pharmacies, pharmacists, pharmacy technicians and other pharmacy personnel. We are licensed in all states that require such licensure in which we do business and believe that we substantially comply with all state licensing laws applicable to our business. Where required by law, we also have pharmacists licensed in all states in which we dispense. If we violate state pharmacy licensure laws or engage in conduct prohibited under our license, we could be subject to enforcement action, including but not limited to suspension or loss of such pharmacy license
     The DEA, as well as some similar state agencies, requires our pharmacy locations to individually register in order to handle controlled substances, including prescription pharmaceuticals. Federal and various state laws also regulate specific labeling, reporting and record-keeping aspects related to controlled substances. We maintain DEA registrations for each of our facilities that require such registration and follow procedures intended to comply with all applicable federal and state requirements regarding dispensing controlled substances.
