These products include pretzels, sandwich crackers, kettle cooked chips, pretzel crackers, popcorn, nuts, potato chips, tortilla chips, cookies, restaurant style crackers, and other salty snacks. Our brands include Snyder’s of Hanover®, the market share leader in the pretzel category in the United States ("US"), and Lance®, which is the number one ranked sandwich cracker in the US, as well as Cape Cod® kettle cooked chips and Kettle Brand® potato chips, which combined make us the market leader in the kettle chips category in the US. In addition, Snack Factory® Pretzel Crisps® is the market share leader in deli snacks and Pop Secret® popcorn currently ranks second in the microwave popcorn category. Late July® is the number one organic and non-genetically modified organism ("non-GMO") tortilla chip in the US. These products demonstrate our successful history of providing irresistible, high-quality snacks dating back over 100 years.
Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. References to “Snyder’s-Lance,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” refer to Snyder’s-Lance, Inc. and its subsidiaries, as the context requires.
Agreement and Plan of Merger
On December 18, 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Campbell Soup Company, a New Jersey corporation (“Campbell”), and Twist Merger Sub, Inc., a North Carolina corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Campbell (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Campbell (the “Merger”). The parties anticipate that the Merger will close late in the first quarter of calendar year 2018.
Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), each share of our common stock, $0.83-1/3 par value, outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $50.00 per share, without interest and subject to any required tax withholding.
The Merger Agreement contains various representations, warranties and covenants by the Company and Campbell. The Merger Agreement requires the Company to call and hold a special shareholder meeting, which is scheduled for March 23, 2018, and requires our Board of Directors to recommend that the Company’s shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, except our Board of Directors may, in certain circumstances, change its recommendation, subject to complying with specified notice and other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement. Additionally, the Company agreed that, among other things, it will not (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or encourage the submission of any Acquisition Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any proposal or offer that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal or (ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with, or disclose non-public information to, any third party relating to any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that may reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement, prior to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s shareholders, the Company may, however, engage in negotiations or discussions with and provide non-public information to a third party that has made an unsolicited, bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that our Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal 
1

counsel and financial advisor, constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to result in, a Superior Proposal (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and that failure to take such actions would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable law.
Prior to the approval of the Merger Agreement by the Company’s shareholders, our Board of Directors may, upon receipt of a Superior Proposal, and in certain other circumstances set forth in the Merger Agreement, change its recommendation that the Company’s shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, subject to complying with specified notice and other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including, if requested by Campbell, negotiating in good faith with Campbell to make such revisions to the Merger Agreement in response to such Superior Proposal. If our Board of Directors changes its recommendation that the Company’s shareholders approve the Merger Agreement and the Merger, Campbell may terminate the Merger Agreement. In addition, prior to obtaining such shareholder approval, the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement providing for a Superior Proposal, subject to payment of the termination fee described below and only following compliance with specified notice and other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, including giving Campbell the opportunity to propose changes to the Merger Agreement so that any such proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal.
The Merger Agreement requires the Company and Campbell to use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary under applicable law to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for each of the Company and Campbell, including the right of each party to terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been consummated by the “end date” of September 18, 2018.
The Merger Agreement provides for the payment by the Company to Campbell of a termination fee in the amount of $149 million in the case of a termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances described in the Merger Agreement, including if: (i) (a) the Merger Agreement is terminated by Campbell or the Company because the Merger is not consummated by the end date or the Company’s shareholders do not approve the Merger Agreement, or by Campbell because of a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of the Company that would cause the related closing condition to be incapable of being satisfied or cured by the end date or, if curable, is not cured by the Company by the earlier of 30 days after receipt of written notice of such breach and three business days prior to the end date, (b) any person publicly discloses a bona fide Acquisition Proposal, which Acquisition Proposal had not been publicly withdrawn prior to the special meeting of the Company’s shareholders, and (c) within 12 months after such termination the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) our Board of Directors changes its recommendation or (iii) the Company enters into definitive transaction documentation providing for a Superior Proposal.
Campbell will be required to pay the Company a termination fee of $198.6 million in the event the Merger Agreement is terminated by the Company, subject to certain limitations set forth in the Merger Agreement, if (i) there has been a breach of a representation, warranty or covenant of Campbell or Merger Sub that would cause the related closing condition to be incapable of being satisfied or cured by the end date or, if curable, is not cured by Campbell or Merger Sub by the earlier of 30 days after receipt of written notice of such breach and three business days prior to the end date, or (ii) the conditions to Campbell and Merger Sub’s obligations to consummate the closing have been satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by actions taken at the closing; provided that such conditions are then capable of being satisfied), Campbell has failed to consummate the Merger within two business days of the date the closing should have occurred and the Company has notified Campbell in writing that all of the conditions to closing have been satisfied (or waived) and it intends to terminate the Merger Agreement if Campbell and Merger Sub fail to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby within two business days. 
The Merger Agreement has been approved by the boards of directors of each of the Company and Campbell. The obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger are subject to customary closing conditions, including, among others: approval of the Merger Agreement and Merger by holders of 75% of the outstanding shares of the our common stock; the accuracy of the representations and warranties of each party (subject to certain exceptions as set forth in the Merger Agreement); each of the parties having performed in all material respects all of their respective obligations under the Merger Agreement; and the absence of any injunctions or other legal restraints.
On December 18, 2017, certain trusts affiliated with Patricia A. Warehime, a member of our Board, and members of her immediate family, each such trust being a shareholder of the Company (collectively, the “Warehime Holders”), entered into a voting agreement with Campbell, pursuant to which the Warehime Holders agreed, among other things, to vote the shares of Company common stock over which they have voting power in favor of the approval of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby, including the Merger. As of February 16, 2018, the record date for the special meeting of our shareholders, the Warehime Holders owned 12,851,757 shares, or approximately 13.1% of the shares of our common stock outstanding and entitled to vote at the special meeting.

Certain terms of the Merger Agreement and Voting Agreement are summarized, and the Merger Agreement and Voting Agreement have been filed as exhibits to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company on January 18, 2018.
Recent Acquisitions and Divestiture
In recent years, we have acquired several companies and brands as we seek future growth both organically as well as through acquisitions.
In October of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Snack Factory, LLC and certain of its affiliates ("Snack Factory"), which added a Core brand to our portfolio, Snack Factory® Pretzel Crisps®. The Snack Factory® brand is known for its innovative flavor profiles, commitment to providing the highest-quality ingredients and a broadening base of passionate consumers. In June of 2014, we completed the acquisition of Baptista’s Bakery, Inc. ("Baptista's"), which is the sole manufacturer of our Snack Factory® Pretzel Crisps® products. In addition, Baptista's is an industry leader in the development, innovation and manufacturing of highly-differentiated snack foods, including organic, non-GMO, all natural and gluten-free products. In October of 2014, we made an additional investment in Late July Snacks, LLC ("Late July") which increased our total ownership interest to 80%. Late July is a leader in organic and non-GMO salty snacks and the investment supports our goal of having a stronger presence in "better-for-you" snacks.
On February 29, 2016, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding stock of Diamond Foods, Inc. ("Diamond Foods"). The strategic combination of Snyder's-Lance and Diamond Foods brought together two established companies with strong brands, and created an innovative, highly complementary and diversified portfolio of branded snacks. Diamond Foods was a leading snack food company with five brands, including: Kettle Brand® potato chips; KETTLE® Chips; Pop Secret® popcorn; Emerald® snack nuts; and Diamond of California® culinary nuts. The transaction expanded our footprint in "better-for-you" snacking, and increased our existing natural food channel presence. In addition, this transaction expanded and strengthened our distribution network in the US, and provided us with a platform for growth in the United Kingdom ("U.K.") and certain other countries within Europe. 
On September 1, 2016, we completed the acquisition of Metcalfe's Skinny Limited ("Metcalfe") by acquiring the remaining 74% interest. Metcalfe owns the U.K.'s leading premium ready-to-eat ("RTE") popcorn brand, and also incorporates a fast growing range of corn and rice cake products. The U.K. popcorn market is one of the fastest growing categories within the U.K. snack food industry, as consumers increasingly seek out "better-for-you" snacking options. 
On December 31, 2016, we completed the carve-out and sale of our culinary nuts business (comprised primarily of the Diamond of California® brand, and the Stockton, CA facility; collectively "Diamond of California"). We had previously entered the culinary nuts business as a result of the Diamond Foods acquisition. This divestiture aligns with our strategy to focus more resources on growth opportunities for our snack food brands.
Products
We are engaged in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of snack food products. These products include pretzels, sandwich crackers, kettle cooked chips, pretzel crackers, popcorn, nuts, potato chips, tortilla chips, cookies, restaurant style crackers, and other salty snacks. Our products are packaged in various single-serve, multi-pack, family-size and party-size configurations. Our branded products are principally sold under trademarks owned by us. While the majority of our branded products are manufactured by us, certain branded products are contract manufactured, due to required expertise, ingredients or equipment, or increased demand.
We also sell Partner brand products, which consist of third-party branded products that we sell to independent business owners ("IBO") through the national direct-store-delivery distribution network ("DSD network"), in order to broaden the portfolio of product offerings for the IBOs. In addition, we contract with other branded food manufacturers to produce their products and periodically sell certain semi-finished goods to other manufacturers. 
Overall sales of our products are relatively consistent throughout the year, although demand for certain products may be influenced by holidays, changes in seasons, or other annual events. In 2017, Core branded products represented approximately 73% of net revenue from continuing operations, while net revenue from Allied brand, Partner brand and Other products represented approximately 7%, 13% and 7%, respectively. In 2016, Core branded products represented approximately 70% of net revenue, while net revenue from Allied brand, Partner brand and Other products represented approximately 8%, 14% and 8%, respectively. In 2015, Branded products represented 62% of net revenue, while net revenue from Allied brand, Partner brand and Other products represented 10%, 18% and 10%, respectively. The decrease each year in both Partner brand and Other products is a result of the acquisition of the Diamond Foods core brands and the shift in our strategic direction.

Intellectual Property
Trademarks that are important to our business are protected by registration or other means in the US and most other international markets where the related products are sold. We own various registered trademarks for use with our Branded products, including: Snyder’s of Hanover®; Lance®; Kettle Brand®; Cape Cod®; Snack Factory® Pretzel Crisps®; Pop Secret®; KETTLE® Chips; Emerald®; and Late July® (collectively, "Core" brands), and Tom’s®; Jays®; Archway®; Stella D’oro®; O-Ke-Doke®; Metcalfe’s skinny®; Krunchers!®; and Eatsmart SnacksTM (collectively, "Allied" brands) as well as a variety of other marks and designs. On a limited basis, we license trademarks for use on certain products that are classified as Branded products. Solely for convenience, trademarks and trade names referred to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may appear without the ® or ™ symbols, but references are not intended to indicate, in any way, that we will not assert our rights to these trademarks and trade names to the fullest extent under applicable law.
Overall Strategy
Our goal is to deliver simple moments of happiness to everyone, everywhere, by providing uncompromisingly delicious snacks made with simple ingredients. We believe that snacks made with simple ingredients, are simply better food. As we grow, we will remain focused on delivering margin expansion through our Performance Transformation Plan, announced by us in April 2017 (the “Transformation Plan”). We expect our growth will be a result of organic investments in our research and development capabilities, and inorganic growth through strategic acquisitions.
Our strategy is built around five supporting initiatives:

• | Optimize the portfolio for growth in wholesome natural snacks. To do so we are focusing on strengthening our core brand innovation pipeline and bringing our existing brands to greater scale to more effectively compete. This involves exiting platforms with little advantage or disadvantaged scale while simultaneously evaluating new, scalable snack markets through both organic growth and inorganic mergers and acquisitions. 


• | Build superior brand preference. We build brand preference by continuously elevating our focus on product taste and quality, increasing investments in world class marketing vehicles, and renovating product ingredients around those qualifications most preferred by our consumers. In parallel we aim to continuously increase the sustainability, convenience, and functional advantage of our product packaging. These efforts will complement our focus on building improved price realization across our portfolio consistent with our value proposition. 


• | Provide the right products, in the right places, at the right times. The DSD network combined with our direct distribution capability allow us to offer our products in a broad array of large and fast growing retail channels where consumers prefer to shop. We are focused on growing in emerging channels and always delivering our products on-time and in-full. 


• | Pursue operational efficiencies. We are improving complexity by reducing manufacturing and distribution complexity and optimizing our product offering through stock keeping unit ("SKU") rationalization. In addition, we leverage zero-based-budgeting to eliminate non-critical expenses and implement proven technologies to improve operational performance. 

4


• | Foster a diverse culture centered on our values. We believe that a culture rich in diversity of thought, experiences and identity yields a strong and resilient organization. We also seek to build a safe and supporting environment, invest in our employees to build their capabilities and experiences, and recognize and reward everyone for their contributions. We believe that this philosophy ultimately benefits our shareholders in the form of a higher performing company. 

Research and Development
We consider research and development of new products to be a significant part of our overall strategy, and are committed to developing innovative, high-quality products that exceed consumer expectations. A team of professional product developers, including microbiologists, food scientists and culinary experts, work in collaboration with innovation, marketing, manufacturing and sales leaders, to develop products that meet changing consumer demands. Our research and development staff incorporates product ideas from all areas of our business in order to formulate new products. In addition to developing new products, the research and development staff routinely reformulates and improves existing products based on advances in ingredients and technology, and conducts value engineering to maintain competitive price points. We own a 60,000 square foot Research and Development Center in Hanover, Pennsylvania, where we conduct much of our research and development. In addition, we have a research and development facility adjacent to our production facility in Salem, Oregon. Our research and development costs were approximately $6.2 million, $10.0 million and $6.2 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Marketing
Our marketing efforts are focused on building long-term brand equity through effective consumer marketing. In addition to volume building trade promotions to market our products, our advertising efforts utilize television, radio, print, digital, mobile and social media aimed at increasing consumer preference and usage of our brands. We also use consumer promotions, sponsorships and partnerships which include free trial offers, targeted coupons and on-package offers to generate trial usage and increase purchase frequency.  These marketing efforts are an integral part of our overall strategy to grow our brands and reach more consumers in order to build superior brand preference. 
We work with third-party information agencies, such as Information Resources, Inc. ("IRI"), Nielsen and other syndicated market data providers, to monitor the effectiveness of our marketing and measure product growth. All information regarding our brand market positions in the US included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K is from IRI and is based on retail dollar sales.
Distribution
We distribute snack food products throughout the US using the DSD network. The DSD network is made up of over 3,200 routes that are primarily owned and operated by IBOs. We also ship products directly to third-party distributors in areas where the DSD network does not operate. Through our direct distribution network, we distribute products directly to retail customers or to third-party distributors using freight carriers or our own transportation fleet. In Europe, we sell our salty snack products through our sales personnel directly to national grocery, co-op and impulse store chains. In 2017, approximately 55% of net revenue was generated by products distributed through the DSD network while the remaining 45% was generated by products distributed through our direct distribution network. 
In order to maintain and expand the DSD network, we routinely participate in certain route purchase and sale activities. These activities include the following:

• | Acquisition of regional distributor businesses - As we expand the DSD network, we continue to look for potential regional distributor business acquisition targets in areas where we do not currently have a DSD network. Upon acquisition, the acquired routes may be reengineered to include our products and retail locations and are then sold to a new or current IBO, as described below.


• | Reengineering of zones - Periodically, we undertake a route reengineering project for a particular geography or zone. The reasons for route reengineering projects vary, but are typically due to increased sales volume associated with new retail locations and/or the addition of new Branded or Partner brand products to the routes in that zone. In these cases, we repurchase all of the IBO routes in that zone. The repurchased routes are then reengineered, which normally results in the addition of new IBO routes (territories) because of the additional volume. Routes are then resold, usually to the original IBO, however, the original IBO has no obligation to repurchase. Upon completion, these route reengineering projects may result in modest net gains on the sale of route businesses due to the value added during the reengineering through additional volume and/or retail locations.


• | Sale of company-owned routes - Some routes remain company-owned primarily because they need additional sales volume in order to become sustainable routes for IBOs. As we build up the volume on these routes through increased distribution of our Branded and Partner brand products, we would sell these routes to IBOs which could result in gains.

5


• | IBO defaults - There are times when the IBOs are not successful and the IBO's distributor agreement with us is terminated. In these instances, if the existing IBO is unable to sell the route to another third party, we may repurchase the route at a price defined in the distributor agreement. We generally put the repurchased route up for sale to another third-party IBO. The subsequent sales transaction generally results in a nominal gain or loss.

Capital Expenditures
We have invested significant capital in our facilities to ensure sufficient capacity, efficient production, effective use of technology, excellent quality, and a positive working environment for our associates. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had capital expenditures of $69.4 million, $73.3 million and $51.5 million, respectively. For 2018, we expect capital expenditures to be in line with 2017 expenditures. Capital spending will be used to upgrade equipment, increase capacity at our manufacturing facilities and is believed to be adequate to maintain and support our revenue growth over the next few years.
Customers
Through the DSD network, we sell our Branded and Partner brand products to IBOs that, in turn, sell to grocery/mass merchandisers, club stores, discount stores, convenience stores, food service establishments and various other retail customers, including drug stores, schools, military and government facilities and “up and down the street” outlets such as recreational facilities, offices and other independent retailers. In addition, we sell our Branded products directly to retail customers and third-party distributors, both in the US and abroad. We also contract with other branded food manufacturers to produce their products or provide semi-finished goods. 
Substantially all of our revenue is from sales to customers in the US. Sales to our largest retail customer, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. ("Wal-Mart"), either through IBOs or our direct distribution network, were approximately 13% of net revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Our sales to Wal-Mart do not include sales of our products made to Wal-Mart by third-party distributors outside of the DSD network. Sales to these third-party distributors represent approximately 6% of our net revenue and may increase sales of our products to Wal-Mart by an amount we are unable to estimate. Our top ten retail customers accounted for approximately 55% of our net revenue during 2017, excluding sales of our products made by third-party distributors.
Raw Materials
The principal raw materials used to manufacture our products are flour, potatoes, oil, peanuts, other nuts, corn, sugar, chocolate, cheese and seasonings. The principal packaging supplies used are flexible film, cartons, trays, boxes and bags. These raw materials and supplies are normally available in adequate quantities in the commercial market and are generally contracted from three to twelve months in advance, depending on market conditions. 
Competition and Industry
Our products are sold in highly competitive markets. Generally, we compete with companies engaged in the manufacturing, distribution, marketing and sale of snack food products, some of which have greater revenue and resources than we do. The principal methods of competition are price, service, product quality, product offerings and distribution. The methods of competition and our competitive position vary according to the geographic location, the particular product categories and the activities of our competitors.
Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters. We are not a party to any material proceedings arising under these laws or regulations for the periods covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We believe we are in compliance with all material environmental regulations affecting our facilities and operations and that continued compliance will not have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. 
Regulation
The manufacture and sale of snack food products is highly regulated. In the US our activities are subject to regulation by various federal government agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, US Department of Agriculture, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Labor and Department of Commerce, as well as various state and local agencies. Our business is also regulated by similar agencies outside of the US.
Sustainability
We are committed to reducing the impact that our products and operations have on the environment. We work to minimize our environmental impact by implementing more sustainable business operations and doing more with less, as we remain committed to being a responsible corporate citizen. At our bakery in Hanover, Pennsylvania, we own a solar farm that produces 3.5 megawatts of electricity that supplies 100% of the power needed at our R&D Center onsite as well as approximately 30% of the power used by the bakery for production during the day. Our Kettle Chip plant in Salem, Oregon captures solar energy by taking advantage of solar panels on the roof and is one of the largest solar installations in the northwest. The Kettle Chip plant in Beloit, Wisconsin, which was the first LEED Gold Certified food manufacturing plant in the United States, uses wind turbines to offset utility usage

from the local power plant. In addition, our Supply Chain team has implemented improved recycling initiatives across the organization in order to strive to bring our manufacturing plants to landfill free operations and manufacturing. At our chip producing plants, we recycle the oil used in kettle chip production to vendors that convert it to other products like biodiesel for use in many other applications. We carry the focus on sustainability beyond production. Our headquarters facility implements a single stream waste vendor so that no matter which receptacle you use, everything that can be is sorted and recycled. We also implemented motion activated light sensors in our offices and manufacturing plants to make sure we only use light when a facility is occupied. 
Employees
As of December 30, 2017, we had approximately 5,900 active employees located in the US and U.K. compared to approximately 6,100 active employees as of December 31, 2016. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
