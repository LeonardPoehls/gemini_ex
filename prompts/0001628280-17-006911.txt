ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Background
Rand was incorporated in the State of Delaware in 2004 as a blank check company. In 2006, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Lower Lakes Towing with its subsidiary Lower Lakes Transportation and its affiliate, Grand River. Subsequent to our acquisition of Lower Lakes Towing, Lower Lakes Transportation and Grand River, we acquired eleven additional vessels and we retired three vessels. 
On December 27, 2012, Lower Lakes Ship Repair Company Ltd. ("Lower Lakes Ship Repair"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing, was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes Ship Repair provides ship repair services exclusively to the Company. On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes Towing (17) Ltd. ("Lower Lakes (17)"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lower Lakes Towing was incorporated under the laws of Canada. Lower Lakes (17) owned the M. V. Manitoulin, a vessel placed in service in November 2015, as further explained below. As of November 17, 2016, Lower Lakes (17) was amalgamated with and into Lower Lakes Towing with Lower Lakes Towing continuing as the surviving entity. 
Vessel Acquisitions
Lower Lakes Towing has acquired two vessels since 2010. On July 21, 2011, Lower Lakes Towing acquired a Canadian-flagged bulk carrier for CDN $2.7 million. 
On October 14, 2011, Lower Lakes Towing purchased a bulk carrier from United Ocean Service, LLC (“USUOS”) for a purchase price of approximately $5.3 million. 
Grand River acquired two vessels in 2011 as well. On December 1, 2011, Grand River purchased a tug from USUOS for a purchase price of approximately $7.8 million. Also on December 1, 2011, Grand River acted as USUOS's third-party designee to purchase a self-unloading barge from U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee of the GTC Connecticut Statutory Trust, for a purchase price of approximately $12.0 million. Subsequent to these acquisitions, the Company undertook modifications to the tug/barge vessel to meet Great Lakes standards. This tug/barge vessel was placed in service on October 23, 2012.
On March 11, 2014, Lower Lakes (17) acquired the LALANDIA SWAN from Uni-Tankers M/T "Lalandia Swan" for a purchase price of $7.0 million. The Lalandia Swan was a Danish flagged chemical tanker that was converted with a new forebody into a Canadian flagged river class self-unloader vessel. After conversion to a self-unloader vessel, the Lalandia Swan was renamed the M. V. Manitoulin. The vessel was placed in service in November 2015. 
Business Overview
Introduction
Our shipping business is operated in Canada by Lower Lakes Towing and in the United States by Lower Lakes Transportation. Lower Lakes Towing was organized in March 1994 under the laws of Canada to provide marine transportation services to dry bulk goods suppliers and purchasers operating in ports on the Great Lakes. Lower Lakes has grown from its origin as a small tug and barge operator to a full-service shipping company with a combined fleet of fifteen cargo-carrying vessels operating in Canada and the United States. We have grown to become one of the largest bulk shipping companies operating on the Great Lakes and a leading service provider in the River Class market segment, as defined below. We transport construction aggregates, salt, grain, coal, iron ore, and other dry bulk commodities for customers in the construction, electric utility, food, and integrated steel industries.
We believe that Lower Lakes is the only company providing significant domestic port-to-port services to both Canada and the United States in the Great Lakes region. Lower Lakes maintains this operating flexibility by operating both U.S. and Canadian flagged vessels in compliance with the Shipping Act, 1916, and the Merchant Marine Act, 1920, commonly referred to as the Jones Act in the U.S. and the Coasting Trade Act in Canada, respectively.

Fleet
Lower Lakes' fleet consists of six self-unloading bulk carriers and three conventional bulk carriers (excluding a retired vessel) in Canada and six self-unloading bulk carriers in the U.S., including three articulated tug and barge units. Lower Lakes Towing owns all nine Canadian vessels. Lower Lakes Transportation time charters the six U.S. vessels, including the three tug and barge units, from Grand River. With the exception of two of the articulated tug and barge units (which Grand River bareboat charters from Black Creek), Grand River owns the vessels that it time charters to Lower Lakes Transportation.
Lower Lakes operates over one-half of all River Class vessels and boom-forward equipped vessels servicing the Great Lakes. River Class vessels represent the smaller end of Great Lakes vessels, with maximum dimensions of approximately 665 feet in length and 78 feet in beam and carrying capacities of 15,000 to 28,000 tons, and are ideal for customers seeking to move significant quantities of dry bulk product to or from ports that restrict non-River Class vessels due to size and capacity constraints. Boom forward self-unloading vessels - those with their booms located in front of the cargo holds - offer greater accessibility for delivery of cargo to locations where only forward access is possible. Six of the vessels used in Lower Lakes' operations are boom forward self-unloaders and six vessels are boom aft self-unloaders.

Customers
Lower Lakes services approximately 50 customers in a diverse array of end markets by shipping dry bulk commodities such as construction aggregates, salt, grain, coal, iron ore, and other dry bulk commodities. Lower Lakes' top ten customers accounted for approximately 69%, 67% and 64% of its revenue during the fiscal years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 respectively. The timing of the end of the Company's fiscal year in relation to the sailing season allows most of a sailing season's receivables to be collected prior to the end of the Company's fiscal year. Lower Lakes is the sole-source shipping provider to several of its customers. With few exceptions, Lower Lakes' customers are under long-term contracts which typically average three to five years in duration and provide for minimum and maximum annual tonnage requirements, annual price escalation features and fuel surcharge adjustments. Certain of our customer contracts also provide for water level adjustments, demurrage and discharge provisions. Lower Lakes has two customers that represents more than 10% of our revenues; these customers accounted for 26.9% of our consolidated revenue for the year ended March 31, 2017. 
Industry and Competition
Lower Lakes faces competition from other marine and land-based transporters of dry bulk commodities in and around the Great Lakes area. In the River Class market segment, Lower Lakes generally faces two primary competitors: Algoma Central Corporation and American Steamship Company. Algoma Central Corporation is a Canadian company that owns 13 self-unloading vessels, two of which are River Class boom-forward vessels, and operates six gearless bulk carriers. American Steamship Company operates in the U.S. and maintains a fleet of 16 vessels, three of which are River Class vessels. We believe that industry participants compete on the basis of customer relationships, price and service, and that the ability to meet a customer's schedule and offer shipping flexibility is a key competitive factor. Moreover, we believe that customers are generally willing to continue to use the same carrier assuming such carrier provides satisfactory service with competitive pricing. 
Employees
As of March 31, 2017, Lower Lakes had approximately 512 full-time employees, 107 of whom were shoreside and management and 405 of whom were shipboard employees. Approximately 40% of Lower Lakes' shipboard employees (all U.S. based Grand River crews) are unionized with the International Organization of Masters, Mates and Pilots, AFL-CIO.  Our contracts with the Masters, Mates and Pilots expired on March 31, 2016.  We engaged in negotiations with the union and agreed to new contracts, but when submitted to union members for approval, the new contracts failed to achieve the necessary votes. We have now re-engaged in active negotiations to reach successor agreements with the union. During the negotiations, the provisions of the expired agreements remain in full force and effect. We have experienced no impact on our workforce or labor costs as a result of the expired contracts at this time.
Lower Lakes has never experienced a work stoppage on its crewed vessels as a result of labor issues, and we believe that our employee relations are good. 
Seasonality
Lower Lakes operates in a seasonal waterway system, primarily due to the cold weather patterns on the Great Lakes during the winter that cause lock closures, waterway ice, and customer facility closings, which typically shut down Great Lakes shipping for a period of up to approximately 90 days commencing from late December until late March or early April, depending on weather conditions. Lower Lakes also experiences a seasonal pattern for its capital spending cycle, typically off-season from the shipping revenues, to permit annual maintenance and investment in its vessels. This pattern causes seasonal fluctuations in Lower Lakes' liquidity and capital resources. Such winter work, capital expenditures and drydocking costs are incurred during a period when customer collections have largely ended in February from the prior season, and fit-out and vessel operating costs will be incurred at the beginning of the season as much as 30 to 60 days prior to the receipt of significant customer collections for services provided at the beginning of the shipping season.

Government Regulations
General. The Company’s marine transportation operations are subject to United States Coast Guard (USCG) and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) legislative oversight, and to other federal, state and Canadian legislation and certain international conventions. 

The Canadian Coasting Act limits the carriage of goods between Canadian ports to vessels of Canadian registry. The U.S. Merchant Marine Act, 1920, the so-called “Jones Act,” limits the carriage of goods between U.S. ports to vessels of U.S. registry that have additional Jones Act “coastwise endorsements.” These coastwise endorsements require USCG determinations that the vessel has been “built in the U.S.” and is “owned by U.S. citizens.” 
Sections 2(a) and 2(c) of the Shipping Act, 1916 (now codified as 46 U.S.C. 50501 (a), (b) and (d)), and the USCG regulations at 46 CFR Ch. I, “Subpart C - Citizenship Requirements for Vessel Documentation,” govern the USCG “owned by U.S. citizens” determinations (“Citizenship Standards”). The Company’s Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws are consistent with these Citizenship Standards, and the Company implements the policies that the USCG recommends for compliance with these Citizenship Standards by “publicly traded corporations.”
Compliance with United States and Canadian domestic trade requirements are important to the operations of the Company. The loss of Jones Act status could have a material negative effect on the Company. The Company monitors the citizenship of its employees and stockholders.

Environmental
The Company's operations are subject to various environmental protection legislation enacted by the United States and Canadian governments, Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River states and provinces and companion regulations.   
Water Pollution Regulations. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, as amended by the Clean Water Act of 1977, the Comprehensive Environment Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1981 and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 impose strict prohibitions against the discharge of oil and its derivatives and of other discharges that are incidental to the normal operation of our vessels. These acts impose civil and criminal penalties for any prohibited discharges and impose substantial strict liability for cleanup of these discharges and any associated damages. Certain states also have water pollution laws that prohibit discharges into waters that traverse or adjoin the state, and impose civil and criminal penalties and liabilities similar in nature to those imposed under federal laws. The EPA discharge rules are enforced under Vessel General Permit regulations.
Ballast Water Discharges. USCG involvement with ballast water discharges on the Great Lakes dates to the 1980s arrival of the non-indigenous zebra mussel. The USCG's “Standards for Living Organisms in Ships Ballast Water Discharged in U.S. Waters” became effective on June 21, 2012. However, vessels destined for the Great Lakes were required to continue with established ballast water exchange (BWE) procedures. Further, studies of the circumstances of the Great Lakes' low salinity, cold water and substantial communities, when combined with short voyage times, substantial ballast flow rates and uncoated ballast tanks have confirmed that these conditions present a set of challenges for ballast water treatment on the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River. It does not appear that any of the ballast water management (BWM) discharge systems now adopted in the USCG regulations will provide effective treatment for the Great Lakes. The USCG and Transport Canada now require that all vessels entering the Great Lakes comply with established BWE procedures.  These BWE procedures are expected to continue in effect. At this time, it is not clear when an agreement will be reached on the effectiveness of a BWM system or systems for operations that are strictly limited to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River ecosystems. 
Clean Air Regulations. The Company's Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River services are subject to North American Emissions Control Area (ECA) rules. These rules have limited the sulfur content of marine fuels to 1.0% since August 1, 2012. Such limit decreased to 0.1% of marine fuels effective January 1, 2015, subject to availability.
Under a reciprocal agreement between the U.S. and Canada, a "Fleet Averaging" framework for Canadian flag vessels, including those of the Company, was put in place to coincide with the imposition of the U.S. ECA. Fleet Averaging allows Canadian flag ship owners to achieve a reduction in emissions across their fleets in a phased-in manner through the period ending 2020. The Company anticipates achieving its required marine emissions through a variety of improvement programs such as the use of exhaust gas scrubbers, switching to low sulfur content fuels (including, potentially, liquefied natural gas) and through other means.
