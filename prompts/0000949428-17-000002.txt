ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Company Overview
Clean Diesel Technologies, Inc. is a leading provider of technology and solutions to the automotive emissions control markets. We possess market leading expertise in emissions catalyst design and engineering for automotive and off-road applications. In particular, we have a proven ability to develop proprietary materials incorporating various base metals that replace costly platinum group metals ("PGM") and rare earth metals in coatings on vehicle catalytic converters. Our business is driven by increasingly stringent global emission standards for internal combustion engines, which are major sources of a variety of harmful pollutants.
We deliver our catalyst technology through the supply of materials and technology used in the catalyst coating process as well as finished products such as coated substrates and emission control systems. We supply our proprietary catalyst technologies to major automakers, heavy duty truck manufacturers, catalyst manufacturers, distributors, integrators and retrofitters. 
We produce coated substrates at our ISO Technical Specifications certified manufacturing facility in Oxnard, California. In some instances, the coated substrates we produce are integrated into exhaust systems by third-party manufacturers before being shipped to our end customer. We also supply coated substrates directly to exhaust systems manufacturers for incorporation in their own products.
Over the past decade, we have developed several generations of high performance catalysts, including our low-PGM mixed phase catalysts, or MPC® that are used on certain new Honda vehicles. During the same period we have developed the ability to deliver our catalyst technology to other catalyst manufacturers in the form of functional powders or material systems. Recently, we have expanded our offering of material systems beyond MPC® to include new synergized-PGM diesel oxidation catalysts, or SPGM™ DOCs, base-metal activated rhodium support, or BMARS™, and Spinel™ technologies. Most catalytic systems require significant amounts of costly PGMs to operate effectively. Our family of unique high-performance material systems, featuring inexpensive base-metals with low PGM content will enable further advances in catalyst performance. We are marketing these new catalyst technologies to other catalyst manufacturers in a proprietary powder form, which will allow them to capture the benefits of our advanced catalyst technology in their own manufacturing operations and will provide a new source of revenue for the Company.
Strategy
Over more than twenty years, we have developed the emissions control technology and manufacturing know-how to allow us to progress to delivering enabling technology for manufacturers serving the emissions catalyst market. The ability to deliver our advanced materials to other catalyst producers as functional powders allows us to achieve greater scale and higher return on our technology investment than would be possible as a manufacturer of emission control systems. The strategy to provide our technology to other manufacturers has significantly increased the size of our addressable market and provides access to markets that would not be achievable as a catalyst producer. In the short term, we are focusing our efforts and resources by pursuing opportunities in fast growing markets in China and India, as well as North America, where we believe that we can serve profitably with our technology provider business model.
The Chinese market offers significant opportunity as the world’s single largest automotive market with over 24 million vehicles produced in 2016. There is an extensive emission control systems supply chain serving domestic and international automobile manufacturers in China. Somewhat unique to China, there are many domestic catalyst manufacturers serving the automotive market in competition with the large global catalyst producers. This segment of the market requires technology and know-how to adhere to increasingly stringent emissions standards and to deliver competitively priced catalysts. In addition, there is significant pressure for the Chinese automotive market to address increasing air pollution, an issue that has escalated to become a matter of public policy. We believe these factors provide a highly favorable environment for our products and technology.
Air quality is also an important market driver in India where annual vehicle production was over 4 million in 2016. India has a number of domestic vehicle manufacturers that are served by both global and local catalyst manufacturers. There is significant opportunity to provide enabling technology to domestic catalyst producers with the appropriate manufacturing expertise. 
North America continues to be a leading global automotive market with over 18 million vehicles produced in 2016. We have focused our resources in North America on developing the growing original equipment manufacturer ("OEM") diesel particulate filter ("DPF") and diesel oxidation catalysts ("DOC") replacement market. We currently serve that market directly with our DuraFit™ product line and through the supply of technology and products to other manufacturers and distributors for sale under their own brand. We believe that our technology has the potential to become the market standard in the OEM DPF and DOC replacement market. 
1

In support of this strategy, we have filed approximately 215 patents that underpin next-generation technology for our advanced zero-PGM or ZPGM and low-PGM catalysts, and during 2015 and 2016, we completed an initial series of vehicle tests to validate our next-generation technologies. Based on the success of these tests, we are beginning to make our new catalyst technologies available to OEMs, catalyst coaters and other participants in the emission reduction supply chain for use in proprietary powder form, and we foresee multiple paths to market our new technologies.
Emissions Control Industry Overview
Regulatory standards have been adopted worldwide to control the exhaust emissions from on- and off-road engines. These emissions typically include nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons, particulate matter, carbon monoxide and more recently greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Emission regulations for mobile sources have tightened and expanded over the years due to an increased understanding of the impacts of these emissions on human health and the environment, which is highlighted by the following:

• | According to a March 2014 EPA report, over 149 million Americans today still experience unhealthy levels of air pollution which are linked to adverse health impacts such as hospital admissions, emergency room visits and premature mortality.


• | In a 2014 State of the Air report prepared by the American Lung Association, it was documented that air pollution hovers at unhealthy levels in almost every major city, placing lives at risk. The same report indicated that cleaner diesel engines helped cut year-round particle pollution in many areas.


• | According to a 2013 report published by the World Health Organization, exposure to particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter (PM2.5) reduces the life expectancy of each person in Europe by an average of 8.6 months.


• | A comprehensive 2016 study led by Tsinghua University and the Health Effects Institute found that, with continued actions to control air pollution, levels will decline substantially by the year 2030, and 275,000 premature deaths will be avoided in the People’s Republic of China.

Because standards put in place by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, the California Air Resources or CARB, the European Union, the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection and other international regulators continue to become more restrictive, we view the market opportunities for our products as continually expanding. Our light duty vehicle catalyst products and heavy duty diesel emission control systems are designed specifically to deal with emissions from gasoline, diesel and a variety of alternative fuel powered engines.
Light Duty Vehicles
Key milestones in the evolution of light duty vehicle emissions control in the U.S. are summarized in the table below:

1970 | Congress passed the Clean Air Act, which required a 90% reduction in emissions from new automobiles by 1975, and resulted in the introduction of the first generation two-way catalytic converter to remove carbon monoxide and hydrocarbon emissions. 
1977 | Congress amended the Clean Air Act in order to further reduce the limits for nitrogen oxide emissions which resulted in the introduction of the three-way catalytic converter in 1981. 
1990 | Amendments were made to the Clean Air Act to further reduce nitrogen oxide emission limits by another 40% beginning in 1994. These "Tier 1" standards also resulted in standards for certain trucks. 
1998 | The Clinton Administration, auto industry and Northeast States came to a voluntary agreement to implement the National Low Emissions Vehicles, or NLEV, which was fully implemented across the U.S. by 2001. Additionally, CARB adopted the Low Emission Vehicle II, or LEV II, program which was a predecessor to the EPA's "Tier 2" standards set in 1999, which took effect in 2004. 
2014 | The EPA announced their finalized "Tier 3" standards, which are to be phased in between 2017 and 2025. These standards further reduce emissions from light duty vehicles by approximately 70% to 80% and are closely coordinated with the CARB LEV III standards. Of particular note, particulate matter standards are being further tightened to ensure that new advanced combustion strategies such as gasoline direct injection and diesel fueled vehicles do not pose additional new sources of pollution.

Light Duty Vehicles—International Markets
Europe implemented similar regulations as those noted above under Euro III (effective 2000), Euro IV (effective 2005), Euro V (effective 2009) and Euro VI (effective 2016).
2

In India the current emission standard is at BSIII going to BSIV nationwide (similar to Euro-IV) with discussions still on-going concerning timing to implement BSV and BSV1.
China has the world's largest passenger car market and is transitioning to China V (equivalent to Euro-V) in 2016 and 2017, with a complex set of regional deadlines. China VI (with an accelerated timetable for Beijing called "Beijing 6") is set to be implemented in 2019. China VI is equivalent to Euro-VI.
Heavy Duty Diesel Engines
Key milestones in the evolution of heavy duty diesel engine emissions control in the U.S. are summarized in the table below.

1985 | The EPA first mandated emission standards for diesel-fueled trucks and buses. 
1991 - 2006 | Emissions standards were largely met with advanced engine technologies. In approximately 375 engine certifications between 1994 and 2006, diesel oxidation catalysts were also used to help engines comply with particulate matter standards. 
2007 | The EPA and CARB standards further reduced particulate matter emissions limits for heavy duty engines by an additional 90% which led to the introduction of catalyzed diesel particulate filters, or CDPF. 
2010 | EPA 2010 significantly lowers the tailpipe emissions of nitrogen oxides, or NOx compared to the 2007 standard. 2010 tailpipe standards in US have led to the use of selective catalytic reduction, or SCR in addition to DOC and filters commonplace in EPA 2007 systems.

Off-road compression ignition emissions standards (non-road Tier 1) were first set in 1996 and consistently phased in and further tightened by off-road Tier 2 and Tier 3 emissions limits. Tier 4 emissions limits which have been phased in between 2011 and 2014 saw the first introduction of various exhaust emissions controls including diesel oxidation catalysts, diesel particulate filters and selective catalytic reduction catalysts. Given the global nature of the off-road diesel powered equipment market, common EPA and European Union standards have typically been enacted at comparable times.
Emerging Replacement Market in North America
According to market analysis firm Power System Research, manufacturers in North America have produced on average of 250,000 heavy duty on-road diesel vehicles equipped with a diesel particulate filter each year since 2007 to comply with EPA requirements. The typical OEM warranty on diesel particulate filters is five years and has expired for many of these vehicles with more continuing to expire in the coming years. As 2007 and newer diesel particulate filters from OEMs fail and require replacement, non-OEM diesel particulate filters will be needed as replacements. According to a 2012 industry report, the market for medium and heavy duty vehicle after-treatment maintenance and repair is projected to grow from $0.5 billion in 2010 to $3.0 billion by 2017. In the third quarter of 2014, we introduced the CDTi manufactured DuraFit™ OEM replacement diesel particulate filters through our channel of distributors to provide an alternative to OEM manufactured parts. We expect to leverage our existing technology and know-how to serve this emerging market.
Heavy Duty Diesel Engines—International Markets
Europe has adopted the stringent Euro-VI standard for heavy-duty vehicles which has led to systems using DOC, particulate filters and SCR. China is following the European standards and is currently implementing Euro-V with Euro-VI set to begin in 2010 with an accelerated version in Beijing. India is currently at BSIV (similar to Euro-IV) and is discussing the timetable for BSV and BSVI implementation.
Technology
In addition to our traditional catalyst products (TWC, DOC, CDPF and SCR), we have succeeded in developing a broad technology portfolio of new materials and catalysts to meet and exceed regulatory emission standards around the globe. We have focused on the two products, Three-Way Catalysts (TWC) and Diesel Oxidation Catalysts (DOC), that currently utilize a significant amount of PGMs. In particular, our BMARS™, Spinel™ and MPC® powder materials and catalyst products
developed from these technologies: SPGM™ DOC, SPGM™ TWC and TWC using BMARS™ and MPC®, are at the core of our business.

• | Spinel™. Our Spinel™ technology is a unique clean emissions exhaust technology which we believe will dramatically reduce the cost of attaining more stringent clean air standards. Spinel was the name initially given to naturally-occurring magnesium aluminate (MgAI2O4) and is now used to describe any composition with the same structure. Our Spinel™ technology can employ numerous low-cost metals in the spinel structure enabling use in a wide range of engine and vehicle applications, both gasoline and diesel, as well as other potential vertical markets. Our unique Spinel™ technology utilizes various base metals, which when combined together in a common structure, achieve 

3

unusual and very effective catalytic conversion activity. Spinel™ technology is ideal for the coating of catalytic converters, an alternative to those utilizing costly PGMs and rare earth materials. The base metals we use are common and inexpensive compared to PGMs, such as platinum, palladium and rhodium, and rare earth metals, such as cerium, lanthanum and neodymium. We believe Spinel™ technology will provide significant cost savings over conventional coating formulations. In addition, the Spinel™ technology structure is extremely versatile and stable. The versatility is critical for optimizing future generations of products to meet changing catalytic conversion needs for rapidly evolving engine technologies and increasingly stringent clean air standards. The stability of Spinel™ is critical to provide superior catalytic performance over time and at extreme temperatures for lifetime durability. In addition to SPGM™ and ZPGM™catalysts, we currently have oxygen storage material, or OSM, under development, which synergizes PGM function and drives the critical vehicle on-board diagnostic system. Our newest family of advanced low-PGM and ZPGM™ oxide compounds based upon our Spinel™ technology is summarized below:
To date, we have filed numerous patents on our Spinel™ technology and two were issued in late 2014. 

• | BMARS™. We have developed and patented intellectual property rights to a novel technology for enhancing the catalytic activity of rhodium known as base-metal activated rhodium on Support (BMARS™). This technology is in the form of a nano-scale powder that can be used by catalyst manufacturing partners in the production of TWC. The products made from these novel materials exhibit superior NOx performance at reduced rhodium loading. 


• | MPC®. We have developed and patented intellectual property rights to a novel technology for creating and manufacturing catalysts known as mixed phase catalysts (MPC®). This technology involves the self-assembly of a ceramic oxide matrix with catalytic metals precisely positioned within three-dimensional structures. The MPC® design gives our catalyst products two critical attributes that we believe differentiate them from competing offerings: superior stability that allows heat resistance and high performance with very low levels of precious metals; and base metal activation that allows base metals to be used instead of costly PGMs without compromising catalytic performance. 


• | SPGM™ DOC. We have developed powder materials that can be used to produce SPGM™DOC, synergized PGM diesel oxidation catalyst. The unique materials developed enable a low PGM and high performance DOC for use in a range of applications, including systems utilizing particulate filters and SCR for advanced emission standards. 


• | Platinum Plus®. We have developed and patented our Platinum Plus® fuel-borne catalyst as a diesel fuel soluble additive, which contains minute amounts of organo-metallic platinum and cerium catalysts. Platinum Plus® enables rapid conversion of particulate matter from diesel engines when coupled with a diesel particulate filter. It also improves combustion, which acts to reduce engine-out emissions. Platinum Plus® fuel-borne catalyst lends itself to a wide range of enabling solutions including diesel particulate filtration, low emission biodiesel, carbon reduction and exhaust emission reduction.

• | ARIS®. We have developed technology for selective catalytic reduction using urea, which is a highly effective method of reducing oxides of nitrogen. ARIS® technology forms a key part of the selective catalytic reduction system and is an advanced, computer-controlled, reagent injection system. 

We protect our proprietary technologies, along with our other intellectual property, through the use of patents, trade secrets and registered and common law trademarks. For additional information, refer to the "Intellectual Property" discussion below.
Competitive Advantages
Through a focused technology development campaign, we have developed a full suite of materials for gasoline and diesel engines with an associated broad portfolio of emission control catalysts. We believe that our technologies and products represent a fundamentally different solution, and the following competitive strengths position us as a leading provider of emission control products and systems.

• | Superior Catalyst Performance. Our proprietary technology enables us to produce catalytic coatings capable of significantly better catalytic performance than those previously available. We have achieved this demonstrated performance advantage by creating catalysts using unique nanostructures with superior stability under prolonged exposure to high temperatures. As a result, in heavy duty diesel and automotive applications, our catalyst formulations are able to maintain high levels of performance over time using substantially lower, or zero, PGMs than products previously available. 


• | Catalyst Cost Advantage—Addressing Global PGM Supply and Demand. Expensive PGMs, which include palladium, platinum and rhodium, and rare earth metals such as cerium, neodymium and lanthanum, are used in the manufacture of emission control catalysts, with palladium being the primary component used in catalysts serving the global light duty vehicle market. According to Johnson Matthey PLC's "Platinum 2013 Interim Review", in 2013, over 70% of all primary platinum and 80% of all primary rhodium produced originated in South Africa. Russia and South Africa combined supplied over 75% of palladium. We believe that the continued growth in supply of these metals from the mines in South Africa and Russia will be critical in order to meet the increasingly stringent global emission control standards. According to the same report, it is estimated that more than $6 billion is spent annually by OEMs on PGM purchases for catalysts. The global auto industry is expected to produce over 100 million vehicles by 2018, according to IHS Automotive. These production levels are expected to result in a continued increase in PGM demand for the foreseeable future. In addition, continued tightening of emission standards by regulators globally will require increased loading of PGM in emission catalysts. The new materials developed at CDTI enable OEMs and their suppliers to drastically reduce the PGM loadings in the DOC and TWC products that currently require the high cost of elevated PGM usage. 


• | Highly Customizable Catalyst Formulations. Our proprietary MPC® technology is a design approach, as opposed to a single chemical formulation. We have developed this technology since inception as a platform that can be tailored for a range of different catalyst applications. Specifically, our formulations can be tailored in two distinct ways. First, the oxide compounds used in our formulations can be adapted for specific applications by adding to them, or doping them with, a wide range of chemical elements. Second, we are able to vary the mixtures of our compounds to create customized solutions for specific applications for different vehicle platforms within the auto industry, complex heavy duty diesel equipment for OEMs, aftermarket and retrofit markets, and for different applications in the energy sector, such as selective catalytic reduction nitrogen oxide control for industrial and utility boilers, process heaters, gas turbines and generator sets. These could also include applications in the fuel cell, petrochemical and refinery, and thermoelectric industries. 


• | Proven Durability. Our products and systems have undergone substantial laboratory and field testing by our existing and prospective customers and have demonstrated their durability and reliability in a wide range of applications in actual use for many years. In addition, our products and systems have achieved numerous certifications and meet or exceed industry standards. 


• | Broad Portfolio of Verified Heavy Duty Diesel Systems. We believe we offer one of the industry's most comprehensive portfolios of system products that have been evaluated and verified (approved) by the EPA and CARB, as well as regulators in several European countries, for use in engine retrofit programs and in the aftermarket segment. Additionally, we have a thorough understanding of the verification process and the demonstrated ability to obtain broad verifications of products for use in the retrofit market. 


• | Compatibility with Existing Manufacturing Infrastructure and Operating Specifications. Catalytic converters using our catalyst products are compatible with existing automotive manufacturing processes as well as specific vehicle operating specifications. Our customers generally do not need to change their manufacturing operations, processes, or how their products operate in order to utilize our proprietary technology. Our heavy duty diesel emission control 

5

products and solutions are engineered to each customer's specific application and designed to deliver custom and industry-leading solutions that meet or exceed environmental mandates.
Products
We categorize our products as follows:

Gasoline Engines | We offer a range of advanced powder materials for use in catalyst products for emission control from gasoline engines: MPC®, BMARS™ and Spinel™. In addition we provide the catalyst products themselves in high-value applications where necessary. We believe catalytic converters using our technology have superior catalytic performance, can cost substantially less as a result of significantly reduced PGM loadings, have comparable or better durability and are physically and operationally compatible with all existing manufacturing processes and operating requirements. Our solution is based on industry-leading, patent-protected technology and a scalable manufacturing business model. 
Diesel Engines | We offer proven and robust catalyst products for emissions control from diesel engine applications: catalyzed particulate filters and diesel oxidation catalysts. Current techniques for diesel engines to meet emissions standards require the use of several methods, including diesel oxidation catalysts, catalyzed diesel particulate filters and selective catalytic reduction systems. We offer a full range of catalyst products for the control of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, particulate matter and nitrogen oxide in light and heavy duty applications. A new generation of materials is now available that enable catalyst manufacturing partners to commercialize SPGM™ DOC products for improved performance and low PGM usage.
Energy Applications | We have developed and can manufacture catalysts for use in selective catalytic reduction and carbon monoxide reduction systems, which are used to reduce nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions from natural gas and petroleum gas burning utility plants, industrial process plants, OEMs, refineries, food processors, product manufacturers and universities. 
Advanced Catalytic Materials | We have developed a complete suite of high performance and cost efficient technologies that can be offered in powder form to catalyst suppliers for inclusion in their manufacturing processes to address global demand by OEMs. 

Sales and Marketing
We deliver our catalyst technology to customers as finished products such as coated substrates and emissions control systems as well as through the supply of materials and technology used in the catalyst coating process. 
We supply our proprietary catalyst technologies to the OEM segment including automakers, heavy duty truck manufacturers, catalyst manufacturers, and aftermarket participants including distributors, integrators and retrofitters.
In the OEM segment, we utilize a business development team, with technical backgrounds, to pursue customers that can benefit from the use of our technology in the manufacture of their own catalysts. The catalyst industry is mainly comprised of a few suppliers serving large, sophisticated customers such as automobile manufacturers. Extensive interaction is required between catalyst manufacturers and the auto maker in the course of developing an effective, reliable catalyst for a particular application. We produce coated catalysts and continue to be an approved supplier of catalysts for major automotive manufacturers. Our ability to deliver our technology in powder form to catalyst manufacturers has enhanced our ability to market our products globally and to other catalyst manufacturers.
In the aftermarket segment, we sell emissions control products to automotive aftermarket suppliers and distributors for the OEM DPF and DOC replacement market. OEM replacement products are sold through the OEMs proprietary service network or through independent distributors and retailers. We are present in the OEM replacement market with Durafit™ brand of OEM replacement diesel particulate filters and diesel oxidation catalysts as well as through the sale of products to other manufacturers. Retrofit applications generally involve funded projects that use "approved systems" that are one-off in nature. Typical retrofit end-user customers include school districts, municipalities and other fleet operators, and the market for our heavy duty diesel systems products is heavily influenced by government funding of emissions control projects.
Competition
The automotive emissions control industry is highly concentrated with a few major competitors as a result of continuing consolidation through acquisitions. The major competitors are diversified enterprises with catalysts representing one of several lines of business. Globally, we and our catalyst manufacturer customers compete directly against BASF GmbH, Johnson Matthey PLC and Umicore Limited Liability Company. In the North America heavy-duty diesel market, competitors also include, Donaldson Company, Inc., ESW, Inc., Hug Filtersystems, and DCL International, Inc.
In the worldwide market the key competitive factors are:
6


• | Ability to provide a solution that satisfies emission reduction regulations;


• | Total cost of product (inclusive of PGM);


• | Ability to transition new products from development to production;


• | Quality control that guarantees 100% compliance with specifications;


• | On-time delivery to support customer production requirements; and


• | Financial stability and global reach.

Our strategy of transitioning to an advanced materials company is intended to enable broad commercialization of our technology without the need for a global manufacturing footprint. In particular, our ability to provide enabling technology to domestic catalyst manufacturers in key growth markets will allow our customers to defend and grow their market share.
Research and Development
Our research and development in catalyst technology is our core strength and has resulted in a broad array of products for the light duty vehicle and heavy duty diesel markets. We believe that the technical sophistication and cost-to-performance ratio of our products truly distinguishes our company. Product development for TWC and DOC has resulted in a broad family of verified products and systems. We credit our accomplishments to date to innovation, technology differentiation, application engineering expertise, highly targeted product development efforts and solid experience in the verification and approval process. 
Intellectual Property
Our intellectual property includes patent rights, trade secrets and registered and common law trademarks. Historically, we have primarily protected our intellectual property, particularly in the area of three-way catalysts (and particularly in the automotive area) by maintaining our innovative technology as trade secrets. We believe that the protection provided by trade secrets for our intellectual property was the most suitable protection available for the automotive industry where our business initially started and in which we currently sell our commercial products. Our automotive competitors largely rely on trade secret protection for their innovative technology.
In order to more broadly commercialize our technology in new business models, we have sought patent protection in relation to any new industries and new countries in which we expect to do business. We currently have approximately 111 issued patents and approximately 177 pending applications covering the following main technologies: fundamental catalyst formulations based on perovskite mixed metal oxides applicable to all catalyst markets, Spinel™ technology, Mixed Phase Catalyst (MPC®) technology, PGM-free catalyzed diesel particulate filter, selective catalytic reduction, diesel oxidation catalyst, ZPGM™ three-way catalyst formulations, ZPGM™ diesel oxidation catalyst, palladium three-way catalyst formulations, fuel-borne catalysts, optimization and stabilization of oxygen storage materials without rare earth materials, exhaust gas recirculation with selective catalytic reduction and exhaust systems for diesel engines incorporating particulate filters. Currently, our patents have expiration dates ranging from 2017 through 2033.
We have conducted an analysis of our technologies and intellectual property and have decided to aggressively patent our important technologies going forward. While we continue to rely on a combination of trade secrets, know-how, trademark registrations, confidentiality and other agreements with employees, customers, partners and others, we intend to strengthen our position through the prosecution of patents to protect our intellectual property rights pertaining to our products and technology.
We currently have registered and unregistered trademarks for the Clean Diesel Technologies name with logo, CDT logo, CDTi name with logo, CSI®, CATALYTIC SOLUTIONS®, CSI logo, ARIS®, BARETRAP®, BMARS™, CATTRAP®, COMBICLEAN®, COMBIFILTER®, DESIGNED TO FIT. BUILT TO LAST.™, DURAFIT™, DURAFIT OEM REPLACEMENT EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES™, MPC®, P2C™, PATFLUID®, PLATINUM PLUS®, PURIFIER and design, PURIFILTER®, PURIMUFFLER®, SPGM™, SPINEL™, THREE-WAY ZPGM™, TWO-WAY ZPGM™, ZPGM™, ZPGM TWC™, TERMINOX® and UNIKAT®.
Manufacturing Operations
We have developed innovative and sophisticated manufacturing processes for coating substrates using our proprietary catalytic coatings. The manufacturing process consists of preparing coatings direct or in powder form via controlled mixing and calcination, then coating and further calcining (one or multiple times) the coated substrates. The process of mixing and applying the various types of coatings onto high cell density substrates is complex and requires sophisticated manufacturing technology. We have been manufacturing automotive catalysts in house since 1999 perfecting those technologies. Our manufacturing processes are designed to provide a high level of quality control at every step of our unique manufacturing 
7

process. We coat our proprietary catalyst products at our Oxnard, California manufacturing facility as well as support our downstream partners in deploying coating processes in their global facilities to enable them to correctly apply our unique products.
For our complete turnkey DuraFit™, Purifilter™, and private label family emissions products we outsource the manufacture of the metal enclosures, accessories and hardware which complete the unit sold to the end customer. We maintain ISO 9001:2008, ISO/TS 16949:2009 and ISO 14001:2004 certifications for our facilities.
Our raw material requirements include significant purchases of ceramic substrates filters that we coat with specialty formulated catalytic materials comprised of platinum group metals (PGMs) and various chemicals. PGMs and substrates are either provided on a consignment basis by the customers or are purchased by us on behalf of the customer. The availability of raw materials is generally dictated by global market supply of key materials. Delivery of key materials such as rare earth metals and PGMs have been at times constricted due to global supply constraints. The ceramic substrates and filters that we buy can generally be purchased from more than one source, limiting our risk of supply. Changing suppliers for some raw materials may require regulatory or customer approval. For further discussion of risk of supply, refer to "Item 1.A. Risk Factors”.
Regulations
We are committed to complying with all federal, state and international environmental laws governing production, use, transport and disposal of substances and control of emissions. In addition to governing our manufacturing and other operations, these laws often impact the development of our emissions control products, including, but not limited to, required compliance with emissions standards applicable to new product diesel, gasoline and alternative fuel engines. These regulations include those developed in Japan, in the United States by the EPA and CARB and in the E.U. by the European Environment Agency, including standards from the Verification of Emission Reduction Technologies, or VERT, Association.
Many of our products must receive regulatory approval prior to sale. In the United States, regulatory approval is obtained from the EPA or CARB through a verification process. The verification process includes a thorough review of the technology as well as tightly controlled testing to quantify statistically significant levels of emission reductions. For example, the EPA verification process begins with a verification application and a test plan. Once this is completed, the testing phase begins and is then followed by a data analysis to determine if the technology qualifies for verification. Once a technology is placed on the verified technologies list and 500 units are sold, the manufacturer is responsible for conducting in-use testing and reporting of results to the EPA. Where we own the verification, primarily in retrofit, we are responsible for this testing. Similar product approval schemes exist in other countries around the world.
Company History
We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1994 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fuel Tech, Inc., a Delaware corporation (formerly known as Fuel-Tech N.V., a Netherlands Antilles limited liability company) ("Fuel Tech"), and were spun off by Fuel Tech in a rights offering in December 1995 on the NASDAQ Stock Market (Symbol CDTI). On October 15, 2010, we completed a business combination with Catalytic Solutions, Inc. ("CSI"), a California corporation formed in 1996, when our wholly-owned subsidiary, CDTI Merger Sub, Inc., merged with and into CSI. We refer to this transaction as the "Merger." The Merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition and, as a result, our Company's (the legal acquirer) consolidated financial statements are now those of CSI (the accounting acquirer), with the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of CDTI being included effective from October 15, 2010, the closing date of the Merger. From November 22, 2006 through the closing date of the Merger, CSI's common stock was listed on the AIM of the London Stock Exchange (AIM: CTS and CTSU).
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 97 full time employees and 2 part time employees. None of our employees is a party to a collective bargaining agreement. We also retain outside consultants and sales and marketing consultants and agents.
