The acquisition of etailz is part of our strategy to diversify our business into the fastest growing segment of retail: the Digital Marketplace. The Company plans to access the relationships, operational expertise, and infrastructure built by etailz to help unlock the full potential of etailz and to accelerate our progress towards being the industry leader for digital marketplace sales and expertise.
 
The Company paid $32.3 million in cash, issued 5.7 million shares of TWMC stock at closing to the shareholders of etailz as consideration for their shares, and paid $4.3 million in cash advances to settle obligations of the selling shareholders. Based on the fair value of $3.56 per share on the acquisition date, the shares had a value of $20.4 million. An earn-out of up to a maximum of $14.6 million will be payable in fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 subject to the achievement by etailz of $6 million in operating income in fiscal 2017 and $7.5 million in fiscal 2018 as outlined in the share purchase agreement. In connection with the acquisition, the Company assumed a liability of the selling shareholders for an etailz employee bonus plan, of which $1.9 million was due and payable at closing and funded as part of the cash advances and the remaining $2.3 million will be earned over a two year service period. The acquisition and related costs were funded primarily from the Company’s cash on hand and short term borrowings under its revolving credit facility. The acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting.
 
During the Company’s second quarter of fiscal 2017, the share purchase agreement with the selling shareholders of etailz was amended to provide that $11.5 million be released from the earnout escrow account and the $3.1 million remaining in the earnout escrow account may be payable in cash to the selling shareholders in 2019, subject to the achievement by etailz of operating income in excess of $15.5 million during the twenty-four month period ending February 2, 2019. In the event that etailz achieves operating income in excess of $13.5 million, but less than $15.5 million, an earnout of $1.6 million would be payable in 2019. If etailz operating income is below $13.5 million, the $3.1 million escrow would be returned to the Company.
 
The amount released from the earnout escrow was disbursed during the Company’s second quarter of fiscal 2017 as follows: $5.0 million to the Company for future investment to support growth initiatives, $5.0 million to the selling shareholders, and $1.5 million to the Company (to be allocated to increase the maximum amount available under the etailz employee bonus plan from $4.2 million to $5.7 million).
 
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration for the above transaction consisted of the following as of October 17, 2016 (in thousands):
 

Cash consideration | $ | 36,600
-----------------------------------------------------------+---+-------
Fair value of stock consideration | | 20,415
Fair value of contingent consideration | | 10,381
Fair value of indemnification consideration held in escrow | | 1,500
