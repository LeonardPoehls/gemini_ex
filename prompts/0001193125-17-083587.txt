Item 1. Business. 
Company Overview 
 Hortonworks, Inc.® is an industry-leading innovator that creates, distributes and supports a new class of enterprise data management software solutions built on open source technology. Our customers use our enterprise-scale Connected Data Platforms to build transformational data applications fueled by actionable intelligence from data in motion, information that flows over a network, such as the internet or corporate networks, and data at rest, information that is stored in digital form in a file system, database or other storage medium. 
 Our data-at-rest solution, Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP), is an enterprise-scale data management platform built entirely on open source software including ApacheTM Hadoop®. HDP combines computer servers with local storage and open source software technology to create a reliable distributed compute and storage platform for large data sets that is secure and scalable up to petabytes of data within thousands of servers or nodes. At the core of HDP is the next generation computing and resource management framework called Yet Another Resource Negotiator (YARN), which enables a centralized data architecture for batch, interactive and real-time workloads to be executed simultaneously on both a single cluster and data set with the comprehensive security, governance and operational services enterprise customers require. HDP integrates with existing data center technologies to support best-of-breed data architectures and enables our customers to collect, store, process and analyze increasing amounts of existing and new data types in a way that augments rather than replaces their existing data center infrastructures. 
 Our data-in-motion solution, Hortonworks DataFlow (HDF), is an enterprise-scale data ingest and stream processing platform built entirely on open source software including Apache NiFi. HDF is complementary to HDP and accelerates the flow of data in motion into HDP to support full fidelity analytics. HDF is a real-time, integrated, secure and adaptive platform capable of ingesting any type of data in motionfrom traditional data sources to new data types such as sensor and machine data, server log data, clickstream data, geo-location data, social and sentiment data and other data generated by documents and other file types. HDF enables customers to collect, curate and analyze their data in motion in order to deliver real-time business insights and actionable intelligence. 
 We employ a differentiated strategic approach in that we are committed to continuously driving innovation and market adoption of Apache Hadoop, Apache NiFi and associated open source technologies within the Apache Software Foundation open source ecosystem. We do this by sharing all of our product development with the open source community in order to further advance open source technology development and functionality which is ultimately consumed by enterprise customers of all types and sizes. We support the open source community and directly employ a large number of core committers to various Apache projects, including Apache Hadoop and Apache NiFi. A committer is an individual who is permitted by the Apache Software Foundation to modify the source code of a particular open source project and then commit those changes to the central repository. We believe that keeping our business model free from architecture design conflicts that could limit the ultimate success of our customers in leveraging the benefits of open source technology at scale is a significant competitive advantage. We have been recognized as a leader in Apache Hadoop by Forrester Research, Inc. based on the strength of our offerings and our differentiated strategy. 
 We were founded in 2011. During 2012 we launched HDP, and during 2015 we launched HDF. We sell support subscriptions and professional services offerings for both of these platforms. As of December 31, 2016, we had over 1,000 support subscription customers (which we generally define as an entity with an active support subscription) across a broad array of company sizes and industries. We have strategic relationships with Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco), Dell EMC, Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company

 (Hewlett Packard Enterprise), Hitachi Data Systems Corporation (Hitachi Data Systems), International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft), Pivotal Software, Inc. (Pivotal), Rackspace Hosting, Inc., SAP AG (SAP), Teradata Corporation (Teradata) and Yahoo! Inc. (Yahoo!), focused on integrated development, marketing and support strategies to maximize the success of our solutions. Consistent with our open source approach, we generally make our Connected Data Platforms (HDP and HDF) available free of charge and derive revenue primarily from customer fees for our support subscription offerings and professional services. 
 We have achieved significant growth in recent periods. Our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $184.5 million, $121.9 million and $46.0 million, respectively. Our operating billings for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were $269.9 million, $165.9 million and $87.1 million, respectively. We incurred net losses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 of $251.7 million, $179.1 million and $177.4 million, respectively. See Item 6Selected Financial DataKey MetricOperating Billings for more information.

 Industry Background 
 Major technology innovations such as social media, mobile and cloud computing, new web-based applications, such as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), and the emergence of the Internet of Anything, in which devices with sensors and actuators transmit increasing amounts of data automatically, have created an always-on, constantly connected society that is putting increasing pressure on enterprise data center infrastructure. The increase in volume, velocity and variety from this new Internet of Anything data in combination with traditional enterprise applications and data systems is creating significant challenges to enterprise data management resources and is disrupting the way enterprises design their data infrastructure. 
 Enterprises are not only inundated with increasing amounts of data, but also struggle with managing more types of data that are less easily managed by traditional data center architectures. Historically, enterprises focused primarily on managing data from dedicated and disparate data center systems, including enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management systems. To store and process these types of data, enterprises were able to utilize relational database management systems optimized for analyzing preselected, structured data stored within isolated silos. 
 Today, the variety of Internet of Anything data, including new data types such as sensor and machine data, server log data, clickstream data, geo-location data, social and sentiment data and other data generated by documents and other file types, is fueling the exponential growth in the aggregate amount of data that has the potential to be captured and managed by the enterprise to drive business value. Collecting, storing, processing and analyzing these massive quantities of new context-rich Internet of Anything data sources requires new tools. 
 As a result of the limitations within traditional data center architectures, enterprise customers require new technologies to cost-effectively collect, store, process and analyze this vast amount of data in its original context-rich form in order to find patterns and actionable insights that enable them to capitalize on opportunities, avoid operational issues and enable more informed decisions. Enterprises must upgrade their data center architectures to harness large volumes of data under management in order to easily leverage existing data sources and explore new data sources in innovative ways. 
 Hadoop was originally developed in the early 2000s. Partnering with the Apache Hadoop community, Yahoo! led major innovations in the technology to help tackle big data challenges and operate its business at scale. The 
 
2 
 
 traditional Hadoop offering (i.e., Hadoop Version 1.x) was largely a batch system that enabled users to manage data at scale, but required siloed computing clusters by application with pre-selected data sets, thus limiting accessibility, interoperability and overall value. Incremental attempts to improve traditional Hadoop focused on bolting on data warehousing and analytics functionality as well as basic levels of security and operations management, which were available through a mix of separate open source projects or commercially available software. This innovation demonstrated the early promise of Hadoop in enabling enterprises to address their big data requirements, but traditional Hadoop still lacked the breadth of functionality and resiliency that would enable it to be deployed more broadly by enterprises in production use cases. 
 To improve on this early functionality, Hortonworks engineers created the initial architecture for YARN and developed the technology for it within the Apache Hadoop community, leading to the release of YARN in October 2013. This technology advancement transformed Hadoop (i.e., Hadoop Version 2.x) into a platform that allows for multiple ways of interacting with data, including interactive structured query language (SQL) processing, in-memory analytic processing, real-time stream processing and online data processing, along with its traditional batch data processing. YARN represented a significant innovation in that it eliminated the need to silo data sets and reduces total cost of ownership by enabling a single cluster of servers to store a wide range of shared data sets on which mixed workloads spanning batch, interactive and real-time use cases can simultaneously process with predictable service levels. YARN is designed to serve as a common data operating system that enables the Hadoop ecosystem to natively integrate applications and leverage existing technologies and skills while extending consistent security, governance and operations across the platform. With these capabilities, YARN as a cornerstone technology embedded within Hadoop 2.X facilitates mainstream Hadoop adoption by enterprises of all types and sizes for production use cases at scale. 
 Our Opportunity 
 Enterprises are facing an increasing need to adopt big data strategies that will help them modernize their data center architectures, control costs and transform their businesses to succeed in an increasingly digital world. Inherent in this shift is a move from the post-transaction, reactive analysis of subsets of data to a new model of pre-transaction, proactive insights across a comprehensive and integrated data architecture capable of managing both data at rest and data in motion. We believe that enterprises that successfully adopt a big data strategy will succeed, whereas enterprises that fail or are slow to implement a modern data architecture will struggle to sustain competitive advantages. We believe that the new class of enterprise-scale data management solutions must meet certain requirements to create and accelerate widespread market adoption and enable the modern data architecture. We believe this set of requirements include: 

 | capability to centrally manage new and existing data types;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to run multiple applications simultaneously on a common data architecture;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | high availability, manageability, security and data governance;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | interoperability with new and existing data center infrastructure investments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | stability and dependability;
--+-----------------------------


 | scalability and affordability;
--+-------------------------------


 | ability to analyze all available data for rich historical insights;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to analyze real-time streams of data for immediate actionable insights;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to securely capture and mediate multi-directional data flows within and outside the data center;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to enable predictive analytic applications based on an open approach to actionable intelligence; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | deployment flexibility that spans the on-premises data center and the public cloud.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This industry association is aimed at speeding Hadoop adoption through ecosystem interoperability rooted in open source. As ecosystem and solution providers create value from Hadoop through the ODPis ongoing efforts, enterprise customers will see the benefits of increased choice with more big data applications and solutions running atop a common core of Hadoop. 
 Further, leading enterprise software and infrastructure vendors as well as global systems integrators with solutions that run on or with the HDP and HDF offerings include Accenture plc, Amazon, Capgemini, Cisco, Dell EMC, Ernst & Young Global Limited, Google Inc., Hewlett Packard Enterprise, IBM, LucidWorks, Inc., Microsoft, NetApp, Inc., Pivotal, SAP, SAS Institute Inc., Teradata, Tableau Software, Inc., VMware, Inc. and Wipro Limited. 
 Competition 
 Within the Enterprise Hadoop market, we compete against a variety of large software and infrastructure vendors, smaller specialized companies and custom development efforts. Our principal competitors in this market include pure play Hadoop distribution vendors such as Cloudera Inc. (Cloudera) and MapR Technologies, Inc. (MapR), enterprise software and infrastructure vendors that offer Hadoop distributions such as IBM and Oracle Corporation (Oracle), as well as cloud computing vendors that offer big data processing services such as Amazon. 
 Within the broader big data market, an Enterprise Hadoop solution may compete for workloads against traditional data warehouse solutions from large vendors such as Teradata, Oracle, Microsoft, IBM, Hewlett Packard Enterprise, SAP and Dell EMC, and non-relational NoSQL databases from pure play vendors such as MongoDB, Inc. (MongoDB) and DataStax, Inc. (DataStax). Because Enterprise Hadoop is commonly integrated with traditional data warehouses, such as our partnerships with Teradata and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, and NoSQL databases, such as our partnership with DataStax, this category of vendors and solutions comprises a set of key partners who may compete with us in certain instances while partnering with us in others. 
 We believe the principal competitive factors in the Enterprise Hadoop and big data markets for our solutions are as follows: 
 

 | name and reputation of the vendor or competitive offering;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to adapt development, sales, marketing and support to the open source software model;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product price, performance, scalability, reliability, functionality and ease of use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | value of support subscription offerings and quality of support and professional services;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | strategic alliances with major enterprise software and infrastructure providers;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | availability of third-party solutions that are integrated with and compatible with the technology;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | number of Global 2000 reference accounts;
--+------------------------------------------


 | ability to provide a credible and actionable roadmap for the technology;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | ability to quickly diagnose software issues and provide patches and other solutions;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | strength of the vendors relationships and reputation in the open source community; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | employment of open source technology core committers and innovators.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

We believe that we generally compete favorably on the basis of the foregoing factors. 
 The traditional barriers to entry that are found in the proprietary software model do not characterize the open source software model. For example, the financial and legal barriers to creating a new Hadoop distribution are relatively low because the software components typically included in Hadoop distributions are publicly available under open source licenses that permit copying, modification and redistribution. However, while anyone can use, copy, modify and redistribute the HDP or HDF offerings, the technical skills, knowledge and capability of our team of committers provides a point of differentiation in the marketplace. Furthermore, others are not permitted to refer to the product using the trademarked Hortonworks name or other proprietary marks unless they have a formal business relationship with us that allows such references. 
 Some of our actual and potential competitors have advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources, stronger brand and business user recognition, larger intellectual property portfolios and broader global distribution and presence. In addition, our industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more established companies may focus on operational intelligence and could directly compete with us. Smaller companies could also launch new products and services that we do not offer and that could gain market acceptance quickly. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our offerings, including HDP, HDF and Hortonworks Sandbox, are built from software components licensed to the general public under the Apache Software License and similar open source licenses. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source software development projects primarily at the Apache Software Foundation. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute these offerings. As a result, open source development and licensing practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. Consequently, our trademarks may represent our most valuable intellectual property with respect to these products. As a result, we actively pursue registration of our trademarks, logos, service marks and domain names in the United States and in other countries. The duration of our trademarks registered in the United States generally lasts as long as we use them in commerce and timely file all documents required by the United States Patent and Trademark Office to maintain such registrations. 
 Hortonworks SmartSense is an optional proactive support service available with our support subscriptions offerings that contains proprietary intellectual property. SmartSense monitors Hortonworks platforms in order to proactively find performance and configuration issues and provide recommendations to help avoid potential future issues. We actively pursue registration of our patents and trademarks for this proactive support service in the United States and in other countries. We also make available intellectual property via our Hortonworks Community Connection online community and our Partnerworks program and rely on copyright laws to protect such intellectual property. 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret, copyright, patent and trademark laws, a variety of contractual arrangements, such as license agreements, assignment agreements, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, and confidentiality procedures and technical measures to gain rights to and protect the intellectual property used in our business. 
 We also rely on certain intellectual property rights that we license from third parties, including under certain open source licenses. Though such third-party technologies may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, we believe that alternative technologies would be available to us. 
 Our policy is to require employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, works of authorship, developments and other processes generated by them on our behalf and agreeing to protect our confidential information, and all of our key employees and contractors have done so. We also control and monitor access to, and distribution of, our proprietary information.
