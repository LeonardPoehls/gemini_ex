ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview

We operate a national local services consumer review service and marketplace with a mission of improving the local service experience for both members and service providers. To that end, we help facilitate happy transactions between more than five million members and our collection of service providers in over 700 categories of service nationwide. Built on a foundation of more than ten million verified reviews of local services, our unique tools, services and content across multiple platforms enable members to research, shop for and purchase local services for critical needs, as well as rate and review the providers of these services. Our ratings and reviews, which are now available to members free-of-charge following our introduction of a free membership tier during 2016, assist our members in identifying and hiring a provider for their local service needs.

We generate revenue from both members and service providers as reflected in the table below for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014:

Member Services. During 2016, we introduced a free membership tier that provides access to our ratings and reviews in all markets free-of-charge for the first time. We continue to offer paid membership tiers as well, and our primary source of membership revenue remains subscription fees. The subscription fees are typically charged in advance and recognized ratably over the term of the membership, which is generally twelve months in length. We compile a breadth of highly relevant, member-generated ratings and reviews that provide insights which could otherwise be difficult for consumers to obtain on their own. We actively monitor for fraudulent reviews, and only verified reviews factor into service providers’ ratings. 
Under our current tiered pricing membership structure, we now offer a free tier (Green) and two paid tiers (Silver and Gold). Each tier offers unique levels of service and benefits to our members, including varying degrees of online and phone support, access to discounts and our award-winning Angie’s List Magazine. The Angie’s Fair Price Guarantee, which promises a fair price for purchases made in our e-commerce marketplace, and the Angie’s Service Quality Guarantee, which promises satisfaction with the quality delivered by service providers on purchases of services made through our e-commerce marketplace, are among the benefits afforded to our paid members. 
We offer our services in a wide variety of categories, a sampling of which is highlighted in the table below: 

Alarms | Driveways | Housecleaning | Pest Control 
Appliance Repair | Dry Cleaning | Interior Design & Decorating | Plumbing 
Auto Repair | Electrical | Landscaping | Pool & Spa Service
Builders - Homes | Fencing | Lawn & Yard | Remodeling 
Carpet Cleaning | Flooring | Lighting | Rentals 
Closets | Garage Doors | Masonry | Roofing 
Decks & Porches | Handyman | Moving | Snow Removal 
Doors | Heating & A/C | Painting | Windows 

Our members rate service providers on an “A” to “F” grading scale based on a variety of criteria, including overall experience, availability, price, quality, responsiveness, punctuality and professionalism and other criteria, depending on the type of service provided. Ratings on each applicable criterion are averaged across all member reviews submitted for the service provider to produce the service provider’s grade on Angie’s List. In addition to a letter grade, we encourage members to provide a detailed description and commentary on the service experience. We also request the approximate cost of the service, the date the service was provided and whether the member would hire the service provider again in the future. We allow members to report on each unique experience they have with a service provider. However, if an individual submits more than one review for the same service provider within a 180-day period, the second review is published only if we determine it is for a separate, unique service experience. 
We do not allow members to submit reviews anonymously, and our certified data collection process prevents service providers from reporting on themselves or their competitors. We believe this policy is critical to maintaining the integrity of our reviews. We permit service providers to respond to reviews, both positive and negative, to provide our members with both sides of the story. We also deploy a variety of other resources, including a team of quality control and certification personnel and our proprietary fraud detection technology, to ensure our members can trust the service provider reviews available via our service. We use automated techniques to screen all reviews for fraudulent activity, duplicate reviews, vulgar language and fake or defamatory content prior to publication, and flagged reviews receive additional screening to ensure their accuracy, reliability and propriety. We provide convenient access to our ratings and reviews on our website and mobile applications. 
We remain committed to helping our members find the best provider for their service needs. Accordingly, the sort logic utilized in search results displays our certified service providers, which must purchase advertising from us in order to obtain our certification, above service providers that are not certified, making it easier for our members to find service providers that have met certain eligibility requirements, agreed to offer a discount to members and generally demonstrated a strong interest in building relationships with and serving our members.

Service Provider Services. Our primary source of service provider revenue is term-based sales of advertising to service providers. Our members are seeking reputable providers of high-cost-of-failure services and utilize our platforms and offerings to find them, thereby providing a large, qualified pool of demand and a strong value proposition to our service providers, thus establishing the basis for the service provider side of our business. 

Service providers are able to take advantage of a variety of services and tools based on the nature and extent of their relationship with us. Our members rate service providers on an “A” to “F” scale, and we invite service providers with an overall member grade of “A” or “B” to complete our certification process to advertise their services and provide exclusive discounts, promotions and e-commerce offers to our members. Service providers must meet certain criteria in order to become eligible for certification, including:

• | retaining an overall member grade of “A” or “B”;


• | passing an annual criminal background check;


• | attesting to proper licensing to perform listed work;


• | maintaining a company-verified profile page; and


• | remaining in good business standing with us.

Once the eligibility criteria outlined above are satisfied, a service provider must purchase advertising from us to obtain our certification. If a service provider fails to meet any of our eligibility criteria during the term of its contract, refuses to participate in our complaint resolution process or engages in what we determine to be prohibited behavior through any of our service channels, we promptly suspend any existing advertising, discounts, promotions or e-commerce offers, and the service provider’s contract is subject to termination. This policy, which may result in us foregoing revenue that we would otherwise receive, is guided by our commitment to our members.
A certified service provider rotates among the first service providers listed in search results for an applicable category, and their company name, overall rating, number of reviews, certification badge and basic profile information are displayed in the search results. Service providers without our certification are listed below our certified service providers in search results, and while the nature and extent of benefits afforded to non-certified service providers is less than what is made available to their certified counterparts, non-certified service providers are still able to take an active role in managing their profiles and monitoring members’ ratings and reviews through our platforms. Our annual Super Service Award, for which both certified and non-certified service providers are eligible, recognizes excellence among service providers that maintain a superior service record. 
In addition to traditional advertising on our platforms, our e-commerce marketplace solutions offer members the opportunity to purchase services through us from highly-rated service providers. These e-commerce offerings are available through postings on our website and mobile applications as well as via email promotions and offers and are an important aspect of our business. When a member completes an e-commerce purchase from our marketplace, we process the transaction and receive a portion of the price paid as revenue. E-commerce offerings provide our members with an easier and more convenient way to fulfill their service needs and may offer a discount as well.

Marketing and Sales

Our primary strategy for new member acquisition is national advertising, including both offline and online media, with continued expansion into digital marketing platforms. Our marketing efforts are not only focused on acquiring new members and increasing market penetration, but also on improving our brand’s awareness and consideration and highlighting our products and services with the goal of driving qualified traffic to and engagement on our platforms. The marketing mix we employ includes offline advertising via national cable and broadcast television and national broadcast radio as well as digital advertising through search engine marketing, web display, affiliate and retargeting. Our co-founder and Chief Marketing Officer, Angie Hicks, serves as our spokeswoman. We also utilize our original content, search engine optimization (“SEO”) and other inbound marketing tactics to supplement our marketing spend and further strengthen our brand as well as to drive more engagement and transactions on our platforms. 
Our sales personnel, the majority of whom are located at our headquarters in Indianapolis, Indiana, focus on originating and renewing service provider advertising contracts and identifying and converting e-commerce opportunities with service providers across the markets in which we operate in the United States.
Our Technology

Our proprietary technology platform is designed to create an engaging user experience for both our members and service providers, to enable us to collect and verify the integrity of our reviews and to help us connect our members to our online marketplace of services from our service providers. We employ a team of internal product and engineering professionals, as well as external resources when necessary, dedicated to enhancing our technology platform, developing new products and services for members and service providers and conducting product and quality assurance testing.

Key elements of our proprietary technology platform, which was enhanced with the introduction of our new technology platform across all markets during 2016, include:


• | Search. Our search technology combines structured and free-form content to enable our members to search for service providers in numerous categories. The search and sort functionality utilizes a number of factors, such as grade, number of reviews, service area and current discounts or other promotions, to connect our members with the most relevant service providers.


• | Targeted review acquisition. We developed a review targeting engine for collecting reviews on service providers. This engine enables us to identify individuals who may have hired a service provider found through our platforms, and we then encourage these individuals to submit a review of their service experience.


• | Fraud detection. We employ various technology-based algorithms and filters, as well as third-party tools, to detect fraudulent reviews. Our reviews are not anonymous and provide a degree of traceability and accountability not present in many competitor websites.


• | Service provider sales lead targeting. We utilize a scoring engine that assigns weights to a variety of attributes in order to effectively identify the most qualified prospective service provider leads for our service provider sales representatives to target.


• | Membership tools and service provider contracts. We use proprietary tools for managing memberships and renewals as well as targeted service provider contracts.


• | E-commerce tools. We utilize dynamic tools that enable consumers to purchase services through our e-commerce marketplace platforms from highly-rated service providers.

We developed our website and related infrastructure, which are hosted in a redundant fashion within multiple third-party co-location facilities and cloud computing services, with the goal of offering unique tools and support to facilitate improvement of the local service experience for both members and service providers.

Cybersecurity
The infrastructure and third-party services we utilize have been subject to various cybersecurity incidents from external sources, including vulnerability scanning, penetration attempts and distributed denial of service attacks. Additionally, individual workstations used by our employees have been exposed to malicious software or advanced persistent threats that are commonplace on the Internet. We maintain systems and processes to detect, alert and mitigate incidents related to malware, attempted intrusions and attacks against our technology and services, and we employ certain preventative measures to reduce the risk of such incidents. We believe our systems and processes are effective in mitigating the risks of cybersecurity threats. The cybersecurity incidents we have experienced to date have not materially impacted our business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition or impaired our ability to accurately record, process, summarize or report information for financial reporting purposes, and there is no indication such incidents have resulted in a loss or breach of member, service provider or employee personal data.
Competition
We compete for consumer attention with numerous providers of consumer ratings, reviews and referrals on the basis of a number of factors, including, among other things, breadth of our service provider listings, reliability of our content, depth and timeliness of information, quality and availability of our products, services and technology and strength and recognition of our brand. We also compete for a share of service providers’ overall advertising budgets with traditional, offline media companies and online marketing providers on the basis of several factors, including, among other things, return on investment, the quality of our membership profile, the effectiveness and relevance of our discount and e-commerce initiatives, our pricing and monetization strategies and recognition of our brand. Our competitors include:

• | Amazon Home & Business Services, Better Business Bureau, Consumers’ Checkbook, Facebook, Inc., Google AdWords Express, Groupon, Inc., HomeAdvisor, Inc., Houzz, Inc., Porch.com, Inc., Pro.com, Pro Referral.com (owned and operated by Red Beacon, Inc.), TaskRabbit, Inc., Thumbtack, Inc., the Yellow Pages and Yelp, Inc.

We are facing an increasingly competitive business environment as many of the competitors identified above continue to expand their presence, including increasing their advertising spend, entering international markets and improving their technology and product and service offerings, in the local services sector.

Research and Development
Our research and development expenditures primarily consist of costs incurred related to the development of our new technology platform, including product and technology personnel and external resources, as applicable. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, development costs attributable to our new technology platform amounted to $13.7 million, $25.2 million and $20.1 million, respectively. 
Intellectual Property

We protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights as well as contractual restrictions. We control access to our proprietary technology by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our personnel and contractors and confidentiality agreements with third parties. In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, trademarks, trade dress, domain names and copyrights to protect our intellectual property. We believe our domain names, trademarks and service marks are important to our marketing strategy and the continued development of awareness of our brand, and therefore, we pursue their registration in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. As of December 31, 2016, we had 25 registered trademarks in the United States and one registered trademark in Europe, as well as four pending trademark applications in the United States.
Personnel

As of January 31, 2017, we employed approximately 1,567 full-time personnel in the United States. None of our personnel are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe relations with our personnel are good.

6

Seasonality

We believe our business is subject to trends related to seasonal activity levels in the local services sector and that we may be impacted by such seasonality in the future, potentially resulting in fluctuations in our revenue, operating expenses or overall financial results. Generally, our highest volume of activity occurs in the second and third quarters of the year, corresponding to the periods of the year when consumers are typically most actively seeking our services. 
Backlog
Service provider contract value backlog consists of the portion of service provider contract value at the end of the period that is not yet recognized as revenue. Our total service provider contract value backlog was $147.3 million and $162.5 million at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Operating Segments and Geographic Areas

We manage our business on the basis of one operating segment. Substantially all of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was generated from members and service providers located in the United States, separately stated as membership revenue and service provider revenue in our consolidated financial statements. The financial information received and reviewed by our President and Chief Executive Officer, who serves as our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) with respect to our evaluation of segment reporting, contains detail on the components of our revenue streams, but operating expenses and assets and liabilities are only reported on a consolidated basis. Further, the financial information reviewed by our CODM does not contain margin information for, nor are operating expenses, assets or liabilities allocated to, each revenue stream. As the financial information reviewed by our CODM does not contain a measure of profit or loss by revenue stream, discrete financial information is not available, and operating results for each revenue stream are therefore not regularly reviewed by the CODM. Accordingly, the CODM does not possess enough information to assess performance and make resource allocation decisions by revenue stream, thus supporting our conclusion that the business is managed on the basis of one operating segment.
