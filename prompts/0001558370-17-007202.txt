 Equitable Financial Corp.
 Equitable Financial Corp., a Maryland corporation (the “Company”), was organized in February 2015. Upon completion of the mutual‑to‑stock conversion of Equitable Financial MHC in July 2015, the Company became the holding company of Equitable Bank and succeeded to all of the business and operations of Equitable Financial Corp., a federal corporation (“Old Equitable”), and each of Old Equitable and Equitable Financial MHC ceased to exist. Since the completion of the mutual‑to‑stock conversion, the Company has not engaged in any significant business activity other than owning the common stock of, and having deposits in, Equitable Bank. Our executive office is located at 113 North Locust Street, Grand Island, Nebraska, and our telephone number at that address is (308) 382‑3136. Equitable Bank
 Equitable Bank is a Nebraska‑based community bank that traces its roots to 1882, when Grand Island Building and Loan Association was chartered by the State of Nebraska as a mutual building and loan association. This building and loan association was converted to a federally chartered savings association in 1992. At that time, it adopted the name of “The Equitable Building and Loan Association of Grand Island, Nebraska, A Federal Savings Bank.” Our present name was adopted in 2005. We operate our business through our main office in Grand Island, Nebraska, one full‑service branch in each of Grand Island, North Platte and Omaha, Nebraska and one additional limited service branch in Grand Island. We believe our locations are strategically positioned within the State of Nebraska along the Interstate 80 corridor, from the eastern‑most point of that corridor in Omaha, through Nebraska’s fourth largest city in Grand Island, and to the largest city in the western part of that corridor in North Platte.
 We are engaged primarily in the business of attracting deposits from the general public and using those funds to originate commercial loans, agricultural loans and one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans. To a lesser extent, we also originate home equity loans, construction and land loans and consumer loans. We invest a portion of our assets in securities issued by the U.S. Government and its agencies, U.S. government‑sponsored enterprises and state and municipal governments. We also invest in mortgage‑backed securities primarily issued or guaranteed by U.S. government‑sponsored enterprises. Our principal sources of funds are deposits and principal and interest payments on loans and investments, as well as borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank (“FHLB”) of Topeka. Our principal source of income is from interest income received on loans and investment securities. Our principal expenses are interest paid on deposits and borrowings, employee compensation and benefits, data processing and facilities.
 We also provide retail brokerage services in Grand Island and North Platte, under the name “Equitable Wealth Management.” In the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, we had brokerage fee income of $723,000. At June 30, 2017, our brokerage business had approximately $151.6 million in assets under management.
 Equitable Bank is subject to extensive regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) and is a member of the FHLB System.
 Equitable Bank’s main office is located at 113 North Locust Street, Grand Island, Nebraska and the telephone number at that address is (308) 382‑3136.

 Market Area
 We are headquartered in Grand Island, Nebraska in Hall County. In addition to our main office, we also operate an additional full service facility and a limited service facility in Grand Island, Nebraska. We also provide retail brokerage services in Grand Island and North Platte, Nebraska under the company name of Equitable Wealth Management. In the beginning of 2005, our Board of Directors made the strategic decision to expand into other select markets in Nebraska. As a result, we now operate one full service location, which includes Equitable Wealth Management, in North Platte, and one full service location in Omaha. All of these cities are connected by Interstate 80, which runs across central Nebraska. The region in which our current offices are located was once dominated by agriculture, but now consists of a diverse blend of industries, urban centers and significant corporate investment.
 Historically, we have considered Grand Island and the surrounding communities in Hall County as our primary market area. With the fourth largest population in Nebraska, Grand Island is a regional population and employment center for central Nebraska. Grand Island has a diverse employment base and serves as a center for agriculture, manufacturing, healthcare, tourism, retail and other related industries. The surrounding communities in Hall County are primarily rural and have an agriculture‑based economy.
 Omaha is the leading urban market in Nebraska, located in eastern Nebraska. Omaha, which is Nebraska’s largest city, is a leader in the central United States in the insurance, telecommunications and transportation industries. North Platte, located in central‑western Nebraska, has an economy primarily based on agriculture and the transportation industry.
 Competition
 We face significant competition for the attraction of deposits and origination of loans. Our most direct competition for deposits has historically come from the several financial institutions operating in our market areas and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service companies such as brokerage firms, credit unions and insurance companies. We also face competition for investors’ funds from money market funds, mutual funds and other corporate and government securities. At June 30, 2017, which is the most recent date for which data is available from the FDIC, we held approximately 5.6% of the deposits in Hall County, which was the fifth largest market share out of the fifteen financial institutions with offices in Hall County. Banks owned by large bank holding companies also operate in our market areas. These institutions are significantly larger than us and, therefore, have significantly greater resources.
 Our competition for loans comes primarily from financial institutions in our market areas, and, to a lesser extent, from other financial service providers such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers. Competition for loans also comes from non‑depository financial service companies in the mortgage market, such as insurance companies, securities companies and specialty finance companies.

 We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. Technological advances, for example, have lowered the barriers to market entry, allowed banks and other lenders to expand their geographic reach by providing services over the Internet and made it possible for non‑depository institutions to offer products and services that traditionally have been provided by banks. Changes in federal law permit affiliation among banks, securities firms and insurance companies, which promotes a competitive environment in the financial services industry. Competition for deposits and the origination of loans could limit our future growth.
 Lending Activities
 General. Our principal lending activity is to originate commercial operating loans, commercial real estate loans, agricultural operating loans, agricultural real estate loans and one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans. To a lesser extent, we also originate home equity loans, construction and land loans and consumer loans. As a long‑standing community lender, we believe that our knowledge of our communities allows us to compete effectively in commercial, agricultural and residential lending by emphasizing superior customer service and local underwriting, which we believe differentiates us from larger commercial banks in our market areas.

  Commercial—Operating Loans. At June 30, 2017, approximately $20.1 million, or 8.4% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial operating loans, including commercial lines of credit and term loans. Our commercial lines of credit are generally used by our customers to finance short‑term working capital needs, like accounts receivable and inventory. Our commercial lines of credit generally are priced on an adjustable‑rate basis and may be secured or unsecured. We generally obtain personal guarantees with all commercial lines of credit. Business assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, equipment, furniture and fixtures may be used to secure lines of credit. Our lines of credit typically have a maximum term of 12 months. Our commercial term loans are generally used by our customers to fund longer‑term borrowing needs, such as purchasing equipment, property improvements or other fixed assets. We typically fix the maturity of a term loan to correspond to 80% of the useful life of any equipment purchased or 7 years, whichever is less. Term loans can be secured with a variety of collateral, including business assets such as equipment, furniture, fixtures or real estate.
 At June 30, 2017, our largest lending relationship for commercial operating loans involved total loan balances of $996,000 and was secured by stock and business assets.  At June 30, 2017, the borrower in this relationship was performing in accordance with the required repayment terms.
 Borrowers of commercial operating loans are required to supply current financial statements and tax returns. Additionally, some borrowers are required to produce cash flow projections which are updated on an annual basis. In addition, on larger loans, the loan officer responsible for the loan and/or our in‑house evaluator will perform an annual site visit, obtain financial statements and perform a financial review of the loan.
 Unlike one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans, which we generally originate on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, we typically originate commercial operating loans on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business or rental income produced by the property. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial operating loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business or rental property itself and the general economic environment. Therefore, commercial operating loans that we originate generally have greater credit risk than the one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans that we originate or, generally, consumer loans. In addition, commercial loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts.

 Commercial—Real Estate Loans. At June 30, 2017, approximately $86.8 million, or 36.2% of our loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans. Our commercial real estate loans are secured primarily by office buildings, retail buildings, owner‑occupied offices, apartment buildings and developed lots. At June 30, 2017, our commercial real estate loans had an average loan balance of approximately $333,000. At June 30, 2017, our largest lending relationship for commercial real estate loans involved total loan balances of $4.9 million and was secured by commercial retail buildings.  At June 30, 2017, the borrower in this relationship was performing in accordance with the required repayment terms.
 We offer both fixed‑rate and adjustable‑rate commercial real estate loans to our customers. At the present time, a large number of our customers are selecting a five‑year fixed‑rate loan product with a balloon payment due after five years. As a result, at June 30, 2017, 69.3% of our commercial real estate loans had fixed interest rates. The rates on our adjustable‑rate commercial real estate loans are generally tied to a variety of indices including the prime interest rate as reported in The Wall Street Journal. A portion of our commercial real estate loans represent permanent financing for borrowers who have completed real estate construction for which we previously provided construction financing.
 In underwriting commercial real estate loans, we generally lend up to 70% of the property’s appraised value. We base our decisions to lend on the economic viability of the property and the creditworthiness of the borrower. In evaluating a proposed commercial real estate loan, we emphasize the ratio of the property’s projected net cash flow to the loan’s debt service requirement (generally requiring a minimum ratio of 1.25 times), computed after deduction for a vacancy factor and property expenses we deem appropriate. Personal guarantees are obtained from commercial real estate borrowers. We require title insurance insuring the priority of our lien, fire and extended coverage casualty insurance, and, if appropriate, flood insurance, in order to protect our security interest in the underlying property.
 Commercial real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans. Commercial real estate loans, however, entail additional credit risks compared to one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, the payment of loans secured by income‑producing properties typically depends on the successful operation of the related real estate project, and thus may be subject to a greater extent to adverse conditions in the real estate market and in the general economy.
 We consider a number of factors in originating commercial real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service). All commercial real estate loans are appraised by outside independent appraisers approved by the Board of Directors or by internal evaluations, where permitted by regulation. Personal guarantees generally are obtained from the principals of commercial real estate loans.
 Agricultural—Operating Loans. At June 30, 2017, approximately $26.7 million, or 11.2% of our loan portfolio, consisted of agricultural operating loans. These loans include seasonal crop operating loans that are used to fund the borrower’s crop production operating expenses; livestock operating and revolving loans used to purchase livestock for resale and related livestock production expense; and loans used to finance the purchase of machinery, equipment and breeding stock. Agricultural operating loans are originated at an adjustable‑ or fixed‑rate of interest and generally for a term of up to 12 months. In the case of agricultural operating loans secured by breeding livestock and/or farm equipment, such loans are originated at fixed rates of interest for a term of up to five years. At June 30, 2017, the average outstanding principal balance of our agricultural operating loans was approximately $107,000, excluding lines of credit with zero balances at this date.
 At June 30, 2017, our largest lending relationship for agricultural operating loans involved total loan balances of $3.4 million and was secured by cattle. At June 30, 2017, the borrower in this relationship was performing in accordance with the required repayment terms.

 Borrowers of agricultural operating loans are required to supply current financial statements and tax returns. Additionally, some borrowers are required to produce cash flow projections which are updated on an annual basis. In addition, on larger loans, the loan officer responsible for the loan and/or our in‑house evaluator will perform an annual site visit, obtain financial statements and perform a financial review of the loan.
 Unlike one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans, which we generally originate on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, we typically originate agricultural operating loans on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s agricultural business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of agricultural operating loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. Therefore, agricultural operating loans that we originate generally have greater credit risk than the one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans that we originate or, generally, consumer loans. In addition, agricultural operating loans often result in larger outstanding balances to single borrowers, or related groups of borrowers, and also generally require substantially greater evaluation and oversight efforts.
 Our agricultural operating loans present an additional risk, as a significant number of our borrowers with these types of loans may qualify for relief under 11 U.S.C. Section 1201 et seq. of the United States Bankruptcy Code (generally known as Chapter 12‑Adjustment of Debts of a Family Farmer or Fisherman with Regular Annual Income) (“Chapter 12”). Chapter 12, which was enacted by the United States Congress in response to the recession in agriculture in 1986, is designed specifically for the reorganization of financial obligations of family farmers.
 Pursuant to Chapter 12, a family farmer may be permitted through an order of the Bankruptcy Court to modify a loan with Equitable Bank without the consent of Equitable Bank, including the following types of modifications: (1) the sale of a portion of the property that serves as collateral for a loan (typically grain or livestock) and the use of the cash proceeds for the borrower’s operating expenses (which reduces the overall value of the Bank’s collateral securing the loan); (2) non‑payment by the borrower of unsecured indebtedness; (3) a reduction in the amount of the loan to the current fair market value of secured property; (4) establishing a repayment schedule which extends the original repayment schedule for the loan; and (5) establishing a lower interest rate on the unpaid balance of the loan. Although we have had exposure to Chapter 12 since its enactment, we never have had a loan that we were required to modify involuntarily under Chapter 12.
 Agricultural—Real Estate Loans. At June 30, 2017, approximately $31.1 million, or 13.0% of our loan portfolio consisted of agricultural real estate loans, which are loans to finance the acquisition, development or refinancing of agricultural real estate. We consider a number of factors in originating agricultural real estate loans. We evaluate the qualifications and financial condition of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value and condition of the agricultural property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, we consider the financial resources of the borrower, the borrower’s experience in owning or managing similar property and the borrower’s payment history with us and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors we consider include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value of the mortgaged property and the debt service coverage ratio (the ratio of net operating income to debt service).
 We offer both fixed‑rate and adjustable‑rate agricultural real estate loans to our customers. At the present time, a large number of our customers are selecting a five‑year fixed‑rate loan product with a balloon payment due after five years. As a result, at June 30, 2017, 32.9% of our agricultural real estate loans had fixed rates of interest. Generally, our agricultural real estate loans amortize over periods not in excess of 20 years and have a loan‑to‑value ratio of 50%, although we will originate such loans with a maximum loan‑to‑value ratio of 65%. In recent years, with the price of the agricultural real estate in our market area, consistent with our conservative underwriting practices, the loan‑to‑value ratio on the majority of our agricultural real estate loans has not exceeded 50%.
 We also originate agricultural real estate loans directly and through programs sponsored by the Farmers Home Administration, an agency of the United States Department of Agriculture (“FmHA”), which provides a partial guarantee on loans underwritten to FmHA standards.

 Agricultural real estate loans generally carry higher interest rates and have shorter terms than one‑to‑four‑family residential real estate loans. Agricultural real estate loans, however, entail additional credit risks compared to one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans, as they typically involve larger loan balances concentrated with single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, payments on agricultural real estate loans are dependent on the successful operation or management of the farm property securing the loan. The success of the loan may also be affected by many factors outside the control of the borrower.
 Weather presents one of the greatest risks to agricultural real estate lending as hail, drought, floods, or other conditions, can severely limit crop yields and thus impair loan repayments and the value of the underlying collateral. This risk can be reduced by the farmer with a variety of insurance coverages which can help to ensure loan repayment. For instance, we generally require farmers to obtain multi‑peril crop insurance coverage through a program partially subsidized by the Federal government. Grain and livestock prices also present a risk as prices may decline prior to sale resulting in a failure to cover production costs. These risks may be reduced by the farmer with the use of futures contracts or options to mitigate price risk. Another risk is the uncertainty of government programs and other regulations. During periods of low commodity prices, the income from government programs can be a significant source of cash to make loan payments and if these programs are discontinued or significantly changed, cash flow problems or defaults could result. Finally, many farms are dependent on a limited number of key individuals upon whose injury or death may result in an inability to successfully operate the farm.
 At June 30, 2017 our largest lending relationship for agricultural real estate loans involved total loan balances of $3.8 million. At June 30, 2017, the borrower in this relationship was performing in accordance with the required repayment terms.
 Like our agricultural operating loans, our agricultural real estate loans present the additional risks associated with Chapter 12 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. See “Agricultural—Operating Loans” above for additional information regarding Chapter 12.
 Residential Real Estate—One‑ to Four‑Family Loans. Historically, our primary lending consisted of originating one‑ to four‑family, owner‑occupied residential real estate loans, substantially all of which were secured by properties located in our market areas. Over the past several years, we have begun to shift our lending focus towards originating commercial and agricultural operating and real estate loans. Nevertheless, at June 30, 2017, approximately $43.1 million, or 18.0% of our loan portfolio, consisted of one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans.
 A portion of the housing stock in our market areas is comprised of two‑, three‑ and four‑unit properties, all of which are classified as one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans. At June 30, 2017, of the $43.1 million of one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans in our portfolio, $26.1 million, or 60.6% of this amount, were comprised of non‑owner occupied properties.
 The average loan balance of one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans held in our portfolio at June 30, 2017 was $79,000 and our largest outstanding balance at that date was $1.8 million which was secured by non-owner occupied residential properties located in Grand Island, Nebraska. At June 30, 2017, this loan was performing in accordance with it repayment terms.
 We currently offer one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans with terms up to 30 years that are generally underwritten according to Freddie Mac (“FHLMC”) guidelines, and we refer to loans that conform to such guidelines as “conforming loans.” We generally originate both fixed‑ and adjustable‑rate mortgage loans in amounts up to the maximum conforming loan limits as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which as of June 30, 2017 was generally $424,100 for single‑family homes in our market area. We generally sell our one‑ to four‑family residential fixed‑rate real estate loans in the secondary market.
 Our fixed‑rate one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans include loans that generally amortize on a monthly basis over periods between 10 to 30 years. Fixed rate one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans often remain outstanding for significantly shorter periods than their contractual terms because borrowers have the right to 

 
  9

 

refinance or prepay their loans. At June 30, 2017, 48.9% of the one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans held in our portfolio (and not sold in the secondary market) were fixed‑rate loans.
 Our adjustable‑rate one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans generally consist of loans with initial interest rates fixed for one, three, or five years, and annual adjustments thereafter are indexed based on changes in the one‑year United States Treasury bill constant maturity rate. Our adjustable‑rate mortgage loans generally have an interest rate adjustment limit of 200 basis points per adjustment, with a maximum lifetime interest rate adjustment limit of 500 basis points. In the current low interest rate environment, we have not originated a significant dollar amount of adjustable‑rate mortgage loans.
 Although adjustable‑rate one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans may reduce, to an extent, our vulnerability to changes in market interest rates because they periodically re‑price, as interest rates increase, the required payments due from the borrower also increase (subject to rate caps), increasing the potential for default by the borrower. At the same time, the ability of the borrower to repay the loan and the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. Upward adjustments of the contractual interest rate are also limited by our maximum periodic and lifetime rate adjustments.
 Regulations limit the amount we may lend relative to the appraised value of the real estate securing the loan, as determined by an appraisal of the property at the time the loan is originated. For borrowers who do not obtain private mortgage insurance (“PMI”), our lending policies limit the maximum loan‑to‑value ratio on both fixed‑rate and adjustable‑rate mortgage loans to 80% of the appraised value of the collateralized property, with the exception for a limited use product which allows for loans up to 90% with no PMI. For most one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans with loan‑to‑value ratios of between 80% and 95%, we require the borrower to obtain PMI. For first mortgage loan products, we require the borrower to obtain title insurance. We also require homeowners’ insurance, fire and casualty, and, if necessary, flood insurance on properties securing real estate loans. We do not offer, and have never offered or invested in, one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans specifically designed for borrowers with sub‑prime credit scores, including interest‑only, negative amortization or payment option adjustable‑rate mortgage loans.
 Residential Real Estate—Home Equity Loans. At June 30, 2017, home equity loans totaled approximately $11.7 million, or 4.9% of our loan portfolio, and are made up of lines of credit secured by owner‑occupied and non‑owner occupied one‑ to four‑family residences and second and third real estate mortgage loans. At June 30, 2017, the total unused commitments with respect to our home equity loans were $4.8 million. The average outstanding home equity loan balance at June 30, 2017 was $36,000 and our largest outstanding home equity loan balance at that date was $645,000, which was secured by residential property located in Grand Island, Nebraska. At June 30, 2017, this loan was performing in accordance with it repayment terms.
 Home equity loans and home equity lines of credit are generally underwritten using the same criteria that we use to underwrite one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans. We typically originate home equity loans and home equity lines of credit on the basis of the applicant’s credit history, an assessment of the applicant’s ability to meet existing obligations and payments on the proposed loan and the value of the collateral securing the loan. Home equity loans are offered with fixed and adjustable interest rates. Lines of credit also are offered with fixed and adjustable rates, which generally are indexed to the prime rate, and with a draw period up to five years. The loan‑to‑value ratio for our home equity loans is generally limited to 85% when combined with the first security lien, if applicable. The loan to value of our home equity lines of credit are generally limited to 85%, unless we hold the first mortgage. If we hold the first mortgage, we will permit a loan to value of up to 90% and adjust the interest rate and underwriting standards to compensate for the additional risk.
 For all first lien position mortgage loans, we utilize outside independent appraisers. For second position mortgage loans where we also hold the existing first mortgage, we will use the lesser of the existing appraisal used in underwriting the first mortgage or assessed value. For all other second mortgage loans, we will use a third‑party service which gathers all data from real property tax offices and gives the property a low, middle and high value, together with similar properties for comparison. The middle value from the third‑party service will be the value used in underwriting. If the valuation method for the loan amount requested does not provide a value, or the value is not sufficient to support the loan request and it is determined that the borrower(s) is(are) credit worthy, a full appraisal will be ordered.

 Home equity loans have greater risk than one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans secured by first‑position mortgages or deeds of trust. We face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of foreclosure, after repayment of the senior mortgages, if applicable. When customers default on their loans, we attempt to work out the relationship in order to avoid foreclosure because the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers. Moreover, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect our ability to fully recover the loan balance in the event of a default.
 Other—Construction and Land Loans. At June 30, 2017, construction and land loans totaled approximately $16.2 million, or 6.8% of our loan portfolio. We originate loans to individuals and, to a lesser extent, builders to finance the construction of residential dwellings. We also make construction loans for commercial development projects, including apartment buildings, restaurants, motels, shopping centers and owner‑occupied properties used for businesses. The average outstanding construction loan balance at June 30, 2017 was $330,000. Our largest lending relationship for construction loans at that date involved a $3.5 million commitment with nothing outstanding at June 30, 2017, which was secured by apartment buildings. At June 30, 2017, the borrower in this relationship was performing in accordance with the required repayment terms.
 Our construction loans generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase, which is usually 12 months for residential properties and 12 to 18 months for commercial properties. At the end of the construction phase, the loan generally converts to a permanent mortgage loan. Loans generally can be made with a maximum loan to value ratio of 80% on residential construction and 70% on commercial construction at the time the loan is originated. Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, we require an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. We also will require an inspection of the property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan.
 Other—Consumer Loans. We are authorized to make loans for a variety of personal and consumer purposes. As of June 30, 2017, consumer loans totaled approximately $3.7 million, or 1.5% of our loan portfolio, and consisted primarily of automobile, recreational vehicles and unsecured personal loans, as well as unsecured lines of credit and loans secured by deposit accounts. As of June 30, 2017, approximately $168,000 of our consumer loans were unsecured. The average outstanding consumer loan balance at June 30, 2017 was $6,000 and our largest outstanding consumer loan balance at that date was $65,000, which is secured by an automobile. At June 30, 2017, this loan was performing in accordance with it repayment terms.
 Our procedure for underwriting consumer loans includes an assessment of the applicant’s credit history and ability to meet existing obligations and payments of the proposed loan, as well as an evaluation of the value of the collateral security, if any.
 Consumer loans generally entail greater risk than one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans, particularly in the case of loans that are unsecured or are secured by assets that tend to depreciate in value, such as automobiles. As a result, consumer loan collections are primarily dependent on the borrower’s continuing financial stability and thus are more likely to be adversely affected by job loss, divorce, illness or personal bankruptcy. In these cases, repossessed collateral for a defaulted consumer loan may not provide an adequate source of repayment for the outstanding loan, and the remaining value often does not warrant further substantial collection efforts against the borrower.
 Loan Originations, Purchases, Sales and Servicing. We benefit from a number of sources for our loan originations, including existing customers, borrowers, builders, real estate broker referrals, attorneys, and “walk‑in” customers. We also advertise in newspapers that are widely circulated in our market areas of Grand Island, North Platte and Omaha. Our loan origination activity may be affected adversely by a rising interest rate environment which may result in decreased loan demand. Other factors, such as the overall health of the local economy and competition from other financial institutions, can also impact our loan originations. Although we originate both fixed‑rate and adjustable‑rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon borrower demand, market interest rates, borrower preference for fixed‑versus adjustable‑rate loans, and the interest rates offered on each type of loan by other lenders in our market area. These lenders include commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions, and mortgage 

 
  11

 

banking companies that also actively compete for local real estate loans. Accordingly, the volume of loan originations may vary from period to period.
 The majority of the fixed rate residential loans that are originated each year meet the underwriting guidelines established by FHLMC. We sell the majority of originations of residential real estate loans into the secondary market. We continue to service them once they are sold. We sold 187 and 190 one‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 From time to time, we also purchase loan participations in which we are not the lead lender. In these circumstances, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies. At June 30, 2017, we had 9 purchased loan participations for which we were not the lead lender, which totaled $9.5 million. All purchased loan participations were performing in accordance with their terms at June 30, 2017. 
 From time to time, we also sell loan participations in which we remain the lead lender. Participations are sold primarily when the total loan amount exceeds our legal lending limit or concentration limit. At June 30, 2017, we had 14 sold loan participations for which we remained the lead lender. The participated loans totaled $30.0 million, of which $8.0 million was retained by us and $22.0 million was sold to other financial institutions.
 The following table shows our loan origination, purchase and repayment activities for the periods indicated.

  Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Equitable Bank’s lending activities follow written, non‑discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination policies established by management and the Board of Directors. Our policies are designed to provide loan officers with guidelines on acceptable levels of risk, given a broad range of factors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan, the viability of the loan and the adequacy of the value of the property that will secure the loan, if applicable.
 The Board of Directors grants loan officers individual lending authority to approve extensions of credit. The level of authority for loan officers varies based upon the loan type, total relationship, form of collateral and risk rating of 

 
  12

 

the borrower. Each loan officer is charged with the responsibility of achieving high credit standards. Individual lending authority can be increased, suspended or removed by the Board of Directors, as recommended by the President or Chief Lending Officer.
 If a loan relationship is in excess of any individual loan officer’s lending authority, the extension of credit must be referred to the Branch Loan Committee for each market, which consists of all loan officers of that branch. Each Branch Loan Committee can approve loan relationships up to $500,000. Loan relationships over $500,000 are referred to our Senior Loan Committee, which consists of all Market Presidents and our Chief Executive Officer. The Senior Loan Committee has the authority to approve loan relationships up to $750,000. Loan relationships above $750,000 are referred to the Executive Committee of the Board of Directors or the entire Board of Directors. The Executive Committee or the entire Board of Directors must approve all loans over the limits described above. In addition, the Executive Committee ratifies all consumer loan relationships over $100,000 and all commercial loan relationships over $500,000.
 In some instances for all loan types, it may be appropriate to originate or purchase loans that are exceptions to the guidelines and limits established within the lending policy described above and below. In general, exceptions to the lending policy do not significantly deviate from the guidelines and limits established within the lending policy and, if there are exceptions, they are clearly noted as such and specifically identified in loan approval documents.
 Loans to One Borrower. Federal savings banks are subject to the same loans‑to‑one‑borrower limits as those applicable to national banks, which restrict loans to one borrower to an amount equal to 15% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus on an unsecured basis, and an additional amount equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral (generally, financial instruments and bullion, but not real estate). At June 30, 2017, our lending limit was $4.6 million and $7.7 million for loans secured by readily marketable collateral. At June 30, 2017, our largest lending relationship to one borrower totaled $4.6 million, which was secured by commercial retail buildings and performing in accordance with its repayment terms as of June 30, 2017. Our second largest lending relationship at June 30, 2017 was $4.4 million and is secured by commercial real estate. This lending relationship also was performing in accordance with its terms at June 30, 2017.
 Asset Quality
 Loan Delinquencies and Collection Procedures. When a loan becomes delinquent, we make attempts to contact the borrower to determine the cause of the delayed payments and seek a reasonable solution to permit the loan to be brought current within a reasonable period of time. The outcome can vary with each individual borrower. In the case of mortgage loans and consumer loans, a late notice is sent 15 days after an account becomes delinquent. If delinquency persists, notices are sent at the 30 day delinquency mark, the 45 day delinquency mark and the 60 day delinquency mark. After 15 days, we attempt to establish telephone contact with the borrower. In the case of mortgage loans, included in every late notice is a letter that includes information regarding home‑ownership counseling. As part of a workout agreement, we will accept partial payments during the month in order to bring the account current. If attempts to reach an agreement are unsuccessful and the customer is unable to comply with the terms of the workout agreement, we will review the account to determine if foreclosure is warranted, in which case, consistent with Nebraska law, we send a 90 day notice of foreclosure and then a 30 day notice before legal proceedings are commenced. A consumer final demand letter is sent in the case of a consumer loan. In the case of commercial loans and commercial mortgage loans, we follow a similar notification practice with the exception of the previously mentioned information on home‑ownership counseling. In addition, commercial loans do not require 90 day notices of foreclosure. Generally, commercial borrowers only receive 10 day notices before legal proceedings can be commenced. Commercial loans may experience longer workout times which may trigger a need for a loan modification that could meet the requirements of a troubled debt restructured loan.
 Impaired and Non‑Performing Loans. A loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. 
 A loan is non‑performing when it is greater than 90 days past due. Some loans may be included in both categories, whereas other loans may only be included in one category. Specific allocations are made for loans that are determined to 

 
  13

 

be impaired. Our policy requires that all non‑homogeneous loans past due greater than 90 days be classified as impaired and non‑performing. However, loans past due less than 90 days may also be classified as impaired when management does not expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured by determining the present value of expected future cash flows or, for collateral‑dependent loans, the fair value of the collateral adjusted for market conditions and selling expenses as compared to the loan carrying value.
 As of June 30, 2017, our total non‑accrual loans were $2.4 million, or 1.00% of total loans, compared to $1.8 million, or 0.90% of total loans, at June 30, 2016. At June 30, 2017, our largest non‑accrual loan was a commercial real estate loan with an outstanding balance of $641,000.
 Troubled Debt Restructurings. Troubled debt restructurings are loan restructurings in which we, for economic or legal reasons related to an existing borrower’s financial difficulties, grant a concession to the debtor that we would not otherwise consider. Typically, a troubled debt restructuring involves a modification of terms of a debt, such as reduction of the stated interest rate for the remaining original life of the debt or extension of the maturity date. We consider modifications only after analyzing the borrower’s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and that is in our best interests. No additional loan commitments were outstanding to our troubled debt restructured borrowers at June 30, 2017.
 The following table sets forth our troubled debt restructurings by concession type and amount at the dates indicated:

 | At June 30, |

  Loans on non‑accrual status at the date of modification are initially classified as non‑accrual troubled debt restructurings. At June 30, 2017, we had $2.1 million in non‑accruing troubled debt restructurings. Our policy provides that troubled debt restructured loans are returned to accrual status after a period of satisfactory and reasonable future payment performance under the terms of the restructuring. Satisfactory payment performance is generally no less than six consecutive months of timely payments and demonstrated ability to continue to repay. At June 30, 2017 and 2016, we had $2.5 million and $3.1 million in accruing troubled debt restructurings, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, no loans that were modified as troubled debt restructurings within the previous twelve months defaulted after their restructure.

 Foreclosed assets. Foreclosed assets consist of property acquired through formal foreclosure, in‑substance foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, and are recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell, establishing a new cost basis. Write‑downs to fair value, which are required at the time of foreclosure, are charged to the allowance for loan losses. After transfer, adjustments to the carrying value of the properties that result from subsequent declines in value are charged to operations in the period in which the declines occur. Subsequent to foreclosure, valuations are updated periodically and assets are marked to current fair value, not to exceed the initial cost basis. In the determination of fair value subsequent to foreclosure, management also considers other factors or recent developments, such as, changes in absorption rates and market conditions from the time of valuation and anticipated sales values considering management’s plans for disposition. Either change could result in adjustment to lower the property value estimates indicated in the appraisals.
 For the year ended June 30, 2017, no loans were transferred into foreclosed assets. For the year ended June 30, 2016, one loan was transferred to foreclosed assets in the amount of $239,000.  We had $223,000 and $462,000 in foreclosed assets at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively.
 Delinquent Loans. At June 30, 2017, we had one loan for $31 past due 61 days or more and accruing which is unsecured.  At June 30, 2016 we had one loan for $24,000 past due 61 days or more and accruing.  This loan was secured by residential property.  At June 30, 2015, 2014, 2013 we had no loans 61 days or more past due and still accruing. 
 Classified Assets. Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities considered by the OCC to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the insured institution will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific allowance for loan losses is not warranted. Assets that do not currently expose the insured institution to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management.
 When an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover losses that were both probable and reasonable to estimate. General allowances represent allowances which have been established to cover accrued losses associated with lending activities that were both probable and reasonable to estimate, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge‑off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific allowances.
 In connection with the filing of our periodic regulatory reports and in accordance with our classification of assets policy, we continuously assess the quality of our loan portfolio and we regularly review the problem loans in our loan portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. Loans are listed on the “watch list” initially because of emerging financial weaknesses even though the loan is currently performing as agreed, or delinquency status, or if the loan possesses weaknesses although currently performing. Management reviews the status of our loan portfolio delinquencies, by product types, with the full Board of Directors on a monthly basis. Individual classified loan relationships are discussed as warranted. If a loan deteriorates in asset quality, the classification is changed to “special mention,” “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss” depending on the circumstances and the evaluation. Generally, loans 90 days or more past due are placed on nonaccrual status and classified “substandard.”
 We also employ a risk grading system for our loans to help assure that we are not taking unnecessary and/or unmanageable risk. The primary objective of the loan risk grading system is to establish a method of assessing credit risk to further enable management to measure loan portfolio quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses.

  The allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered adequate to provide for losses that can be reasonably anticipated. Management performs a quarterly evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance. The allowance is 

 
  17

 

increased by the provision for loan losses, and decreased by charge‑offs, net of recoveries. Loans deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for loan losses, and subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. All, or part, of the principal balance of loans receivable are charged off to the allowance as soon as it is determined that the repayment of all, or part, of the principal balance is highly unlikely. Non‑residential consumer loans are generally charged off no later than 120 days past due on a contractual basis, unless productive collection efforts are providing results. Consumer loans may be charged off earlier in the event of bankruptcy, or if there is an amount that is deemed uncollectible. No portion of the allowance for loan losses is restricted to any individual loan product and the entire allowance is available to absorb any and all loan losses.
 The allowance is based on two components, which are: (i) specific reserves for impaired loans; and (ii) a general valuation allowance for the remainder of the loan portfolio.
 The first component is the specific reserves that relate to loans that are classified as impaired. For these loans, an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value of the impaired loan are lower than the carrying value of that loan. A loan is considered impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Impairment is measured by either the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan’s effective interest rate or the fair value of the underlying collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. The majority of our loans utilize the fair value of the underlying collateral. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and shortfalls on a case‑by case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length and reason for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record and the amount of shortfall in relation to what is owed. One‑ to four‑family residential real estate loans and consumer installment loans are considered to be homogeneous and, therefore, are not separately evaluated for impairment unless they are considered troubled debt restructurings. A loan is considered to be a troubled debt restructuring when, to maximize the recovery of the loan we modify the borrower’s existing loan terms and conditions in response to financial difficulties experienced by the borrower.
 The second component of the allowance for loan losses is the general valuation allowance. The general valuation allowance is determined by historical loss experience and consideration of a variety of current factors including, but not limited to; levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge‑offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision based on new information as it becomes known. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established which could have a material negative effect on our financial results.
 In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews our allowance for loan losses and may require us to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available at the time of the examination, which may not be currently available to management. Based on management’s comprehensive analysis of the loan portfolio, we believe the current level of the allowance for loan losses is adequate.

 Allocation of the Allowance for Loan Losses. The following table presents our allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans at the periods indicated. Management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis. The allocation of the allowance by category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category.

 Investment Activities
 General. We are permitted under federal law to invest in various types of liquid assets, including U.S. Government obligations, securities of various federal agencies and of state and municipal governments, deposits at the FHLB of Topeka, certificates of deposit at federally insured institutions, certain bankers’ acceptances and federal funds. Within certain regulatory limits, we also may invest a portion of our assets in commercial paper and corporate debt securities. We are also required to maintain an investment in stock of the FHLB of Topeka.
 Securities are categorized as “held to maturity,” “trading” or “available for sale,” based on management’s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security. Debt securities are classified as “held to maturity” and reported in financial statements at amortized cost only if we have the positive intent and ability to hold these securities to maturity. Securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates, changes in the security’s prepayment risk, increases in loan demand, or other similar factors cannot be classified as “held to maturity.”
 Trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded through earnings. We typically do not use a trading account with the intent to purchase and sell securities. Debt and equity securities not classified as “held to maturity” or “trading” are classified as “available for sale.” These securities are reported at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses on the securities are excluded from earnings and reported, net of deferred taxes, as a separate component of equity. None of our securities are classified as trading securities.
 All of our securities carry market risk insofar as increases in market rates of interest may cause a decrease in their fair value. Investments in securities are made based on certain considerations, which include the interest rate, tax considerations, yield, settlement date and maturity of the security, our liquidity position, and anticipated cash needs and sources. The effect that the proposed security would have on our credit and interest rate risk and risk‑based capital is also considered. We purchase securities to provide necessary liquidity for day‑to‑day operations, and when investable funds exceed loan demand.
 Generally, our investment policy is to invest funds in various categories of securities and maturities based upon our liquidity needs, asset/liability management policies, investment quality, marketability and performance objectives. The Board of Directors reviews our securities portfolio on a monthly basis.
 Securities classified as held to maturity totaled $736,000 at June 30, 2017; $136,000 of this amount was mortgage‑backed securities. At June 30, 2017, we had securities classified as available for sale of $1.4 million at amortized cost, of which $440,000 were mortgage‑backed securities. Mortgage‑backed securities are discussed below. 
 We also have a $453,000 investment in FHLB of Topeka stock at June 30, 2017, which is classified separately from securities due to the restrictions on sale or transfer. For further information regarding our securities portfolio, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.
 Municipal Obligations. At June 30, 2017, our municipal securities portfolio totaled $600,000 and was comprised of taxable bonds issued by cities and other political subdivisions in Nebraska. At June 30, 2017, all of our municipal securities were classified as held to maturity. At this date, none of these securities had maturities of more than 10 years.
 Mortgage‑Backed Securities. Mortgage‑backed securities represent a participation interest in a pool of one‑ to four‑family or multi‑family mortgages. The mortgage originators use intermediaries (generally U.S. government agencies and government‑sponsored enterprises) to pool and repackage the participation interests in the form of securities, with investors such as Equitable Bank receiving the principal and interest payments on the mortgages. Such U.S. government agencies and government sponsored enterprises guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors.
 Mortgage‑backed securities are typically issued with stated principal amounts, and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that are within a specific range and have varying maturities. The characteristics of the underlying pool of mortgages, i.e., fixed‑rate or adjustable‑rate, as well as prepayment risk, are 

 
  20

 

passed on to the certificate holder. The life of a mortgage‑backed pass‑through security thus approximates the life of the underlying mortgages. Our mortgage‑backed securities consist of Ginnie Mae securities.
 At June 30, 2017, mortgage‑backed securities represented 0.2% of our total assets, of which $442,000 were available for sale and $136,000 were held to maturity. At June 30, 2017, $578,000, or 100% of our mortgage‑backed securities had fixed rates of interest. During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 there was no purchases of mortgage-back securities.  During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016 one mortgage-back security was purchased for approximately $469,000.
 Mortgage‑backed securities generally yield less than the mortgage loans underlying such securities because of their payment guarantees or credit enhancements, which offer nominal credit risk to the security holder. In addition, mortgage‑backed securities are more liquid than individual mortgage loans and we may use them to collateralize borrowings or other obligations of Equitable Bank.
 U.S. Government-sponsored agency. At June 30, 2017, the carrying value of our portfolio of United States Government-sponsored agency securities totaled $969,000 and were all classified as available-for-sale.  While these securities generally provide lower yields than other investments in our securities portfolio, we maintain these investments, to the extent appropriate for liquidity purposes, for pledging for public funds deposits.

  Sources of Funds
 General. Deposits have traditionally been our primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. We also rely on advances from the FHLB of Topeka and Promontory Products as a form of brokered deposits. In addition to deposits and borrowings, we derive funds from scheduled loan payments, investment maturities, loan prepayments, retained earnings and income on interest earning assets. While scheduled loan payments and income on interest earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing market interest rates, economic conditions and competition from other financial institutions.
 Deposits. A majority of our depositors are persons or businesses who work or reside or operate in Hall, Lincoln and Douglas Counties in Nebraska. We offer a selection of deposit products, including checking, savings, money market deposit accounts, and certificates of deposit. Deposit account terms vary, with the principal differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. We establish interest rates, maturity terms, service fees and withdrawal penalties on a periodic basis. Management determines the rates and terms based on rates paid by competitors, our need for funds or liquidity, overall growth goals and federal and state regulations. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in interest rates and competition. The variety of deposit accounts that we offer allows us to be competitive in generating deposits and to respond with flexibility to changes in our customers’ demands. We believe that deposits are a stable source of funds, but our ability to attract and maintain deposits at favorable rates will be affected by market conditions, including competition and prevailing interest rates.
 The Promontory network is a form of brokered deposit program. In addition to offering depositors enhanced FDIC insurance coverage, being a participant in the Promontory network allows us to fund our balance sheet through CDARS’ One‑Way Buy program. This program uses a competitive bid process for available deposits at specified terms. These deposits work well for us because of their weekly availability, coupled with their short term, which allows us to more closely mirror our funding needs. We believe this arrangement is a viable source of funding provided that we maintain our “well‑capitalized” status. Brokered deposit holdings are limited to 10% of reported total assets or $25.4 million as of June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2017, brokered deposits totaled $6.4 million (all of which are in products with the Promontory network). At June 30, 2017, we had $46.1 million in total time deposits.

 Supervision and Regulation
 General
 Equitable Bank, as a federal savings association, is currently subject to extensive regulation, examination and supervision by the OCC, as its primary federal regulator, and by the FDIC as the insurer of its deposits. Equitable Bank is a member of the FHLB System and its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Equitable Bank must file reports with the OCC concerning its activities and financial condition in addition to obtaining regulatory approvals before entering into certain transactions such as mergers with, or acquisitions of, other financial institutions. There are periodic examinations by the OCC to evaluate Equitable Bank’s safety and soundness and compliance with various regulatory requirements. This regulatory structure is intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and depositors. The regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies, including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of an adequate allowance for loan losses for regulatory purposes. Any change in such policies, whether by the OCC, the FDIC or Congress, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and Equitable Bank and their operations.
 The Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd‑Frank Act”) made extensive changes to the regulation of Equitable Bank. Under the Dodd‑Frank Act, the Office of Thrift Supervision was eliminated and responsibility for the supervision and regulation of federal savings associations such as Equitable Bank was transferred to the OCC on July 21, 2011. The OCC is the agency that is primarily responsible for the regulation and supervision of national banks. Additionally, the Dodd‑Frank Act created a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as an independent bureau of the Federal Reserve Board. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau assumed responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations and has authority to impose new requirements. However, institutions of less than $10 billion in assets, such as Equitable Bank, will continue to be examined for compliance with consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations by, and be subject to the enforcement authority of, their prudential regulators.
 Certain of the regulatory requirements that are applicable to Equitable Bank and the Company are described below. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete explanation of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Equitable Bank and the Company.
 Federal Banking Regulation
 Business Activities. The activities of federal savings banks, such as Equitable Bank, are governed by federal laws and regulations. Those laws and regulations delineate the nature and extent of the business activities in which federal savings banks may engage. In particular, certain lending authority for federal savings banks, e.g., commercial, non‑residential real property loans and consumer loans, is limited to a specified percentage of the institution’s capital or assets.
 Capital Requirements. On July 9, 2013, the OCC approved rules that amended the regulatory capital rules applicable to Equitable Bank.  The rules implement the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Act.  Various provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act increase the capital requirements of financial institutions.  The rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which became effective January 1, 2015, and refine the definition of what constitutes “capital” for purposes of calculating those ratios.  
     The new minimum capital level requirements applicable to Equitable Bank are:  (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8% (unchanged from prior rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4%.  The rules also established a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios resulting in the following ratios:  (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8.5%; (iii) a total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 10.5%; and, a Tier 1 leverage ratio unchanged at 4%.  The phase-in period for the capital conservation buffer requirement started January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and will increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019.  An institution is subject to further limitations on 

 
  26

 

paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that can be utilized for such actions.
     Prompt Corrective Regulatory Action. Prompt corrective action regulations provide five classifications: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized, although these terms are not used to represent overall financial condition. If adequately capitalized, regulatory approval is required to accept brokered deposits. The OCC is required to take certain supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s degree of undercapitalization. In addition, numerous mandatory supervisory actions become immediately applicable to an undercapitalized institution, including, but not limited to, increased monitoring by regulators and restrictions on growth, capital distributions and expansion. The OCC could also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. Significantly and critically undercapitalized institutions are subject to additional mandatory and discretionary measures.
 Insurance of Deposit Accounts. Equitable Bank’s deposits are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC. Deposit insurance per account owner is currently $250,000. Under the FDIC’s risk‑based assessment system, insured institutions are assigned a risk category based on supervisory evaluations, regulatory capital levels and certain other factors. An institution’s assessment rate depends upon the category to which it is assigned, and certain adjustments specified by FDIC regulations. Institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. The FDIC may adjust the scale uniformly, except that no adjustment can deviate more than two basis points from the base scale without notice and comment. No institution may pay a dividend if in default of the federal deposit insurance assessment.
 The Dodd‑Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity.
 The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. A significant increase in insurance premiums would likely have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Equitable Bank. Management cannot predict what insurance assessment rates will be in the future.
 Loans to One Borrower. Federal law provides that savings associations are generally subject to the limits on loans to one borrower applicable to national banks. Generally, subject to certain exceptions, a savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of its unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by specified readily‑marketable collateral.
 Qualified Thrift Lender Test. Federal law requires savings associations to meet a qualified thrift lender test. Under the test, a savings association is required to either qualify as a “domestic building and loan association” under the Internal Revenue Code or maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” (total assets less: (i) specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets; (ii) intangibles, including goodwill; and (iii) the value of property used to conduct business) in certain “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential real estate loans and related investments, including certain mortgage‑backed securities but also including education, credit card and small business loans) in at least nine months out of each twelve‑month period.
 A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test is subject to certain operating restrictions and the Dodd‑Frank Act also specifies that failing the qualified thrift lender test is a violation of law that could result in an enforcement action and dividend limitations. As of June 30, 2017, Equitable Bank maintained 78.7% of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and, therefore, met the qualified thrift lender test.
 In the future, if our business strategy leads to continued growth in our commercial loan portfolio, we may consider converting Equitable Bank’s charter from that of a savings association to that of a commercial bank. Doing so could allow us to avoid operating restrictions and penalties that can be applied to savings associations which fail to satisfy the qualified thrift lender test.

 Limitation on Capital Distributions. Federal regulations impose limitations upon all capital distributions by a savings association, including cash dividends, payments to repurchase its shares and payments to stockholders of another institution in a cash‑out merger. Under the regulations, an application to and the prior approval of the OCC is required before any capital distribution if the institution does not meet the criteria for “expedited treatment” of applications under OCC regulations (i.e., generally, examination and Community Reinvestment Act ratings in the two top categories), the total capital distributions for the calendar year exceed net income for that year plus the amount of retained net income for the preceding two years, the institution would be undercapitalized following the distribution or the distribution would otherwise be contrary to a statute, regulation or agreement with the OCC. If an application is not required, the institution must still provide 30 days prior written notice to, and receive the nonobjection of, the Federal Reserve Board of the capital distribution if, like Equitable Bank, it is a subsidiary of a holding company, as well as an informational notice filing to the OCC. If Equitable Bank’s capital ever fell below its regulatory requirements or the OCC notified it that it was in need of increased supervision, its ability to make capital distributions could be restricted. In addition, the OCC could prohibit a proposed capital distribution by any institution, which would otherwise be permitted by the regulation, if the OCC determines that such distribution would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice.
 Community Reinvestment Act. All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low‑ and moderate‑income neighborhoods. An institution’s failure to satisfactorily comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could result in denials of regulatory applications. Responsibility for administering the Community Reinvestment Act, unlike other fair lending laws, is not being transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Equitable Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recently completed examination.
 Transactions with Related Parties. Federal law limits Equitable Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with “affiliates” (e.g., any entity that controls or is under common control with Equitable Bank, including the Company and any of its other subsidiaries). The aggregate amount of covered transactions with any individual affiliate is limited to 10% of the capital and surplus of the savings association. The aggregate amount of covered transactions with all affiliates is limited to 20% of the savings association’s capital and surplus. Certain transactions with affiliates are required to be secured by collateral in an amount and of a type specified by federal law. The purchase of low quality assets from affiliates is generally prohibited. Transactions with affiliates must generally be on terms and under circumstances that are at least as favorable to the institution as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non‑affiliated companies. In addition, savings associations are prohibited from lending to any affiliate that is engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and no savings association may purchase the securities of any affiliate other than a subsidiary.
 The Sarbanes‑Oxley Act of 2002 generally prohibits loans by the Company to its executive officers and directors. However, the law contains a specific exception for loans by a depository institution to its executive officers and directors in compliance with federal banking laws. Under such laws, Equitable Bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and 10% stockholders (“insiders”), as well as entities such persons control, is limited. The laws limit both the individual and aggregate amount of loans that Equitable Bank may make to insiders based, in part, on Equitable Bank’s capital level and requires that certain board approval procedures be followed. Such loans are required to be made on terms substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals and not involve more than the normal risk of repayment. There is an exception for loans made pursuant to a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to all employees of the institution and does not give preference to insiders over other employees. Loans to executive officers are subject to additional limitations based on the type of loan involved.
 Enforcement. The OCC currently has primary enforcement responsibility over savings associations and has authority to bring actions against the institution and all institution‑affiliated parties, including stockholders, and any attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful actions likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors to institution of receivership, conservatorship or termination of deposit insurance. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and can amount to $25,000 per day, or even $1.0 million per day in especially egregious cases. The FDIC has the authority to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings association. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC 

 
  28

 

has authority to take such action under certain circumstances. Federal law also establishes criminal penalties for certain violations.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System. Equitable Bank is a member of the FHLB System, which consists of twelve regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The FHLB provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. Equitable Bank, as a member of the FHLB of Topeka, is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in that FHLB of Topeka. Equitable Bank was in compliance with this requirement with an investment in FHLB stock at June 30, 2017 of $453,400.
 Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve Board regulations require savings associations to maintain non‑interest earning reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily Negotiable Order of Withdrawal (NOW) and regular checking accounts). The regulations provided that reserves be maintained against aggregate transaction accounts as follows: a 3% reserve ratio is assessed on net transaction accounts up to and including $115.1 million; a 10% reserve ratio is applied above $115.1 million. The first $15.5 million of otherwise reservable balances (subject to adjustments by the Federal Reserve Board) are exempted from the reserve requirements. The amounts are adjusted annually.  In October 2008, the Federal Reserve Board began paying interest on certain reserve balances.
 Other Regulations
 Equitable Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, including the:

· | Truth‑In‑Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;

 Holding Company Regulation
 General. As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is subject to Federal Reserve Board regulations, examinations, supervision, reporting requirements and regulations regarding its activities. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to Equitable Bank.
 Pursuant to federal law and regulations and policy, a savings and loan holding company such as the Company may generally engage in the activities permitted for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act and certain other activities that have been authorized for savings and loan holding companies by regulation.
 Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company from, directly or indirectly or through one or more subsidiaries, acquiring more than 5% of the voting stock of another savings association, or savings and loan holding company thereof, without prior written approval of the Federal Reserve Board or from acquiring or retaining, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non‑subsidiary holding company or savings association. A savings and loan holding company is also prohibited from acquiring more than 5% of a company engaged in activities other than those authorized by federal law or acquiring or retaining control of a depository institution that is not insured by the FDIC. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings associations, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the insurance funds, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors.
 The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings associations in more than one state, except: (i) the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and (ii) the acquisition of a savings association in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings association specifically permit such acquisitions. The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions.
 Capital Requirements. Savings and loan holding companies historically have not been subject to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. However, in July 2013, the Federal Reserve Board approved a new rule that implements the “Basel III” regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd‑Frank Act. The final rule established consolidated capital requirements for many savings and loan holding companies, including the Company.  In May 2015, the Federal Reserve Board approved a final rule which exempts certain savings and loan holding companies that have total consolidated assets of less than $1 billion from the consolidated capital requirements.  The Company qualifies for this exemption.
 Source of Strength. The Dodd‑Frank Act also extends the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The regulatory agencies must promulgate regulations implementing the “source of strength” policy that holding companies act as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress.
 Dividends and Stock Repurchases. The Federal Reserve Board has the power to prohibit dividends by savings and loan holding companies if their actions constitute unsafe or unsound practices. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which also applies to savings and loan holding companies and which expresses the Federal Reserve Board’s view that a holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that the company’s net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the company’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. The Federal Reserve Board also indicated that it would be inappropriate for a holding company experiencing serious financial problems to borrow funds to pay dividends. Under the prompt corrective action regulations, the Federal Reserve Board may prohibit a bank holding company from paying any dividends if the holding company’s bank subsidiary is classified as “undercapitalized.”
 Federal Reserve Board policy also provides that a holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a

quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred.
 Acquisition of the Company. Under the federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company or savings association. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the company or institution, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in a change of control. Under the Change in Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the anti‑trust effects of the acquisition. Any company that acquires control would then be subject to regulation as a savings and loan holding company.
 Emerging Growth Company Status. The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act.
 An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say‑on‑pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say‑on‑golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation; however, the Company will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non‑voting equity held by non‑affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. The Company has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company.
 A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three‑year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non‑convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non‑voting equity held by non‑affiliates).
 Federal Taxation
 General. The Company and Equitable Bank are subject to federal income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal taxation is intended only to summarize certain pertinent federal income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company or Equitable Bank.
 Method of Accounting. For federal income tax purposes, the Company reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending June 30 for filing its federal and state income tax returns.
 Bad Debt Reserves. Prior to 1996, Equitable Bank was permitted to establish a reserve for bad debts and to make annual additions to the reserve. These additions could, within specified formula limits, be deducted in arriving at our taxable income. As a result of tax law changes in 1996, Equitable Bank was required to use the specific charge‑off method in computing its bad debt deduction beginning with its 1996 federal tax return. Savings institutions were required to recapture any excess reserves over those established as of December 31, 1987 (base year reserve).

 At June 30, 2017, Equitable Bank had approximately $1.7 million in reserves subject to recapture in excess of its base year reserves.
 The Company is required to use the specific charge‑off method to account for bad debt tax deductions.
 Taxable Distributions and Recapture. Prior to 1996, bad debt reserves created prior to 1988 were subject to recapture into taxable income if Equitable Bank failed to meet certain thrift asset and definitional tests or made certain distributions. Tax law changes in 1996 eliminated thrift‑related recapture rules. However, under current law, pre‑1988 tax bad debt reserves remain subject to recapture if Equitable Bank makes certain non‑dividend distributions, repurchases any of its common stock, pays dividends in excess of earnings and profits, or fails to qualify as a “bank” for tax purposes. At June 30, 2017, our total federal pre‑base year bad debt reserve was approximately $2.1 million.
 Alternative Minimum Tax. The Internal Revenue Code imposes an alternative minimum tax at a rate of 20% on a base of regular taxable income plus certain tax preferences, less any available exemption. The alternative minimum tax is imposed to the extent it exceeds the regular income tax. Net operating losses can offset no more than 90% of alternative taxable income. Certain payments of alternative minimum tax may be used as credits against regular tax liabilities in future years. At June 30, 2017, the Company had approximately $174,000 in available credits for carryover.
 Net Operating Loss Carryovers. A financial institution may carry back net operating losses to the preceding two taxable years and forward to the succeeding 20 taxable years. A 2009 federal tax law change allows for a one‑time carry back of either 2008 or 2009 taxable losses for up to five years. 
 Corporate Dividends‑Received Deduction. The Company may exclude from its federal taxable income 100% of dividends received from Equitable Bank as a wholly‑owned subsidiary by filing consolidated tax returns. The corporate dividends‑received deduction is 80% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns at least 20% of the stock of the distributing corporation. The dividends‑received deduction is 70% when the corporation receiving the dividend owns less than 20% of the distributing corporation.
 State Taxation
 Nebraska Taxation. Under Nebraska law, Equitable Bank pays a franchise tax in lieu of a corporate income tax. The franchise tax is the lesser of two amounts computed based on our average deposits and net financial income, respectively. Presently, the tax is $0.47 per $1,000 of average deposits but not to exceed an amount determined by applying 3.81% to our net financial income. Net financial income is our income as reported to the OCC after ordinary and necessary expenses but before income taxes. In addition, the Company is required to file a Nebraska income tax return because we do business in Nebraska. For Nebraska tax purposes, corporations are presently taxed at a rate equal to 5.58% of the first $50,000 of taxable income and 7.81% of taxable income in excess of $50,000. For this purpose, “taxable income” generally means federal taxable income, subject to certain adjustments (including addition of interest income on non‑Nebraska municipal obligations and excluding interest income from qualified U.S. governmental obligations).
