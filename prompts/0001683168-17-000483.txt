ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Corporate History
 
On December 29, 2010, the Company completed a reverse merger (the “Merger”) with Solar Wind Energy, Inc. , a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on July 26, 2010 (“Solar Wind - Subsidiary”). In connection with the Merger, the Company issued to the stockholders of Solar Wind - Subsidiary in exchange for their Solar Wind - Subsidiary Common Stock, the right to receive an aggregate of 300,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. As a result of the reverse merger, Solar Wind - Subsidiary is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.
 
For accounting purposes, Solar Wind - Subsidiary was the surviving entity. The transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization of Solar Wind - Subsidiary pursuant to which Solar Wind - Subsidiary was treated as the surviving and continuing entity although the Company is the legal acquirer rather than a reverse acquisition. Accordingly, the Company’s historical financial statements are those of Solar Wind - Subsidiary immediately following the consummation of the reverse merger. Also, going forward the business operations of Solar Wind - Subsidiary will become the Company’s principal business operations.
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of the State of Idaho on January 22, 1962, as Superior Mines Company. In 1964, the Company’s name was changed to Superior Silver Mines, Inc. On December 27, 2010, the Company reincorporated as a Nevada corporation. Prior to the Merger, the Company had been dormant for a number of years and had no known mineral reserves. On January 21, 2011, the Company changed its name from Superior Silver Mines, Inc. to Clean Wind Energy Tower, Inc. and on March 11, 2013, changed its name to Solar Wind Energy Tower Inc. along with its wholly-owned subsidiary, a corporation formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, which changed its name from Clean Wind Energy, Inc. to Solar Wind Energy, Inc. In addition, effective January 24, 2011, the Company’s quotation symbol on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board was changed from SSVM.OB to CWET.OB and on March 11, 2013, in conjunction with our name change, the Company’s quotation symbol on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board was changed from CWET.OB to SWET.OB.
 
The Company’s executive offices are located at 1997 Annapolis Exchange Parkway, Suite 300, Annapolis, Maryland 21401.
 
Overview
 
Our Company’s core objective and focus is to become a leading provider of clean efficient green energy to the world communities at a reasonable cost without the destructive residuals of fossil fuel, while continuing to generate innovative technological solutions for today and tomorrow’s electrical power needs.

Solar Wind has assembled a team of experienced business professionals, engineering and scientific consultants with the proven ability to bring the idea to market. Solar Wind has filed and been issued patents that the Company believes will further enhance this potentially revolutionary technology. Solar Wind is based in Annapolis, MD, and is traded on the OTCBB under the symbol ‘SWET’.
 
Solar Wind has, designed, engineered, developed and is preparing to construct large “Solar Wind Downdraft Towers” that use benevolent, non-toxic natural elements to generate electricity economically by integrating and synthesizing numerous proven as well as emerging technologies. In addition to constructing Solar Wind Downdraft Towers in the United States and abroad, the Company intends to establish partnerships at home and abroad to propagate these systems and meet increasing global demand for electricity.
 
A Bold New Energy Solution
 
The United States and other nations are aggressively pursuing energy independence with clean, sustainable energy solutions. Solar Wind offers a bold new approach to overcome the current limitations of other known alternative energy sources. The Solar Wind Downdraft Tower combines dry air heated by the solar rays of the sun with water added as a catalyst to create a powerful natural downdraft.
Hybrid Solar/Wind Technology 
 
We view ourselves as a hybrid solar/wind technology because the simplicity of our solution is the harnessing of the natural power of a downdraft created when water is introduced to hot dry air within the confines of our tower structure.
The Solar Wind Downdraft Tower
 

· | Avoids the adverse effects associated with fossil and nuclear fuels. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Is capable of Operating 24/7 and can outperform solar collectors that produce only when the sun shines in the daytime and wind turbines that produce only when the wind blows 
· | Has the capability of being operated with virtually no carbon footprint, fuel consumption or waste production. 
· | Has the potential to generate clean, cost effective and efficient electrical power without the damaging effects caused by using fossil or nuclear fuels, and other know alternative power sources.
· | Uses benevolent non-toxic natural elements to generate electricity. 

Technology
 
Innovative Renewable Energy Technology 
 
The Solar Wind Downdraft Tower is a hollow cylinder reaching skyward into the hot dry atmosphere heated by the solar rays of the sun. The water introduced by the injection system evaporates and is absorbed by the hot dry air which has been heated by the solar rays of the sun. The air becomes cooler, denser and heavier than the outside warmer air and falls through the cylinder at speeds up to and in excess of 50 mph and is diverted into wind tunnels surrounding the base of the Tower where turbines inside the tunnels power generators to produce electricity.
 
In geographic areas where atmospheric conditions are conducive, the exterior of the Solar Wind Downdraft Tower may be constructed with vertical “wind vanes” that capture the prevailing wind and channel it to produce supplemental electrical power. This dual renewable energy resource enhances the capability and productivity of the Solar Wind Energy system.

Physical Principles Evaporating water to create or diminish energy (for cooling) is a well-understood physical principle. Evaporative coolers are used not just throughout the United States Southwest region (hot & arid), but widely in the power industry to cool gas, coal and nuclear power plants. Similarly, cooling towers adorn the roofs of countless buildings in large cities, providing affordable energy. Airline pilots are very familiar with downdrafts and diligently avoid downdrafts associated with thunderstorms, especially when near the ground, where downdrafts can force a 200 ton airplane dangerously downward. Solar Wind’s Energy Tower uses the same fundamental physical principle of evaporative cooling which creates a downdraft. Cool, moist, dense air always falls through hot dry air. What most people are unaware of is that the wind speed in an energy tower can exceed 50mph. In summary, it is clear that Solar Wind’s Energy Tower creates and harnesses the downdraft, using widely applied and well-understood physical principles, to produce abundant electricity.

Abundant, Clean, Affordable Electricity Production
 
The Company has successfully managed to downsize the Tower, reducing capital costs and improving projected financial performance. The Company recently announced the completion of weather data models that confirm that the first Tower height can be lowered from 3,000 feet down to 2,250 feet. This development was made possible by utilizing our proprietary software which can calculate and predict energy production by our Solar Wind Downdraft Towers given local weather data. By feeding the weather data for southwestern Arizona / northern Mexico into the program, the Tower’s height and diameter can be adjusted along with the amount of water added as fuel to create a desired amount of energy. The outcome dictates the optimum size of the Tower’s height and width.
 
Under the most recent design specifications, the first San Luis Tower has a design capacity on an hourly basis, of up to 1250 megawatt hours, gross. Using a 60% capacity factor, the Tower’s potential hourly yield would be 600 megawatt hours from which approximately 18. 5% will be used to power its operations, yielding approximately 500 megawatt hours available for sale to the power grid. Due to lower capacities during winter days, the average daily output for sale to the grid for the entire year is approximately 435 megawatt hours. Currently in California avoided costs are running approximately $0.11 per kilowatt hour. As an independent power producer of clean renewable energy the Company will not be selling power directly to consumers, but rather to the grid.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company has filed numerous patent applications with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to protect its intellectual property. The Company has been awarded four patents. The Company has judiciously pursued the patent applications that we feel are instrumental to the core development of our technology and project:
Patent #8120191 issued 2/21/2012 “Efficient Energy Conversion Devices & Methods
 
The patent covers a novel hydraulic system capable of maintaining high efficiency hydraulic to electric conversion under a wide variance of wind speeds, as coupled to a plurality of wind turbines in wind tunnels.
Patent #8,517,662 B2 issued 8/27/2013 “Atmospheric Energy Extraction Devices & Methods
 
The patent covers a structure for producing electricity, specifically a Tower capable of adding moisture at the top of the structure to hot-dry air so as to generate a downdraft of wind within the interior of the Tower, vanes coupled to the exterior of the Tower that at least partially define a plurality of elongated pockets to the exterior of the Tower, and flaps located to redirect the incident wind downwards into tunnels to convert wind to electricity.
Patent #8,643,204 B2 issued 2/4/2014 “Efficient Energy Conversion Devices and Methods”
 
This application enhances and broadens previously issued Patent #8120191
 
Patent #8,727,698 B1 issued 5/20/2014 “Atmospheric Energy Extraction Devices & Methods”
 
The patent claims are targeted to represent the advantages of the new Tower structural shape, the configuration of the Tower walls, their composition as well as the wall thicknesses for a given height, along with more efficient construction methodology and enhanced wind force resistance over prior Tower designs.
Site Requirements
 
The Company’s planned Downdraft Tower requires very specific site conditions. The location must provide appropriate climate and atmospheric conditions. The site must have access to reliable water sources, either fresh or salt water, in which case desalinization may be required. Additionally, the site should have access to rail service and other logistical ease of access.
Considerations
 
The Downdraft Tower works best in hot, dry climates, , and near a reliable water source. Prime production periods are daytime during spring, summer and fall, which closely aligns with electricity demand patterns.
 
The External Wind Capture keeps working 24/7 including cold winter months and at night whenever a wind is blowing - from the surface up to 4,000 feet - where much stronger winds blow far more constantly (at least twice as often as on the surface and at much higher speeds).
 
There are a number of appropriate sites around the globe that are hot, dry, and near water adequate to support numerous Energy Towers that efficiently turn the sun’s energy into electricity.
 
The Distinct Advantages
 
The Company enjoys one major advantage over all other wind energy producers: a constant, high speed downdraft that blows for more than half the year. While ordinary wind turbine farms struggle with 20% to 30% capacity factors and wind speeds that are often useless or marginal (too low or too high), the Company’s Energy Tower can continuously channel 50 mph winds (or higher) into a controlled environment where the vast majority the wind’s energy can be captured to generate electricity.
 
Power industry experts know that when computing wind power, the velocity is tripled. Thus a 60 mph wind contains 3 times as much kinetic energy as a 30 mph wind striking a conventional turbine.

Global Energy Generation Calculator
 
The Company has developed a software based analytical program to determine the energy generation capabilities of its Solar Wind Downdraft Towers based on the climate in geographic locations around the world, and has taken the appropriate steps to protect its intellectual property invention.
 
This essential tool has been under development by the Company for over one year and applies “known” scientific meteorology data of a specific area to the Solar Wind Downdraft Tower’s variables in order to determine and project energy outputs on a daily basis. Advancements in the scientific community over the last decade that predict and pin-point specific weather conditions provided significant insights to the development of this innovative tool.
 
This analytical tool, combined with our proprietary operating systems technology and existing core patents, clearly provides the Company with a unique opportunity to allow global positioning of this alternative solution to the world’s energy needs. The Company can now rapidly respond to a request from virtually any country reasonably suitable to host a project and determine specifically where the Solar Wind Downdraft Tower should be located, the size of the Tower and the amount of electricity it can produce.
 
Development
 
The master development plan for a site requires a series of steps:
 

· | explore, select, and qualify site; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | negotiate and execute land lease sale (site) and suitability for rights of way (water pipeline, transmission line, highway and railway access); 
· | survey and identify any artifacts and cultural resources that may be impacted by site exploration, project construction or operation; 
· | acquire water rights; 
· | determine and design access to and availability of electrical grid, roads, rail transportation, sewer, water, and power for construction and operation;
· | create project site plan for offices, storage buildings for construction equipment, etc.; 
· | coordinate and provide, to the extent possible, resource carry-over (i.e., buildings and facilities) to the locale after construction; 
· | determine the type and number of jobs created during study, construction and operational phases; 
· | determine the cost of the project (currently estimated at $1.5 billion); and 
· | determine the electricity produced (currently estimated at 3.7 Million MWH’s). 

Business Model 
 
The business model of our Company is to create an Energy Compound of Towers to be developed individually with a common water supply and rail/water port for supplies and equipment delivery, and common component assembly plant and labor force. Energy Compounds could actually be developed simultaneously in North America, North Africa (to serve the European grid by piping direct current across the Mediterrean), India and the Middle East. The world market can support all the materials needed and can certainly use the electricity. The cost per kilowatt is similar to that of a typical coal or gas-fired facility. SWET has positioned itself to take advantage of this solution and bring the first project to market, thereby setting the stage for a global “game changing” opportunity.
Project Partnering 
 
The Company’s business plan involves “partnering” with various entities such as utilities, sovereign nations and independent power producers, to provide the ability to bring this solution to the market as rapidly as possible.

Each Solar Wind Downdraft Tower is its own independent project. The Company’s involvement in each project is to facilitate the Tower’s development with its expertise, intellectual property and project management team. The Company will receive development fees, licensing fees, and royalties on power sales from each project and/or ownership interests.
 
Coordinated World Class Expertise 
 
The Company is evaluating potential sites for a possible first Tower here in the United States and received key patents to protect its techniques to extract the energy from the Solar Wind Downdraft Tower. Some of the best consultants in the world have been and continue to support the Company’s efforts to bring this first Downdraft Tower to market.
 
The first site is near San Luis, AZ and the Mexico/US border. The weather data has been updated for the first site and final reports accurately calculate the Tower's output capacity 24/7. Those reports now support and validate SWET’s goal to develop its first Tower at the minimum size and design output possible, which preserves cash flow for adequate debt service coverage.
 
First Energy Tower Site in United States
 

The Company made a final site selection within the City of San Luis, Arizona for the potential development of its first tower. After a substantial evaluation of multiple sites in the southwestern part of the country over a two and a half year period, including various locations in proximity to San Luis, Arizona, the Company chose the site location that best met all of its required attributes including climate, geography, zoning, as well as a welcoming environment. It executed an option agreement to purchase a site encompassing over 640acres of land within the City of San Luis, Arizona, which was later was recorded in Yuma County, Arizona. Wednesday, April 23, 2014, the city unanimously approved a “Development and Protected Development Rights Agreement” with Solar Wind Energy Tower Inc. providing assurance of the necessary local entitlements for development of the first tower in the City of San Luis. The agreement covers a number of items including, but not limited to, land zoning, rights-of-way, utilities and provides that the City of San Luis will guarantee the supply the water to fuel the Tower Project for a minimum of 50 years.

Recently, the government of San Luis Mexico, coordinated arranging for the Company to option ( a site complete with all of the entitlements including the necessary water allocation in San Luis Rio Colorado, Sonora, Mexico. The Company and the government are investigating the access, and timing required to connect to the Mexican electrical grid. We are also investigating other privately owned sites in the same area with comparable attributes.

Customers
 
Energy produced by the Downdraft Tower could provide low cost electricity to the power grid. The Company plans to ultimately build and operate wind energy plants and sell the electricity either through contracts with utilities, which is the traditional method for independent power plants, or directly into the open market or electricity commodities market like a merchant plant similar to many natural gas fired power plants. The Company may also sell the power plants themselves to large customers or utilities and/or operate such plants for customers or utilities.
 
The sale of electricity to power brokers is more profitable than selling directly to the electricity commodities market. If the cost of the marketing infrastructure of selling green energy at a $0.02 per kWh premium is justified as opposed to the wholesale contracting of electricity at a lower price, then the Company plans to market the electricity to green energy brokers. The green power is energy from clean energy production sources like wind energy in which consumers are willing to pay a premium in order to promote clean energy. If the Company chooses to work through power brokers, it believes the potential exists to sell the environmental correct “green” power at a premium price being higher than conventional fuel sources. Power brokers usually receive a premium of $0.015 per kWh above the wholesale price paid on the open market. However, the market is new and subject to uncertainty including price fluctuations.
 
Markets
 
Wind energy experienced a 39% annual growth for the past five years according to the American Wind Energy Association, the industry’s trade organization based in Washington, D.C. Recent national surveys show that approximately 40-70% of the population surveyed indicate a willingness to pay a premium for renewable energy. Although 10% of the respondents say they will participate in such a program, actual participation is estimated at 1%. Currently, more than a dozen utilities have green marketing programs. Public Service Company of Colorado, Central and South West Services Corporation of Texas, and Fort Collins Light and Power Company are leading the effort in wind related green electricity marketing.
 
The Company is investigating the feasibility of locating a Downdraft Tower in California. California has three major regulated investor-owned utilities and many municipal utilities, all of which are required by state law to have renewable sources of generation in their resource portfolios, whether generated or purchased. Arizona utilities have similar requirements. Due to federal regulations requiring that transmission owners provide service on the same terms to all generators requesting service, known as “open access”, independent power producers (which the Company would be under its business model), are able to develop wind energy projects in areas where such resources are most prevalent and sell power to anyone interconnected with the transmission grid in California. California’s transmission grid is operated by a regional transmission organization (“RTO”), the California Independent System Operator (“CAISO”). Other states belong to other RTOs.
 
Competition
 
The Downdraft Tower project requires specific site and appropriate weather conditions. Given these constraints and the increasing focus on renewable energy to offset the environmental problems caused by fossil fuels, the renewable energy industry is highly competitive.
 
In the markets where the Company plans to conduct its business, it will compete with many energy producers including electric utilities and large independent power producers. There is also competition from fossil fuel sources such as natural gas and coal, and other renewable energy sources such as solar, traditional wind, hydro and geothermal. The competition depends on the resources available within the specific markets.
 
Although the cost to produce clean, reliable, renewable energy is becoming more competitive with traditional fossil fuel sources, it generally remains more expensive to produce, and the reliability of its supply is less consistent than traditional fossil fuel. Deregulation and consumer preference are becoming important factors in increasing the development of alternative energy projects.

The Company believes that governments and consumers recognize the importance of renewable energy resources in the energy mix, and are facilitating the implementation of wind and other renewable technologies through renewable portfolio standards and revenue and tax incentives.
 
Arizona and California are primarily served by large utilities, such as Southern California Edison Company, Pacific Gas & Electric Company, San Diego Gas & Electric Company, Arizona Public Service Company (“Arizona Public Service”) and UNS. All of these companies have non-regulated subsidiaries or sister companies that develop generating facilities. In addition, utilities from other states and countries have established large wind energy generating companies, such as Florida Power & Light Company, enXco, Inc. and PPM Energy, Inc. (now part of a large Spanish renewable company, Iberdrola Renovables, S.A.).
 
According to the Electric Power Research Institute, the past ten years have seen traditional energy costs increase while wind energy costs have declined. The advances in technology, larger-scale and more efficient manufacturing processes, and increased experience in wind turbine operations has contributed substantially to this trend. This cost decline is paralleled with a several hundred fold increase in installed wind energy capacity. As a result, maintenance costs have fallen significantly. Wind energy sources comprise less than 1% of the current electricity generating industry.
 
An assessment released by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory in 2010 shows that U.S. wind resources are even larger than previously estimated and potential capacity of the land-based wind resource is more than 10,000 GW, far exceeding the 300 GW required to meet 20% of the nation’s electrical demand with wind in 2030.This figure does not factor the potential of Downdraft Towers. The estimated levelized cost of new generation resources by the Energy Information Administration shows the cost of wind energy is competitive to other conventional means of energy generation. The cumulative capacity-weighted average price of wind power, including the production tax credit, was about 4.4 cents per kilowatt hour in 2009 — a price that competes with fossil fuel-generated electricity.

Environmental
 
Various parties in the United States and other nations are pursuing clean energy solutions that use efficient and cost- effective renewable resources to serve society while avoiding the adverse effects associated with fossil and nuclear fuels, and also the obvious limitations of solar collectors that work only when the sun shines or wind turbines that work only when the wind blows.
 
The Solar Wind Downdraft Tower has the capability of being operated with virtually no carbon footprint, fuel consumption, or waste production. The technology has the potential to generate clean, cost effective and efficient electrical power without the damaging effects caused by using fossil or nuclear fuels, and other conventional power sources. The Company also believes that increasing emphasis on green technologies and governmental incentives in the energy industry should have a positive long-term effect on the Company's planned business and the wind energy industry in general.
 
Numerous federal and state environmental laws can affect the development of renewable energy, such as the California Environmental Quality Act. These laws require that certain studies be conducted to ensure that there are no significant adverse impacts on wildlife, humans and the environment generally. The significant impacts of wind energy projects are on visibility, noise, birds, wildlife habitat and soil erosion. Changes in environmental laws can pose significant expenses on renewable energy development.
 
International treaties and protocols, such as the Kyoto Protocol, have significantly impacted the development and implementation of renewable energy technologies. Certain countries and regions also have established emission trading programs. Under emission trading programs, utilities and factories are permitted to produce a certain level of emissions. If such an entity produces fewer emissions than its allotment, the entity may sell its excess allotment to parties exceeding their emissions allotments. To date, these mechanisms are at an early stage of development within the United States. Credit trading provides the potential for creating additional income for renewable energy producers, rationalizing of electricity prices for utilities and reducing the overall retail price for green power.
 
The Company believes that increasing emphasis on green technologies and governmental incentives in the energy industry should have a positive long-term effect on the Company’s planned business and the wind energy industry in general.
 
Industry Analysis
 
According to the American Wind Energy Association (“AWEA”), wind energy was the world’s fastest growing energy source during most of the 1990s, expanding at annual rates ranging from 25% to 35%. The AWEA estimates the global industry growth rate has averaged 32% over the five years from 2004 through 2008, with a growth rate of 39% in 2009. The U.S. wind industry broke all previous records by installing over 10,000 MW of new wind capacity in 2009. Current installed capacity worldwide at the end of 2009 was 35,086 MW, compared to 25,076 MW at the end of 2008. The major contributing growth factor is the federal stimulus package passed in 2009 that extended a tax credit and provided other investment incentives for alternative energy sources. The U.S. Energy Information Administration attributes 1.9% of total electric generation in the nation to wind power.
 
Not factoring the Company’s planned Downdraft Tower product, World Energy Council expects new wind capacity worldwide to continue to grow. The continued evolution of this technology is evident with the existence of varying wind turbine designs. However, there is division in the wind industry between those who want to capitalize on the emerging respect the business community has for established, mature wind technology, and those who seek new technologies designed to bring about significant cost reductions. The Company chooses to seek new horizons beyond current perception and knowledge by developing new technologies that it believes will be capable of significantly reducing wind energy costs.

As wind energy technology gains wider acceptance, competition may increase as large, well-capitalized companies enter the business. Although one or more may be successful, the Company believes that its technological expertise and early entry will provide a degree of competitive protection.
 
Licensing and Regulation
 
In the United States, many state governments have amended their utility regulations and significantly changed certain competition and marketing rules with respect to generation, transmission and distribution of electric energy. Among other things, deregulation allows consumers to purchase electricity from a source of their choice, and requires utilities to purchase electricity from independent power producers and to offer transmission to independent power producers at reasonable prices.
 
In California, deregulation legislation, such as the Assembly Bill 1890 and the Renewable Energy Program, were implemented in the mid-1990s to encourage the development of renewable power generation projects through various incentives. In addition, Assembly Bill 995 and Senate Bill 1038 were passed to further facilitate the development of renewable resources. In November 2008, the governor of the State of California signed Executive Order S-14-08 requiring that California utilities reach a 33% renewable energy goal by 2020, exceeding the previous legislative mandate that electric utilities supply 20% of their total retail power sales from renewable resources by 2010. In September 2009, the Governor signed Executive Order S-21-09, requiring the Air Resources Board under the California Environmental Protection Agency to adopt a regulation by July 1, 2010 requiring California’s load-serving entities to meet the 33% renewable energy goal through the creation and use of renewable energy sources to ensure reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
 
In Arizona, access to the electricity market has been established through Arizona’s Retail Electric Competition Rules, which, in the Company’s opinion, provide a favorable environment for renewable energy generators. Electricity producers are subject to the Federal Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act (“PURPA”) and state regulations. In addition, power producers must also meet standards set by the Arizona Corporations Commission (the “ACC”).
 
The Federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 provided further benefits to independent power producers by requiring transmission companies to provide access to third parties at a reasonable price. On October 3, 2008, the President of the United States signed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 into law. This legislation contains a number of tax incentives designed to encourage both individuals and businesses to make investments in renewable energy, including an eight-year extension of the business solar investment tax credit (“ITC”). The ITC is a 30% tax credit on solar property effective through December 31, 2016. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 further extended the U.S. $0.021/kWh Production Tax Credit (“PTC”) through December 31, 2012, and provide an option to elect a 30% ITC or an equivalent cash grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.
 
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2017, the Company had a total of 3 full time employees. The Company anticipates that it may need to hire additional staff in the areas of engineering, marketing and administration in the future.
