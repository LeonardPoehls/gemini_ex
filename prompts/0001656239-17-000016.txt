Item 1. | Business


Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. is an owner, operator and developer of casinos and related hospitality and entertainment businesses. References herein to “Pinnacle,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer to Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries, except where stated or the context otherwise indicates. References to “Former Pinnacle” refer to Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc. prior to the Spin-Off and Merger (as such terms are defined below).
We own and operate 16 gaming, hospitality and entertainment businesses, of which 15 operate in leased facilities. Our owned facilities are located in Ohio and our leased facilities are located in Colorado, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nevada, and Pennsylvania, subject to the Master Lease and the Meadows Lease (as such terms are defined below). We also hold a majority interest in the racing license owner, and we are a party to a management contract, for Retama Park Racetrack located outside of San Antonio, Texas. Additionally, we own and operate a live and televised poker tournament series under the trade name Heartland Poker Tour. 
Our mission is to increase stockholder value. We seek to increase revenues through enhancing the guest experience by providing them with their favorite games, restaurants, hotel accommodations, entertainment and other amenities in attractive surroundings with high-quality guest service and our mychoice customer loyalty program. We seek to improve cash flows by focusing on operational excellence and efficiency while meeting our guests’ expectations of value. Our long-term strategy includes disciplined capital expenditures to improve and maintain the existing facilities in which we operate, while growing the number of businesses we own and operate by pursuing opportunities to either acquire or develop gaming, hospitality and entertainment businesses. We intend to diversify our revenue sources by growing our portfolio of businesses and facilities, while remaining gaming, hospitality and entertainment centric. We intend to implement these strategies either alone or with third parties when we believe it benefits our stockholders to do so. In making decisions, we consider our stockholders, guests, team members and other constituents in the communities in which we operate. 
Highlights of 2016 include the following:

• | In April 2016, Former Pinnacle completed the transactions under the terms of a definitive agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”), a real estate investment trust. Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, Former Pinnacle separated its operating assets and liabilities (and its Belterra Park property and excess land at certain locations) into the Company, a newly formed subsidiary initially named PNK Entertainment, Inc., and distributed to its stockholders, on a pro rata basis, all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the Company (such distribution referred to as the “Spin-Off”). Gold Merger Sub, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of GLPI (“Merger Sub”), then merged with and into Former Pinnacle (the “Merger”), with Merger Sub surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of GLPI. Following the Merger, the Company was renamed Pinnacle Entertainment, Inc., and operates 14 of its gaming, hospitality and entertainment businesses under a triple-net master lease agreement for the facilities acquired by GLPI (the “Master Lease”). The Master Lease has an initial term of 10 years with five subsequent, five-year renewal periods at our option. The Company currently pays annual rent of $377 million to GLPI.


• | In April 2016, immediately prior to the consummation of the Spin-Off and Merger, Former Pinnacle’s amended and restated credit agreement (the “Former Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) was repaid in full and terminated and its 6.375% senior notes due 2021, 7.50% senior notes due 2021 and 7.75% senior subordinated notes due 2022 were redeemed. In addition, Former Pinnacle’s 8.75% senior subordinated notes due 2020 were satisfied and discharged in April 2016, and were subsequently redeemed in May 2016. During 2016, prior to the Spin-Off and Merger, we repaid $68.4 million of loans under the Former Senior Secured Credit Facilities, net of borrowings.


• | In connection with the Spin-Off and Merger, in April 2016, we entered into a credit agreement (the “Senior Secured Credit Facilities”) with certain lenders, which is comprised of (i) a $185.0 million term loan A facility, (ii) a $300.0 million term loan B facility and (iii) a $400.0 million revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). Subsequent to their issuance, during 2016, we repaid $32.2 million of loans under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, net of borrowings. In addition, during 2016, we issued $500.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.625% senior notes due 2024 (the “5.625% Notes”).


• | In May 2016, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to $50.0 million of our common stock, which we completed in July 2016. In August 2016, our Board of Directors authorized an additional share repurchase program of up to $50.0 million of our common stock. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we repurchased 6.2 million shares of common stock for $70.2 million under both programs.

• | In September 2016, we closed on a purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with GLP Capital, L.P. (“GLPC”), a subsidiary of GLPI, pursuant to which we acquired The Meadows Racetrack and Casino (the “Meadows”) business located in Washington, Pennsylvania for base consideration of $138.0 million, subject to certain adjustments. As a result of the transaction, we own and operate the Meadows’ gaming, entertainment and harness racing business subject to a triple-net lease of its underlying real estate with GLPI (the “Meadows Lease,” and together with the Master Lease, the “Leases”).

Over the last several years, our operations have grown through strategic acquisitions, notably the August 2013 acquisition of Ameristar Casinos, Inc. (“Ameristar”) and the September 2016 acquisition of the Meadows as well as through the development and opening of three properties: Belterra Park in Cincinnati, Ohio; L’Auberge Baton Rouge in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; and River City in St. Louis, Missouri. We have also made strategic dispositions over the last several years, including the equity interests in subsidiaries that operated the Lumiére Place Casino, HoteLumiére, and the Four Seasons Hotel St. Louis (collectively, the “Lumiére Place Casino and Hotels”); the equity interest of Ameristar Casino Lake Charles, LLC; and the Boomtown Reno operations.
Additionally, our business was impacted by the Spin-Off and Merger transactions that occurred in April 2016, where we now operate 14 gaming, hospitality and entertainment businesses in leased gaming facilities subject to the Master Lease. Prior to the Spin-Off and Merger, the gaming facilities within which we operated our gaming, hospitality and entertainment businesses were owned by Former Pinnacle.

In April 2015, we completed the sale of approximately 40 acres of land in Springfield, Massachusetts, originally purchased by Ameristar for a possible future casino resort, for cash consideration of $12.0 million.
In April 2015, we completed the sale of approximately 783 acres of excess land surrounding Boomtown Reno for cash consideration of $13.1 million.
Competition
We face significant competition in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such competition may intensify in some of these jurisdictions if new gaming operations open in these markets or existing competitors expand their operations. Our properties compete directly with other gaming properties in each state in which we operate, as well as properties in other states. We also compete for customers with other casino operators in other markets, including casinos located on Native American reservations, and other forms of gaming, such as lotteries and internet gaming. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater name recognition and marketing and financial resources. In some instances, particularly with Native American casinos, our competitors pay substantially lower taxes or no taxes at all, as compared to us. We believe that increased legalized gaming in certain states, particularly in areas close to where our existing gaming properties are located; the development or expansion of Native American gaming in or near the states in which we operate; and the potential legalization of internet gaming could create additional competition for us and could adversely affect our operations or proposed development projects.
Government Regulation and Gaming Issues
The gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must obtain and maintain certain licenses to continue our operations. Each of the casinos on which we operate is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. For a more detailed description of the statutes and regulations to which we are subject, please see Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, “Government Regulation and Gaming Issues,” which is incorporated herein by reference.

Our businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions which have been enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, earnings or the competitive positions of our properties. From time to time, certain development projects may require substantial costs for environmental remediation due to prior use of our development sites. Our project budgets for such a site typically include amounts expected to cover the remediation work required.
