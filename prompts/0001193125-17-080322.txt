Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to discovering, developing and commercializing novel therapeutics to treat grievous blood-based disorders with significant unmet need. Our lead product candidate is GBT440, an oral, once-daily therapy that modulates hemoglobins affinity for oxygen, which we believe inhibits hemoglobin polymerization in sickle cell disease, or SCD, and improves hypoxemia in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, or IPF. We are developing GBT440 for SCD. We are currently evaluating GBT440 in SCD in a Phase 3 clinical trial of GBT440 in adult and adolescent patients with SCD. In addition, we are evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of GBT440 in a Phase 2a clinical trial of adolescent patients with SCD. In December 2015, the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Fast Track Designation and Orphan Drug Designation for GBT440 for the treatment of SCD, and in November 2016 we were granted Orphan Drug Designation in Europe for GBT440 for the treatment of SCD. 
 In addition to SCD, we are conducting two Phase 2 clinical trials of GBT440 for the potential treatment of IPF, which is a hypoxemic pulmonary disorder. We are also engaged in other pre-clinical research and development activities. 
 SCD is marked by red blood cell, or RBC, destruction and occluded blood flow and hypoxia, leading to anemia, stroke, multi-organ failure, severe pain crises, and shortened patient life span. GBT440 inhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymerization, the underlying mechanism that causes sickling of RBCs. In our clinical trials of GBT440 in SCD patients, we observed reduced markers of RBC destruction, improvements in anemia, improvements in markers of tissue oxygenation, and reduced numbers of sickled RBCs. 
 SCD is a genetic blood disorder caused by a single point mutation in the beta-chain of hemoglobin, which results in the formation of abnormal hemoglobin known as sickle hemoglobin, or HbS. Normally, oxygenated RBCs travel from the lung through blood vessels. Hemoglobin is the protein inside RBCs that carries oxygen and releases oxygen at the tissues. In SCD, when oxygen is released, HbS becomes sticky and aggregates into polymers, or long, rigid rods within RBC, much like a sword within a balloon. The RBCs assume a sickled shape and becomes inflexible, which can destroy RBCs, cause blockage in small blood vessels, block blood flow, and decrease oxygen delivery to tissues. As a result, beginning in early childhood, SCD patients suffer many clinical consequences, including unpredictable and recurrent episodes, or crises, of severe chronic and acute pain, anemia, stroke, spleen failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute chest syndrome, liver disease, kidney failure, other morbidities, and premature death. These consequences are directly related to reduced blood flow and insufficient oxygen delivery. According to a 2014 publication, in the United States, SCD shortens patient life expectancy by approximately 25 to 30 years even with available medical care. 
 Current treatment options for SCD are limited to one approved therapy for adults known as hydroxyurea, blood transfusions and bone marrow transplantation. The utilization of these treatments is significantly limited due to their suboptimal efficacy and significant toxicity. As a result, patients with SCD continue to suffer serious morbidity and premature mortality. 
 We believe there is a significant unmet medical need for a novel SCD therapy that: 
 
 | inhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymer formation, the underlying mechanism of RBC sickling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | stops inappropriate RBC destruction and improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prevents or reduces the episodes or crises of severe pain associated with SCD;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | modifies the long-term course of the disease;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | is effective in all SCD genotypes, and in both children and adults;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | has a more favorable side effect profile than currently available therapies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | is available as a convenient, oral therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------

 GBT440s therapeutic approach was inspired by the natural activity of fetal hemoglobin, or HbF. HbF is present during fetal development and in early infancy until it is replaced with adult hemoglobin, and has an 
 
1 
 
 inherently increased oxygen affinity that allows a fetus to extract oxygen from the mothers blood. Typically, newborns with SCD do not experience RBC sickling until approximately six to nine months of age, after which HbF is usually no longer expressed. Additionally, it has been observed that rare individuals who have inherited both the HbS mutation as well as a gene deletion that allows them to continue to express 10% to 30% HbF in their RBCs into adulthood do not exhibit the clinical manifestations of SCD, despite expressing up to 90% sickled hemoglobin, or HbS in their blood. HbF dilutes the concentration of deoxygenated HbS that can participate in hemoglobin polymerization, and thereby significantly reduces the formation of hemoglobin polymers. 
 GBT440 is a novel, proprietary investigational drug that increases hemoglobins affinity for oxygen by binding to the alpha-chain of hemoglobin. GBT440 has been observed to keep a proportion of HbS, in its oxygenated state, where it cannot participate in polymerization. Similar to HbF, by diluting total HbS with a proportion of GBT440-bound hemoglobin, GBT440 prevents hemoglobin polymer formation. Based on its mechanism of action, we believe that GBT440 can reduce the physical and clinical manifestations of SCD. 
 In December 2014, we initiated our randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending dose Phase 1/2 clinical study of GBT440 in healthy subjects and patients with SCD. The study was conducted in three parts: single dose administration, followed by multiple dose administration, daily for 15 days in healthy subjects and 28 days in SCD subjects, and then followed by multiple dose administration, daily for up to six months in SCD subjects. In this clinical trial, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GBT440, as well as exploratory markers of SCD activity, including anti-hemolytic effects and SCD-related clinical effects. We reported initial results from this clinical trial at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, meeting in December 2015. We reported additional results from this clinical trial at the European Hematological Association meeting in June 2016 and at the ASH meeting in December 2016. Among the 41 SCD subjects who received multiple doses of GBT440 (at doses of either 1000mg, 900mg, 700mg or 500mg per day) for 28 days up to six months, 100% of study subjects demonstrated a hematologic response to GBT440 therapy, as evidenced by improvements in one or more markers of hemolysis and anemia (hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin and percentage reticulocyte counts). In addition, all study cohorts showed marked reductions in irreversibly sickled cells in the peripheral blood from baseline, and, all study subjects treated for 90 days to up to six months showed sustained improvement in bilirubin and percentage reticulocyte counts, continued reductions in sickled RBCs and a median 1.0 g/dL increase in hemoglobin. As a result, this Phase 1/2 clinical study demonstrated GBT440s pharmacological mechanism of action and linear, dose-proportional pharmacokinetics. In this clinical study, GBT440 was well tolerated through six months of dosing; the most common treatment-related adverse events were mild to moderate headaches and gastrointestinal disorders, which occurred in similar rates in the placebo arms. 
 Following discussions with the FDA that concluded successfully in October 2016, we have initiated a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national Phase 3 clinical trial of GBT440 in SCD that we refer to as the HOPE study. The HOPE study is designed to enroll up to 400 adult and adolescent SCD patients, age 12 years and older, who have had at least one episode of vaso-occlusive crisis in the previous year. The HOPE study is being conducted in two parts: the initial Part A, which will compare two dose levels of GBT440 (900 mg and 1500 mg) versus placebo, and will include up to 150 patients; followed by Part B, which will include 250 patients randomized to placebo or a dose of GBT440 selected based on the results of Part A. The main objectives of Part A are to select the optimal dose, define the final secondary endpoints for Part B and qualify the Patient Reported Outcome, or PRO, instrument. The primary efficacy endpoint of the HOPE study is the proportion of patients who achieve a >1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at 24 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include the effect of GBT440 on SCD symptom exacerbation, which will be measured by our PRO instrument, in addition to overall SCD symptoms as compared to placebo. We will also assess traditionally defined vaso-occlusive crisis as well as hospitalizations and red blood cell transfusions as secondary endpoints. 
 We believe there is a significant market opportunity in SCD. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, estimates the prevalence of SCD at 90,000 to 100,000 individuals in the United States, where newborn screening is mandatory. It is estimated that the prevalence of SCD in Europe is approximately 60,000 individuals. The global incidence of SCD is estimated to be 250,000 to 300,000 births annually. One study estimates that in the 
 
2 
 
 United States, the average annual cost for the care of an adult patient with the most common genotype of SCD exceeds $200,000, and the cumulative lifetime costs exceed $8.0 million over an assumed 50-year lifespan, driven primarily by hospital admissions, physician fees, clinic and emergency department visits, and the costs of diagnostic procedures and outpatient consultations. 
 We are also studying the potential for GBT440 to treat IPF, which is a fatal disease characterized by irreversible, progressive scarring of the lungs. The cause of IPF is unknown and there is no cure. As an IPF patients lung scarring worsens, the lungs cannot properly transport oxygen into the bloodstream and, as a result, the bodys tissues do not get the oxygen they need. Progression of lung scarring inevitably results in hypoxemia causing shortness of breath, and a decline in overall function; eventually the use of supplemental oxygen is necessary. Ultimately, the progressive worsening of lung function over time leads to organ dysfunction, frequent hospitalizations and death. IPF typically affects individuals over the age of 50, and the median survival after diagnosis is approximately 2 to 3 years. 
 Hypoxemia, which means abnormally low levels of oxygen in the blood, is a common finding in IPF. Hypoxemia is the underlying cause of patients symptoms of breathlessness and fatigue, and contributes to adverse patient outcomes. GBT440 has been shown to increase oxygen saturation in animal models of pulmonary fibrosis and severe hypoxemia. Based on these findings, GBT is now conducting two clinical trials of GBT440 as a potential treatment for hypoxemia in a broad range of subjects with IPF. 
 In June 2016, we initiated our first Phase 2a clinical trial of GBT440 in IPF. This clinical study is a randomized, placebo-controlled study of GBT440 that is evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effect on hypoxemia of GBT440 in patients with IPF who have hypoxemia on exertion. In November 2016, we initiated our second Phase 2a clinical trial of GBT440 in IPF, an open-label clinical study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of GBT440 for the treatment of hypoxemia in IPF patients who are using supplemental oxygen at rest. We have named this second Phase 2a clinical study the ZEPHYR study. In addition, in February 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the physiologic effects of GBT440 in healthy volunteers under hypoxic conditions and exercise conditions that maximally stress heart and lung function, to support our understanding of GBT440s effects on hypoxemia and complement our ongoing Phase 2a program. 
 We believe there is a significant market opportunity in IPF. It is estimated that there are less than 150,000 patients with IPF in the United States. 
 We own or jointly own and have exclusively licensed rights to our product candidates in the United States, Europe and other major markets. We own three issued U.S. patents that cover the composition of matter of GBT440, methods of use of GBT440, and a polymorph of GBT440. These patents are due to expire in 2032, 2034 and 2035, respectively (absent any applicable patent term extensions). We own or co-own additional pending patent applications in the United States and multiple foreign countries relating to our lead product candidate GBT440. 
 To execute on the opportunities presented by our research and development portfolio, we have assembled a team of employees, management and directors rich in scientific experience and capabilities in drug discovery, development and commercialization. Our management has a successful track record in developing and commercializing drug candidates. In aggregate, our management team has contributed to several drug approvals, including Avastin®, Herceptin®, Kaletra®, Kyprolis®, Ravictl® and Rituxan®. We intend to leverage this expertise and experience to rapidly advance the development of GBT440 for SCD, determine the potential of GBT440 in hypoxemic pulmonary disorders starting with IPF, and advance other product candidates that we may identify and develop.

GBT440 for the Treatment of Sickle Cell Disease 
 We are developing our lead product candidate GBT440 as a once-daily, oral therapy for patients with SCD. We are investigating GBT440s potential to inhibit the abnormal polymerization of hemoglobin, which is the underlying mechanism of RBC, sickling and leads to the associated complications that characterize SCD. We have designed a clinical program for GBT440 targeted at the treatment of adults, adolescents, children and infants across all SCD genotypes. In December 2014, we initiated our first clinical trial of GBT440, a Phase 1/2 study in which we evaluated GBT440 in both healthy subjects and SCD subjects. In November 2016, we initiated our on-going multi-national Phase 3 clinical trial of GBT440 in adult and adolescent subjects with SCD, which we have named the HOPE study. In addition, we are evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of single and multiple doses of GBT440 in a Phase 2a clinical trial of adolescent patients with SCD. 
Sickle Cell Disease Overview 
 SCD is a grievous disease that can lead to hemolytic anemia, meaning the destruction of RBCs within blood vessels, and vaso-occlusion, which means blocked blood flow to tissues, as well as progressive multi-organ damage and early death. Beginning in childhood, patients suffer unpredictable and recurrent episodes or crises of severe pain due to blocked blood flow to organs, which often lead to physical and psychosocial disability. In addition, the constant destruction of RBCs with the release of their contents into the blood often leads to damaged or diseased blood vessels, which further exacerbate blood flow obstruction and multi-organ damage. Consequences of SCD can manifest in early childhood and may include stroke, spleen failure, pulmonary hypertension, acute chest syndrome, liver disease, kidney failure, leg ulcers, priapism, which is a medical emergency due to refractory penile erection, and premature death. According to a 2014 publication, in the United States, SCD shortens patient life expectancy by approximately 25 to 30 years even with available medical care. 
 SCD is a genetic blood disorder caused by a single gene mutation in the beta-chain of hemoglobin, which results in mutant hemoglobin known as HbS. Hemoglobin is the protein in RBCs that carries oxygen from the lungs to the bodys tissues, releases oxygen at the tissues, and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs. Hemoglobin accomplishes this by binding and then releasing oxygen through allosterism, which means the 
 
4 
 
 hemoglobin molecule changes its shape to have a high affinity for oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen is abundant, and to have a low affinity for oxygen in the tissues, where oxygen must be released. Oxyhemoglobin, the high oxygen affinity form of hemoglobin, is formed in the lungs during respiration, when oxygen binds to the hemoglobin molecule. Deoxyhemoglobin, the low oxygen affinity form of hemoglobin, is formed when oxygen molecules are removed from the binding site as blood flows from the lungs to the tissues in the body. In patients with SCD, deoxygenated HbS, molecules polymerize to form long, rigid rods within an RBC, much like a sword within a balloon. As a consequence, the normally round and flexible RBC becomes rigid and elongate into a sickled shape. Sickled RBCs do not flow properly in the bloodstream; they clog small blood vessels and reduce blood flow to the organs. This results in inadequate oxygen delivery, or hypoxia, to all body tissues, which can lead to multi-organ failure and premature death. 
 The following graphic illustrates the process by which sickling occurs in SCD patients as a result of the polymerization of deoxygenated HbS in an RBC, leading to occluded blood flow, in contrast to a normal RBC: 
 

SCD manifests in individuals who inherit at least one HbS gene from a parent and an additional mutation on the second beta globin gene from the other parent. There are several different genotypes of SCD, including the following major genotypes: 
 
 | HbSS, or sickle cell anemia, where both genes are HbS;
--+-------------------------------------------------------


 | HbSC, where one gene is HbS, and the other is HbC (inherited by a non-SCD impacted parent); and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | HbS/ßthal, where one gene is HbS, and the other is Beta thalassemia.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------

 Market Opportunity in SCD 
 The CDC estimates the prevalence of SCD at 90,000 to 100,000 individuals in the United States, where newborn screening is mandatory. The incidence of SCD is estimated at approximately 1 in 2,000 to 2,500 newborns in the United States. It is estimated that the prevalence of SCD in Europe is approximately 60,000 individuals. The global incidence of SCD is estimated to be 250,000 to 300,000 births annually. SCD is concentrated in populations of African, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. 
 Of SCD patients in the United States, approximately 45% are under the age of 18, and approximately 60% to 65% have the HbSS genotype, which is often referred to as sickle cell anemia, with the remaining 35% to 40% having other genotypes. In all genotypes of SCD, the mechanism that leads to the consequences of the disease involves the polymerization of HbS in its deoxygenated state, which results in RBC sickling. We believe that because of this common underlying mechanism, GBT440 may show activity across all SCD genotypes. Our Phase 3 HOPE study is enrolling SCD patients with all genotypes of SCD. 
 SCD is associated with high treatment costs. One study estimates that in the United States, the average annual cost for the care of an adult patient with the most common genotype of SCD exceeds $200,000, and the 
 
5 
 
 cumulative lifetime costs exceed $8.0 million over an assumed 50-year lifespan, driven primarily by hospital admissions, physician fees, clinic and emergency department visits and the costs of diagnostic procedures and outpatient consultations. As a result, we believe that a safe, effective and convenient oral treatment for SCD would be well received by patients, physicians and payors. 
 Current Treatment Options and Their Limitations 
 SCD remains a significant unmet medical need. The only drug approved to treat SCD, known as hydroxyurea, which was initially approved as a chemotherapy drug, was approved by the FDA in 1998 for the treatment of sickle cell anemia in adults with 3 or more painful crises per year. Hydroxyurea is currently the only drug approved for SCD, and it is not approved for pediatric SCD patients in the United States. The use of hydroxyurea is significantly limited by its side effect profile, variable patient responses and concerns regarding long-term toxicity. Hydroxyureas side effects include impairment of fertility, suppression of white blood cells, or neutropenia, and suppression of platelets, or thrombocytopenia, which place patients at risk for infection and bleeding. 
 In addition to hydroxyurea treatment, transfusions with normal blood are an option to help alleviate anemia, which is a common symptom of SCD, and reduce sickling of RBCs. Blood transfusions have a number of limitations, including the expense of treatment, lack of uniform accessibility and risks ranging from allergic reactions to serious complications such as blood-borne infection and iron overload, which can cause organ damage. The only potentially curative treatment currently available for SCD patients is bone marrow transplantation, which requires a suitable matching donor and carries significant risks, including an approximately 5% mortality rate. Despite the current standard of care, including hydroxyurea, blood transfusion and palliative therapy for acute pain attacks, patients with SCD continue to suffer serious morbidity and premature mortality. 
 In light of the devastating effects of SCD on patients and the high costs of care for these patients, there is a significant unmet need for a treatment that: 
 
 | inhibits abnormal hemoglobin polymer formation, the underlying mechanism of RBC sickling;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | stops inappropriate RBC destruction and improves blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | prevents or reduces the episodes or crises of severe pain associated with SCD;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | modifies the long-term course of the disease;
--+----------------------------------------------


 | is effective in all SCD genotypes, and in both children and adults;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | has a more favorable side effect profile than currently available therapies; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | is available as a convenient, oral therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------

Overview of Hemoglobin Biology and GBT440s Mechanism of Action 
 As described above, hemoglobin accomplishes transports oxygen from the lungs to the bodys tissues, releases oxygen into the tissues, and returns carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs by changing its shape to be high affinity for oxygen in the lungs, where oxygen is abundant, and low affinity for oxygen in the tissues, where oxygen must be released. An important tool for assessing how readily hemoglobin acquires and binds oxygen in the lungs and releases oxygen into the tissues is the oxygen equilibrium curve, or OEC. The OEC represents the proportion of oxyhemoglobin, measured as the percentage of oxygen saturation (O2 % saturation) on the vertical axis relative to the amount of oxygen dissolved in blood, indicated as the oxygen tension, or partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), on the horizontal axis. 
 
6 
 
We have demonstrated in preclinical models that our novel hemoglobin modifiers, including GBT440, bind to hemoglobin, resulting in increased oxygen affinity. The effect of GBT440 on the measured OEC is a shift of the curve to the left on the horizontal axis, as shown in the graph below. In other words, at a given prevailing oxygen tension in the blood, we have observed a higher percentage of oxygen saturation, or a higher proportion of oxyhemoglobin in the blood, following the administration of GBT440. 
 

In various studies of SCD, scientists have demonstrated that hemoglobin in the oxygenated state is a potent inhibitor of HbS polymerization. Since HbS polymerization occurs in the deoxygenated state, we believe that increasing the proportion of oxyhemoglobin, or left-shifting the OEC, should delay the polymerization of HbS and prevent the sickling of RBCs, which may ameliorate many, of the clinical manifestations of SCD. Importantly, we are able to measure the proportion of hemoglobin modification (%HbMOD), which is expressed as the percentage of hemoglobin molecules occupied or bound by GBT440. 
 HbF, which is present during fetal development and persists for up to six to nine months in infants until it is replaced by adult hemoglobin, has an inherent high affinity for oxygen, which is critical for a developing fetus to capture oxygen from the mothers blood. Newborns with SCD do not experience RBC sickling until approximately six to nine months of age, after which HbF is no longer expressed. Additionally, it has been observed that rare individuals who have inherited the HbS mutation and a gene deletion that allows them to continue to express 10% to 30% HbF in their RBCs into adulthood do not exhibit the clinical manifestations of SCD, despite expressing up to 90% sickled hemoglobin, or HbS, in their blood. HbF dilutes the concentration of deoxygenated HbS that can participate in polymerization, and thereby prevents hemoglobin polymer from forming. 
 Based on these observations, we believe that to delay polymerization of HbS, GBT440 would need to bind to only approximately 10% to 30% of the total hemoglobin in a patients blood. One theoretical concern regarding increasing the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen is that excessive oxygen affinity could prevent hemoglobin from releasing oxygen into the tissues, thus causing hypoxia. However, based on HbF data, our animal toxicology studies, and our clinical studies, we believe our target modification of the total hemoglobin in a patients blood would not adversely compromise oxygen delivery to the tissues. 
 Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of GBT440 
 In December 2014, we initiated our first clinical trial of GBT440, a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single and multiple ascending dose study in which we evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of GBT440 in both healthy subjects and patients with SCD. We refer to this Phase 1/2 clinical study as the GBT440-001 study. This clinical study was conducted at Quintiles Drug Research Unit at Guys Hospital in London, United Kingdom, and was conducted in three parts, as shown in Figure 1 below: Part A (single dose administration), Part B (multiple dose administration, daily for 15 days in healthy subjects and 28 days in SCD subjects), and Part C (multiple dose administration, daily for 90 days in SCD subjects). An extension study for patients in Part C to dose some patients for up to 6 months is referred to as GBT440-024. We evaluated GBT440s ability to prevent the hemolysis or destruction of RBCs in SCD subjects primarily by 
 
7 
 
 measuring the blood levels of hemoglobin, bilirubin and reticulocyte counts. We also measured LDH as an additional marker of hemolysis; however it is generally more variable and nonspecific because it is released from tissues other than RBCs and does not measure extravascular hemolysis which is the primary hemolytic mechanism in SCD. In this clinical trial, we also evaluated the effect of GBT440 on morphologic sickling of RBCs. We believe that findings of decreased hemolysis and anti-sickling activity provide evidence of inhibition of sickle hemoglobin polymerization, which may translate into improved symptoms, reduction in clinical events (such as vaso-occlusive crisis) and reduced organ damage due to RBC sickling. 
 Figure 1  Study Design of our Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial of GBT440 
 

We reported initial results from our GBT440-001 Phase 1/2 clinical trial at the American Society of Hematology, or ASH, meeting in December 2015, additional results from this clinical trial at the European Hematological Association meeting in June 2016 and additional results at the ASH meeting in December 2016. As of the most recent data available to us in November 2016 in preparation for the ASH meeting, we dosed 48 subjects in Part A single dose administration cohorts. Additionally, in Part B multiple dose administration cohorts, we dosed 62 subjects, comprised of 24 healthy volunteers (18 of whom received GBT440 and six of whom received placebo) and 38 SCD subjects (28 of whom received GBT440 and 10 of whom received placebo). We initiated the first cohort in the Part C 90-day dose administration in SCD subjects in December 2015 and presented these data at EHA. Additionally, we initiated an extension study, GBT440-024, to allow for the 90 day 900 mg cohort to receive GBT440 for up to six months. Also, 2 subjects with SCD have been enrolled in an ongoing cohort of subjects with HbSC or HbS/ ß+thalassemia. 
 Overall, a total of 261 subjects, including 205 healthy subjects and 49 adult SCD subjects and 7 adolescent subjects with SCD, have been administered single or multiple doses of GBT440 across 11 clinical studies. A total of 97 subjects (48 healthy subjects and 49 SCD subjects) have received GBT440 in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial, GBT440-001 and its extension to 6 months, GBT440-024. Seven adolescent participants (median age of 16 years) received a single dose of GBT440 at 600 mg in the single dose and pharmacokinetic portion (Part A) of Study GBT440-007. In addition to these Phase 1/2 clinical trials, there are eight clinical pharmacology studies (four completed and four ongoing), in which a total of 157 healthy subjects have received GBT440. The most commonly reported adverse events, or AEs, regardless of treatment causality, across SCD subjects included mild or moderate headache, pain (both headache and pain were reported more frequently in the placebo arm than in the GBT440 treatment arms), rash, back pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and cough. All events of diarrhea were mild. Most of these events resolved without treatment and are easily monitored. Some adults with SCD experienced acute painful sickle cell crisis in the follow-up period after drug discontinuation or dose holds, which was thought to be related to underlying SCD, and not to GBT440.

Based on data available for review in November 2016 from our Phase 1/2 clinical study, no drug-related serious adverse events, or SAEs, have been reported. No SAEs were reported in the single dose cohorts or in healthy subjects who received multiple doses of GBT440. A total of 10 SAEs, each of which were assessed to be not related to study drug, were reported in SCD subjects in the multiple dose cohorts. 
 The pharmacokinetic data from SCD subjects shows a dose proportional increase in GBT440 exposure following single and multiple dosing. The half-life was observed to be approximately 2.8 days in healthy subjects and 1.6 days in SCD subjects. The shorter half-life in SCD subjects may be due to higher RBC turnover and/or anemia in SCD. 
 Among the 41 SCD patients who received multiple doses of GBT440 (at doses of either 500 mg, 700 mg, 900 mg, or 1000 mg per day) in our Phase 1/2 clinical study for 28 days up to six months, 100% of study subjects demonstrated a hematologic response to GBT440 therapy, as evidenced by significant improvement in one or more clinical markers of hemolysis and anemia (hemoglobin, unconjugated bilirubin and percentage reticulocyte counts). In addition, all study cohorts showed marked reductions in irreversibly sickled RBCs in the peripheral blood from baseline, and all study subjects treated for 90 days up to six months showed sustained improvement in bilirubin and percentage of reticulocyte counts, continued reductions in sickled RBCs and a median 1.0g/dL increase in hemoglobin. There was no evidence of tissue hypoxia; trends to erythropoietin reductions and the reduction in reticulocyte counts were consistent with an improvement in tissue oxygen delivery; oxygen delivery to tissues at rest and during exercise was normal. 
 As presented at the ASH meeting in December 2016, the tables below show that SCD subjects in our Phase 1/2 study who were treated for 90 days to six months with GBT440 showed a durable and significant hemoglobin increase as compared to placebo. In addition, SCD subjects in this study showed sustained improvements in bilirubin level as well as counts of reticulocyte and irreversibly sickled cells, and a greater increase in hemoglobin than at day 28.

Day 1 | Day 90 (GBT440 700 mg)

 We believe the expanding clinical evidence demonstrating that GBT440 was well tolerated up to 6 months of dosing and that GBT440 inhibits irreversibly sickled cells, improves hemolytic anemia, and reduces RBC damage continues to support the potential for GBT440 to serve as a disease-modifying therapy for SCD. 
 Phase 3 HOPE Study of GBT 440 
 The HOPE study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-national, Phase 3 clinical trial enrolling up to 400 adult and adolescent SCD patients age 12 and older who have had at least one episode of vaso-occlusive crisis, or VOC, in the previous year (see Figure 3). The HOPE study is being conducted in two-parts: the initial Part A, which will compare two dose levels of GBT440 (900 mg and 1500 mg) versus placebo, and will include up to 150 patients; followed by Part B, which will include 250 patients randomized to placebo or a dose of GBT440 selected based on the results of Part A. The main objectives of Part A are to select the optimal dose, define the final secondary endpoints for Part B and qualify the Patient Reported Outcome, or PRO, instrument. The primary efficacy endpoint of the HOPE study is the proportion of patients who achieve a >1 g/dL increase in hemoglobin at 24 weeks of treatment compared to baseline. Our discussions with the FDA have 
 
10 
 
 focused on a path way to full approval based on the HOPE study, by meeting the primary and at least one key secondary endpoint, though achieving this outcome will depend in large part on the data and results obtained from the study itself. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include the effect of GBT440 on SCD symptom exacerbation, which will be measured by our PRO instrument, in addition to overall SCD symptoms as compared to placebo. The PRO is administered on a hand-held electronic device, and is designed to capture the full range of daily SCD symptoms. The HOPE study will also assess traditionally defined VOC as well as hospitalizations and red blood cell transfusions as secondary endpoints. 
 Figure 3: Phase 3 HOPE Study Design 
 

We plan to conduct the Phase 3 HOPE Study at leading SCD sites around the globe, enrolling adults and adolescents with SCD who have had at least one episode of VOC in the previous year. The HOPE Study was initiated in December 2016 and we anticipate receipt of top-line data results in the first half of 2019. 
European Union Regulatory Path for GBT440 
 We are engaged in discussions with European regulatory authorities to define the future development plan for GBT440. The objectives of these regulatory interactions include discussion of study design for additional clinical trials, trial endpoints and the development of GBT440 in other patient populations, including pediatrics. 
 In November 2016, the European Commission, or EC, granted Orphan Drug Designation status in the European Union, or EU, for GBT440 for the treatment of SCD. 
 Evaluation of GBT440 in Hypoxemic Pulmonary Disorders 
 In hypoxemic pulmonary disorders, where the lungs cannot supply adequate oxygen to the blood, we believe that hemoglobin modifiers such as GBT440 that left-shift the oxy-hemoglobin equilibrium curve have the potential to enable increased oxygen uptake in the lungs, resulting in increased blood oxygen saturation and improved oxygen delivery to tissues. The primary goal in treating patients affected by these disorders is to compensate for the reduced oxygen diffusion associated with the underlying lung disease by increasing hemoglobin oxygen affinity and in turn increasing blood oxygen content. 
 
11 
 
We are evaluating our lead product candidate GBT440 in patients with IPF, a fatal disease characterized by irreversible, progressive fibrosis or scarring of the lungs. The prognosis is poor for patients with IPF, which typically occurs primarily in people over 50 years old, with a median survival time from diagnosis of two to three years. It is estimated that there are less than 150,000 patients with IPF in the United States. The scarring of the lungs leads to a reduction in the diffusion of oxygen from the lung to the blood resulting in hypoxemia, or low blood oxygen levels, which is believed to play a key role in IPF patients symptoms, disease co-morbidities and adverse patient outcomes. Ultimately, the progressive worsening of lung function over time leads to organ dysfunction, frequent hospitalizations and death. Since GBT440 is intended to specifically treat the hypoxemia associated with IPF, we believe that if GBT440 is shown to be safe and effective in IPF patients, it may have the potential to be administered in combination with other therapeutics that focus on slowing the rate of disease progression, such as pirfenidone and nintedanib. 
 Supplemental oxygen therapy is a well-established treatment in chronic hypoxemic conditions, but is associated with a significant burden on the patients quality of life due to demands of the delivery equipment that ultimately can lead to significantly impaired mobility and psychosocial decline. In addition, IPF patients who are prescribed supplemental oxygen therapy may still have significant periods of oxygen desaturation, leading to symptoms and reductions in physical activity. Accordingly, we believe an orally administered drug that improves oxygen uptake and delivery may improve dyspnea, cough and other symptoms related to hypoxemia and may have the potential to improve quality of life, reduce IPF exacerbations and healthcare utilization. 
 We have observed in a mouse model of hypoxia, referred to below as Study 1 that oral dosing with a hemoglobin-modifying analog of GBT440 reduces hypoxemia under conditions of extreme hypoxia (5% oxygen, far lower than 21% atmospheric or room air oxygen). Furthermore, treated animals demonstrated improved hemodynamic measures including blood pressure and increased survival rates compared to control, as shown in the figure below. We believe this result is based upon the compounds effect on increased hemoglobin oxygen affinity and the associated increase in blood oxygen content. 
 Study 1: Increased survival in animals treated with GBT440 analog and exposed to hypoxia (5% oxygen) 
 

Based on the results of Study 1, we initiated additional animal studies in two disease models of acute hypoxemic lung injury and bleomycin-induced fibrosis. In these animal studies, we also observed improvements in hypoxemia and tissue oxygenation in animals treated with the hemoglobin-modifying analog of GBT440 compared to controls. 
 In the fibrosis model (Study 3), bleomycin was administered to induce fibrosis and hypoxemia over a period of two weeks and then treated with a GBT440 analog or control. As shown in the graph below, the administration of the GBT440 analog resulted in a significant improvement in hypoxemia (oxygen saturation). The results of these studies suggest that a hemoglobin-modifying agent such as GBT440 may improve oxygen uptake in a lung with compromised oxygen diffusion capacity, such as fibrosis.

Study 3: Increased oxygen saturation in animals treated with GBT440 analog in bleomycin induced lung fibrosis 
 

Based on these results, we have initiated two Phase 2a clinical studies of GBT440 in IPF patients with hypoxemia: GBT440-006 and GBT440-026 (which we have named the ZEPHYR study). In addition, we have initiated a Phase 1 study of GBT440 in healthy volunteers relating to hypoxemic conditions. 
 Phase 2a GBT440-006 Study 
 In June 2016, we initiated our first Phase 2a clinical trial of GBT440 in IPF. GBT440-006 is a randomized placebo-controlled clinical study evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and effect on hypoxemia of GBT440 in patients with IPF who are hypoxemic on exertion. Approximately 30 IPF patients, 45 to 80 years of age, are being enrolled to receive either 900 mg or 600mg of GBT440 or matching placebo orally, daily for 28 days. The primary endpoint for the study is to evaluate the safety of GBT440 over a 58-day period. Key secondary endpoints include evaluating the effect of GBT440 on oxygen saturation, IPF-related symptoms using patient reported outcomes as well as the six-minute walk distance. The study will also assess the pharmacokinetic profile of GBT440 in IPF patients. 
 Phase 2a GBT 440-026 (ZEPHYR) Study 
 In November 2016, we initiated our second Phase 2a clinical trial in IPF, which we refer to as the ZEPHYR study. The ZEPHYR study is an open-label clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of GBT440 in subjects with IPF who have hypoxemia at rest and require supplemental oxygen. Approximately 16 IPF subjects, 45 to 80 years of age, are being enrolled to receive 900 mg of GBT440 orally, daily for 90 days. The primary endpoint for the study is to evaluate the effect of GBT440 on oxygen saturation at rest over a 90-day period. Secondary endpoints include evaluating the effect of GBT440 on the requirement for supplemental oxygen, IPF-related symptoms and quality of life using patient reported outcomes as well as the six-minute walk distance. 
 Phase 1 GBT 440-0111 (Basecamp) Study 
 In February 2017, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the physiologic effects of GBT440 in healthy volunteers under hypoxemic conditions and exercise conditions that maximally stress heart and lung function, which we refer to as the Basecamp study. The Basecamp study is intended to support our understanding of GBT440s effects on hypoxemia and complement our ongoing Phase 2a program in IPF. 
Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently depend on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for all of our requirements of raw materials, drug substance and drug product for our non-clinical research and our ongoing clinical trials of our lead product candidate GBT440. We have not entered into long-term commercial manufacturing agreements with our current CMOs. We intend to continue to rely on CMOs for later-stage development and commercialization of GBT440, as well as the development and commercialization of any other product candidates that we may identify. Although we rely on CMOs, we have personnel and third-party consultants with extensive manufacturing experience to oversee the relationships with our contract manufacturers. 
 
13 
 
We believe the synthesis of the drug substance for GBT440 is reliable and reproducible from readily available starting materials, and the synthetic routes are amenable to large-scale production and do not require unusual equipment or handling in the manufacturing process. We have obtained an adequate supply of the drug substance for GBT440 from our CMOs to satisfy our immediate clinical and nonclinical demands. We have implemented improvements to our drug substance manufacturing process to further ensure production capacity adequate to meet future development and potential commercial demands. 
 We have completed development for a solid oral formulation of a tablet form of GBT440, and are continuing to develop potential pediatric formulations. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents and patent applications intended to cover our product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture, and any other aspects of inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. 
 We plan to continue to expand our intellectual property portfolio. We endeavor to promptly file domestic and international patent applications for new commercially valuable inventions, including applications directed to compositions and methods of treatment created or identified from our ongoing development of our product candidates. Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary rights protecting our commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our current and future issued patents, if any, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our intellectual property portfolio. 
 The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies like us are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent, if any, is issued, and patent scope can be reinterpreted by the courts after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any patents, if issued, will provide sufficient protection from competitors for our business. 
 Because patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially even longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in interference proceedings or derivation proceedings declared by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, to determine the priority of inventions. 
 Patents 
 Our patent portfolio includes seven issued U.S. patents, as well as multiple U.S. and foreign patent applications in various stages of prosecution or allowance. Our patent applications and patents fall into two categories: those relating our lead product candidate GBT440 or otherwise to our lead development program; and those relating to any of our other research and development programs over time, such as our now-discontinued research program for kallikrein modulators. 
 Our patent portfolios related to our lead program are comprised of multiple patent families relating to GBT440 and analogs, and include patent applications related to GBT440 covering certain compositions of matter, methods of use, method of manufacture, formulations, and polymorphs of GBT440, as well as certain compositions of matter and methods of use for GBT440 analogs. These patent applications are pending in a variety of jurisdictions, including the United States, jurisdictions under the Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, 
 
14 
 
 Argentina, Taiwan and other countries. With regard to our lead product candidate GBT440 specifically, we are the sole owner of three issued U.S. patents that cover GBT440 (U.S. Patent Nos. 9,018,210, 9,248,199, and 9,447,071). U.S. Patent No. 9,018,210, issued on April 28, 2015, covers the composition of matter for GBT440, U.S. Patent No. 9,248,199, issued on February 2, 2016, covers methods of use of GBT440, and U.S. Patent No. 9,447,071, issued on September 20, 2016, and covers a polymorph of GBT440. These issued U.S. patents covering our lead product candidate will expire in 2032, 2034, and 2035, respectively, absent any applicable patent term extensions. Any patents that may issue from our other patent applications relating to GBT440 in the United States or from corresponding PCT and foreign patent applications, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2032 and 2037, absent any applicable patent term extensions. Some of these pending patent applications are jointly owned by us and Regents of the University of California, or the Regents, as described below. 
 In addition, we own additional issued U.S. patents related to our lead program covering the composition of matter for GBT440 analogs, which were granted in 2015 and 2016, and are currently expected to expire in 2032 and 2033, respectively, absent any applicable patent term extensions. Any patents that may issue from the other patent applications relating to GBT440 analogs in the United States or from corresponding PCT and foreign patent applications, if issued, would be expected to expire between 2032 and 2033, absent any applicable patent term extensions. Some of these pending patent applications are jointly owned by us and the Regents. 
 In addition, we own jointly with and have exclusively licensed from the Regents worldwide patent rights to U.S. Patent No. 9,012,450 and to several pending U.S. patent applications covering GBT440 and GBT440 analogs. In exchange for our exclusive license, we have agreed to pay a royalty to the Regents of less than 1% on future net sales and to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture, market and sell the products covered by the licensed patents. The risks associated with joint ownership of patent rights are more fully discussed under Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property. 
 Patent term 
 The base term of a U.S. patent is 20 years from the filing date of the earliest-filed non-provisional patent application from which the patent claims priority, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid. The term of a U.S. patent can be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates the owner of the patent for administrative delays at the USPTO the extent of which is offset by delays by the patent owner before the USPTO in obtaining the patent. In some cases, the term of a U.S. patent is shortened by a terminal disclaimer that reduces its term to that of an earlier-expiring patent. The term of a U.S. patent may be eligible for patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act, to account for at least some of the time the drug is under development and regulatory review after the patent is granted. With regard to a drug for which FDA approval is the first permitted marketing of the active ingredient, the Hatch-Waxman Act allows for extension of the term of one U.S. patent that includes at least one claim covering the composition of matter of an FDA-approved drug, an FDA-approved method of treatment using the drug and/or a method of manufacturing the FDA-approved drug. The extended patent term cannot exceed the shorter of five years beyond the non-extended expiration of the patent or 14 years from the date of the FDA approval of the drug. Some foreign jurisdictions, including Europe and Japan, have analogous patent term extension provisions, which allow for extension of the term of a patent that covers a drug approved by the applicable foreign regulatory agency. In the future, if our lead product candidate GBT440 or any other product candidates receive FDA approval, we would expect to apply for patent term extension on patents, if issued, covering those products, their methods of use and/or methods of manufacture. 
 Trade secrets 
 In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our competitive position. We typically rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We protect trade secrets and know-how by establishing confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. These agreements generally provide that all confidential information developed or made known during the course of an individual or entities relationship with us must be kept confidential during 
 
15 
 
 and after the relationship. These agreements also typically provide that all inventions resulting from work performed for us or relating to our business and conceived or completed during the period of employment or assignment, as applicable, shall be our exclusive property. In addition, we take other appropriate precautions, such as physical and technological security measures, to guard against misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We intend to begin building a commercial infrastructure in the United States and to consider building additional capabilities that may be necessary to effectively support the commercialization of GBT440 when we believe a regulatory approval in a particular geography is likely. Because SCD is a rare disease in several significant geographic markets, with a concentrated prescribing audience and a small number of key opinion leaders who significantly influence the treatments prescribed for the relevant patient population, we believe that we can effectively address the market using our own targeted, specialty sales and marketing organization supported by internal sales personnel, an internal marketing group and distribution support. Additional capabilities important to the SCD and hematology marketplace include the management of key accounts such as managed care organizations, specialty pharmacies and government accounts. 
 Outside of the United States and core European markets, where appropriate, we may utilize strategic partners, distributors or contract sales forces to expand the commercial availability of GBT440. In addition, we believe the other indications that we may pursue with our product candidates can also be addressed with a small, dedicated sales force. We currently do not expect that we will require large pharmaceutical partners for the commercialization of our product candidates, although we may consider partnering in certain territories or indications or for other strategic purposes. We intend to evaluate our commercialization strategy as we advance our preclinical programs in other rare disease indications. 
 Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. There are many public and private biopharmaceutical companies, universities, governmental agencies and other research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be similar to our product candidates or address similar markets. In addition, the number of companies seeking to develop and commercialize products and therapies similar to our product candidates is likely to increase. 
 In the area of SCD, we expect to face competition from hydroxyurea (marketed as DROXIA or Hydrea by Bristol-Myers Squibb Company as well as in generic form), which is currently the only approved therapeutic for the treatment of adults with SCD. Several companies are also developing product candidates for chronic treatment in SCD, including Novartis AG, which is engaged in the clinical development of crizanlizumab, an anti-P-selectin monoclonal antibody, Sancilio, which has announced they will be initiating a phase 3 trial for SC411, docosahexaenoic acid, and Emmaus, which has filed an NDA for pharmaceutical grade L-glutamine. Several other agents are in early clinical trials investigating new mechanisms of action for the chronic treatment of SCD. We also expect to face competition from one-time therapies for SCD, including hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, gene therapy and gene editing. For example, bluebird bio, Inc. is currently engaged in the clinical development of LentiGlobin BB305, which aims to treat SCD by inserting a functional human beta-globin gene into the patients own hematopoietic stem cells, or HSCs, ex vivo and then transplanting the modified stem cell into the patients bloodstream. While not directly competitive with preventative agents like GBT440, several agents are also in development for the acute treatment of SCD crises including rivipansel, being developed by Pfizer Inc. 
 In the area of IPF, we expect to face competition from the approved therapeutics, including pirfenidone (marketed by Genentech a member of the Roche Group as Esbriet in the U.S., Canada, EU, and other markets, by Shionogi as Pirespa in Japan, and in generic form in certain markets) and nintedanib, marketed by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH in the U.S. and EU as Ofev. In addition, there are several other anti-fibrotic agents in Phase 2 studies that could impact the future IPF landscape. Since GBT440s approach is to address the hypoxemic aspects of IPF, we believe that GBT440 could be administered potentially in combination with other disease modifying therapeutics such as pirfenidone and nintedanib. 
 
16 
 
Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of treatments and the commercialization of those treatments. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Government Regulation 
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Pricing of such products is also subject to regulation in many countries. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific to each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 U.S. drug development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDAs refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or withdrawals from the market, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the New Drug Application, or NDA, process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of extensive non-clinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including the FDAs GLP regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical-trial related regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational drug for each proposed indication;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA, for a new drug;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA whether to accept it for filing and review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
17 
 

 | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | potential FDA audit of the non-clinical and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The non-clinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any of our product candidates, including GBT440, will be granted on a timely basis, or at all. The data required to support an NDA is generated in two distinct development stages: non-clinical and clinical. The non-clinical development stage generally involves synthesizing the active component, developing the formulation and determining the manufacturing process, as well as carrying out non-human toxicology, pharmacology and drug metabolism studies in the laboratory, which support subsequent clinical testing in humans. As the drug sponsor, we must submit the results of the non-clinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the drug candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsors control, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There are also requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 Clinical trials 
 Clinical trials are generally conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials, which may overlap. 
 

 | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the product candidate.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose of the product candidate required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve large numbers of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product candidate for its intended use, its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product approval. Phase 3 clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
18 
 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval, to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA. 
 As the drug sponsor, we must submit progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials and other information at least annually to the FDA, as well as written IND safety reports to the FDA and the study investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, must include methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 NDA and FDA review process 
 The results of nonclinical studies and clinical trials, together with other detailed information, including extensive manufacturing information and information on the composition of the drug and proposed labeling, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug for one or more specified indications. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP requirements to assure and preserve the products identity, strength, quality and purity. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA is typically accompanied by a user fee (adjusted on an annual basis). According to the FDAs fee schedule, effective through September 30, 2017, the user fee for an NDA is approximately $2 million. PDUFA also imposes an annual product fee for human drugs (approximately $98,000). Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business having fewer than 500 employees. Additionally, an application for a product that has been designated as a drug for a rare disease or condition (referred to as an orphan drug) under section 526 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act is not subject to an application fee unless the application includes an indication for other than a rare disease or condition. GBT440 for the treatment of sickle cell disease has been granted orphan drug designation by the FDA and by the European Commission. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. The FDA is supposed to make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt of the submission. Once the NDA is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA is supposed to complete its initial review of an NDA that it has accepted for review and respond to the applicant within stated periods (within 10 months for a standard NDA and six months for an NDA designated by the 
 
19 
 
 agency for priority review). However, the FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product (including the facilities of contract manufacturers, if applicable) to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA may also audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. There are likely to be extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. The review and evaluation of an NDA by the FDA is very comprehensive and time consuming and may take longer than originally planned to complete. 
 After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application will not be approved in its present form, and usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The complete response letter may require additional clinical data and/or additional clinical trial(s), and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. 
 United States Orphan drug designation 
 We were granted orphan drug designation for GBT440 for the treatment of SCD by the FDA in 2015. Under the Orphan Drug Act in the United States, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States (or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States in limited circumstances). Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process, but does confer other potential development and commercialization benefits as described below. 
 If we submit an NDA seeking approval for GBT440 for the treatment of sickle cell disease, this NDA submission should qualify for the orphan user fee exemption from the PDUFA application fee. In addition, we should qualify for additional incentives, including tax credits for qualifying clinical trials, and may also qualify for a substantial period of market exclusivity. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or by providing a major contribution to patient care. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product for a different indication than that for which the orphan product has exclusivity. A competitor could also block the approval of one of our products for seven years by obtaining orphan product exclusivity for the same product (or a competitor product that contains our product candidate) for the same indication we are 
 
20 
 
 seeking (although we are not aware that any competitor is seeking to develop GBT440 for sickle cell disease alone or as part of a competitors product). If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union, or EU, has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 In addition to the US orphan drug designation, our product candidate GBT440 has received a Fast Track designation from the FDA for the potential treatment of sickle cell disease. The FDAs Fast Track program is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life threatening condition, where nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a Fast Track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review. 
 A product candidate may obtain accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or another significant clinical benefit. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require that the drug sponsor perform post-approval clinical trials, and may impose marketing restrictions to limit distribution or use to assure safe use of the drug. 
 Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as a Fast Track designation, in addition to intensive guidance from FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Pediatric information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and efficacy of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, which was signed into law in 2012, requires that a sponsor who is planning to submit a marketing application for a drug that includes a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration submit an initial Pediatric Study Plan, or PSP, within sixty days of an end-of-Phase 2 meeting or, if there is no end-of-Phase 2 meeting as early as practicable before the initiation of the Phase 3 or Phase 2/3 study. The initial PSP must include an outline of the pediatric study or studies that the sponsor plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, age groups, relevant endpoints and statistical approach, or a justification for not including such detailed information, and any request for a deferral of pediatric assessments or a full or partial waiver of the requirement to provide data from pediatric studies along with supporting information. The FDA and the sponsor must reach agreement on the PSP. A sponsor can submit amendments to an agreed-upon initial PSP at any time if changes to the pediatric plan need to be considered based on data collected from non-clinical studies, early phase clinical trials, and/or other clinical development programs. 
 
21 
 
Post-marketing requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, a pharmaceutical company and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences and complying with complex promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for uses or for patient populations for which the drug was not approved (known as off-label use), and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and on interactions with healthcare providers. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use of these materials, and may be required to be reviewed in advance in certain circumstances such as a new product launch. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, the pharmaceutical company may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require additional data or the conduct of additional non-clinical studies and clinical trials. 
 FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMP requirements. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP requirements. Our third party manufacturers must comply with cGMP requirements that require among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation, and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of violative conditions, including failure to conform to cGMP requirements, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including recall. 
 Other regulatory matters 
 Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities following product approval are also subject to regulation by numerous regulatory authorities in addition to the FDA, including, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services, the United States Department of Justice, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Trade Commission, the Occupational Safety & Health Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency and state and local governments. 
 For example, in the United States, sales, marketing and scientific/educational programs must also comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws. These laws include the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf) to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order, or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Violations of this law are punishable by up to five years in prison, criminal fines, administrative civil money penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and criminal healthcare fraud statutes created by the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act. 
 
22 
 
Moreover, although as a drug manufacturer we would not submit claims directly to payors, drug manufacturers can be held liable under the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. The government may deem manufacturers to have caused the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state, and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties of between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and the potential implication of various federal criminal statutes. 
 Pricing and rebate programs must comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. The handling of any controlled substances must comply with the U.S. Controlled Substances Act and Controlled Substances Import and Export Act. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. 
 The distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. 
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals, or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our managements attention from the operation of our business. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future products marketed by us could materially affect our business in an adverse way. 
 Changes in regulations, statutes or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements; (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling; (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products; or (iv) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect the operation of our business. 
 United States patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of any of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the products approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the patent term extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves 
 
23 
 
 any application for patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our GBT440 product candidate, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Marketing exclusivity provisions under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act provide a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to obtain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. So far as we are aware, GBT440 would qualify as a new chemical entity under these provisions. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another drug based on the same active moiety, regardless of whether the drug is intended for the same indication as the original innovator drug or for another indication, where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator who holds the NDA for the active agent. 
 The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA for a drug product that contains an active moiety that has been previously approved if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the modification for which the drug received approval on the basis of the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the active agent for the original indication. 
 Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA by a competitor. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the nonclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Orphan drug exclusivity, as described above, may offer a seven-year period of marketing exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States which, if granted, adds six months to the end of existing exclusivity periods and patent terms, and may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric trial in accordance with an FDA-issued pre-approval written request for such a pediatric trial where information relating to the use of the product candidate in a pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population. 
 European Union drug development and Orphan Drug designation 
 In the EU, our product candidates may also be subject to extensive regulatory requirements. As in the United States, medicinal products can only be marketed if a marketing authorization from the competent regulatory authorities has been obtained. 
 Similar to the United States, the various phases of nonclinical and clinical research in the EU are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority, or NCA, and one or more Ethics Committees, or ECs. Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred. 
 The EU clinical trials legislation is currently undergoing an ongoing revision process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining the clinical trials authorization process, simplifying adverse event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials, and increasing their transparency. 
 
24 
 
In November 2016, the European Commission, acting on a positive recommendation from the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, or COMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, designated GBT440 as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of sickle cell disease. Orphan drug status in the EU has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits to US orphan drug status, including 10 years of marketing exclusivity from the approval of the marketing application, designated product-specific consultation by the EMA, and certain reductions or exemptions in regulatory fees. 
 European Union drug review and approval 
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. There are two types of marketing authorizations: 
 The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines, and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions, and viral diseases. This mandatory Centralized Procedure applies in the case of GBT440 for sickle cell disease, in light of the 2016 designation of GBT440 as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of sickle cell disease. 
 The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State, or RMS. The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics, or SPC, and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SPC, labeling, or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
 Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. 
 European Union new chemical entity exclusivity 
 In the EU, new chemical entities, sometimes referred to as new active substances, qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. The data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovators data to assess a generic application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovators data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of 11 years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are determined to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
 
25 
 
European Union orphan designation and exclusivity 
 In the EU, the European Commission, after reviewing the opinion of the EMAs Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products grants orphan drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the EU Community (or where it is unlikely that the development of the medicine would generate sufficient return to justify the investment) and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or, if a method exists, the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). 
 In the EU, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the orphan drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an application for marketing approval. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. In November 2016 we were granted orphan drug designation in the EU for GBT440 for the potential treatment of SCD. 
 Rest of the world regulation 
 For other countries outside of the EU and the United States, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. Additionally, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution. 
 Reimbursement 
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. The coverage determination process is often time-consuming and costly and is likely to require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor individually, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid health care costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, and mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies share of sales to federal health care programs. Adoption of general controls and measures, coupled with the tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit payments for pharmaceutical drugs. 
 The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturers outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Effective in 2010, the ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, and adding a 
 
26 
 
 new rebate calculation for line extensions (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products and potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits (phased-in by 2014). 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or the MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Any negotiated prices for any of our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. 
 For a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer. As of 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing, although under the current state of the law these newly eligible entities (with the exception of childrens hospitals) will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs. As 340B drug pricing is determined based on AMP and Medicaid rebate data, the revisions to the Medicaid rebate formula and AMP definition described above could cause the required 340B discount to increase. 
 As noted above, the marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. We expect that an increasing emphasis on cost containment measures in the United States will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products, for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Historically, products launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products, if approved.
