Item 1. Business
General
In this Annual Report, “we,” “us,” “our,” "GCI," "GCI Liberty," and “the Company” refer to GCI Liberty, Inc. and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Prior to February 20, 2018, we were known as General Communication, Inc. On February 20, 2018, the Comissioner of the Department of Commerce, Community and Economic Development of the State of Alaska accepted for filing the amended and restated Articles of Incorporation that were approved by our shareholders at a special meeting held on February 2, 2018. The name change is a result of the Transactions described in "Part 1 - Item 1. Business - Narrative Description of our Business - Development of our Business During the Past Fiscal Year." Additionally, as of February 20, 2018, our Class A common stock and Class B common stock were reclassified into Class A-1 common stock and Class B-1 common stock, respectively. 
GCI was incorporated in 1979 under the laws of the State of Alaska and has its principal executive offices at 2550 Denali Street, Suite 1000, Anchorage, AK 99503-2781 (telephone number 907-868-5600).

Narrative Description of our Business

3

General
We are the largest Alaska-based communications provider as measured by revenues. We provide a full range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, businesses, governmental entities, and educational and medical institutions primarily in Alaska under our GCI brand. Due to the unique nature of the markets we serve, including harsh winter weather and remote geographies, our customers rely extensively on our systems to meet their communication and entertainment needs. 
Since our founding in 1979 as a competitive long distance provider, we have consistently expanded our product portfolio and facilities to become the leading integrated communication services provider in our markets. Our facilities include redundant and geographically diverse digital undersea fiber optic cable systems linking our Alaska terrestrial networks to the networks of other carriers in the lower 48 contiguous states.  We operate the only statewide wireless network. 
For the year ended December 31, 2017, we generated consolidated revenues of $919.2 million.  We ended the period with 219,400 wireless subscribers and 134,800 cable modem subscribers.
Development of our Business During the Past Fiscal Year
Transaction with Liberty Interactive Corporation. On April 4, 2017, General Communication, Inc., Liberty Interactive Corporation, a Delaware corporation (“Liberty”) and Liberty Interactive LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty (“Liberty LLC”), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (as may be amended from time to time, the “Reorganization Agreement” and the transactions contemplated thereby, the “Transactions”). Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, General Communication, Inc. amended and restated its articles of incorporation resulting in General Communication, Inc. being renamed GCI Liberty, Inc. and a reclassification and auto conversion of its common stock. Following these events, Liberty will acquire GCI through a reorganization in which certain interests, assets and liabilities of the Liberty Ventures Group (“Liberty Ventures”) will be contributed to GCI Liberty in exchange for a controlling interest in GCI Liberty. The assets to be contributed to GCI Liberty are expected to include Liberty’s equity interests in Liberty Broadband and Charter Communications, Inc. along with certain other equity interests, together with the operating business of Evite, Inc. and certain other assets and liabilities, in exchange for (a) the issuance to Liberty LLC of (i) a number of shares of GCI Liberty Class A Common Stock and a number of shares of GCI Liberty Class B Common Stock equal to the number of outstanding shares of Series A Liberty Ventures common stock and Series B Liberty Ventures common stock outstanding on the closing date of the contribution, respectively, and (ii) cash, and (b) the assumption by GCI Liberty of certain liabilities attributed to Liberty Ventures.
Following the contribution and acquisition of GCI Liberty, Liberty will then effect a tax-free separation of its controlling interest in GCI Liberty to the holders of Liberty Ventures common stock in full redemption of all outstanding shares of such stock. As a result of the Transactions, holders of GCI common stock (regardless of class) each will receive (i) 0.63 of a share of GCI Liberty Class A common stock and (ii) 0.20 of a share of new GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock in exchange for each share of their existing GCI common stock. The exchange ratios were determined based on total consideration of $32.50 per share in respect of each share of existing GCI common stock, comprised of $27.50 per share in GCI Liberty Class A common stock and $5.00 per share in newly issued GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock, based upon a Liberty Ventures reference price of $43.65 (with no premium paid for shares of GCI Class B common stock) and an initial liquidation price of $25.00 per share of GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock. The GCI Liberty Series A Cumulative Redeemable preferred stock will accrue dividends at an initial rate of 5% per annum (which would increase to 7% in connection with a future reincorporation of GCI Liberty in Delaware) and will be redeemable upon the 21st anniversary of the closing. The closing of the Transactions are expected to be consummated on March 9, 2018, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.

Business Strategy
We intend to grow the company using the following strategies:
Expand Our Product Portfolio and Footprint in Alaska. Throughout our history, we have successfully added and expect to continue to add new products to our product portfolio.  We have a demonstrated history of new product evaluation, development and deployment for our customers, and we continue to assess revenue-enhancing 
4

opportunities that create value for our customers.  Where feasible and where economic analysis supports geographic expansion of our network coverage, we are currently pursuing or expect to pursue opportunities to increase the scale of our facilities, enhance our ability to serve our existing customers’ needs and attract new customers. Additionally, due to the unique market conditions in Alaska, we, and in some cases our customers, participate in several federal (and to a lesser extent locally) subsidized programs designed to financially support the implementation and purchase of telecommunications services like ours in high cost areas. With these programs we have been able to expand our network into previously undeveloped areas of Alaska and, for the first time, offer comprehensive communications services in many rural parts of the state where we would not otherwise be able to construct facilities within appropriate return-on-investment requirements.
Make Strategic Acquisitions.  We have a history of making and integrating acquisitions of telecommunications providers and other providers of complementary services.  Our management team will continue to actively pursue and make investments that we believe fit with our strategy and networks and that enhance earnings.
Maximize Sales Opportunities. We sell new and enhanced services and products to our existing customer base to achieve increased revenues and penetration of our services.  Through close coordination of our customer service and sales and marketing efforts, our customer service representatives suggest to our customers other services they can purchase or enhanced versions of services they already purchase.  Many calls into our customer service centers or visits into one of our retail stores result in sales of additional services and products.
Deliver Industry Leading Customer Service. We have positioned ourselves as a customer service leader in the Alaska communications market.  We operate our own customer service department and have empowered our customer service representatives to handle most service issues and questions on a single call.  We prioritize our customer services to expedite handling of our most valuable customers’ issues, particularly for our largest commercial customers.  We believe our integrated approach to customer service, including service set-up, programming various network databases with the customer’s information, installation, and ongoing service, allows us to provide a customer experience that fosters customer loyalty.
Leverage Communications Operations. We continue to expand and evolve our integrated network for the delivery of our services.  Our bundled strategy and integrated approach to serving our customers creates efficiencies of scale and maximizes network utilization.  By offering multiple services, we are better able to leverage our network assets and increase returns on our invested capital.  We periodically evaluate our network assets and continually monitor technological developments that we can potentially deploy to increase network efficiency and performance.
We operate our business under a single reportable segment. Effective in the first quarter of 2017, we reassessed and reorganized our management and internal reporting structures in order to make our operations more efficient, which triggered an analysis of our reportable segments. As a result of our assessment, we merged our former Wireless and Wireline segments into one operating segment. We realigned our external financial reporting to support this change. Our chief operating decision maker assesses our financial performance as follows: 

• | Capital expenditure decisions are based on the support they provide to all revenue streams


• | Revenues are managed on the basis of specific customers and customer groups


• | Costs are generally managed and assessed by function and generally support the organization across all customer groups or revenue streams


• | Profitability is assessed at the consolidated level

Prior to 2017, we operated our business under two reportable segments - Wireline and Wireless. As a result of the reorganization of our reporting structure, assets, including goodwill, and liabilities were reassigned to a single reporting unit.

• | Business - We offer a full range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to businesses, governmental entities, and educational institutions, wholesale data, voice, and wireless services to common carrier customers, and regulated voice services to residential and commercial customers in rural communities primarily in Southwest Alaska.

Sales and Marketing
We offer our services directly to consumer and business customers through our call center, direct mail advertising, television advertising, Internet advertising, local media advertising, and through our retail stores. Our sales efforts are primarily directed toward increasing the number of subscribers we serve, selling bundled services, and generating incremental revenues through product and feature up-sell opportunities. We sell our managed services, wholesale data, voice, and wireless services, and data services to rural schools and health organizations through direct contact marketing.
Our sales and marketing strategy hinges on our ability to leverage (i) our unique position as an integrated provider of multiple communications, data and video services, (ii) our well-recognized and respected brand names in the Alaskan marketplace and (iii) our leading market positions in the services and products we offer.  By continuing to pursue a marketing strategy that takes advantage of these characteristics, we believe we can increase our customer market penetration and retention rates, increase our share of our customers’ aggregate voice, video, data and wireless services expenditures and managed services expenditures, and achieve continued growth in revenues and operating cash flow.
Facilities
We operate a modern, competitive communications network providing switched and dedicated voice and broadband services. Our fiber network employs digital transmission technology over our fiber optic facilities within Alaska and between Alaska and the lower 48 states.
We serve many rural and remote Alaska locations solely via satellite communications. Each of our satellite transponders is backed up on alternate spacecraft with multiple backup transponders. We operate a hybrid fiber 
6

optic cable and digital microwave system (“TERRA”) linking Anchorage with the Bristol Bay, Yukon-Kuskokwim, and northwest regions of the state. 
We own and operate a statewide network providing voice and data services to the urban and rural communities of Alaska. Our statewide wireless network provides 4G LTE data service, EVDO, 3G UMTS/HSPA+, 2G CDMA, and 2G GSM/EDGE service. We continue to expand and upgrade these services to provide a modern network for Alaska. We own and operate Wi-Fi access points that create a Wi-Fi network branded as TurboZone in Anchorage, Fairbanks, Juneau, Kenai-Soldotna, Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other areas of the State ("TurboZone").
Our dedicated Internet access and Internet protocol data services are delivered to an Ethernet port located at the service end-point.  Our management platform continuously monitors the network and service end-points for performance. The availability and quality of service, as well as statistical information on traffic loading, are continuously monitored for quality assurance.  The management platform has the capability to remotely access network elements and service end-points, permitting changes in configuration without the need to physically be at the service end-point.  This management platform allows us to offer network monitoring and management services to businesses and governmental entities.
Our video businesses are located throughout Alaska and serve the majority of the population. Our facilities include hybrid-fiber-coax plant and head-end distribution equipment. The majority of our locations on the fiber routes are served from head-end distribution equipment in Anchorage.  All of our cable systems are completely digital.
Competition
We operate in intensely competitive industries and compete with a number of companies that provide a broad range of communication, entertainment, and information products and services. Technological changes are further intensifying and complicating the competitive landscape and consumer behavior. 
Retail Wireless Services and Products Competition
We compete with AT&T, Verizon, and other community or regional-based wireless providers, and resellers of those services in Anchorage and other markets. Regulatory policies favor robust competition in wireless markets.  Wireless local number portability helps to maintain a high level of competition in the industry because it allows subscribers to switch carriers without having to change their telephone numbers.
The communications industry continues to experience significant technological changes, as evidenced by the increasing pace of improvements in the capacity and quality of digital technology, shorter cycles for new products and enhancements and changes in consumer preferences and expectations.  Accordingly, we expect competition in the wireless communications industry to continue to be dynamic and intense as a result of the development of new technologies, services and products.
The national wireless carriers with whom we compete, AT&T and Verizon, have resources that are greater than ours. These companies have significantly greater capital, financial, marketing, human capital, distribution and other resources than we do.  Specifically, as a regional wireless carrier we may not have immediate access to some wireless handsets that are available to these national wireless carriers. 
We compete for customers based principally upon price, service bundles, the services and enhancements offered, network quality, customer service, billing services, statewide network coverage and capacity, TurboZone, the type of wireless handsets offered, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.  Our ability to compete successfully will depend, in part, on our marketing efforts and our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting the industry.
Data Services and Products Competition
The Internet industry is highly competitive, rapidly evolving and subject to constant technological change.  Competition is based upon price, service bundles, the services and enhancements offered, the technologies used, customer service, billing services, and perceived quality, reliability and availability.  We compete with other providers some of which are headquartered outside of Alaska and have substantially greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do.
We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of data services than are available through other alternative delivery sources.  Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical 
7

performance and speed, and responsive community-based customer service.  Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our data services product offerings.
Presently, there are a number of competing companies in Alaska that actively sell and maintain data and voice communications systems.  Our ability to integrate communications networks and data communications equipment has allowed us to maintain our market position based on customer support services rather than price competition alone.  These services are blended with other transport products into unique customer solutions, including managed services and outsourcing.
Video Services and Products Competition
Our video systems face competition from services and devices that offer distribution of movies, television shows and other video programming, using alternative methods such as Internet video streaming and direct broadcast satellite ("DBS").  Our video systems also face competition from potential overbuilds of our existing cable systems.  The extent to which our video systems are competitive depends, in part, upon our ability to provide quality programming and other services at competitive prices.
Internet video streaming is a major source of competition for our video services.  Additionally, some online video services produce or acquire their own original content. However, as a major Internet-provider ourselves, the competition may result in additional data service subscriber revenue to the extent we grow average Internet revenue per subscriber.
The DBS industry is another major source of competition for our video services.  Two major companies, AT&T-owned DIRECTV and DISH DBS Corporation, are currently offering high-power DBS services in Alaska.
Competitive forces may be counteracted by offering subscribers expanded programming.  We have retransmission agreements with various broadcasters and provide for the uplink/downlink of their signals into certain of our systems, and local programming for our customers.  Additionally, our ownership of television stations provides us the opportunity to create unique content for our subscribers.
Video systems generally operate pursuant to franchises granted on a non-exclusive basis.  The 1992 Cable Act gives local franchising authorities jurisdiction over basic video service rates and equipment in the absence of “effective competition.”  The 1992 Cable Act also prohibits franchising authorities from unreasonably denying requests for additional franchises and permits franchising authorities to operate video systems.  Well-financed businesses from outside the video industry may become competitors for franchises or providers of competing services.
We expect to continue to provide, at reasonable prices and in competitive bundles, a greater variety of video services than are available off-air or through other alternative delivery sources.  Additionally, we believe we offer superior technical performance and responsive community-based customer service.  Increased competition, however, may adversely affect our market share and results of operations from our video services product offerings.
Voice Services and Products Competition
Our most significant competition for local access and long-distance comes from wireless substitution and voice over Internet protocol services. Wireless local number portability allows consumers to retain the same phone number as they change service providers allowing for interchangeable and portable fixed-line and wireless numbers.  A growing number of consumers now use wireless service as their primary voice phone service for local calling. We also compete against Incumbent Local Exchange Carriers ("ILECs"), long-distance resellers and certain smaller rural local telephone companies for local access and long-distance. We have competed by offering what we believe is excellent customer service and by providing desirable bundles of services.
See “Regulation — Wireline Voice Services and Products” below for more information.
Seasonality
Our services and products do not exhibit significant seasonality.  Our ability to implement construction projects is hampered during the winter months because of cold temperatures, snow and short daylight hours.

Major Customer
We had no major customer in 2017 and 2016. Verizon was a major customer in 2015.
Environmental Regulations
We undertake activities that may, under certain circumstances, affect the environment. Accordingly, they may be subject to federal, state, and local laws designed to preserve or protect the environment, including the Clean Water Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act.  The FCC, Bureau of Land Management, U.S. Forest Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and National Park Service are among the federal agencies required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 and National Historic Preservation Act to consider the environmental impact of actions they authorize, including facility construction.
The principal effect of our facilities on the environment would be in the form of construction of facilities and networks at various locations in Alaska and between Alaska, Washington, and Oregon.  Our facilities have been constructed in accordance with federal, state and local building codes and zoning regulations whenever and wherever applicable.  We obtain federal, state, and local permits, as required, for our projects and operations. We are unaware of any material violations of federal, state or local regulations or permits.
Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses
We do not hold franchises (with the exception of video services as described below) or concessions for communications services or local access services.  We hold a number of federally registered service marks used by our business.  We own two utility patents issued in 2017 pertaining to device diagnostics and network connectivity. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the FCC the authority to license and regulate the use of the electromagnetic spectrum for radio communications.  We hold licenses for our satellite and microwave transmission facilities for provision of long-distance services. We hold various licenses for spectrum and broadcast television use. These licenses may be revoked and license renewal applications may be denied for cause.  However, we expect these licenses to be renewed in due course when, at the end of the license period, a renewal application will be filed.
We hold licenses for earth stations that are generally licensed for fifteen years.  The FCC also issues a single blanket license for a large number of technically identical earth stations.  Our operations may require additional licenses in the future.
We are certified through the Regulatory Commission of Alaska ("RCA") to provide local, long distance, and video service by Certificates of Public Convenience and Necessity (“CPCN”). These CPCNs are nonexclusive certificates defining each authorized service area.  Although CPCNs have no stated expiration date, they may be revoked due to cause.
Regulation
Our businesses are subject to substantial government regulation and oversight.  The following summary of regulatory issues does not purport to describe all existing and proposed federal, state, and local laws and regulations, or judicial and regulatory proceedings that affect our businesses.  Existing laws and regulations are reviewed frequently by legislative bodies, regulatory agencies, and the courts and are subject to change.  We cannot predict at this time the outcome of any present or future consideration of proposed changes to governing laws and regulations.
Wireless Services and Products
General. The FCC regulates the licensing, construction, interconnection, operation, acquisition, and transfer of wireless network systems in the United States pursuant to the Communications Act.  As wireless licensees, we are subject to regulation by the FCC, and must comply with certain build-out and other license conditions, as well as with the FCC’s specific regulations governing wireless services.  The FCC does not currently regulate rates for services offered by commercial mobile radio service providers (the official legal description for wireless service providers).
Commercial mobile radio service wireless systems are subject to Federal Aviation Administration and FCC regulations governing the location, lighting, construction, modification, and registration of antenna structures on which our antennas and associated equipment are located and are also subject to regulation under federal 
9

environmental laws and the FCC’s environmental regulations, including limits on radio frequency radiation from wireless handsets and antennas.
Universal Service. The High Cost Program of the Universal Service Fund ("USF") pays Eligible Telecommunications Carriers ("ETCs") to support the provision of facilities-based wireless telephone service in high cost areas. A wireless carrier may seek ETC status so that it can receive support from the USF.  Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireless telephone service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other small areas throughout Alaska. Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireless telephone services, and our net cost of providing wireless telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected.
On August 31, 2016, the FCC published the Alaska High Cost Order.  Per the Alaska High Cost Order, as of January 1, 2017, Remote high cost support payments to Alaska High Cost participants are frozen on a per-company basis at adjusted December 2014 levels for a ten-year term in exchange for meeting individualized performance obligations to offer voice and broadband services meeting the service obligations at specified minimum speeds by five-year and ten-year service milestones to a specified number of locations. Remote high cost support is no longer dependent upon line counts and line count filings are no longer required. Prior to the Alaska High Cost Order, Urban high cost support payments were frozen and had phased down to 60% of the monthly average of the 2011 annual support. The Alaska High Cost Order mandated that as of January 1, 2017, Urban high cost support for 2017 and 2018 would be two-thirds and one-third of the December 2014 level of support received, respectively, with Urban high cost support ending effective December 31, 2018.
On April 27, 2016, the FCC released a Third Report and Order to reform and modernize the USF’s Lifeline program ("Lifeline Order").  The Lifeline program is administered by the Universal Service Administrative Company ("USAC") and is designed to ensure that quality telecommunications services are available to low-income customers at just, reasonable, and affordable rates.  The Lifeline Order adopted several reforms, including incentivizing and sometimes requiring broadband providers to offer fixed and/or mobile broadband service to Lifeline subscribers. The Lifeline Order also limited the number of federal programs that confer Lifeline eligibility, and made small changes to the requirement for annual recertification of all Lifeline subscribers. Failure to correctly judge eligibility and recertify Lifeline subscribers could materially adversely affect our Lifeline revenues and/or increase our costs in the form of FCC fines for failure to comply with Lifeline rules. 
Interconnection.  We have completed negotiations and the RCA has approved current direct wireless interconnection agreements with all of the major Alaska ILECs.  These are in addition to indirect interconnection arrangements utilized elsewhere.
See “Description of Our Business — Regulation — Wireline Voice Services and Products — Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks” for more information.
Emergency 911. The FCC has imposed rules requiring carriers to provide emergency 911 services, including enhanced 911 (“E911”) services that provide to local public safety dispatch agencies the caller’s phone number and approximate location. Providers are required to transmit the geographic coordinates of the customer’s location, either by means of network-based or handset-based technologies, within accuracy parameters revised by the FCC, to be implemented over a phase-in period.  Due to Alaska’s relatively low population and low cell-site densities, we have excluded certain areas from E911 coverage where cell triangulation is not feasible, pursuant to FCC rule.  We have also filed for a waiver, which remains pending, for remaining areas where triangulation may be technically feasible, but where the cell-site densities are insufficient to reach the FCC’s standard. The FCC also imposed requirements to allow users to text-to-911 if the local public safety dispatch agency requests and is able to receive such texts. We have developed a text-to-911 technical solution and have certified to the FCC that we are now capable of meeting the FCC requirements. Providers may not demand cost recovery as a condition of providing E911, although they are permitted to negotiate cost recovery if it is not mandated by the state or local governments.
State and Local Regulation. While the Communications Act generally preempts state and local governments from regulating the entry of, and the rates charged by, wireless carriers, it also permits a state to petition the FCC to allow it to impose commercial mobile radio service rate regulation when market conditions fail to adequately protect customers and such service is a replacement for a substantial portion of the telephone wireline exchange service within a state. No state currently has such a petition on file, and all prior efforts have been rejected. 
10

In addition, the Communications Act does not expressly preempt the states from regulating the “terms and conditions” of wireless service. Several states have invoked this “terms and conditions” authority to impose or propose various consumer protection regulations on the wireless industry. State attorneys general have also become more active in enforcing state consumer protection laws against sales practices and services of wireless carriers. States also may impose their own universal service support requirements on wireless and other communications carriers, similar to the contribution requirements that have been established by the FCC.
States have become more active in attempting to impose new taxes and fees on wireless carriers, such as gross receipts taxes. Where successful, these taxes and fees are generally passed through to customers and result in higher costs to customers.
At the local level, wireless facilities typically are subject to zoning and land use regulation. Neither local nor state governments may categorically prohibit the construction of wireless facilities in any community or take actions, such as indefinite moratoria, which have the effect of prohibiting construction. Pursuant to Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act of 2012, state and local governments are further constrained in their regulation of changes to existing wireless infrastructure. Nonetheless, securing state and local government approvals for new antenna structures has been and is likely to continue to be difficult, lengthy and costly.
Data Services and Products
General. There is no one entity or organization that governs the global operation of the Internet. Each facilities-based network provider that is interconnected with the global Internet controls operational aspects of their own network. Certain functions, such as IP addressing, domain name routing, and the definition of the TCP/IP protocol, are coordinated by an array of quasi-governmental, intergovernmental, and non-governmental bodies. The legal authority of these bodies is not precisely defined.
The vast majority of users connect to the Internet over facilities of existing communications carriers. Those communications carriers are subject to varying levels of regulation at both the federal and state level. Thus, non-Internet-specific regulatory decisions exercise a significant influence over the economics of the Internet market.
Many aspects of the coordination and regulation of Internet activities and the underlying networks over which those activities are conducted are evolving. Internet-specific and non-Internet-specific changes in the regulatory environment, including changes that affect communications costs or increase competition from ILECs or other communications services providers, could adversely affect our costs and the prices at which we sell Internet-based services.
On February 26, 2015, the FCC adopted an order reclassifying Internet service as a telecommunications service under Title II of the Communications Act. This order prohibited broadband providers from blocking or throttling most lawful public Internet traffic, from engaging in paid prioritization of that traffic, and from unreasonably interfering with or disadvantaging end users' and edge providers’ ability to send traffic to, from, and among each other. The order also strengthened the FCC’s transparency rules, which require accurate and truthful service disclosures, sufficient for consumers to make informed choices, for example, about speed, price and fees, latency, and network management practices. The order allowed broadband providers to engage in reasonable network management, including using techniques to address traffic congestion. These rules applied equally to wired and wireless broadband services. The order refrained from applying rate regulation and tariff requirements on broadband services.  On January 4, 2018, the FCC released an order that returned to a Title I classification of Internet service and eliminated many of the requirements described above. There are various efforts in Congress, through the federal courts of appeal, and through state legislation to re-impose the rules adopted in 2015. While we do not believe that the 2015 FCC order conflicts with our existing practices or offerings, the re-imposition of that regulatory framework would impose regulatory burdens, likely would increase our costs, and could adversely affect the manner and price of providing service.
Rural Health Care Program. The USF Rural Health Care ("RHC") Program subsidizes the rates for services provided to rural health care providers. For the funding year that ran from July 1, 2016 through June 30, 2017, USAC received requests for funds that exceeded the funding available for the RHC Program. USAC allocated the funding on a pro-rata basis to rural health care providers who submitted their funding requests during a certain period. We provide services to rural health care providers who were impacted by the pro-rata allocation and as a result certain of our customers did not receive the full subsidy that was expected under the program. Under the program rules, we are forbidden from lowering our rates for services previously provided, however, the FCC 
11

published an order on June 30, 2017 to assist eligible remote Alaska rural health care providers by allowing Alaska service providers, such as us, to retroactively lower their rates, or effectively giving a credit against amounts owed, for services provided. Based on these specific circumstances, we decided to retroactively lower our rates to these customers pursuant to the FCC waiver, and as a result we reduced revenue by $5.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, to aid our rural health care provider customers who were impacted by the pro-rata allocation. 
The FCC issued an Order and Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (“NPRM”) on December 18, 2017 and announced that requests for funds has exceeded the amount available for the funding year that runs from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018 (“FY2017”). The Order specifically addresses relief if a FY2017 proration is needed and directs USAC to use unused RHC program funding available at the time of proration to lower or eliminate the proration factor first for all qualifying funding requests from non-consortia health care providers. All of our customers in the FY2017 and included in our December 31, 2017 accounts receivable are non-consortia health care providers. The FCC and USAC have given no guidance as to the amount of unused funding available, thus we cannot predict the amount of any such shortfall.
The NPRM seeks comment about potential reforms to the RHC program to address future program shortfalls. We cannot predict at this time what changes, if any, that the FCC will adopt or the impact of any such changes.
Schools and Libraries Program. In 2014, the FCC adopted orders modernizing the USF Schools and Libraries Program ("E-Rate"). These orders, among other things, increased the annual E-Rate cap by approximately $1.5 billion, designated funds for internal connections within schools and libraries, and eliminated funding for certain legacy services, such as voice, to increase the availability of 21st century connectivity to support digital learning in schools nationwide. These orders did not have a material effect on the overall E-Rate support available to our schools and libraries customers, and therefore did not materially affect our revenue from such customers.
Video Services and Products
General. Because video communications systems use local streets and rights-of-way, they generally are operated pursuant to franchises (which can take the form of certificates, permits or licenses) granted by a municipality or other state or local government entity. The RCA is the franchising authority for all of Alaska. We believe that we have generally met the terms of our franchises, which do not require periodic renewal, and have provided quality levels of service. Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide video services to military bases.
Must Carry/Retransmission Consent. The 1992 Cable Act contains broadcast signal carriage requirements that allow local commercial television broadcast stations to elect once every three years to require a cable system to carry the station, subject to certain exceptions, or to negotiate for “retransmission consent” to carry the station.
The FCC has adopted rules to require cable operators to carry the digital programming streams of broadcast television stations. Further, the FCC has declined to require any cable operator to carry multiple digital programming streams from a single broadcast television station, but should the FCC change this policy, we would be required to devote additional cable capacity to carrying broadcast television programming streams, a step that could require the removal of other programming services.
Pole Attachments. The Communications Act requires the FCC to regulate the rates, terms and conditions imposed by public utilities for cable systems’ use of utility pole and conduit space unless state authorities can demonstrate that they adequately regulate pole attachment rates. In the absence of state regulation, the FCC administers pole attachment rates on a formula basis. This formula governs the maximum rate certain utilities may charge for attachments to their poles and conduit by companies providing communications services, including cable operators. The RCA, however, does not use the federal formula and instead has adopted its own formula that has been in place since 1987. This formula could be subject to further revisions upon petition to the RCA.  In addition, in 2011, the FCC adopted an order to rationalize different pole attachment rates among types of services, and on November 17, 2015, took further steps to bring telecommunications and cable pole attachment rates into parity. Though the general purpose of the rule changes was to ensure pole attachment rates as low and as uniform as possible, we do not expect the rules to have an immediate impact on the terms under which we access poles.  We cannot predict the likelihood of the RCA changing its formula, adopting the federal formula, or relinquishing its oversight of pole attachments to the FCC, any of which could increase the cost of our operations. 
Copyright. Cable television systems are subject to federal copyright licensing covering carriage of television and radio broadcast signals. In exchange for filing certain reports and contributing a percentage of their revenues to a

federal copyright royalty pool that varies depending on the size of the system, the number of distant broadcast television signals carried, and the location of the cable system, cable operators can obtain blanket permission to retransmit copyrighted material included in broadcast signals. The possible modification or elimination of this compulsory copyright license is the subject of continuing legislative review.  We cannot predict the outcome of this legislative review, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain desired broadcast programming. Copyright clearances for non-broadcast programming services are arranged through private negotiations.
Wireline Voice Services and Products
General. As an interexchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of interstate, international, and intrastate long-distance services.  As a state-certificated competitive local exchange carrier, we are subject to regulation by the FCC and the RCA as a non-dominant provider of local communications services.  Military franchise requirements also affect our ability to provide communications services to military bases.
Universal Service. The USF pays ETCs to support the provision of facilities-based wireline telephone service in high cost areas. Under FCC regulations and RCA orders, we are an authorized ETC for purposes of providing wireline local exchange service in Anchorage, Juneau, Fairbanks, the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, and other small areas throughout Alaska. Without ETC status, we would not qualify for USF support in these areas or other rural areas where we propose to offer facilities-based wireline telephone services, and our net cost of providing local telephone services in these areas would be materially adversely affected. See “Description of Our Business - Regulation - Wireless Services and Products - Universal Service” for information on USF reform.
Rural Exemption and Interconnection. A Rural Telephone Company is exempt from compliance with certain material interconnection requirements under Section 251(c) of the 1996 Telecom Act, including the obligation to negotiate Section 251(b) and (c) interconnection requirements in good faith, unless and until a state regulatory commission lifts such “rural exemption” or otherwise finds it not to apply.  All ILECs in Alaska are Rural Telephone Companies except Alaska Communications Systems Group, Inc.'s (“ACS”) in its Anchorage study area.  We participated in numerous proceedings regarding the rural exemptions of various ILECs in order to achieve the necessary interconnection agreements with the remaining ILECs. In other cases the interconnection agreements were reached by negotiation without regard to the implications of the ILEC’s rural exemption.
We have completed negotiation and/or arbitration of the necessary interconnection provisions and the RCA has approved current wireline Interconnection Agreements between GCI and all of the major ILECs.  We have entered all of the major Alaskan markets with local access services.
See “Description of Our Business — Competition — Voice Services and Products Competition” for more information.
Access Charges and Other Regulated Fees. The FCC regulates the fees that local telephone companies charge long-distance companies for access to their local networks.  In 2011, the FCC released rules to restructure and reduce over time originating interstate access charges, along with a proposal to adopt similar reforms applicable to terminating interstate access charges.  The details of implementation in general and between different classes of technology continue to be addressed, and could affect the economics of some aspects of our business.  We cannot predict at this time the impact of this implementation or future implementation of adopted reforms, but we do not expect it to have a material adverse impact on our operations.
Unbundled Network Elements. The ability to obtain unbundled network elements ("UNEs") is an important element of our local access services business. We cannot predict the extent to which existing FCC rules governing access to and pricing for UNEs will be changed in the face of additional legal action and the impact of any further rule modifications that are yet to be determined by the FCC. Moreover, the future regulatory classification of services that are transmitted over facilities may impact the extent to which we will be permitted access to such facilities.  Changes to the applicable regulations could result in a change in our cost of serving new and existing markets. On July 7, 2017, ACS filed a petition in which it asked the FCC to regulate us as an ILEC pursuant to section 251(h)(2) of the Communications Act, including the requirement to provide competitors with access to unbundled network elements. We cannot predict at this time the outcome of this proceeding. However, grant of the petition in its entirety may subject us to regulatory burdens that could materially impact our costs.

Local Regulation. We may be required to obtain local permits for street opening and construction permits to install and expand our networks. Local zoning authorities often regulate our use of towers for microwave and other communications sites. We also are subject to general regulations concerning building codes and local licensing. The Communications Act requires that fees charged to communications carriers be applied in a competitively neutral manner, but there can be no assurance that ILECs and others with whom we will be competing will bear costs similar to those we will bear in this regard.
Regulatory Regime Applicable to IP-based Networks. In 2014, the FCC adopted an order calling for experiments to examine how best to accelerate the technological and regulatory transitions from traditional TDM-based networks to IP-based technologies.  Although no entity has proposed conducting a technology transition experiment in our service territory in response to the FCC’s 2014 order, additional proposals for experiments are possible. We cannot predict whether additional proposals for experiments might be submitted to the FCC nor any resulting proceedings or their effect on us. The FCC also has other open dockets through which it might make changes to the regulatory regime applicable to IP-based networks. A change in regulatory obligation or classification that interferes with our ability to exchange traffic with other providers, that raises the cost of doing so, or that adversely affects eligibility for USF support could materially affect our net cost of and revenue from providing local services.
