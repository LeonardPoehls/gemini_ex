Item 1.  Business.
 
Chinawe.com Inc. (the “Company”, “Chinawe” or “we”), formerly known as Neo Modern Entertainment Corp. (“NeoModern”), was formed pursuant to the corporation laws of the State of California on March 19, 1997.
 
Chinawe’s principal business was providing professional management services relating to non-performing loans (“NPLs”) in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), as well as other consulting services. During the first quarter of 2009, the Company’s sole customer, Huizhou One Limited (“HOL”), issued a notice of termination to terminate its service contracts with the Company with effect from March 26 and March 27, 2009. Effective from March 27, 2009, the Company became a non-operating company.
 
Item  1A. Risk Factors.
 
Set forth below are certain risks and uncertainties relating to our business. These are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, operating results or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.
 
RISK RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS
 
THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NO OPERATING BUSINESS
 
The Company is currently seeking one or more lines of business that it can enter into. The Company, however, has not identified a specific line of business or territory for any such new business. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in identifying a new line of business that it can enter into or that it will be successful in operating any such new business. If we do not successfully address these risks and uncertainties, our financial condition will be materially adversely affected and the Company may have to dissolve.
WE WILL REQUIRE FUNDS TO FINANCE ENTRY INTO A NEW LINE OF BUSINESS
 
We will need financing to enter into a new line of business. We may seek to obtain such funds through sales of equity and/or debt, or other external financing in order to fund any new operations. We cannot assure that any capital resources will be available to us, or, if available, will be on terms that will be acceptable to us. Any equity financing will dilute the equity interests of existing security holders. If adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms, our ability to execute any new business plan and our business will be materially and adversely affected. The principal stockholder of the Company has in the past advanced funds to the Company to continue its operations. Although this stockholder has indicated that it will continue to fund the Company while the Company searches for a new line of business, there can be no assurance that the principal stockholder will continue to so fund the Company until a new line of business is located.
THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO PENALTIES FOR FAILURE TO FILE FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS
 
The Company filed Forms 5471 and 5472 with the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) late. The IRS could impose aggregate penalties of approximately $330,000 for such late filings. As of December 31, 2017 and the date of the Company’s financial statements, the Company has not received any correspondence from the IRS in respect of such penalties. The imposition of such penalties would have a material adverse effect upon the Company’s financial condition.
RISKS RELATING TO OUR STOCK
 
BECAUSE OUR COMMON STOCK PRICE IS BELOW $5.00, WE ARE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL RULES AND REGULATIONS.
 
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) has adopted regulations which generally define a “penny stock” to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. The Company’s common stock, par value $0.001 per share (“Common Stock”), presently is a “penny stock”. Because our Common Stock is a “penny stock”, it is subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker/dealers who sell our securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors. There can be no assurance that the Common Stock will trade for $5.00 or more per share, or if so, when.
TRADING ON THE OTC MARKETS; POSSIBLE DELISTING 
 
Absent NASDAQ Capital Market or other NASDAQ or stock exchange listing, trading, if any, in our Common Stock will, as it presently is, continue on the OTC Markets. As a result, you may find it difficult to dispose of or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the Common Stock. If delisted, we cannot predict when, if ever, our class of Common Stock would be re-listed for trading on the OTC Markets or any other market or exchange as the approval to re-list the Common Stock is subject to review by applicable regulatory authorities.

POSSIBLE TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED
 
The Company may elect to terminate the registration of the Common Stock under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). In the event the Company so terminates the registration of the Common Stock (i.e., “goes Dark”), the Company’s reporting obligations under the Exchange Act will be suspended and stockholders will no longer have access to current information about the Company.
