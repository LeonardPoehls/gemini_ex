Item 1.    BUSINESS
General
 
Hamilton Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland chartered corporation incorporated on June 7, 2012 to serve as the stock holding company for Hamilton Bank (the “Bank”), a federally chartered savings bank. On October 10, 2012, in accordance with a Plan of Conversion adopted by its Board of Directors and approved by its members, the Bank converted from a mutual savings bank to a stock savings bank and became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. In connection with the conversion, the Company sold 3,703,000 shares of common stock at a price of $10.00 per share, through which the Company received net proceeds of approximately $35,580,000. Hamilton Bancorp’s principal business activity is the ownership of the Bank’s capital stock and the management of the offering proceeds it retained in connection with the Bank’s conversion. Hamilton Bancorp does not own or lease any property but instead uses the premises, equipment and other property of the Bank with the payment of appropriate rental fees, as required by applicable law and regulations, under the terms of an expense allocation agreement. In the future, Hamilton Bancorp may acquire or organize other operating subsidiaries.

Founded in 1915 and celebrating over 100 years of service, the Bank is a community-oriented financial institution, dedicated to serving the financial needs of consumer and businesses within its market area. Our lending market area is considered greater Maryland, southern Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., and northern Virginia. We offer a variety of deposit and loan products in our market area. Our real estate loans consist primarily of one-to- four family mortgage loans (including owner-occupied and investor loans), as well as commercial real estate loans, and home equity loans and lines of credit. We also offer commercial term, leases and line of credit loans and, to a limited extent, consumer loans consisting primarily of automobile loans and loans secured by deposits. We currently operate out of our corporate headquarters in Towson, Maryland and our seven full-service branch offices located in Baltimore City, Cockeysville, Towson, Rosedale, Ellicott City and Pasadena, Maryland. Our market area for deposits is primarily the local counties surrounding our offices.

We also invest in securities, which consist primarily of U.S. government agency, municipal and corporate bond obligations, mortgage-backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations issued or guaranteed by U.S. government-sponsored enterprises, and to a much lesser extent, equity securities of government-sponsored enterprises.
 
We offer a variety of deposit accounts, including certificate of deposit accounts, money market accounts, savings accounts, NOW accounts and individual retirement accounts. Over the past two years we have borrowed funds from the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) to meet growing loan demand, including $11.5 million in FHLB advances in March 2017 to assist with the purchase of $23 million in residential mortgage loan pools. We have also acquired FHLB advances through our acquisitions of Fraternity Community Bancorp, Inc. and Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. completed in May 2016 and September 2015, respectively. We are committed to offering alternative banking delivery systems, including ATMs, online banking and remote deposit capture. 
 
Recent Acquisitions
 
On May 13, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Fraternity Community Bancorp, Inc. (“Fraternity Community Bancorp”) through the merger of Fraternity Community Bancorp, the parent company of Fraternity Federal Savings & Loan Association, with and into the Company pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated October 12, 2015. As a result of the merger, each shareholder of Fraternity Community Bancorp received a cash payment equal to nineteen dollars and twenty-five cents ($19.25) for each share of Fraternity Community Bancorp common stock, or an aggregate of approximately $25.7 million. Immediately after the acquisition of Fraternity Community Bancorp, Fraternity Federal Savings & Loan Association was merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank the surviving bank.
 
On September 11, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of Fairmount Bancorp, Inc. (“Fairmount Bancorp”) through the merger of Fairmount Bancorp, the parent company of Fairmount Bank, with and into the Company pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated April 15, 2015. As a result of the acquisition, each shareholder of Fairmount Bancorp received a cash payment equal to thirty dollars ($30.00) for each share of Fairmount Bancorp common stock, or an aggregate of approximately $15.4 million. Immediately after the acquisition of Fairmount Bancorp, Fairmount Bank was merged with and into the Bank, with the Bank the surviving bank.
 
As a result of the acquisitions, we have added three branches to our branch structure in the Baltimore area. (See Note 3 – “Acquisitions” of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion about each acquisition.)

The Bank’s website address is www.hamilton-bank.com. Available through the Investor Relations area of our website are annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, news releases on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act. In general, we intend that these reports be available as soon as practicable after they are filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Information on the Bank’s website should not be considered a part of this Annual Report.
Market Area
 
We conduct our operations from our seven full-service banking offices in Maryland. Our primary deposit market includes the areas surrounding our banking offices in Cockeysville, Pasadena, Towson, Rosedale, Ellicott City and two locations in Baltimore City. In May 2016, we closed our stand-alone branch office in the Cockeysville area of Baltimore County and merged it into one of our recently acquired branches that is close in proximity and served the same Cockeysville community and surrounding area. The acquired branch is smaller in size, offering cost savings, and provides easier access for our customers so their needs can be better served. The combining of these two branches makes our Cockeysville branch our largest branch by deposits with just over $100 million in deposits as of March 31, 2017. We are also in the process of relocating our Ellicott City branch to a new property a short distance away from its current location. The landlord, whom the current location is leased from, is converting the existing branch property into other commercial space.

The Bank considers greater Maryland, southern Pennsylvania, Washington D.C., and northern Virginia its primary lending area for its various consumer, commercial and mortgage lending services. It is the policy of the Bank to focus on lending to customers within its primary lending area, and/or to collateralize secured loans with real property located within the primary lending area. However, we occasionally make loans secured by collateral located outside of our primary lending market, especially to borrowers with whom we have an existing relationship or who have a significant presence within our primary market. Our primary lending market contains a diverse cross section of employment sectors, with a mix of services, manufacturing, wholesale/retail trade, federal and local government, health care facilities and finance related employment. The city of Baltimore is now considered a major center for both the financial and health service industries.
 
Our branch network includes Baltimore City and the Maryland counties of Anne Arundel, Howard, and Baltimore. Maryland continues to rank first in the nation with respect to median household income, as reflected in 2015 with median household income of nearly $76,000 compared to a national average of $56,000. Both Howard and Anne Arundel county rank amongst the top counties in the state with respect to household income and report lower unemployment. Baltimore City, Baltimore County, Howard, and Anne Arundel County reported preliminary unemployment rates of 6.3%, 4.5%, 3.2% and 3.7%, respectively, for December 2016, compared to the statewide and national unemployment rates of 4.2% and 4.7%, respectively.
 
Competition
 
We face significant competition within our market both in making loans and attracting deposits. Our market area has a high concentration of financial institutions including large money center and regional banks, community banks and credit unions. Some of our competitors offer products and services that we currently do not offer, such as trust services and private banking. Our competition for loans and deposits comes principally from commercial banks, savings institutions, internet banks, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, credit unions, and non-bank lenders. We face additional competition for deposits from short-term money market funds, brokerage firms, mutual funds and insurance companies. Our primary focus is to build and develop profitable customer relationships across all lines of business while maintaining our position as a community bank.
 
As of June 30, 2016 (the latest date for which information is available), our market share was 0.42% of total deposits in Baltimore City, making us the 10th largest out of 27 financial institutions in Baltimore City. In addition, as of June 30, 2016, our deposit market share was 1.33%, 0.41% and 0.70% of total deposits in Baltimore County, Anne Arundel, and Howard County, respectively, making us the 11th largest out of 33 financial institutions in Baltimore County, the 20th largest out of 28 financial institutions in Anne Arundel County and 15th largest out of 19 financial institutions in Howard County. 
 
Lending Activities

General. Historically, our principal lending activity has been the origination of mortgage loans collateralized by one-to-four family residential real estate located within our primary market area. In recent years we have reduced our emphasis on the origination of one-to-four family mortgage lending to become less reliant on the origination of such loans for growth and to emphasize the origination of commercial business and commercial real estate lending. This will allow the Bank to develop a more diversified loan portfolio, generate loan growth from different resources, and provide our customers with more products and services that fit their needs. In connection with this strategy, we have hired several commercial real estate and commercial business loan officers with strong experience in these lending areas. In addition, back office commercial loan personnel have also been hired to assist with the processing, underwriting, and monitoring of our commercial loan portfolio. Our commercial loan underwriting analysis is maintained in-house and allows us to be more efficient in originating loans and enhance the customer experience. We currently sell a majority of our one-to-four family mortgage loans with terms over 10 years into the secondary market. In addition to commercial business loans and leases, commercial real estate loans and residential mortgage loans, we also offer home equity loans and lines of credit, residential and commercial construction loans, and, to a much lesser extent, other consumer loans.

Although our portfolio of one-to-four family residential loans increased significantly both in amount and as a percentage of total loans during fiscal 2017, the increase was primarily due to our acquisition of Fraternity Community Bancorp in May 2016.

Residential Mortgage Loans. Hamilton Bank originates mortgage loans secured by owner occupied one-to-four family residential properties. To a lesser extent, we have also acquired, participated and made loans to investors for the purchase of one-to-four family residential properties that are not owner-occupied. As of March 31, 2017, we had a total of $183.0 million of residential mortgage loans secured by one-to-four family properties, of which $157.4 million, or 86.1%, were secured by properties serving as the primary residence of the owner. The remaining $25.2 million, or 13.9%, of such loans were secured by non owner-occupied residential properties. Almost all of our residential mortgage loans are secured by properties in the Greater Baltimore area. 
 
Historically, the terms of our one-to-four family mortgage loans retained in our portfolio ranged from 10 to 30 years. Beginning in 2009, in order to lower our interest rate risk in a rising rate environment, we have sold to the secondary market the majority of our one-to-four family fixed rate loans that have been originated with terms exceeding 10 years. Towards the end of fiscal 2017 though, we once again began to portfolio some of the fixed-rate residential mortgages we originated due to the amount of run-off experienced within the portfolio. During fiscal 2017 and 2016, we sold $2.2 million, or 23.5%, and $4.4 million, or 68.0%, of one-to-four family mortgage loans that we originated with terms exceeding 10 years, respectively. Our residential mortgage portfolio is almost entirely comprised of fixed-rate loans, with 83.3% of residential mortgage loans due after March 31, 2018 having fixed rates at March 31, 2017. During the year ended March 31, 2017, we originated $4.4 million in residential mortgage loans with adjustable-rates.

We generally do not make new one-to-four family mortgage loans on owner-occupied properties with loan-to-value ratios exceeding 95% at the time the loan is originated, and all loans with loan-to-value ratios in excess of 80% require private mortgage insurance. Loan to value ratios on refinances may not exceed 80%, and loan-to-value ratios for non-owner occupied properties may not exceed 85%. In addition, borrower debt may generally not exceed 43% of the borrower’s monthly cash flow. With respect to borrower debt on loans secured by non-owner occupied properties, we look to the investor’s aggregate debt and cash flows from all investment properties the investor operates. We require all properties securing residential mortgage loans to be appraised by a board-approved independent appraiser.
 
Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties typically have 5 to 10 year terms and amortize over a 25 to 30 year period. Because of the increased risk associated with non-owner occupied properties, interest rates on such loans are higher than owner-occupied properties; averaging 6.1% during the year ended March 31, 2017. We have generally only originated loans secured by non-owner occupied properties to investors that reside in our market area.
 
In an effort to provide financing for first-time home buyers, we offer 30-year fixed-rate one-to-four family mortgage loans with loan-to-value ratios up to 95%, which cannot be readily sold to the secondary market and are held in portfolio. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, we did not originate any such loans which we did not sell.
 
We also make “jumbo loans” (loans above $424,100, the current maximum conforming loan amount as established by the Federal Housing Finance Agency) that we may sell into the secondary market or retain in the Bank’s portfolio depending upon the residential mortgage run-off at the time. Jumbo loans that we originate and sell, typically have 30 year terms and maximum loan-to-value ratios of 80%. At March 31, 2017, our largest outstanding portfolio jumbo residential mortgage loan was for $2.3 million at origination, with a current book balance of $2.0 million. This loan is performing in accordance with its original terms.
 
From 2009 through part of fiscal 2017, applications for loans that we intended to sell were processed through Mortgage Department Services, LLC (“MDS”), a company in which we had a minority interest.  In fiscal 2017 we brought this process in-house using various software programs. Each application and loan is reviewed to ensure that the loan meets the standards for sale to the secondary market and the Bank’s portfolio (See “—Loan Originations, Participations, Purchases and Sales”). When we sell loans in the secondary market, we typically sell the loans at a premium and record the income immediately as a gain on sale of loans. All such loans are sold with servicing released and in most cases, with recourse that we provide to the purchaser in the case of (i) delinquency within the first 90 days of sale or (ii) breaches of customary representations and warranties to the buyers. 
 
All residential mortgage loans that we originate include “due-on-sale” clauses, which give us the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that, among other things, the borrower sells or otherwise disposes of the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid. All borrowers are required to obtain title insurance for the benefit of Hamilton Bank. We also require homeowner’s insurance and fire and casualty insurance and, where circumstances warrant, flood insurance. 
 
Commercial Real Estate Loans. We originate commercial real estate loans in the Greater Baltimore area that are secured by properties used for business purposes such as small office buildings or retail facilities. We have increased our origination of commercial real estate loans over the last several years, and intend to continue to grow this portion of our loan portfolio in the future. At March 31, 2017, commercial real estate loans amounted to 31.7% of total loans or $107.6 million, including $11.9 million acquired in the Fraternity acquisition, compared to approximately $36.2 million, or 22.5% of total loans, at March 31, 2013.

Our commercial real estate loans are underwritten based on our loan underwriting polices. Our policies provide that such loans may be made in amounts of up to 85% of the appraised value of the property, provided that the property is more than 50% owner-occupied or 75% of the appraised value of the property if it is not owner-occupied. Our commercial real estate loans typically have terms of 5 to 10 years and amortize for a period of up to 25 years. In the past year we have originated an increased amount of commercial real estate loans with terms of 7 to 10 years based upon the strength of the property cash flow and loan to value ratio. Interest rates may be fixed or adjustable. If adjustable, then they are generally based on the Prime rate of interest, LIBOR, or U.S. Treasuries Constant Maturity. 
 
The regulatory loan-to-one borrower limit is 15% of a bank’s unimpaired capital plus unimpaired surplus. As a result of the additional capital received in the stock offering, Hamilton Bank’s loans-to-one borrower limit is approximately $6.4 million. We have adopted an internal limit equal to 75% of the Bank’s loan-to-one borrower limit. We generally target commercial real estate loans with balances of $250,000 to $4.0 million. At March 31, 2017, our commercial real estate loans had an average balance of $861,000. At that same date, our largest commercial real estate relationship included one loan totaling $4.9 million. This loan is secured by a shopping center, and was performing in accordance with their original terms at March 31, 2017.
 
Commercial real estate lending involves additional risks compared to one-to-four family residential lending because payments on loans secured by commercial real estate properties are often dependent on the successful operation or management of the properties, and/or the collateral value of the commercial real estate securing the loan. Repayment of such loans may be subject, to a greater extent than residential loans, to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Also, commercial real estate loans typically involve larger loan balances in relation to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers. Commercial real estate loans generally have a higher rate of interest and shorter term than residential mortgage loans because of increased risks associated with this type of lending. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards. We have experienced a decrease over the past several years in delinquencies and non-performing loans in our commercial real estate loan portfolio. See “Risk Factors—Our increase in commercial real estate loans has increased our credit risk.”
 
Commercial Business Loans. We originate commercial business loans and lines of credit secured by non-real estate business assets. These loans are generally originated to small and middle market businesses in our primary market area. Our commercial business loans are generally used for working capital purposes or for acquiring equipment, inventory or furniture, and are primarily secured by business assets other than real estate, such as business equipment, inventory and accounts receivable. We have increased our origination of commercial business loans over the last few years and intend to continue to grow this portfolio at a moderate pace. At March 31, 2017, commercial business loans and lines of credit outstanding totaled $21.5 million, including $513,000 acquired in the Fraternity Community Bancorp acquisition, which amounted to 6.4% of total loans, compared to approximately $15.7 million, or 10.8% of total loans, at March 31, 2014. At March 31, 2017, we also had $10.7 million of unused commercial business lines of credit. 
 
Our commercial business loans have terms up to 5 years at both fixed and adjustable rates of interest, although, adjustable rates of interest are preferred and obtained when possible. Our commercial business loans are underwritten based on our commercial business loan underwriting policies. We typically avoid making commercial business loans to purchase highly specialized, custom made equipment which may be difficult to dispose of in the event of default. When making commercial business loans, we consider the financial statements, lending history and debt service capabilities of the borrower (generally requiring a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.20:1.00), the projected cash flows of the business, and the value of the collateral, if any. The majority all commercial business loans are guaranteed by the principals of the borrower.

Hamilton Bank is also qualified to make Small Business Administration (“SBA”) loans. The SBA program is an economic development program which finances the expansion of small businesses. Under the SBA program, we originate and fund loans under the SBA 7(a) Loan Program which qualify for guarantees up to 85% for loans less than or equal to $150,000 and 75% for loans greater than $150,000. We also originate loans under the SBA’s CDC/504 Loan Program in which we generally provide 50% of the financing, taking a first lien on the real property as collateral. We do not treat the SBA guarantee as a substitute for a borrower meeting our credit standards, and, except for minimum capital levels or maximum loan terms, the borrower must meet our other credit standards as applicable to loans outside the SBA process. During fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016, we did not originate any loans under the SBA 7(a) Loan Program.

We focus on the origination of commercial business loans in amounts between $250,000 and $4.0 million. At March 31, 2017, our commercial business loans had an average outstanding balance of $201,000. At that same date, our largest commercial business loan was a commercial line of credit with a commitment balance of $4.0 million, of which $2.2 million was advanced. The loan is secured by the business assets of the company and is performing in accordance with its original terms at March 31, 2017.
 
Commercial business loans generally have a greater credit risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income, and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial business loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial business loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself. Further, the collateral securing the loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. We seek to minimize these risks through our underwriting standards. See “Risk Factors - Our entry into commercial real estate and commercial business lending may result in higher losses on our loans.”
 
Home Equity Loans and Lines of Credit. We offer home equity loans and lines of credit that are secured by the borrower’s primary or secondary residence. At March 31, 2017, we had $20.5 million, or 6.1% of our total loan portfolio in home equity loans and lines of credit. At that date we also had $23.0 million of undisbursed funds related to home equity lines of credit. 
 
Home equity loans and lines of credit are generally underwritten using the same criteria that we use to underwrite one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. Home equity loans and lines of credit may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80% when combined with the principal balance of the existing first mortgage loan. Our home equity loans are primarily originated with fixed rates of interest with terms of up to 20 years. Our home equity lines of credit are originated with adjustable-rates based on the prime rate of interest plus or minus an applicable margin and require interest paid monthly. Home equity loans and lines of credit are available in amounts of between $10,000 and $1.0 million.
 
Home equity loans and lines of credit secured by second mortgages have greater risk than one-to-four family residential mortgage loans secured by first mortgages. We face the risk that the collateral will be insufficient to compensate us for loan losses and costs of foreclosure. When customers default on their loans, we attempt to foreclose on the property and resell the property as soon as possible to minimize foreclosure and carrying costs. However, the value of the collateral may not be sufficient to compensate us for the amount of the unpaid loan and we may be unsuccessful in recovering the remaining balance from those customers. Particularly with respect to our home equity loans and lines of credit, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property securing the loan. 
 
Construction Loans. We originate construction loans for both commercial and residential real estate. Construction loans we originate generally provide for the payment of interest only during the construction phase. At the end of the construction phase, the loan converts to a permanent mortgage loan at the same or a different rate of interest. The construction period on the residential homes is typically nine to twelve months, at which time Hamilton Bank is repaid through permanent financing by a third party with servicing released or the loan is converted under the loan documents to a permanent loan and is retained in the Bank’s portfolio.

Before making a commitment to fund a construction loan, Hamilton Bank requires detailed cost estimates to complete the project and an appraisal of the property by an independent licensed appraiser. Hamilton Bank also reviews and inspects each property before disbursement of funds during the term of the construction loan. Loan proceeds are disbursed after inspection based on the percentage of completion method. Construction loans for one-to-four family residential real estate may be underwritten with a loan-to-value ratio of up to 80% or 95% with private mortgage insurance. Commercial construction loans generally may not exceed a loan-to-value ratio of 75% to 80%. 
 
Construction lending generally involves a greater degree of risk than other one-to-four family mortgage lending. The repayment of the construction loan is, to a great degree, dependent upon the successful and timely completion of construction. Various potential factors including construction delays or the financial viability of the builder may further impair the borrower’s ability to repay the loan.
 
At March 31, 2017, total construction loans represented $9.6 million, or 2.8%, of Hamilton Bank’s total loans, of which $6.4 million consisted of residential construction loans and $3.2 million were commercial construction. At March 31, 2017, the commitment to fund or advance funds on total construction loans equaled $15.1 million. At March 31, 2017, our largest construction loan was a residential construction loan with a contractual principal balance of $927,200 and a recorded investment balance of $927,000. The loan is secured by the residential property being constructed and is performing in accordance with its original terms at March 31, 2017.
 
Other Consumer Loans. We make loans secured by deposit accounts up to 90% of the amount of the depositor’s deposit account balance. On a more limited basis, we also originate automobile loans to our customers. Other consumer loans totaled $3.2 million, or 0.9% of our total loan portfolio, at March 31, 2017.
 
Loan Originations, Participations, Purchases and Sales. Most of our loan originations are generated by our loan personnel operating at our corporate headquarters and banking office locations. All loans we originate are underwritten pursuant to our policies and procedures. While we originate fixed-rate and adjustable-rate loans, our ability to generate each type of loan depends upon relative borrower demand and the pricing levels as set in the local marketplace by competing banks, thrifts, credit unions, and mortgage banking companies. Our volume of real estate loan originations is influenced significantly by market interest rates. As a result, the volume of our real estate loan originations can vary from period to period. 
 
Consistent with our interest rate risk strategy, in the low interest rate environment that has existed in recent years, we have sold on a servicing-released basis the majority of our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans with maturities over 10 years that we have originated. All loan applications originated from 2009 through the first part of 2017, that we had the intention of selling, were processed through MDS. MDS has since been dissolved and we started directly underwriting and selling loans in the secondary market ourselves in 2017. Through the Fraternity acquisition, we obtained the necessary software and personnel to be able to process loans we intend to sell in-house. We receive a premium for each loan that is delivered or sold to the secondary market. When a loan is sold, it is sold with servicing released and in most cases, with recourse that we provide to the purchaser in the event of (i) delinquency within the first 90 days of sale or (ii) breaches of customary representations and warranties to the buyers. As a result of the acquisitions, the amount of normal attrition and prepayments associated with the one-to-four family residential mortgage portfolio has increased significantly. Consequently, we have begun to portfolio some of our residential mortgage loan originations versus selling them in the secondary market so as to maintain our loan diversification going forward. 
 
From time to time, we have purchased loan participations in commercial loans in which we are not the lead lender that are secured by real estate or other assets within the state of Maryland. With regard to all loan participations, we follow our customary loan underwriting and approval policies, and although we may be only approving and servicing a portion of the loan, we underwrite the loan request as if we had originated the loan to ensure cash flow and collateral are sufficient. At March 31, 2017, our loan participations totaled $14.9 million, or 4.4% of our total loan portfolio, the majority of which were in our primary market area. Of the $14.9 million in participations, $126,000 is on nonaccrual at March 31, 2017, a decrease of $510,000 from March 31, 2016. We do not specifically look to loan participations as a means to increase loan volume; however, we do look at opportunities for participations, if presented, on a case by case basis. 
 
 
10



In addition to loan participations, we may look to purchase pools or portfolios of loans from time-to-time to enhance growth and earnings potential. As with participations, we follow our customary loan underwriting standards when reviewing a particular pool of loans to determine if the purchase makes sense. Based upon the number of loans within a particular pool, we may not be able to review the loan pool on a loan-by-loan basis, but will review the loan data requested on the entire pool, such as delinquency, credit scores, and appraised values and examine an adequate sample of the individual loans that make up the loan pool. In March 2017 we purchased $23.4 million of one-to-four family jumbo residential mortgage loans in two separate pools at a premium of 102.5% each. The purchases were funded with approximately $12.5 million in cash and $11.5 million in borrowings from the FHLB. We entered into a cash flow hedge with respect to the borrowings to lock in a long-term cost of funds and minimize some of the interest rate risk associated with purchasing longer-term assets. 
 
In May 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Fraternity Federal Savings and Loan, we acquired approximately $108.7 million in outstanding loans. As of March 31, 2017, the outstanding balance of those acquired from Fraternity totaled $91.2 million, or 26.9% of gross loans, of which $28,000 are on non-accrual. The remaining loans are performing as agreed under their current terms at March 31, 2017. In September 2015, prior to Fraternity, we acquired Fairmount Bank and approximately $53.6 million in outstanding loans, of which $37.9 million remain outstanding at March 31, 2017. The outstanding Fairmount loans make-up 11.2% of gross loans at March 31, 2017. 
 
As noted earlier, we may sell residential mortgage loans into the secondary market at a premium. We also have the ability to sell certain pools of loans to increase liquidity, improve current earnings, divest of a concentration of loans, or manage problem credits. When selling a pool of loans, we analyze whether the sale makes sense from a profit standpoint and then look for several bids from various parties so as to maximize the price with respect to the sale. In fiscal 2017 we sold two pools of loans with a combined book value of $4.5 million. Both pools consisted primarily of one-to-four family non-owner occupied residential mortgage (“residential investor”) loans acquired in the Fairmount Bank acquisition. The financial performance of the residential investor loans sold was deteriorating and the underlying collateral did not provide sufficient support. Selling the pool of loans made the most sense with respect to managing these problem credits and reducing any additional losses going forward.

Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. Our lending activities follow written, non-discriminatory underwriting standards and loan origination procedures developed by management and approved by our board of directors. The loan approval process is intended to assess the borrower’s ability to repay the loan and the value of the collateral that will secure the loan. To assess the borrower’s ability to repay, our policies provide for the review of the borrower’s employment and credit history and information on the historical and projected income and expenses of the borrower. We will also evaluate a guarantor when a guarantee is provided as part of the loan. 
 
Hamilton Bank’s policies and loan approval limits are established by our board of directors. Designated Bank officers and loan committee are assigned levels of loan authority. Having loan authority gives the individuals or committee the ability to authorize the extension of credit. Every extension of credit requires two signatures, one of which must have sufficient authority given the risk rating and aggregate exposure. The second approver cannot be an individual assigned less loan authority than the sponsor of the loan. Loan authority is recommended by the Chief Credit Officer and approved by the Loan Committee. All loan authorities are reviewed and confirmed annually by the Loan Committee. The Chief Credit Officer, and or the President may recommend interim changes to establish loan limits or assign loan authority for new officers. These interim changes shall be presented to the Loan Committee for approval at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Chief Credit Officer and/or the President also have the authority to reduce or remove loan authority. Such changes in lending authority are to be reported to Loan Committee after the fact.

Securities Activities
 
General. Our investment policy is developed by management and approved by the board of directors. The objectives of the policy are to: (i) ensure adequate liquidity for loan demand and deposit fluctuations, and to allow us to alter our liquidity position to meet both day-to-day and long-term changes in assets and liabilities; (ii) manage interest rate risk in accordance with our interest rate risk policy; (iii) provide collateral for pledging requirements; (iv) maximize return on our investments; and (v) maintain a balance of high quality diversified investments to minimize risk. 
 
Our Investment Committee, consisting of our President and Chief Executive Officer, our Chief Financial Officer, and Controller is responsible for implementing our investment policy, including approval of investment strategies and monitoring investment performance. The President and Chief Financial Officer are authorized to execute purchases or sales of securities. The board of directors regularly reviews our investment strategies and the market value of our investment portfolio. 
 
We account for investment and mortgage-backed securities in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 320, “Investments – Debt and Equity Securities.” ASC 320 requires that investments be categorized as held-to maturity, trading, or available for sale. Our securities are generally categorized as available-for-sale based on our need to meet daily liquidity needs and to take advantage of profits that may occur from time to time. At March 31, 2017, all of our securities were classified as available for sale. 
 
Federally chartered savings institutions have authority to invest in various types of assets, including government-sponsored enterprise obligations, securities of various federal agencies, residential mortgage-backed securities, certain certificates of deposit of insured financial institutions, overnight and short-term loans to other banks, corporate debt instruments, debt instruments of municipalities and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac equity securities. At March 31, 2017, our investment portfolio consisted almost entirely of securities and mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. Government agencies, municipalities or U.S. Government-sponsored enterprises. At that same date we also held $2.0 million of corporate bonds, which equaled approximately 2.0% of our total investment securities based upon the fair value of such securities. The principal and interest on our mortgage-backed securities are guaranteed by the issuing entity. 
 
At March 31, 2017, we owned just over $2.0 million in Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta stock. As a member of Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, we are required to purchase stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At March 31, 2017, we had no investments in a single company or entity (other than an agency of the U.S. Government, a municipality or a U.S. Government-sponsored enterprise) that had an aggregate book value in excess of 10% of our equity.
 
In fiscal 2017, our investment balances increased through the acquisition of Fraternity and the build-up of excess cash. Prior to fiscal 2017, our investment balances had decreased due to either calls or maturing bonds, normal principal pay downs on our mortgage backed securities, or the sale of certain securities. The proceeds from these reductions in securities have been used to fund loan activity and acquisitions, and to a lesser extent reinvested in investment securities.

Sources of Funds
 
General. Deposits, scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal, maturities and calls of securities and funds provided by operations are our primary sources of funds for use in lending, investing and for other general purposes. We historically have not used Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB) advances to fund our operations. However, beginning in the second half of fiscal 2015, we began to once again borrow from the FHLB as a means to fund our loan growth, including $11.5 million in FHLB advances in March 2017 that were used to fund the purchase of $23.4 million of jumbo residential loans. Additionally, in fiscal 2016 and 2017 we acquired $10.5 million and $15.0 million of FHLB advances in the acquisitions of Fairmount and Fraternity, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, we have $35.6 million in advances outstanding from the FHLB.
 
Deposits. We offer deposit products having a range of interest rates and terms. We currently offer statement savings accounts, NOW accounts, noninterest-bearing demand accounts, health savings accounts (HSA), money market accounts and certificates of deposit. We also offer the Certificate of Deposit Account Registry Service (CDARS) program to our customers. Our strategic plan includes a greater emphasis on developing commercial business activities, both deposit and lending customer relationships. 
 
Deposit flows are significantly influenced by general and local economic conditions, changes in prevailing interest rates, internal pricing decisions and competition. Our deposits are primarily obtained from areas surrounding our branch offices. In order to attract and retain deposits we rely on paying competitive interest rates and providing quality service.
 
Based on experience, we believe that our deposits are relatively stable. However, the ability to attract and maintain deposits and the rates paid on these deposits, has been and will continue to be significantly affected by market conditions. At March 31, 2017, $247.6 million, or 60.1% of our total deposit accounts were certificates of deposit, of which $124.9 million had maturities of one year or less.

The following tables set forth the distribution of our average deposit accounts, by account type, for the years indicated. Our focus has been on growing our lower costing core deposits (considered all deposits other certificates of deposit) and relying less on originating certificates of deposit.

Borrowed Funds. As a member of the FHLB, Hamilton Bank is eligible to obtain advances upon the security of the Federal Home Loan Bank common stock owned and certain loan products, provided certain standards related to credit-worthiness have been met. Federal Home Loan Bank advances are available pursuant to several credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. At March 31, 2017, based on available collateral, we had the ability to borrow approximately $88.2 million from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. We historically have not used Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta (FHLB) advances to fund our operations. However, beginning in the second half of fiscal 2015, we began to once again borrow from the FHLB as a means to fund our loan growth, including $11.5 million in FHLB advances in March 2017 that were used to supplement the purchase of two loan pools totaling $23.4 million of jumbo residential loans. Additionally, in fiscal 2016 and 2017 we acquired $10.5 million and $15.0 million of FHLB advances in the acquisition of Fairmount and Fraternity, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, we have $35.6 million in advances outstanding from the FHLB as presented in the table below.

Hamilton Bank may also borrow up to $5.0 million from a correspondent bank under a secured federal funds line of credit, and $1.0 million under an unsecured line of credit. We would be required to pledge investment securities to draw upon the secured line of credit. During fiscal 2017, there was nothing drawn upon either line of credit.
 
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2017, we had 74 full-time equivalent employees. Our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Management believes that we have a good working relationship with our employees.
Subsidiary Activities
 
Hamilton Bancorp has one direct subsidiary, Hamilton Bank. At March 31, 2017, Hamilton Bank has five wholly owned subsidiaries including 3110 FC, LLC, a Maryland limited liability company that was formed to hold other real estate owned acquired through foreclosure or deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. On May 13 , 2016, in connection with the acquisition of Fraternity Community Bancorp, the Bank acquired four additional subsidiaries: 4819 Palmer Avenue LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Maryland ("4819 Palmer"); 764 Washington Boulevard LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Maryland ("764 WB LLC"); 764 Washington Boulevard II LLC, a limited liability company organized under the laws of the State of Maryland ("764 WB LLC II"); and Fraternity Insurance Agency, Inc., an inactive corporation organized under the laws of the State of Maryland. 4819 Palmer, 764 WB LLC and 764 WB LLC II were each formed by Fraternity Federal Savings & Loan Association to hold other real estate owned.

REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
 
General
 
As a federal savings bank, Hamilton Bank is subject to examination and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”), and is also subject to examination by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC’). The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which Hamilton Bank may engage and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund, and not for the protection of stockholders. Under this system of federal regulation, financial institutions are periodically examined to ensure that they satisfy applicable standards with respect to matters such as their capital adequacy, assets, management, earnings, liquidity and sensitivity to market interest rates. Hamilton Bank is also regulated to a lesser extent by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “Federal Reserve Board”), which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. Hamilton Bank must comply with the consumer protection regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protections Bureau. Hamilton Bank also is a member of and owns stock in the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta, which is one of the twelve regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The OCC examines Hamilton Bank and prepares reports for the consideration of its board of directors on any operating deficiencies. Hamilton Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated to a great extent by federal law and, to a much lesser extent, state law, especially in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts, the form and content of Hamilton Bank’s loan documents and certain consumer protection matters. 
 
As a savings and loan holding company, Hamilton Bancorp is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. Hamilton Bancorp is also subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission under the federal securities laws. 
 
Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to Hamilton Bank and Hamilton Bancorp. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on Hamilton Bank and Hamilton Bancorp. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on Hamilton Bancorp, Hamilton Bank and their operations. 
 
Federal Banking Regulation 
 
Business Activities. A federal savings bank derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, Hamilton Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and nonresidential real estate, commercial business loans and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Dodd-Frank Act authorized, for the first time, the payment of interest on commercial checking accounts. Hamilton Bank may also establish subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for Hamilton Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. 
 
Capital Requirements. Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 4.5%, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio of 6.0%, a total capital to risk-based assets of 8%, and a 4% Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act.
 
 
19



For purposes of the regulatory capital requirements, common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus, meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Hamilton Bank exercised the opt out option. Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 
 
In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, all assets, including certain off-balance sheet exposures (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests) are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risks believed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one to four- family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0% to 600% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors.
 
In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted asset above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is being phased in beginning January 1, 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and increasing each year until fully implemented at 2.5% of risk-weighted assets on January 1, 2019. The buffer requirement increased to 1.25% as of January 1, 2017.
 
In assessing an institution’s capital adequacy, the OCC takes into consideration, not only these numeric factors, but qualitative factors as well, and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions if deemed necessary. 
 
At March 31, 2017, Hamilton Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable regulatory requirements.
 
Loans to One Borrower. Generally, a federal savings bank may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be loaned, equal to 10% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if the loan is secured by readily marketable collateral, which generally does not include real estate. As of March 31, 2017, Hamilton Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one-borrower limitations. 
 
Qualified Thrift Lender Test. As a federal savings bank, Hamilton Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, Hamilton Bank must either (i) maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” in at least nine months of the most recent 12 months or (ii) qualify as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings institution, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings institution’s business. A federal savings bank that fails the QTL test must operate under specified restrictions specified in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL Test subject to enforcement action for a violation of law. At March 31, 2017, Hamilton Bank held 83.29% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments,” and satisfied the QTL Test.
 
 
20



Capital Distributions. Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings bank, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the capital account. A federal savings bank must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if:
 

● | the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceed the sum of the savings bank’s net income for that year to date plus the savings bank’s retained net income for the preceding two years;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the savings bank would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the savings bank is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings bank that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as Hamilton Bank, must still file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before the board of directors declares a dividend or approves a capital distribution.
 
A notice or application related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if:
 

● | the federal savings bank would be undercapitalized following the distribution;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation, or agreement.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution may not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to satisfy any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings bank also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. In addition, Hamilton Bank’s ability to pay dividends will now be limited if Hamilton Bank does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the new capital rules, which may limit the ability of Hamilton Bancorp to pay dividends to its stockholders. See — “Capital Requirements.”
 
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. All federal savings banks have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low- and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings bank, the OCC is required to assess the federal savings bank’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings bank’s failure to comply with the provisions to the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications such as branch mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. Hamilton Bank received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its last federal examination in 2015. 
 
Transactions with Related Parties. A federal savings bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution, such as Hamilton Bank. Hamilton Bancorp is an affiliate of Hamilton Bank because of its control of Hamilton Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings bank from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. Federal regulations require savings banks to maintain detailed records of all transactions with affiliates. 
 
 
21



Hamilton Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 
 

● | be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | not to exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of Hamilton Bank’s capital.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by Hamilton Bank’s loan committee or board of directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. 
 
Enforcement. The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings banks and has the authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including officers, directors and employees, as well as stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on an insured institution. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order, to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil penalties cover a wide range of violations and actions, and range up to $25,000 per day, unless a finding of reckless disregard is made, in which case penalties may be as high as $1 million per day. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or to recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular savings bank. If action is not taken by the OCC, the FDIC has authority to take action under specified circumstances.
 
Standards for Safety and Soundness. Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems and audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest-rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the guidelines, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. If an institution fails to meet these standards, the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to implement an acceptable compliance plan. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties.
 
Federal law requires that federal bank regulators take “prompt corrective action” with respect to institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements. For this purpose, the law establishes five capital categories: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. The applicable OCC regulations were amended to incorporate the previously mentioned increased regulatory capital standards that were effective January 1, 2015. Under the amended regulations, an institution is deemed to be “well capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 5.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 6.5% or greater. An institution is “adequately capitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 6.0% or greater, a leverage ratio of 4.0% or greater and a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 4.5% or greater. An institution is “undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5%. An institution is deemed to be “significantly undercapitalized” if it has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a leverage ratio of less than 3.0% or a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0%. An institution is considered to be “critically undercapitalized” if it has a ratio of tangible equity (as defined in the regulations) to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%. 
 
 
22



Generally a receiver or conservator must be appointed for an institution that is “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date a federal savings bank receives notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company for the institution required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee the lesser of an amount equal to 5% of the institution’s assets at the time it was notified or deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC, or the amount necessary to restore the institution to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings institution that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters, and the OCC has the authority to require payment and collect payment under the guarantee. Various restrictions, such as on capital distributions and growth, also apply to “undercapitalized” institutions. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors.
 
As of March 31, 2017, Hamilton Bank was classified as a “well capitalized” institution. 
 
Insurance of Deposit Accounts. The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC-insured financial institutions such as Hamilton Bank. Deposit accounts in Hamilton Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. 
 
The FDIC assesses insured depository institutions to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. Under the FDIC’s risk-based assessment system, institutions deemed less risky pay lower assessments. Assessments for institutions of less than $10 billion of assets are now based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure of an institution’s failure within three years. That system, effective July 1, 2016, replaced the previous system under which institutions were placed into risk categories.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to revise its procedures to base assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity instead of deposits. The FDIC finalized a rule, effective April 1, 2011, that set the assessment range at 2.5 to 45 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. In conjunction with the Deposit Insurance Fund’s reserve ratio achieving 1.15%, the assessment range (inclusive of possible adjustments) was reduced for insured institutions of less than $10 billion of total assets to 1.5 basis points to 30 basis points, effective July 1, 2016.
 
The Dodd-Frank Act increased the minimum target Deposit Insurance Fund ratio from 1.15% of estimated insured deposits to 1.35% of estimated insured deposits. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation must seek to achieve the 1.35% ratio by September 30, 2020. The Dodd-Frank Act requires insured institutions with assets of $10 billion or more to fund the increase from 1.15% to 1.35% and, effective July 1, 2016, such institutions are subject to a surcharge to achieve that goal. The Dodd-Frank Act eliminated the 1.5% maximum fund ratio, instead leaving it to the discretion of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has exercised that discretion by establishing a long-range fund ratio of 2%.
 
In addition to the FDIC assessments, the Financing Corporation (“FICO”) is authorized to impose and collect, with the approval of the FDIC, assessments for anticipated payments, issuance costs and custodial fees on bonds issued by the FICO in the 1980s to recapitalize the former Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation. The bonds issued by the FICO are due to mature in 2017 through 2019. For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, the annualized FICO assessment was equal to 0.56 basis points of total assets less tangible capital. 
 
 
23



The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of Hamilton Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. 
 
Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC.

Holding Company Regulation
 
General. Hamilton Bancorp is a savings and loan holding company within the meaning of Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, Hamilton Bancorp is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and is subject to regulations, examinations, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over Hamilton Bancorp and any future non-savings institution subsidiaries. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. 
 
 
25



Permissible Activities. Under present law, the business activities of Hamilton Bancorp are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met, including electing such status or, in the absence of such an election, for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c) (8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations. As of March 31, 2017, Hamilton Bancorp, Inc. has not elected financial holding company status. 
 
Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including Hamilton Bancorp, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5% of another savings institution or holding company thereof, without prior regulatory approval. It also prohibits the acquisition or retention of, with certain exceptions, more than 5% of a non-subsidiary company engaged in activities that are not closely related to banking or financial in nature, or acquiring or retaining control of an institution that is not federally insured. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board must consider the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the federal deposit insurance fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. 
 
The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: 
 

● | the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The states vary in the extent to which they permit interstate savings and loan holding company acquisitions. 
 
Capital. Savings and loan holding companies have not historically been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to promulgate consolidated capital requirements for depository institution holding companies that are no less stringent, both quantitatively and in terms of components of capital, than those applicable to their subsidiary depository institutions. The previously discussed final rule regarding regulatory capital requirements implemented these Dodd-Frank Act requirements. As is the case with institutions themselves, the capital conservation buffer is being phased in between 2016 and 2019. However, legislation was enacted in December 2014 which required the Federal Reserve Board to amend its “Small Bank Holding Company” exemption from consolidated holding company capital requirements to (i) extend its applicability to savings and loan holding companies and (ii) raise the threshold for the exemption from $500 million to $1 billion in consolidated assets. Regulations doing so were effective May 15, 2015. Consequently, both bank and savings and loan holding companies with under $1 billion in consolidated assets, including Hamilton Bancorp, are exempt from the consolidated regulatory capital requirements unless the Federal Reserve Board determines otherwise on a case by case basis. 
 
Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of managerial and financial strength to their subsidiary savings and loan associations by providing capital, liquidity and other support in times of financial stress. 
 
 
26



Dividends. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends and the repurchase of shares of common stock by bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate or earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary savings and loan association becomes undercapitalized. The policy statement also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform the Federal Reserve Board supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or if the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, as of the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of Hamilton Bancorp to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. 
 
Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. 
 
Federal Securities Laws 
 
Hamilton Bancorp’s common stock is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Hamilton Bancorp is subject to the information, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 
 
The registration under the Securities Act of 1933 of shares of common stock issued in the stock offering does not cover the resale of those shares. Shares of common stock purchased by persons who are not our affiliates may be resold without registration. Shares purchased by our affiliates are subject to the resale restrictions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933. If we meet the current public information requirements of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, each affiliate of ours that complies with the other conditions of Rule 144, including those that require the affiliate’s sale to be aggregated with those of other persons, would be able to sell in the public market, without registration, a number of shares not to exceed, in any three-month period, the greater of 1% of our outstanding shares, or the average weekly volume of trading in the shares during the preceding four calendar weeks. In the future, we may permit affiliates to have their shares registered for sale under the Securities Act of 1933. 
 
Emerging Growth Company Status 
 
The JOBS Act which was enacted in April 2012 has made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.0 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” Hamilton Bancorp qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. 
 
An “emerging growth company” may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation; however, Hamilton Bancorp will also not be subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally less than $75 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. Hamilton Bancorp has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company. 
 
 
27



A company loses emerging growth company status on the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.0 billion or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year of the issuer following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of common equity securities of the company pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933; (iii) the date on which such company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which such company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under Securities and Exchange Commission regulations (generally, at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). 
 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 
 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act addresses, among other issues, corporate governance, auditing and accounting, executive compensation, and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. As directed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are required to certify that our quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact. The rules adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act have several requirements, including having these officers certify that: (i) they are responsible for establishing, maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting; (ii) they have made certain disclosures to our auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about our internal control over financial reporting; and (iii) they have included information in our quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been changes in our internal control over financial reporting or in other factors that could materially affect internal control over financial reporting.
