General 
We are a NYSE-listed hospitality and leisure company (ticker symbol: RLH) primarily engaged in the franchising, management and ownership of hotels under our proprietary brands, which include Hotel RL, Red Lion Hotel, Red Lion Inn & Suites, GuestHouse and Settle Inn & Suites. On September 30, 2016, we acquired certain assets from Vantage Hospitality Group, Inc. and a number of its affiliates ("Vantage"), including the brands of Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, Lexington Hotels & Inns, America's Best Inns & Suites, Jameson Inns, Country Hearth Inns & Suites, Vantage Hotels, Value Inn Worldwide, Value Hotel Worldwide, 3 Palms Hotels and Resorts and Signature Inn. All our brands are referred to collectively as the RLHC brands, and our hotels operate in the upscale, midscale or economy hotel segments. 
All our properties strive to highlight friendly service and reflect the local flair of their markets. The upscale and midscale RLHC brands of Hotel RL, Red Lion Hotel and Red Lion Inn & Suites offer a unique local spin on the expected travel experience

in an environment that allows customers to feel welcome and at home. Our focus is to anticipate guest needs and pleasantly surprise them with our distinctive Pacific Northwest-inspired customer service. Warm and authentic, our commitment to customer service includes a focus on delivering the guest locally inspired, friendly and personalized signature moments. This is intended to position each RLHC brand hotel as an advocate to our traveling guests, creating brand relevance and loyalty, differentiating us from our competition.
In October 2014, we launched a new brand, Hotel RL. This upscale lifestyle brand is a full-service, conversion brand that is targeted for the top 80 U.S. urban markets inspired by the spirit of the Pacific Northwest and designed for consumers with a millennial mindset. The first additions to Hotel RL were the Hotel RL Baltimore Inner Harbor and the Hotel RL Washington DC, which opened in August 2015 and October 2015, respectively. During 2016, we converted three of our existing hotels located in Olympia and Spokane, Washington and Salt Lake City, Utah to the Hotel RL brand. These five properties are owned through our joint ventures and operated by RLHC. In addition, the Hotel RL brand currently has 6 signed franchise agreements. In January 2017, two of the franchise Hotel RLs in Brooklyn, New York and Omaha, Nebraska opened. The remaining four are expected to open in the second half of 2017 or early 2018.
Our economy brands are focused on delivering our guests a consistent experience with exceptional comfort, quality and service at an affordable rate, with over 1,000 locations in 47 states and four countries outside the United States. 
A summary of our properties as of December 31, 2016 is provided below:

Managed | 2 | | 500 
Franchised hotels | 1,117 | | 68,900
Total systemwide | 1,137 | | 73,200

We are also engaged in entertainment operations, which derive revenue from promotion and presentation of entertainment productions under the WestCoast Entertainment tradename and from ticketing services under the TicketsWest tradename. The ticketing service offers online ticket sales, ticketing inventory management systems, call center services, and outlet/electronic distributions for event locations. 
Our company was incorporated in the State of Washington in April 1978.
Operations 
We operate in three reportable segments: 
The franchised hotels segment is engaged primarily in licensing our brands to franchisees. This segment generates revenue from franchise fees, which are typically based on a percentage of room revenue or on a flat fee per month, and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our central services programs. These programs include our reservation system, guest loyalty program, national and regional sales, revenue management tools, quality inspections, advertising and brand standards.
The company operated hotel segment derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage offerings at owned and leased hotels for which we consolidate results. Revenues are also derived from management fees and related charges for hotels with which we contract to perform management services.
The entertainment segment is composed of our WestCoast Entertainment and TicketsWest operations. 
Our remaining activities, none of which constitutes a reportable segment, have been aggregated into "other". 
We have two measures of segment performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP): revenue and operating income. In addition, we measure performance of our company operated hotel segment using the following non-GAAP measures: 
2

•Revenue per available room (RevPAR) 
•Average daily rate (ADR)
•Occupancy
•Comparable hotel revenue
•Comparable hotel direct operating income (margin)
Intersegment revenues are minimal. Certain operating expenses are allocated to the operating segments based upon internally established allocation methodologies. Income tax provision (benefit) and certain corporate operating expenses are neither allocated to the segments nor included in the measures of segment performance. See Item 6. Selected Financial Data for information about our non-GAAP measures and reconciliations to the most comparable GAAP measures.

(1 | ) | Certain operating results for the periods included in this report are shown on a comparable hotel basis. With the exception of pro forma economy hotels, comparable hotels are defined as hotels that were in the system for at least one full calendar year as of the beginning of the current reporting year under materially similar operations.
(2 | ) | We acquired the franchise license agreements of GuestHouse and Settle Inn & Suites properties on April 30, 2015. Results presented for periods prior to that date are attributable to and provided by the prior owner. These results do not include any franchises acquired from Vantage, as comparable pro forma data is not available. 
(3 | ) | The results for our three Hotel RLs converted in 2016 are included in midscale company operated hotels, as these properties were previously Red Lion Hotels, which we classify as midscale. 

Average occupancy, ADR and RevPAR, as defined below, are widely used in the hospitality industry and appear throughout this document as important measures to the discussion of our operating performance. 

• | Average occupancy represents total paid rooms occupied divided by total available rooms. We use average occupancy as a measure of the utilization of capacity in our network of hotels.


• | RevPAR represents total room and related revenues divided by total available rooms. We use RevPAR as a measure of performance yield in our network of hotels.


• | ADR represents total room revenues divided by the total number of paid rooms occupied by hotel guests. We use ADR as a measure of room pricing in our network of hotels.


• | Total available rooms represents the number of rooms available multiplied by the number of days in the reported period. We use total available rooms as a measure of capacity in our network of hotels and do not adjust total available rooms for rooms temporarily out of service for remodel or other short-term periods.


• | Comparable hotels are hotels that have been owned, leased, managed, or franchised by us and were in operation for at least one full calendar year as of the beginning of the reporting year and properties for which comparable results were available.

Company Strategy 
Our strategy is to grow our brands and profitability by expanding our hotel network with additional franchised hotels, managing the operations of hotels leased or partially owned by us through joint venture or minority equity participation, managing operations of hotels for hotel owners who have contracted with us to perform management services, and increasing RevPAR by offering superior hotel management technology to hotel operators. 
We believe franchising and management represents a profitable, non-capital intensive growth opportunity. By segmenting our upscale, midscale and economy brands with clear distinctions between each offering, we are uniquely positioned to provide an appealing alternative for a variety of owners. Our strategy for our upscale and midscale hotel brands is to identify larger urban metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) that are saturated by larger brands in order to become the conversion brand of choice for owners of established hotels looking for alternatives in those markets. We believe our strong brand name recognition in the Western U.S. markets provides us with an opportunity to expand our hotel network within our existing footprint. The Midwest, South and East Coast markets also provide us with opportunity to expand our hotel network into markets across North America as our brands will be a unique and new value proposition for current and potential hotel owners in markets saturated by competitor brands. To assist in our ability to grow our hotel network in larger metropolitan cities, we may consider special incentives, management contracting services, minority equity, joint venture opportunities with hotel owners and investors or adding additional brand options. In addition to conversion from other brands, independently branded hotel operations may also benefit from the RLHC central services programs. Our economy hotel brands have strong national brand name recognition and provide hotel owners an affordable alternative to traditional franchise programs with primarily flat fees, sensible property improvement plans and a wealth of resources and programs to support owners. For all of our properties, we strive to provide hotel owners leading distribution technology and sales support as part of our brand support programs. 
We believe that additional growth in our hotel network in larger metropolitan areas will also come from hotel acquisitions where we contribute partial equity or participate in equity ownership opportunities in joint ventures with hotel owners and investors. Equity investment in hotels new to our system is an opportunity for us to redeploy cash on hand or cash generated from sales of joint venture hotels into improvement and expansion of our hotel network in major cities. Further growth opportunities may come from the expansion of our brand offerings. With Hotel RL we have a hotel product that is intended to be flexible enough to allow adaptive reuse projects, conversions and new builds while giving owners a more free-form approach to adapt the hotel to their unique markets and locations. The new flat fee structure is a true differentiator in this segment, which provides a predictable cost structure for our franchisees with the opportunity to leverage a greater proportion of their top-line growth to superior hotel performance. 
All of our owned properties are held in joint venture (JV) entities, in each of which we have a majority ownership interest. Eleven of our hotels are held in RL Venture, LLC, which was formed in January 2015 in which we hold a 55% interest. Immediately after transferring the properties into the JV entity, we sold a 45% member interest to a third party and concurrently refinanced all of our secured debt. During 2016, we completed extensive renovations to these properties, and converted three of them to Hotel RLs. All 11 hotels will continue to be managed by RLHC's wholly-owned subsidiary, RL Management, each with an initial five-year management contract, with three five-year extensions.
Our Baltimore Hotel RL is held in its own JV entity, RLS Balt Venture, LLC, of which we own 73%. 
Our Red Lion Hotel Atlanta Airport is held in its own JV entity, RLS Atla Venture, of which we own 55%.
Our Washington DC Hotel RL is held in its own JV entity, of which we own 55%. Prior to 2016, we owned 86% of this entity. During the first and second quarters of 2016, we sold 31% of our interest, in two transactions, to our joint venture partner. 
The obligation for all of our debt under the JV loan agreements is generally non-recourse to RLHC, except for instances of fraud, criminal activity, waste, misappropriation of revenues, and breach of environmental representations.

In 2015, we completed the acquisition of the intellectual property assets and all hotel franchise license agreements of GuestHouse International, LLC. The acquisition expanded our presence across the country by adding two recognized hotel brands GuestHouse and Settle Inn & Suites, to the RLHC brands, and their franchise license agreements. 
On September 30, 2016 (the close date), we (i) acquired selected assets and assumed certain liabilities of Vantage Hospitality Group, Inc. (“Vantage”), a subsidiary of Thirty-Eight Street, Inc. (“TESI”) and (ii) acquired one brand name asset from TESI. Vantage is a hotel franchise company, and the addition of the Vantage assets substantially increases our number of franchise properties and provides us with a broader presence across the United States and Canada. We acquired over 1,000 hotel franchise and membership license agreements, as well as multiple brand names, including Americas Best Value Inn, Canadas Best Value Inn, Lexington Hotels & Inns, America's Best Inns & Suites, Jameson Inns, Country Hearth Inns & Suites, Vantage Hotels, Value Inn Worldwide, Value Hotel Worldwide, 3 Palms Hotels and Resorts and Signature Inn. The acquisition was funded at closing with $22.6 million of cash on hand, of which $10.3 million was paid to Vantage and $12.3 million was paid to TESI and 690,000 shares of RLHC stock paid to TESI, which was valued at $5.8 million, based on the closing price of RLHC stock of $8.34 on the close date. The total purchase price was $40.2 million, which included the estimated fair value of $0.9 million for the assumption of an obligation related to a previous business acquisition of Vantage and the estimated fair value of $10.9 million of primarily contingent consideration, the total of which will be payable to TESI at the first and second anniversaries of the close date, based on the attainment of certain performance criteria. A minimum of $2 million of the additional consideration is not contingent and will be paid in equal amounts at the first and second anniversaries of the close date. Payment of the contingent consideration is dependent on the retention of Vantage properties under franchise or membership license agreements, as determined by the room count at the first and second year anniversary dates when compared with the room count at the close date
In December 2016, we completed an underwritten public offering of 2.5 million shares of our common stock with net proceeds to the company of $18.5 million. Proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate purposes which may include, but are not limited to, pursing acquisitions and supporting our working capital needs. 
We are also investing in sales and marketing talent and technology to improve our ability to manage the various channels that drive occupancy and average daily rate at our hotels, including transient, group and preferred corporate business. We continue to improve and implement our guest management ecosystem, RevPak, which includes a number of industry revenue generation systems fully integrated to provide comprehensive information by integrating information on customer acquisition, customer management and customer retention. This suite of products is flexible and dynamic and can be tailored to the needs of individual hotel brands. It also delivers dynamic and personalized communications and promotions tailored to individual guest travel needs and habits.
Our focus on improving e-commerce revenue generation includes ongoing updates and improvements to our RedLion.com website and improved and targeted digital marketing utilizing information generated through our RevPak reservation and distribution system.
Employees 
At December 31, 2016, we employed 1,752 people on a full-time or part-time basis, with 1,593 directly related to hotel operations, 98 employees in other operating segments, primarily within our entertainment segment, and 61 employees in our corporate office. Our total number of employees fluctuates seasonally, and we employ many part-time employees. 
At December 31, 2016, approximately 8% of our total workforce was covered by various collective bargaining agreements providing, generally, for basic pay rates, working hours, other conditions of employment and organized settlement of labor disputes. We believe our employee relations are satisfactory.
