ITEM 1.  DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 18, 2002, as ATM Financial Corp.
 
On May 13, 2011 the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Stock Purchase Agreement”) with Seawind Energy Limited (“Seawind Energy”) and its subsidiary Seawind Services Limited (“Seawind services”), pursuant to which the Company acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding common stock of Seawind Energy, in exchange for the issuance of 40,000,000 restricted shares of the Company’s common stock (such transaction as “Seawind Acquisition”).  The acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger and, accordingly, the Company is the legal survivor and Seawind Energy is the accounting survivor.
 
For accounting purposes, Seawind Energy was the surviving entity. The transaction was accounted for as a recapitalization of Seawind Energy pursuant to which Seawind Energy was treated as the surviving and continuing entity.  The Company did not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in connection with this transaction.  Accordingly, the Company’s historical financial statements are those of Seawind Energy immediately following the consummation of the reverse merger.
 
In anticipation of the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, on March 30, 2011 the Company changed its name to 3Power Energy Group Inc. and increased its authorized share capital to 300,000,000 shares.  On July 4, 2011, Seawind Energy and Seawind Service changed their name to 3Power Energy Limited (“3Power Energy”) and 3Power Project Service Limited (“3Power Service”), respectively. Both 3Power Energy and 3Power Service are inactive as of March 31, 2017.
 
The Business 
 
The principle planned business of the Company is to sell electricity generated by solar, wind, hydro, biomass and other renewable energy resources and to develop, build and operate power plants based on these technologies.  The core approach of the Company’s planned business is to deliver energy in markets where there is an inherent energy gap between supply and demand or where there exists long term, stable, government backed financial support for the development of renewable energy.  The strategic plan of the Company is to develop power plants and sell electricity in mature and emerging international energy markets at secure rates with the highest potential margins for return on investment.

Acquisition of Shala Energy sh .p .k:
 
On June 5, 2012, the Company and Shala Energy sh.p.k ("Shala") executed a master acquisition agreement (the “Acquisition Agreement”) whereby Shala agreed to transfer and the Company agreed to acquire 75% of the equity of Shala. Under the Acquisition Agreement (the “Acquisition”), the closing of the acquisition was subject to the Company’s completion and satisfaction of the due diligence on Shala and Shala’s partners with respect to their shares in Shala and upon the Company’s payment of the first year premium for the insurance bond premium issued in favor of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy of Republic of Albania in replacement of the then existing bank guarantee issued in favor of Ministry of Economy, Trade and Energy of Republic of Albania for the Shala River Concession Agreement, in the amount of 7,230,315 Euro (the “Required Insurance Bond Premium”). Shala is a firm specializing in developing hydro-electric projects, owning and operating sustainable energy projects in the hydro, wind and solar power sectors in Albania.
 
On August 10, 2012, after the conclusion of the due diligence efforts, the Company made the first year payment of required Insurance Bond Premium in the amount of 164,851 Euro ($211,972), and as such the Acquisition closed. The Acquisition resulted in the Company acquiring 75% of the interest in a hydro-electrical project of a total installed power of 127.6 MW of Shala River in Albania.  The Shala River project finalization is in process with the Ministry of Albania.
 
In connection the acquisition of Shala, the Company is obligated for an aggregate of 4% of the total project costs as facilitator fees in either cash or the Company's common stock to Capital Trust Holding AG, as advisor for the Shala acquisition transaction. During the year ended March 31, 2013, the Company accrued $600,000 due to the facilitator fees for feasibility studies in process and recorded as expenses. In December 2013, the Company issued to Capital Trust Holding AG and its affiliates, 15,000,000 shares of its common stock, valued at $0.04 per share in settlement of the facilitator fees for feasibility studies.
 
During the year ended March 31, 2016, Shala began operations, acquiring assets and incurring costs. As such, this activity is including in our consolidated balance sheet and statement of operations for the current period.
 
Current Focus
 
During the current fiscal year, Shala has continued to develop hydro power and solar plant concessions in the Republic of Albania.
 
In February 2017 the Albanian Government passed a further law enhancing the national consumption of renewable energy by 8% to 38% of nationally consumed electricity.  Albania’s rivers are a national natural resource which potentially can provide a capacity of 4,000 MW of which currently only approximately 600 MW are being utilised.
 
Albania’s Mediterranean climate also provides the perfect environment for Solar PV produced energy.
 
Shala, through its operating office in Tirana, Albania, has developed concession opportunities of approximately 300 MW hydroelectric and 50 MW of Solar PV plants,.  Of these concessions approximately 100 MW are construction (shovel) ready but no construction has yet commenced. We estimate but cannot guarantee that construction will commence by late 2017.  A further 100 MW are awaiting final construction permits and the remaining capacity is currently in the planning and permission application phase.
 
All concessions have been or are being environmentally assessed by the relevant Albanian Authorities and financial modelling indicates average IRR’s of approximately 15%.
 
Shala is in on-going negotiations with international EPC and O&M providers on the basis of a “design, finance, build and operate” model. 
 
Shala continues to be financially supported by its shareholders, but infrastructure and construction development phase will require substantial additional equity and senior debt. There is no assurance that such financing will be available and if it is not, that would have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to move into the construction phase.

Prior to the closing of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Seawind Services entered into an agreement to provide project management and engineering services to 3Power Energy Group for the development of two wind farm projects in Chile. However, during the year 2012 and 2013, we ceased the 19.5 megawatt Chilean wind farm project on basis that the project is proven to be economically unviable. We also ceased the 9 megawatt solar power plant in Italy around the end of 2012.
 
On October 8, 2012, the High Court of Justice in the United Kingdom issued a winding-up order for the liquidation and winding up of the affairs of 3Power Project Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company’s Subsidiary, 3Power Energy Limited.
