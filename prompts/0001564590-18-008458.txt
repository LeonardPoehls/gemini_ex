Overview 
 We are the leading designer and omni-channel retailer of maternity apparel in the United States, with the only nationwide chain of maternity apparel specialty stores, as well as a deep and expansive assortment available through multiple online distribution points, including our three brand-specific websites. As of February 3, 2018 we operate 1,124 retail locations, including 487 stores in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, and 637 leased departments located within department stores and baby specialty stores throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico. We also sell our merchandise on the Internet, primarily through our Motherhood.com, APeaInThePod.com and DestinationMaternity.com websites. We also sell our merchandise through our Canadian website, MotherhoodCanada.ca, through Amazon.com in the United States, and through websites of certain of our retail partners, including Macys.com.  Our 487 stores operate under three retail nameplates: Motherhood Maternity®, A Pea in the Pod® and Destination Maternity®. We also operate 637 leased departments within leading retailers such as Macy’s®, buybuy BABY® and Boscov’s®. Generally we are the exclusive maternity apparel provider in our leased department locations. 
 We maintain our leading position through our two key brands, which enable us to reach a broad range of maternity customers. Through our stores and certain of our leased departments, we offer maternity apparel under one or both of our two primary brands, Motherhood Maternity (“Motherhood” or “Motherhood Maternity”) at value prices and A Pea in the Pod (“Pea” or “A Pea in the Pod”) at both contemporary and premium prices. Our A Pea in the Pod Collection® (“Pea Collection”) is the distinctive premier maternity apparel line within the A Pea in the Pod brand, featuring exclusive designer label product at premium prices.
 We believe that one of our key competitive advantages is our ability to fulfill, in a high-service store environment, all of an expectant or nursing mother’s clothing needs, including casual and career wear, formal attire, lingerie, sportswear and outerwear, in sizes that cover all trimesters of the maternity cycle. We believe that our vertically-integrated business model enables us to offer the broadest assortment of fashionable maternity apparel. We design and contract the manufacture of over 90% of the merchandise we sell using factories located throughout the world, predominantly outside of the United States. 
 In fiscal 2017 we opened seven stores and closed 35 stores, primarily consisting of closings of underperforming stores. In recent years we have evaluated our retail store base to identify and, in many cases, close underperforming stores where we can do so without disproportionate exit cost.
 Currently, we operate 28 stores and five leased departments in Canada, including 24 Motherhood stores, three Destination Maternity combo stores and one Destination Maternity superstore, and a Motherhood website under a Canadian URL (MotherhoodCanada.ca). In addition, we have international store and product supply relationships in the Middle East, South Korea, Mexico, Israel and India. As of February 3, 2018, we have 188 international franchised locations, comprised of 15 stand-alone stores  173 shop-in-shop locations, in which we have a Company-branded department operated by our franchise partners within other retail stores.
 We believe that our customers, particularly first-time mothers, are entering a new life stage that drives widespread changes in purchasing needs and behavior, thus making our maternity customer and her family a highly-valued demographic for a range of consumer products and services companies. As a result, we have been able to expand and leverage the relationship we have with our customers and generate incremental revenues and earnings by offering other value-added baby and parent-related products and services through a variety of marketing partnership programs utilizing our extensive opt-in customer database and various in-store marketing initiatives.

The Company was founded in 1982 as a mail-order maternity apparel catalog. We began operating retail stores in 1985 and completed our initial public offering in 1993. To address multiple price points in maternity apparel and improve operating productivity, we acquired Motherhood Maternity and A Pea in the Pod in 1995 and acquired other maternity apparel specialty chains from 1994 to 2001. Since the acquisitions of Motherhood Maternity and A Pea in the Pod, we have developed and grown these brands. Also, since the 1990s we have partnered with other retailers to sell our products through maternity apparel departments within their stores.
 Industry Overview 
 We are unaware of any reliable external data on the size of the maternity apparel business. We believe that there is an opportunity to grow our business by selling maternity clothes to those pregnant women who currently purchase loose-fitting or larger-sized non-maternity clothing as a substitute or partial substitute for maternity wear. We also believe that our business can grow by reducing the amount of “hand-me-down” and “borrowing” associated with maternity apparel, particularly in the value-priced segment. Additionally, although we are not wholly unaffected by external factors (such as fluctuations in the birth rate), we believe that the demand for maternity apparel is relatively stable when compared to non-maternity apparel. 
Our Competitive Strengths 
 We are the leader in maternity apparel.     We are the leading designer and omni-channel retailer of maternity apparel in the United States, with the only nationwide chain of maternity apparel specialty stores, as well as a deep and expansive assortment available through multiple online distribution points, including our three brand-specific websites. We believe that our brands are the most recognized in maternity apparel. We have established a broad and diverse distribution network, with stores and leased departments in a wide range of geographic areas and retailing venues (both within and outside of the United States), as well as e-commerce sales through our own brand-specific web-sites, and third-party e-commerce sites includingMacys.com and Amazon.com. In addition, we have a leading position across all major price points of maternity apparel through our retail store nameplates and our brands. Our exclusive focus on maternity apparel and our leadership position enable us to gain a comprehensive understanding of the needs of our maternity customers and keep abreast of fashion and product developments that meet her style. 
 We offer a comprehensive assortment of maternity apparel and accessories.     A primary consideration for expectant mothers shopping for maternity clothes is product assortment, as pregnant women typically need to replace at least a portion of their wardrobe. We believe that we offer the widest selection of merchandise in the maternity apparel business. We also offer product for multiple seasons, as pregnant women’s clothing needs vary depending on their due date. Our ability to offer a broad assortment of product is due, in large part, to our vertically-integrated business model, which includes our extensive in-house design and contract manufacturing capabilities. 
 We are vertically integrated.     We design and contract for the manufacture of over 90% of the merchandise we sell. We believe that vertical integration enables us to offer the broadest assortment of maternity apparel, to respond quickly to fashion trends, to ensure product quality, to improve product gross margins and to optimize in-stock levels.
 We are able to enhance our leadership position by distributing our products through multiple distribution points, including online as well as through our leased department relationships.  In addition to our 487 stores, we distribute our product online through our ecommerce websites (Motherhood.com, APeaInThePod.com, DestinationMaternity.com and MotherhoodCanada.ca) and third party websites (such as Amazon.com and Macys.com), as well as through our 637 leased departments located within department stores and baby specialty stores throughout the United States and in Puerto Rico, namely Macy’s, buybuy BABY and Boscov’s. Generally we are the exclusive maternity apparel provider in our leased department locations. We believe that we have an opportunity to increase the sales and profit we generate from our current online distribution points and leased department relationships by growing and improving our performance in these channels.  In addition we believe we have the opportunity to increase our sales and profit further through the select addition of new digital and brick and mortar distribution points with new retail partners.
 We have an experienced management team.     We have an executive management team with significant experience in all aspects of the retail and apparel business, including our interim Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) Melissa Payner-Gregor, who has over 20 years of experience in specialty retail, our Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), David Stern, who has over 15 years of senior financial management experience, including over nine years of experience with retail organizations, and our Chief Administrative Officer, Ronald Masciantonio, who has over a decade of senior management experience at Destination Maternity.  Our executive management team is complemented by experienced specialty retail executives across all disciplines of our Company.

----+--------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe our ability to lease attractive real estate locations is enhanced due to the brand awareness of our concepts, our multiple price point approach, our highly sought-after maternity customer and our real estate management and procurement capabilities. We are the only maternity apparel retailer to provide mall operators with differently priced retail concepts, depending on the mall’s target demographics. We are also able to provide varied store formats for malls whose maternity customers seek a wide range of price alternatives. In addition, in the case of multi-mall operators, we have the flexibility to provide several stores across multiple malls.
 Motherhood Maternity Stores.     Motherhood Maternity is our largest chain with 385 stores as of February 3, 2018. Our Motherhood Maternity brand serves the moderate priced portion of the maternity apparel business, which has the greatest number of customers. The Motherhood brand is positioned with an expansive on-trend fashion assortment ranging from wardrobe essentials to special occasion, offering quality merchandise at affordable value. Motherhood stores average approximately 1,800 square feet and are located primarily in mid-priced and moderate regional malls, strip and power centers, and central business districts. Motherhood stores include 96 outlet locations that carry Motherhood-branded merchandise as well as some closeout merchandise. In fiscal 2017 we opened five new Motherhood stores including outlets and closed 29 Motherhood stores including outlets. As of February 03, 2018, we operated 24 Motherhood stores in Canada and believe that market opportunities may permit us to open additional stores in Canada in the future. 
 A Pea in the Pod Stores.     As of February 3, 2018, we had 27 A Pea in the Pod stores. Our A Pea in the Pod brand is a contemporary, fashion-forward assortment including a curated selection of exclusive designer labels at better and premium pricing, offering customers fashionable maternity pieces. A Pea in the Pod stores average approximately 2,100 square feet and are located in mid-priced regional malls, lifestyle centers and central business districts while others are located in upscale venues, including Beverly Hills, Water Tower Place (Chicago), South Coast Plaza (Orange County, California) and Newbury Street (Boston). In fiscal 2017 we opened two Pea stores and closed one Pea store. 
 Destination Maternity Stores.     As of February 3, 2018, we had 75 Destination Maternity nameplate stores averaging approximately 4,200 square feet, including 43 Destination Maternity combo stores and 32 Destination Maternity superstores. Our Destination Maternity stores carry both of our primary brands (Motherhood and Pea). Our Destination Maternity combo stores are larger (average of approximately 2,900 square feet) than our single-brand stores. Our Destination Maternity superstores carry both of our primary brands, plus an expanded line of maternity-related accessories, nursing products, health and fitness products, books, and body and nutritional products. Our Destination Maternity superstores also typically feature a “relax area” for husbands and shoppers alike, and an inside play area for the pregnant mom’s toddlers and young children. Destination Maternity superstores average  approximately 5,700 square feet for the 32 stores open as of February 3, 2018. In fiscal 2017 we did not open any Destination Maternity stores and closed five Destination Maternity stores. 
 Leased Departments.     In addition to the stores we operate, we have arrangements with department stores and baby specialty stores, including Macy’s, buybuy BABY and Boscov’s to operate maternity apparel departments in their stores. Generally, we are the exclusive maternity apparel provider in our leased department locations. We staff these leased departments at varying levels and maintain control of the pricing and promotional terms, as well as the timing and degree of the markdowns of our merchandise that is sold in the leased departments. We operate our leased departments during the same hours and days as the host store and are responsible for replenishment of the merchandise in the leased departments. These leased departments typically involve the lease partner collecting all of the revenue from the leased department. The revenue is remitted to us, less a fixed percentage of the net sales earned by the lease partner as stipulated in each agreement.

----+---------------------------------------------

 International.      Currently, we operate 28 stores and five leased departments in Canada, including 24 Motherhood stores, three Destination Maternity combo stores and one Destination Maternity superstore, and a Motherhood website under a Canadian URL (MotherhoodCanada.ca).
 We have a franchise agreement with Multi Trend, a member of the Al-Homaizi Group, covering six key markets in the Middle East. As of February 3, 2018, our Motherhood and Pea merchandise is offered in 14 franchise stores operating in the Middle East. 
 We have a franchise agreement with Agabang & Company to sell our brands in South Korea. Our Motherhood and Pea merchandise is available for sale in maternity shop-in-shops operated by Agabang in its Agabang Gallery and Nextmom stores (which carry infant and children’s apparel and non-apparel merchandise, as well as maternity apparel) and other retail stores, and in franchise stores in South Korea. As of February 3, 2018, our Motherhood and Pea merchandise is offered in 38 shop-in-shops and one franchise store in South Korea.
 We have a franchise agreement with El Puerto de Liverpool, S.A.B. de C.V., the largest department store company in Mexico. Our Motherhood and Pea merchandise is available for sale primarily in maternity shop-in-shops located in Liverpool’s department stores (which carry a wide range of products, including infant and children’s apparel and non-apparel merchandise, as well as maternity apparel) throughout Mexico. As of Feburary3, 2018 our Motherhood and Pea merchandise is offered in 102 shop-in-shops in Mexico.
 We have a franchise agreement with H&O Fashion Ltd., one of Israel's largest and dominant fashion-retail chains. Our Motherhood and Pea merchandise is offered through shop-in-shops in select H&O stores. As of February 03, 2018, our Motherhood and Pea merchandise is offered in 33 shop-in-shops in Israel.
 We have a franchise agreement with Rhea Retail Private Limited, a leader in the sale of women’s, children’s, and infants’ clothing and accessories in India, however, as of February 3, 2018, our merchandise is not offered in any locations.
 We continue to evaluate other international sales opportunities. As our franchise relationships to date demonstrate, our initial international strategy has primarily consisted of franchising, licensing or similar arrangements with foreign partners. Our future international strategy may include increased e-commerce distribution, franchising or licensing arrangements with foreign partners, as well as potentially entering into wholesale business arrangements, entering into joint ventures or developing our own operations in certain countries. 
 Internet Operations 
 We sell our merchandise on the Internet primarily through our brand-specific websites, Motherhood.com and APeaInThePod.com, as well as through our DestinationMaternity.com website. We also sell our merchandise through our Canadian website, MotherhoodCanada.ca, as well as through Amazon.com and Macys.com in the United States. We believe that many pregnant women, particularly millennials, use the Internet to find maternity-related information and to purchase maternity clothes. Our websites are therefore important tools for educating existing and potential customers about our brands and driving traffic to our stores. Our marketing and technology capabilities and the replenishment capabilities of our distribution facilities and stores enable us to incorporate Internet design, operations and fulfillment into our existing operations. Our brand-specific sites were re-launched in in the first quarter of 2017 after a complete re-platforming of each of our sites through integration with a best-in-class enterprise cloud commerce solution. The provider is the category-defining leader of enterprise cloud commerce solutions used by a variety of best-in-class Internet retailers, including a significant number of fashion focused specialty retailers. We believe this integration is currently helping and will continue to help us keep current with the ever-changing digital landscape while focusing our efforts on our core merchandising and operational strengths.   We believe that our Internet operations (both through our existing ecommerce distribution points and, perhaps, new ecommerce distribution points) represent a continued growth opportunity for us to increase sales and profit in all channels.

Marketing Partnerships 
 We believe our customers, particularly first-time mothers, are entering a new life stage that drives widespread changes in purchasing needs and behavior, thus making our maternity customer and her family a highly-valued demographic for a range of consumer products and services companies. We have been able to leverage the relationship we have with our customers to earn incremental revenues. We expect to continue to expand and leverage the relationship we have with our customers and earn incremental revenues through a variety of marketing partnership programs utilizing our extensive opt-in customer database and various in-store and online marketing initiatives, which help introduce our customers to various baby and parent-related products and services offered by leading third-party consumer products companies. 
Operations 
 Merchandising Operations Teams.     To obtain maximum efficiencies, we are organized primarily along functional lines, such as merchandising, design, planning and allocation, and production. Our merchandising, design, and planning and allocation teams are organized on a brand-specific basis. Each brand team is led by the head merchant and includes a brand-specific head designer and head planner. These teams are also supported by centralized production, purchasing, marketing and other necessary professionals. 
 Store Operations.     The typical maternity customer, especially the first-time mother, seeks more advice and assistance than the typical non-maternity customer. Therefore, we aim to employ passionate, skilled and inspirational store team members who are trained to provide the high level of attentive service and reassurance needed by our customers. Our goal is to provide a boutique or personalized level of service that differentiates us from our competitors. Our centralized merchandising, store operations and visual presentation departments also enable our field leadership and store team members to focus primarily on selling and maintaining consistency from store to store on their appearance and operational execution. In addition, our visual presentation department coordinates with the merchandising department to develop floor-sets, design store display windows and place marketing materials to better define and enhance the product presentation. 
 The field/store leadership reporting structure consists of regional directors, district managers, leased area managers and store managers. Generally, these members of the field/store leadership team are each eligible to receive incentive-based compensation related to store, district and regional performance for both our stores and leased department groups.
 Merchandising, Design and Inventory Planning and Allocation 
 Merchandising.     Our product styling decisions are based on current fashion trends, as well as input from our designers and outside vendors as we seek to create fashionable product that flatters and comfortably fits the pregnant woman’s body, allowing her to maintain her pre-pregnancy sense of style. We strive to maintain an appropriate balance between introducing new and proven styles, as well as between basic essential wardrobe pieces and fashion items. Each brand has its own team of merchants and designers. The merchandising and design teams each report to our Senior Vice President of Merchandising and Design. 
 Design.     The design of our products begins with a review of global runway trends, current non-maternity retail fashion trends, fashion reporting service information and fabric samples. The designers review our best-selling items from prior seasons and integrate current fashion ideas from the non-maternity apparel business. 
 Planning and Allocation.     Our inventory planning and allocation department is responsible for planning future inventory purchases and pricing, as well as targeting overall inventory levels and turnover. We establish target inventories for storefronts within each channel with the goals of optimizing our merchandise assortment and turnover, maintaining adequate depth of merchandise by style and managing closeout and end-of-season merchandise consolidation. Our planning and allocation team continually monitors and responds to consumer demand through utilization of available tools. Our capabilities to perform these tasks were significantly enhanced with the implementation of our new cloud-based allocation tool and related processes in fiscal 2016. The planning and allocation department reports to our Senior Vice President of Planning and Allocation.
Production and Distribution 
 Our direct supply chain manufactures over 90% of our apparel, predominantly outside of the United States. In fiscal 2017 we continued to focus on the supply chain reducing the number of factories and balance our global footprint, to improve costs, streamline operations, ensure quality and improve speed to market. We maintain the flexibility to add new contractors, if necessary, to fulfill our sourcing needs. No individual vendor/factory represents a material portion of our production. A majority of our merchandise is purchased “full package” as finished product made to our specifications, typically utilizing our designs. Substantially all the merchandise produced outside of the United States is paid for in US dollars. 
 7

Our production personnel work with our supply chain to ensure, compliance with our design specifications and timely delivery of finished goods from concept through to finished product. We use a third-party consulting firm to help monitor working conditions at our contractors’ facilities on a global basis ensuring social compliance standards are followed.
 Finished garments from manufacturers and vendors are received at our distribution center in Florence, New Jersey. Garments are inspected and then channeled into our automated storage and retrieval devices, as well as traditional bulk storage. The Florence distribution facility utilizes a fully-integrated equipment and software system capable of servicing all business channels. This integrated system allows for optimum inventory utilization, rapid replenishment and extremely accurate fulfillment of all orders. Retail location replenishment decisions are made based upon target inventories established by our planning and allocation department and individual retail location sales data and were enhanced with the implementation of our new cloud-based allocation tool. Freight is routed through small parcel carriers while utilizing zone-skipping methodologies, which improves cost effectiveness and speed to market. 
 Since 2003 we have been certified to participate in Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”), a United States Department of Homeland Security sponsored program, with United States Customs and Border Protection (“U.S. Customs”), through which we implement and monitor our procedures to manage the security of our supply chain as part of the effort to protect the United States and our imported products against potential acts of terrorism. Since 2005 we have been certified to participate in the Importer Self-Assessment Program (“ISA”), a U.S. Customs program available only to C-TPAT participants with strong internal controls. Through our participation in the ISA program, we assume responsibility for monitoring our own compliance activities with applicable U.S. Customs regulations in exchange for certain benefits, which may help increase efficiency in importing. These benefits include exemption from certain government audits, increased speed of cargo release from U.S. Customs, front of the line access to U.S. Customs cargo exams, enhanced prior disclosure rights from U.S. Customs in the event of alleged trade violations, availability of voluntary additional compliance guidance from U.S. Customs, and less intrusive government oversight of trade compliance. In 2010 we were granted Tier 3 Status within the C-TPAT program, the highest level of recognition currently available. Our Tier 3 Status was revalidated in January 2018. In 2013 we participated in a revalidation of our C-TPAT process in Vietnam with U.S. Customs.
 In 2007 we were accepted to participate in the U.S. Customs and Border Protection’s Drawback Compliance Program. The benefits of this program include 1) waiver of prior notice where we do not have to notify U.S. Customs at the time of export of product to Canada and 2) accelerated payment privileges to receive drawback refunds of United States import duties previously paid within 30 days of filing the claim for refund, with respect to goods we export from the United States that we previously imported into the United States. 
 Information Technology Systems 
 Historically, our information technology systems have been developed in-house or highly customized versions of external software with our custom Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) system serving as the central brain of most of our systems, including our core merchandising system. Our current ERP system manages our production inventories, documentation, purchase orders and scheduling. In addition, we have an in-house developed Internet-based point-of-sale system that provides daily access to financial and merchandising information in addition to payment processing. This point-of-sale system feeds information back to the ERP for use in our core merchandising tasks.
 Although our current systems, including our in-house developed ERP and point of sale systems, are serviceable and adequate to meet our business needs, we continue to move forward with plans for modernization of our technology portfolio. In fiscal 2016 we completed the implementation of a best-in-class tool for inventory allocation. In addition, we have implemented a market leading payment processing solution which greatly improves the security of cardholder data and enables EMV-compliant payment processing in our stores. We also did substantial work in implementing our new web platform and re-launching each of our ecommerce sites,  which went live in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
 Given the importance of our information technology systems, we continue to take extensive measures to ensure their responsiveness and security. Our hardware and communications systems are based on a redundant and multiprocessing architecture, which allows their continued operation on a parallel system in the event that there is a disruption within the primary system. We have two data centers supporting our business functions: one in our corporate headquarters location in Moorestown, New Jersey and the second in our distribution center in Florence, New Jersey. The data centers communicate via diverse broadband connections using multiple service providers. In addition, our software programs and data are backed up and securely stored off-site.
 Advertising and Marketing 
 Our advertising and marketing program serves to strengthen the power of our brands, to drive traffic to our stores, to increase customer loyalty and word-of-mouth referrals, and to support our e-commerce platforms. The key objectives of our marketing strategy are helping every new customer discover our brands and recognize us as the authority in maternity fashion; motivating her to purchase; reaffirming that her decision to shop with us was the right one; and creating a memorable experience that she will share. 
 8

We understand that our customers have a limited window of need, so we target our messaging through a robust customer relationship management (CRM) program that utilizes focused email messaging and traditional direct-mail advertising. In addition, we advertise on her favorite websites and provide social media content to ensure that our messaging reaches and engages her. On our own e-commerce sites we have additional marketing opportunities through exclusive sales and on-site features that help our customer discover the right fashion to fit her style based on her pregnancy stage. 
 In our stores we use inspirational imagery and informative signage to enhance each customer’s shopping experience and to encourage her to buy. Our in-store signage provides visuals of seasonal collections and new styles. Our publicity efforts generate editorial coverage locally and nationally in a variety of media formats for our brands. In addition, our public relations efforts and partnerships with bloggers, celebrities and other third parties expand our reach.
 Competition 
 Our business is highly competitive and characterized by low barriers to entry, especially online. The following are several factors important to competing successfully in the retail apparel industry: ability to anticipate fashion trends and customer preferences; product procurement and pricing; breadth of selection in sizes, colors and styles of merchandise; inventory control; quality of merchandise; store design and location; visual presentation and advertising; customer service; and reputation. We face competition in our maternity apparel lines from various sources, including department stores, specialty retail chains, discount stores, independent retail stores and catalog and Internet-based retailers, from both new and existing competitors. Many of our competitors are larger and have substantially greater financial and other resources than us. Our better and premium-priced merchandise faces a highly fragmented competitive landscape that includes locally based, single unit retailers, as well as a handful of multi-unit maternity operations. In the value-priced maternity apparel business, we currently face competition on a nationwide basis from retailers such as Gap®, H&M®, Old Navy®, Target® and Wal-Mart®. Substantially all these competitors also sell maternity apparel on their websites. We also face increasing competition from Internet-based retailers such as ASOS, Pink Blush, Zulily and Hatch. 
Employees 
 As of February 3, 2018, we had approximately 1,100 full-time and 2,600 part-time employees. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our employee relations to be good.

 Seasonality 
 Our business, like that of many other retailers, is seasonal. Our quarterly net sales were historically highest in the peak Spring selling season during our third fiscal quarter that previously ended on June 30 of our fiscal years that ended on September 30. Under our 4-5-4 retail fiscal calendar ending on the Saturday nearest January 31 of each year, the peak Spring selling season generally occurs during our first and second fiscal quarters. Given the historically higher sales level in that timeframe and the relatively fixed nature of most of our operating expenses, we have typically generated a very significant percentage of our full year operating income and net income during the calendar months of March through May. Results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year. Quarterly results may fluctuate materially depending upon, among other things, increases or decreases in comparable sales, the timing of new store openings and closings, new leased department openings and closings, net sales and profitability contributed by new stores and leased departments, the timing of the fulfillment of purchase orders under our product and license arrangements, adverse weather conditions, shifts in the timing of certain holidays and promotions, changes in inventory and production levels and the timing of deliveries of inventory, and changes in our merchandise mix.
