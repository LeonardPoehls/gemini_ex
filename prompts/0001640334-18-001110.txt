Product Sourcing
 
TGS purchases its products from a Chinese manufacturer. On June 4, 2017, we entered into a marketing and sale agency agreement with this Chinese manufacturer. With this agreement, we will be responsible for the marketing and sale of products in Canada. The agreement is for a term of 2 years with automatic renewal for one year term for subsequent years. There are no royalties payable pursuant to the agreement and no pre-determined wholesale or retail prices. Wholesale product pricing will be determined by the parties on a continual basis, and retail pricing will be at the discretion of TGS. The Chinese manufacturer will manufacture PVC panels to order based on the mold designed by the company, or to such other specifications as may be requested by the company from time to time. The company will strive to maintain a solid rapport with its manufacturer to ensure the company will have a good quality product and enhanced reliability in manufacturing and delivery. TGS also plans to work closely with its manufacturer to diversify its products to present a more complete and varied product line. 
 
Benefit of PVC Panels
 
PVC panels boast many advantageous qualities for building applications both traditional and creative. Their usage has gained increasing popularity as they are ideal alternatives for conventional building materials such as drywalls and plywood, particularly in areas exposed to water and moisture.
 
Easy Installation. PVC panels are quick and easy to install, without the need for complex specialty tools. Their interlocking design is based on a simple tongue-and-groove mechanism, pieced together like a jigsaw puzzle. Fasteners are hidden inside the grooves and finished off with specially designed trimmings to provide a smooth and clean finish. Panels are available in standard width and customizable lengths to accommodate to different project requirements.
Low Maintenance. PVC panels require minimal effort to maintain and cleaning only involves water and a mild soap solution using a sponge or soft bristle brush. On most occasions, wiping will be sufficient.
Waterproof and Mold Proof. One of the most appealing selling points of PVC panels is their water-resistant capability; ideal for use in areas with frequent exposure to water that would otherwise damage alternative wall applications. Because of their ability to repel water, they are also highly resistant to mold and bacteria, making them highly hygienic and suitable for environments with stringent health and safety requirements.
Fire and Chemical Resistant. The chemical makeup of PVC panels provides an inherit resistance to fire and most corrosive chemicals. Not only do they offer a safe environment for application but also longevity not obtainable with conventional building materials.
Lightweight yet Durable. With their hollow design and standard widths, PVC panels are easy to transport and lightweight compared to other materials of similar application. Nonetheless, they are also very durable and robust; materials that can withstand even the toughest and most demanding environments.
Bright and Clean. The smooth, glossy finish of the panels helps reflect light, offering interiors a bright and clean appearance. As long as the panels are installed indoor as directed, they are fade resistant and the surface will remain fresh and clean for a long period of time.
Versatile Application. PVC panels are suitable for virtually all indoor settings and environments whereby walls and ceilings exist. They can be installed as a new walls system or retrofitted to existing surfaces with little complications. The panels can be installed horizontally, vertically, or even diagonally to accommodate to the needs and tastes of individual customers.
Cost and Time Effective. The simplicity of PVC panels calls for straightforward labour. No additional plastering or painting is required. Not only can projects be completed in a fraction amount of time in comparison to drywall, but money is also saved as labour cost is significantly reduced.
Recyclable. PVC panels can be recycled and reshaped into new products.

PVC panel Applications
 
Due to the versatility of the products, PVC panels can be utilized in a wide array of different applications within residential, commercial, and industrial settings. They are ideal alternatives to traditional wall systems not only for their functionality but also for their decorative aptitude.
 

Residential Use | Commercial Use | Industrial Use 
----------------+------------------------+---------------------------

Installation Overview
 
Cutting. The panels can be cut vertically or horizontally using simple woodworking tools. They can be cut using a normal fine-toothed wood saw or with a jigsaw.
Fitting to Walls. The panels can be fitted directly to the wall and can be fixed straight over tiles. Only on exceptionally uneven/bad conditioned walls do they need to be fitted to battens. The panels can be glued, screwed, nailed or stapled as desired. Due to the tongue and groove nature of the paneling, they can be fixed through the tongue, such that the fixings are always hidden.
Fitting to Ceilings. Panels can be fitted using adhesive, staples or screws. If suspending from the ceiling, panels can be fitted using a metal hanger bracket or attached to a wooden framework. To cut holes for spotlights, a hole cutting attachment for an electric drill is ideal.
Industry Analysis
 
Construction Industry
 
Canada’s construction industry activity dropped from US$294.1 billion in 2014 to US$289.0 billion in 2015, marking a 1.7 percent decline, following an average annual growth of 3.6 percent for four consecutive years. Weak economic conditions, low commodity prices, poor fixed-capital investments, public spending cuts, and a high rate of unemployment all contributed to this weak performance. Despite this downturn, industry activity is expected to pick up in 2016 with marked improvement over the next five years to reach US$321 billion by 2020, driven by investment in public infrastructure, renewable energy infrastructure and commercial projects, and improvements in consumer and investor confidence. Growing population and urbanization, and improvements in domestic manufacturing activities are predicted to be the main drivers behind the industry growth up until 2020 in Canada. Several government programs, such as the Affordable Housing Initiative (AHI), New Building Canada Plan (NBCP) and Made in Canada, will also continue to support the industry’s growth over the forecast period.
 
Non-residential and engineering construction projects will remain the keystones of provincial and federal governments ten-year plans. As a start, the second quarter of 2016 saw investment in non-residential construction rising 0.2 percent to $12.6 billion from the previous quarter. However, construction activity will vary greatly across provinces, with some regions impacted by lower commodity prices, delayed or cancelled projects and declining employment.
 
Alberta. Low oil and natural gas prices in Alberta will continue to hinder engineering, institutional, and industrial construction until 2019. Commercial building, on the other hand, will continue into 2016 with existing projects, before slowing in 2017 and growing in steady increments over the long term.

Manitoba. The province’s diverse economic sectors offer potential for growth as major new hydro, transmission and pipeline projects go underway. It is also anticipated that there will also be a gradual rise in commercial and industrial building construction and growing demand for maintenance work.
Saskatchewan. It is anticipated that non-residential building construction will be maintained at high levels until 2021 by major mining and infrastructure projects, as well as steady gains in maintenance work in the near term. As projects wind down after 2021, the decline in engineering-related work declines will be offset by moderate growth in industrial, commercial and institutional (ICI) building construction.
British Columbia. Construction in 2016 will begin in a growth phase with new infrastructure projects and energy development leading investment.
 
Residential
 
Residential construction is expected to take on more importance in the industry over the next five years, to account for 38.4 percent of the industry’s total value in 2020. The market will be supported by a rising population, urbanization, improving economic conditions, as well as the government’s initiative to provide affordable houses to the lower- and middle-class population through the Affordable Housing Initiative. The Canadian government is planning to spend US$6.0 billion in social infrastructure by 2020, which includes expenditure on renovation and new housing buildings construction.
Housing Starts
 
After years of record growth, nationwide housing starts are expected to slow in 2018 and 2019. While there is an overall decline in new housing starts at the national level, activity will vary greatly amongst different provinces. Oil-producing provinces such as Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Newfoundland and Labrador are expected to experience continual decline before rebounding.
Renovations
 
While new housing slows, renovation work continues to rise in Canada across all provinces. Renovation spending is an important part of Canada’s economy, contributing roughly $15 billion to the local market in 201512 and accounting for 3.4 percent of the gross domestic product in 2014. From the millennium up to the recession, the renovation industry has grown by 8.7 percent annually and 2.6 percent per year post-recession. With Canadians struggling to afford new housing options, many have turned to renovations as a way to achieve better living spaces.
Market Size and Growth
 
In 2013, roughly 39.3 million tons of PVC were consumed worldwide, making it one of the most widely produced plastics in addition to polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). According to German market research firm Ceresana, demand for PVC is expected to rise by 3.2 percent per annum until 2021. Asia-Pacific currently makes up the largest market in sales, accounting for 56 percent of global consumption. It will remain as the highest growth market in the upcoming years, followed by North America and Western European, who are experiencing growth again after losses in previous years.
 
The construction industry has been recognized as the leading market for the sale of PVC products. Despite a slowdown, China’s construction industry remains the highest growing market in the world, followed by India, who is expected to grow at a rate of 4.9 percent per year. With positive developments in the construction industry, demand for PVC products in the United States and Canada is projected to be on a steady rise, rebounding from weak domestic demand in previous years.

Market Strategy
 
Agricultural
 
Agricultural facilities will represent one of the major target markets of the Company. Among agricultural facilities, TGS will largely be focusing its initial marketing efforts towards the Hutterites colonies within Canada through various forms of direct marketing. The Hutterites, with their concentrated geographic locations and dominant agricultural background, are ideal customers for the Company. This largely untapped market presents a tremendous potential as they allow for the purchase of large volume and opportunity for recurring business. Word-of-mouth is a very effective form of advertisement within such tightly knit community. TGS hopes to take advantage of such once it gains entry into this market. The Company will be working closely with agents with experience conducting business with the Hutterites colonies to maximize its marketing reach. 
 
Each Hutterite colony is inhabited by 50 to 120 people with an average of 80 people and 14 families. Almost all Hutterites are sustained through farming, an occupation of utmost importance pertaining to their religious beliefs. Most colonies grow crops and manage farms between 3,000 and 12,000 acres. They also raise a large amount of livestock, at times producing 10 to 30 percent of a province’s hogs, eggs, or turkeys18. 
 
Residential
 
TGS will also be pursuing the home renovation market where PVC panel could be a practical replacement to drywall installations, particularly where moisture and mold growth are issues. The Company will work with experienced contractors that can seek out potential market in the residential sector and, at the same time, generate enough buzz within the market to enhance consumer interest and knowledge for how PVC panels can be incorporated into their homes.
 
According to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation’s last issue of Renovation and Home Purchase Report published in 2012, contractors continue to play a big part in homeowner’s renovation projects. Among households that renovated in 2011, 35 percent contracted out all the work, 30 percent contracted out partial of the work, 29 percent engaged in the work themselves, and 5 percent purchased materials and contracted out the labor. Respondents between ages 45 to 54 performed 28 percent of all renovations, the highest among all the age groups, followed by age 55 to 64, age 35 to 44, age 65+, and lastly, age 25 to 34. The average cost of renovations was highest among the highest income brackets, led by those earning over $100,000 (at an average cost of $18,604), followed by those earning $80,000 to $99,999 (average cost of $11,827).
 
Commercial and Industrial 
 
For the commercial and industrial market, the Company will target facilities where frequent exposure to water may pose as a concern, such as car wash facilities. As well, it will also target warehousing facilities for which the use of PVC wall panels could substantially reduce cost and installation time. PVC panels can also be considered for use in temporary facilities in which the panels can be removed at the end of the job and relocated to another facility. 
Marketing and Sale Strategy
 
Pricing
 
A competitively lower price point will be set at the initial stage of the Company’s operations to avoid direct competition with the existing suppliers in Canada. This pricing strategy aims to overcome the challenge of being a new entry into the market and to attract larger volumes sales from contractors and the Hutterite colonies in hopes of retaining them as repeat customers. Generally, the Company aims to sell its products at 10% below the selling price of other suppliers while achieving a gross profit margin of at least 15% to 20%. Based on the company’s recent review, the market selling price of PVC panels ranges from $1.30 to $1.80 per square foot. Despite the company’s appealing price structure, it is important for the consumers to be aware that quality will not be comprised. TGS’ lowered pricing approach should be achievable through a combined competitive advantage of having its products sourced overseas, an effective coordination of logistic functions and a simple corporate structure. Once the Company establishes a stable foothold in the market, price adjustments can be made as needed to achieve a more favorable profit margin.

Inventory, Sales and Distribution
 
We do not currently maintain an inventory of products, although we intend to do so when we have sufficient capital to procure an inventory of our custom designed panels. We will require a minimum investment of $50,000 to manufacture the first container of our custom designed PVC panels. A container represents the minimum shipping quantity available to us. 
 
TGS does not intend to carry any large amount of in-house inventory and will aim to complete orders only upon the fulfillment of a minimum shipping quantity. It is, therefore, imperative that a significant sales volume be achieved, not only to offset the reduced profit margin due in part of the lower pricing, but also to attain maximum economy in shipping and to eliminate the cost for inventory storage. Generally, shipments of products will be shipped to Calgary and from Calgary the products will be distributed to customers. Although we do not currently require a warehouse facility, we anticipate that we will require a modest warehousing or storage space once we invest in an inventory of our custom designed panels. Such spaces are commonly available in Calgary on a month to month basis. 
 
When we do obtain inventory, wholesale prices will be negotiated on a case by case basis. Similarly, we will negotiate retail prices on a case by case basis, typically incorporating a markup of 15% to 30% from the factory wholesale price. Generally, all payments will be due upon delivery. For large orders, we will require a deposit of 30%. We will either receive payments directly from customers or from our agents. 
 
The sale of TGS’ products will primarily be conducted through direct sale or the company’s sales agents. Initially, TGS plans to have two groups of sales agents, with one group located in northern Alberta and one group located in southern Alberta. Generally, the Company would require a deposit of 30% upon receiving an order and a final payment on delivery. Importantly, our ability to engage sales agents is subject to our raising sufficient capital to finance inventory, marketing expense, and general and administrative expenses. 
 
Promotion
 
Direct marketing, public relations, simple advertisements and word-of-mouth will be TGS’ primary promotional strategy. We will also focus our marketing efforts towards farming communities in the form of direct fax advertising to create awareness and stimulate consumer interest. Facsimile remains a common form of communication channel within the farming communities, such as Hutterite colonies. The advertisement will provide general information about our products and direct the viewer to the Company’s sales agent to obtain further details. As the sales agent will be the representative for the Company, strong interpersonal skills and public relations will be imperative for the closing of the transactions. In any sale, the ultimate goal for the Company is to foster long-term relationships with potential and existing clients in hopes of generating positive word-of-mouth referrals.
Target Customers
 
Initially, TGS will target its marketing efforts toward few group of customers, such as farming communities, contractors, home builders and developers. These customer groups should tend to purchase in large volume and bring recurring business. By focusing on these few initial customer groups, this will allow the Company to operate more on a person-to-person basis and to develop a good relationship which should lead to recurring business. 
Competitive Analysis
 
The market for PVC wall and ceiling panels in Canada is still in its infancy state with a limited number of competitors in the industry. Currently, there several Canadian companies selling their own brand of PVC wall and ceiling panels in western Canada. Accompanying their direct sales approach are distributors in various regions that help market and promote their products.
 
Despite being a new player in the market, TGS believes that it is well positioned to enter into the market due to its low overhead structure and strong relationship with its PVC products manufacturer in China.

Competitive Products
 
Drywall is the main competitive product to PVC panels. It is the most commonly used product for wall and ceiling installations. However, there are locations where drywall installation is not suitable, particularly in moist and wet locations such as car wash facilities. Using PVC panels would be a more suitable installation for moist and wet locations. PVC panels could also be better suited for temporary facilities for which the PVC panels can be removed at the end of the job and relocated to another location. 
 
In addition to various advantages of using PVC panels, PVC panel installation is also cost effective in comparison to drywall installation. With finish surface, PVC panel installation doesn’t require tapping, mudding, sanding and painting as for drywall installation. This saves a lot of installation time and thus labor cost. Based on the current pricing, it is estimated that a drywall installation would cost significantly higher than the cost of PVC panel installation. For example for an area of 1,000 square feet, it is estimated that the installation cost using PVC panels would be in the range of about $2,000 comparing to $4,000 for drywall installation. 
 
Employees
 
Currently we do not have any employees. Our President, Chief Executive Officer and director, Chung Szeto, provides his services as a consultant to our Company on a full-time basis. Our Secretary, Treasurer, and Director, Sau Chun Yu provides her services as a consultant to our Company on a part-time basis. Our officers and directors provide services to our business on a consulting basis in order to eliminate overhead costs that we would be required to incur upon the engagement of employees, including employment insurance and workers compensation premiums. We do not expect any material changes in the number of employees over the next 12-month period and will continue to outsource contract employment as needed.
Description of Property
 
Our executive and administrative offices are located at Unit 3, 6420 – 4 Street NE Calgary, Alberta, Canada T2K 5M8. The space, which is approximately 300 square feet, is currently provided to us at no cost by our officers and directors. We believe that our office space is sufficient to meet our present needs and do not anticipate any difficulty securing alternative or additional space, as needed, on terms acceptable to us.
Subsidiaries
 
We have one wholly owned subsidiary, TGS Building Products Ltd, an Alberta (Canada) company, incorporated on March 8, 2016.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We assert common law trademark rights in the province of Alberta for the names “TGS”, “TGS International”, and “TGS Building Products” in the field of construction materials. Common law trademark rights are enforceable in provincial courts in Canada, and may be asserted against those who appropriate, dilute or damage the goodwill of our business by using the same or similar trade-names or trademarks. Unlike statutory trademark rights, which are acquired by registration and provide nation-wide protection, common law trademark rights are acquired automatically and provide protection only in the jurisdiction where a business uses a name or logo in commerce. We intend to rely on common law trademark protection until such time as we deem it economical for our business to register our trade-names or trademarks.
 
We have not registered for the protection of any rights under trademark, patent, or copyright laws in any jurisdiction.
