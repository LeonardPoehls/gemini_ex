Item 1. Business
Overview
 
China ShouGuan Mining Corporation (ShouGuan, we and the Company) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 4, 2010. We are a holding company that conducts business operations in Shandong Province in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). On June 23, 2010, we entered into a stock exchange transaction with the shareholders of Bei Sheng Limited (BSL), whereby we issued 100,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the ownership interest in BSL, for the purpose of re-domiciling BSL as a Nevada corporation in the United States. These shares were issued as restricted securities under SEC Rule 144. As a result of the share exchange transaction, BSL became our wholly-owned operating subsidiary in the PRC. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to the Company throughout this annual report include the operations of BSL and its subsidiaries and variable interest entities (VIEs).
 
We were founded by a number of business professionals and experts in China who specialize in mining technologies, mining resources management and financial and strategic management. Our primary focus is on acquiring existing gold mine in Shandong province of the PRC. These potential targets are mostly run with low productivity because of inadequate funds and primitive technologies. We plan to re-engineer and redevelop these gold mines through the transfer of advanced exploration and mining technologies, capital injection and effective management.
 
Our business model includes sourcing of early stage gold mines with good profit potential, conducting feasibility studies to identify suitable projects, leasing the suitable mining sites and facilities and managing the mining operations on these selected sites, with the goal of acquiring the mine if the operations prove to be satisfactory based on the review criteria set by our experienced management. In addition, we also provide consulting services in areas related to mine exploration and analysis to our clients on a project-by-project basis.
 
Revenues are derived from the sales of gold concentrates, the principal raw material used in gold smelting operation to produce gold. The selling prices are determined from two factors, the amount of gold in the gold concentrates and the price of gold on the date of sale. The amount of gold in the gold concentrates is determined and agreed upon between the Company and the smelters and then the selling price is determined according to the official gold price at the time of sale as indicated by the Shanghai Gold Exchange (http://www.sge.sh), an entity governed by the PRC Government). On the consulting side, revenues are derived on a project-by-project basis and payment is collected as we complete our service as outlined in the scope of each individual project.  In order to minimize the effect of fluctuations of gold price and to achieve better economies of scale in operations, the Company decides to focus more on mine exploration.
 
We target to grow proactively through continual sourcing of existing gold mines in the PRC and managing them. These projects will be executed by BSL and its VIEs. CunliJi Gold Mine was the first project commenced in May 2009. To ensure all mines are legally and properly operated, all target gold mines are required to have full sets of government-approved licenses before effecting commencement of any business operations.

On December 28, 2010, the Companys Form S-1 registration statement (the Registration Statement) was declared effective by the SEC, allowing us to sell a total of 1,000,000 shares of our common stock and raise a total of $500,000, which we intend to use to implement our business operations (the Offering). The Offering was expired on June 26, 2011 as stated in the Registration Statement and the Board of Directors of the Company has held a special meeting and resolved to extend the offering period for an additional 180 days. On October 30, 2011, the Company consummated the sale to 19 accredited investors of an aggregate of 1,000,000 shares of its common stock, par value $0.0001, at a per share price of $0.201, or $201,000 in the aggregate, pursuant to certain subscription agreements. These shares were subsequently issued on January 12, 2012. This offering was the initial public offering of common stock of China Shouguan Mining Corporation. The Company is now quoting at OTCQB for the symbol CHSO.
 
On May 6, 2011, the Company, through its variable interest entity, YantaiJinguan Investment Co., Ltd. (Yantai), entered into a lease agreement with LongkouDayuan Gold Mining Co. Ltd., an unrelated third party being the legal owner and holding the mining license of the Dayuan gold mine (the Lease Property) regarding Dayuan Gold Mine. Under the agreement, the Company agrees to pay the aggregate rental payments of approximately $20 million for a term of 10 years commencing from April 1, 2011 through April 1, 2021 to obtain the right to manage and operate the Lease Property in the repayment schedule, whereas the Company is committed to pay $12 million equal to 6 years rental, no later than September 30, 2011 and the remainder will be paid no later than March 1, 2017.
 
In July 2013, the Yantai local government informed the Company that the Shandong Province has promulgated a new local regulation. The regulation stated that all underground mines in the territory which has a production of under 40,000 tonnes per year will all be forced to close down before the end of 2015. As such, since CunliJi Mine falls within the category, the Company decided to sell the mine for money and to invest in mines in other territories, which includes investing in mine exploration areas, and, acquiring or leasing some tailings environmental protection projects. 
 
On 21st February 2014 SSIC acquired 99% shareholdings of DaxinganlingYiguanyuan Mining Investment Company Limited (DYM) for a consideration of RMB4,000,000. DYM focuses on mine exploration in the Daxinganling area in the Heilongjiang Province in north-eastern part of China. DYM has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with DaxinganlingGuolin Mining Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Daxinganling local government in July 2013, which stated that the two parties would cooperate together to explore the precious metals mines in the Daxinganling area. As of December 31, 2016, no exploratory work or other operating activities have been commenced.
On 31st March 2014, the Company signed an agreement with YantaiJinjian Smelting Technology Limited (85%) and YantaiJihao Trading Limited (15%), where 100% interests in XinGuan (as defined below) which owned CunliJi Mine was transferred for a total consideration of RMB45,000,000. It resulted in a profit of RMB9,000,000 for the Company compared with the original acquisition consideration in 2010.
Corporate History and Structure
 
China ShouGuan Mining Corporation was incorporated in the State of Nevada on May 4, 2010. On May 27, 2010, Harry Orfanos, our original director and incorporator in the State of Nevada, resigned as our President and Chief Executive Officer and the Board of Directors appointed Mr. Feize Zhang to serve as our President, Treasurer, Chief 

5

Executive Officer and Director, Mr. Ming Cheung as Secretary, Chief Financial Officer and Director and Mr. Jingfeng Lv as Chief Technical Officer.
 
On June 23, 2010, we entered into a stock exchange transaction with the shareholders of Bei Sheng Limited (BSL), whereby we issued 100,000,000 shares of common stock in exchange for 100% of the ownership interest in BSL, for the purpose of re-domiciling BSL as a Nevada corporation in the United States. These shares were issued as restricted securities under SEC Rule 144. As a result of the merger, BSL became our wholly-owned operating subsidiary in the PRC.BSL was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands on December 17, 2009 as a limited liability company for the purpose of holding 100% equity interest in Golden Wide International Limited (GWIL).
 
GWIL was incorporated in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong) on June 18, 2009 as a limited liability company. GWIL formed Shoujin Business Consulting (Shenzhen) Limited (SBCL) as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise under the laws of the PRC on April 23, 2010. SBCL is principally engaged in the business of providing consulting services in the PRC.
 
Shenzhen Shouguan Investment Co., Ltd (SSIC) is an investment holding company established in Shenzhen, on December 1, 2008. It is 70% owned by Mr. Feize Zhang, our Chairman and CEO, 20% owned by Mr. Jingfeng Lv, our Chief Technical Officer, and 10% owned by Mr. Jianxi Yang, a director of Yantai JinGuan Investment Limited, SSICs subsidiary. SSIC represents the headquarters of the Company, principally engaging in formulation of corporate plans for the overall operational management and strategic development of the Company. As the company management platform, SSIC acts an effective linkage between mining projects with the U.S. capital market in terms of searching potential gold mine projects, performing due diligence, integration of resources, promoting investor relations as well as accessing to capital markets for financing.
 
Yantai JinGuan Investment Limited (JinGuan) was incorporated in Yantai, the PRC and is a subsidiary held 99% by SSIC. JinGuan represents the investment management platform for operational and financial management of our current gold mine projects (i.e. Dayuan Mine). Another business function of JinGuan is to undertake geological exploratory work for gold mines as well as to provide technical consulting services. As a subsidiary of SSIC and its management platform in Shandong province, JinGuan is required to report regularly to SSIC in terms of the daily operation and the progress of development of the two gold mines.
 
PenglaiXinGuan Investment Limited (XinGuan) was incorporated in Penglai, the PRC and is the wholly-owned subsidiary of JinGuan. XinGuan houses our licenses and operations in Penglai, the PRC. As described above, XinGuan was sold to two third parties on March 31, 2014.
 
The following diagram illustrates our current corporate structure:

To satisfy the investment restrictions in the PRC mining business, the Company, through SBCL entered into and consummated certain contractual arrangements with SSIC, JinGuan and DYM. As a result of these contractual arrangements, which obligates SBCL to absorb the risk of loss from the activities of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM,and enables SBCL to receive all of its expected residual returns, we account for SSIC, JinGuan and DYM,and their subsidiaries, as a variable interest entity (VIE) under U.S. GAAP and we consolidate their results in our consolidated financial statements.
 
Since the Company, BSL, GWIL, SBCL and its VIE arrangement as SSIC were under common control with the same ultimate beneficial owners, who are officers and directors of the Company, the re-domiciling transaction and VIE arrangement was accounted for as a transfer of entities under common control and all disclosures referencing business operations of our VIEs were made throughout this report as if the share exchange transaction had become effective as of the beginning of the first period presented, even though the Company was not yet incorporated in Nevada. As such, the Company, BSL and its subsidiaries and VIEs are hereinafter collectively referred to as the Company and all are consolidated in our financial statements.
 
Prior to acquisition of the Company shares, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Lv were not affiliates of the Company. They were also not an affiliate of any of the Companys shareholders.

Contractual Arrangements
 
Gold mining is a highly restricted industry in China. As such, it is extremely difficult for PRC gold mining companies to obtain government approval on having foreign ownership. Accordingly, BSL's PRC subsidiary, SBCL, which is considered foreign-invested, is currently ineligible to directly own the required exploration and mining licenses in China. Our exploration and mining business is currently provided through contractual arrangements with BSL and its VIEs in China, which are currently SSIC and its subsidiaries, JinGuan and DYM.
 
BSL's VIEs sell gold concentrates directly to our customers, which are typically the refinery plants in China. We have been and are expected to continue to be dependent on our VIEs to operate our exploration and mining business. SBCL has entered into contractual arrangements with our VIEs, which enable us to:
 

- | exercise effective control over the VIEs; 
- | receive substantially all of the economic benefits from the VIEs; and 
- | have an exclusive option to purchase all of the equity interests in the VIEs.

 
SBCL entered into a series of agreements (VIE agreements) amongst SSIC, JinGuan and DYM and the individual owners of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM (See NOTE below) and details of the VIE agreements are as follows:
 

1. | Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement, signed on May 15, 2010 - SBCL has the exclusive right to provide to SSIC, JinGuan and DYM (DYMs agreement was signed and effective on March 31, 2014), consulting services, including operational management, human resources management, research and development of the technologies related to the operations of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM. SSIC, JinGuan and DYM pay to SBCL annually consulting service fees in an amount equal to all of their revenue for such year. These agreements run for a 10-year term and are subject to automatic renewal for an additional 10 year term provided that no objection is made by both parties on the renewal. 
2. | Exclusive Option Agreement - SBCL has the option to purchase all of the assets and ownership of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM at any time. 
3. | Equity Pledge Agreement, - SSIC, JinGuan and DYM agree to pledge their legal interests to SBCL as a security for the obligations under the Exclusive Technical Service and Business Consulting Agreement. 
4. | Proxy Agreement - SSIC, JinGuan and DYM irrevocably grant and entrust SBCL the right to exercise its voting and other stockholder rights. 
5. | Operating Agreement, - SBCL agrees to participate in the operations of SSIC, JinGuan and DYM in different aspects. NOTE: All of the aforesaid agreements were signed and effective on May 15, 2010, except the ones signed with DYM which were signed and effective on February 21, 2014. Also, a former VIE, XinGuan (which held the CunliJi mine), was sold to two third parties on March 31, 2014 and as of that date XinGuan ceased to be a VIE in the group.

Regional Geology
 
The Dayuan Mine is located at the northwest of Jiaodong Peninsula. Jiaodong refers to east of Jiaolai River in Shandong province, including Yantai, Weihai and the eastern Qingdao, which together constitute the major part of Shandong Peninsula. The region is simple in term of geological structure, consisting of loose sedimentary rock at the valley and widespread igneous rock, mainly granite, which gradually developed into mineral veins (principally diorite porphyry) of different phases. Fault zones were developed in the region, with the Potouqing Fracture as the main fault zone in the area. Vein no. 117 belongs to one of the secondary fault structures of Potouqing Fracture. The overall 

11

strike of this vein is 45°, dipping 76°~ 85° towards SE, with 1800m in length above ground level, of which 580m in length is within the Dayuan Mine.
 
Rock Formations and Mineralization :
 
The Dayuan Mine is an underground gold mine. It is on the Zhaoyuanmetallogenic zone, which belongs to the northern rim of Linglong Gold Field. The formation stemmed from the southern side on the main fault zone of the Linglong Gold Field. The mineral ore resources are mainly gold, pyrite. Other minerals are galena, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, quartz, sericite, feldspar and chlorite. 
 
The DY-117 Mine Area consists of one gold vein numbered 117, consisting of 2 ore bodies, namely 117-(1) and 117-(2). Overall strike of the ore bodies is 45°, dipping 76°~ 85° towards SE. Ore body 117-(1) strikes 45° and with dipping 76°
 
85°towards SE. The tendency length of the ore body within the mine is 580m. The vein is continuous and even in thickness ranging from 0.25m to 1.23m, with an average of 0.65m. Gold grade of the ore body ranges from 1.36 Au g/ton to 9.87 Au g/ton, with an average of 4.44 Au g/ton. Ore body 117-(2) strikes 45° to 65° and with dipping 66°~ 77°towards NW. Its NE end is merged with the ore body 117-(1). The tendency length of the ore body is also 580m. 

The vein is continuous and even in thickness ranging from 0.24m to 1.34m, with an average of 0.66m. Gold grade of the ore body is estimated to range from 1.54 Au g/ton to 12.12 Au g/ton, with an average of 5.07 Au g/ton.
 
Work Completed and Present Conditions:
 
Both 117-(1) and 117-(2) ore bodies are explored using vertical drilling wells and are open up to a depth of 610m. The DY-117 Mine Area consists of 6 plots with elevation of 200m, 160m, 120m, 90m, 50m and 10m respectively. The ore bodies at elevation of 50m and 10m were completely mined. Currently, there is no exploratory work at the Dayuan Mine.
Equipment, Infrastructure and Other Facilities of the Dayuan Mine:
 
Mining equipment of the Dayuan Mine mainly includes exploration machinery, ore mining machinery and mineral processing machinery.  The machinery includes drillers, belt conveyor, lift trucks, mining crusher, grinding mill, revolving screens, sand washer, etc.  Site infrastructure includes roads, water supply system, electric supply system, warehouses, living quarters, dining facilities and an administration building. Current State of Exploration :
 
As of the date of this report, the Dayuan Mine property is without known reserves.
 
The Dayuan Mine commenced exploratory operation in July 2011. Mineral exploration was temporary halted in the Dayuan Mine Area in March 2013 and December 2013.

According to national requirements upon production ramp-up and technical updating of mines, the production capacity should be increased from 30,000 tons/year to 60,000 tons/year, besides the safety facilities should be updated in order to meet the national standards, which has made the normal production impossible in 2015, in addition the subsequent technical updating is expected to continue to the first half of the year in 2016.

The Dayuan Mine is currently at the exploratory stage.  We have no detailed plan or timetable to explore the property at this time. So far, we do not have any plan to fund the exploration program of this mine.
 
Description of Processing Facilities :
 
The processing facilities at Dayuan Mine Area include a set of 12 processing machines consisting of ball mills, jiggers, screw classifiers, stirring tanks, flotation machine, belt conveyors, concentrator and pressure filter. The raw ore is processed into gold concentrates through the following procedures.
 
Primary grinding takes place in a ball mill. The ground product from the primary grinding process is first put through a jigger to recover the coarse gold particles then classified in a screw classifier. Classifier underflow goes back to the ball mill. The overflow, sized at about 85% less than 0.074 mm, is then sent to flotation; Flotation comprises a rougher stage and four cleaner stages on the rougher concentrate as well as three scavenger flotation stages to yield the final concentrates; The final concentrates are then dehydrated by thickening and the thickener underflow is then filtered.

Sample Collection, Preparation, Analysis and Assay Control
 
A systematic procedure was developed for the collection and preparation of percussion drill hole samples. We firstly identify gold bearing zones by collecting rock chip samples from favorable locales for gold mineralization with reference to related literature survey and the geological map of the mines. The target areas will be explored by trenching and rock-chip sampling.
 
Depending on the sampling results, the target areas are demarcated for detailed sampling in three-dimension. The rock sample produced from drilling are dry chips of drilled rock, which is obtained from drill holes at equidistance. Each sample was about 1.0 meter in length, and not longer than 1.5 meter. The samples are all taken by, or under the supervision of our geological experts. Based on the three-dimension sampling of the gold-bearing zone (ore body), i.e. length, width, depth and grade, a global resource of the gold deposit is estimated.
 
Exploration geologists analyze and log the sample to ascertain the prospective mineralisation within the drilled orebody. A representative sample is taken from the sack, and is the sieved to remove excess dust. Once the desired sample has been washed and dried, exploration geologists will note the weight percentage of the desired minerals in the sample. The samples will be stored in plastic cutting boxes before further chemical analysis offsite. Samples of rocks or soil are then delivered to accredited laboratories for geochemical assay to determine metal contents and detect geochemical anomalies. One of our accredited laboratories is Shandong Zhaojin Geological Exploration Co., Ltd. (Shandong Zhaojin) Shandong Zhaojin. is granted the license for mineral exploration, geological drilling and exploration and geological testing by Shandong Provincial Land Resources Department under the PRC government. For geochemical assay, rock and soil samples are crushed, powdered, fused or digested in acid and then analyzed using different analytical methods. Since there is always some loss of gold during the analytical procedure, the gold 

13

grade in the sample is believed unlikely to be overstated. All samples were collected, handled and analyzed by Shandong Zhaojin using the standard preparation procedures in accordance with the national standard GB/T1900-IS09000 "Quality management and quality assurance", which is considered adequate for the preliminary level of evaluation. Quality control of all mine exploration projects in China is executed under the administration of local exploration regulations, provincial regulations on exploration projects.
 
Our Proposed Business Strategy
 
Currently, most privately-owned gold mines in China are poorly managed and operated and are usually mined to a depth of about 300 - 500 meters, far beyond a valid exploration analysis of about 200~300 meters. Mining and exploration activities are generally done without any systematic planning and/or analysis. This often leads to high waste of exploration / mining inputs and results in inefficient operations with low productivity. We intend to re-engineer and redevelop our mining targets through the transfer of advanced exploration and mining technologies to identify the geological features and locations of the ore bodies, as well as the formation trends of associated mineral veins. We feel that the proposed business strategies of our experienced management team will provide a better solution to mine the ore bodies in a more efficient and productive way. Our mining solutions include mining data collection and analysis, identification of ore locations and running trends of veins, design of exploration and mining plans, on-site mine construction planning, formulation and customization of mining methodologies, introduction of modern exploration and mining technologies to increase productivity, supervision of subcontracting staff and provision of technical supports in relation to production management, mine ventilation, water discharge, system upgrade, quality assurance, safety control, etc. Our current mineral exploration subcontractor is only responsible for the actual underground exploration works like digging tunnels, underground transportation and mine extraction, and does not participate in any works related to mine planning, data analysis, site identification and operational management.

Future potential mining projects
 
We target to grow proactively through continual sourcing of existing gold mines in the PRC and managing them. Before investing in a potential mining project, we intend to go through a series of procedures for preliminary assessment in order to determine the amount of minerals, if any, and therefore whether the subject property should be acquired, based on the economic viability of extracting the potential minerals and profitably processing them. To do so, we intend to engage geotechnical professionals to conduct such assessments and analyses.
 
We primarily base on two standard criteria to assess potential acquisition targets. Firstly, whether the target mine is located on the major gold mineralization zone; Secondly, whether the potential mine is located in an area with a policy-friendly environment in which we can operate the mine smoothly under a favorable policy environment.
 
In July 2013, the Yantai local government informed the Company that the Shandong Province has promulgated a new local regulation. The regulation stated that all underground mines in the territory which has a production of under 40,000 tonnes per year will all be forced to close down before the end of 2015. As such, since CunliJi Mine falls within the category, the Company decided to sell the mine for money and to invest in mines in other territories, which includes investing in mine exploration areas, and, acquiring or leasing some tailings environmental protection projects.

On 21st February 2014 SSIC acquired 99% shareholdings of DaxinganlingYiguanyuan Mining Investment Company Limited (DYM) for a consideration of RMB4,000,000. DYM focuses on mine exploration in the Daxinganling area in the Heilongjiang Province in north-eastern part of China. DYM has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with DaxinganlingGuolin Mining Company Limited, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Daxinganling local government in July 2013, which stated that the two parties would cooperate together to explore the precious metals mines in the Daxinganling area. As of December 31, 2016, no exploratory work or other operating activities have been commenced.
 
Procedures for assessing a potential acquisition:
 
1) Two standard criteria must be satisfied;
 2) Perform geological works including field survey and field sampling;
 3) Perform due diligence such as operations and facilities, financial and legal documents, human resources, etc.
