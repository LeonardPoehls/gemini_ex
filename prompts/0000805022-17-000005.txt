Item 1.  Business
Introduction

The original Buckeye Pipe Line Company was founded in 1886 as part of the Standard Oil Company (“Standard Oil”) and became a publicly owned, independent company after the dissolution of Standard Oil in 1911.  Expansion into petroleum products transportation after World War II and subsequent acquisitions thereafter ultimately led to Buckeye Pipe Line Company becoming a leading independent common carrier pipeline.  In 1964, Buckeye Pipe Line Company was acquired by a subsidiary of the Pennsylvania Railroad, which later became the Penn Central Corporation.  In 1986, Buckeye Pipe Line Company was reorganized into a master limited partnership (“MLP”), Buckeye Partners, L.P. We are a publicly traded Delaware master limited partnership, and our limited partnership units representing limited partner interests (“LP Units”) are listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the ticker symbol “BPL.”  Buckeye GP LLC (“Buckeye GP”) is our general partner.  Unless the context requires otherwise, references to “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Partnership” or “Buckeye” are intended to mean the business and operations of Buckeye Partners, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries.

We own and operate a diversified network of integrated assets providing midstream logistic solutions, primarily consisting of the transportation, storage, processing and marketing of liquid petroleum products.  We are one of the largest independent liquid petroleum products pipeline operators in the United States in terms of volumes delivered, with approximately 6,000 miles of pipeline. We also use our service expertise to operate and/or maintain third-party pipelines and perform certain engineering and construction services for our customers. Additionally, we are one of the largest independent terminalling and storage operators in the United States in terms of capacity available for service. Our terminal network comprises more than 120 liquid petroleum products terminals with aggregate storage capacity of over 115 million barrels across our portfolio of pipelines, inland terminals and marine terminals located primarily in the East Coast, Midwest and Gulf Coast regions of the United States and in the Caribbean.  Our network of marine terminals enables us to facilitate global flows of crude oil and refined petroleum products, offering our customers connectivity between supply areas and market centers through some of the world’s most important bulk storage and blending hubs.  Our flagship marine terminal in The Bahamas, Buckeye Bahamas Hub Limited (“BBH”), formerly known as Bahamas Oil Refining Company International Limited (“BORCO”), is one of the largest marine crude oil and refined petroleum products storage facilities in the world and provides an array of logistics and blending services for the global flow of petroleum products.  Our Gulf Coast regional hub, Buckeye Texas Partners LLC (“Buckeye Texas”), offers world-class marine terminalling, storage and processing capabilities. Our recent acquisition of an indirect 50% equity interest in VTTI B.V. (“VTTI”) expands our international presence with premier storage and marine terminalling services for petroleum products predominantly located in key global energy hubs, including Northwest Europe, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore. We are also a wholesale distributor of refined petroleum products in areas served by our pipelines and terminals.
Business Strategy

Our primary business objective is to provide stable and sustainable cash distributions to our unitholders, while maintaining a relatively low investment risk profile.  The key elements of our strategy are to:

• | Operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner;

Recent Developments

VTTI Acquisition
In January 2017, we acquired an indirect 50% equity interest in VTTI for cash consideration of $1.15 billion (the “VTTI Acquisition”). VTTI will be owned jointly with Vitol S.A. (“Vitol”). VTTI is one of the largest independent global marine terminal businesses that, through its subsidiaries and partnership interests, owns and operates approximately 57 million barrels of petroleum products storage across 14 terminals located on five continents. These marine terminals are predominately located in key global energy hubs, including Northwest Europe, the United Arab Emirates and Singapore, and offer world-class storage and marine terminalling services for refined petroleum products, liquid petroleum gas and crude oil. We and VIP Terminals Finance B.V., a subsidiary of Vitol, have equal board representation and voting rights in the VTTI joint venture.
Hurricane Matthew
In October 2016, Hurricane Matthew made landfall in the Bahamas and the southeastern United States. Our domestic operations experienced no property damage or product releases as a result of the storm. Our BBH terminalling facility, which is located along the Northwest Providence Channel of Grand Bahama Island, experienced property damage but no material interruption of services or product releases. During 2016, we incurred operating expenses of $11.0 million and maintenance capital expenditures of $6.1 million and recorded a $5.8 million write-off of damaged long-lived assets as a result of the storm. We estimate the range of total costs expected to be incurred as a result of Hurricane Matthew to be between $20 million to $30 million, comprised of both operating and capital expenditures, including the amounts incurred to-date. We intend to seek recovery from our insurers for property damage incurred above our self-insured retentions; however, no assurances can be given relative to the timing or amount of such recoveries.
Equity Offering
In October 2016, we completed a public offering of 7.75 million LP Units pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement, which priced at $66.05 per unit. The underwriters also exercised an option to purchase 1.16 million additional LP Units, resulting in total gross proceeds of $588.7 million before deducting underwriting fees and other related expenses of $8.0 million. We used the net proceeds from the offering to initially reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our existing $1.5 billion revolving Credit Facility with SunTrust Bank (the “Credit Facility”) and for general partnership purposes, as well as to subsequently fund a portion of the purchase price for the VTTI Acquisition in January 2017.
Notes Offering

In November 2016, we issued $600.0 million of senior unsecured 3.950% notes maturing on December 1, 2026 (the “3.950% Notes”) in an underwritten public offering at 99.644% of their principal amount. Total proceeds from this offering, after underwriting fees, expenses and debt issuance costs of $5.2 million, were $592.7 million. In January 2017, we used the net proceeds from this offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for the VTTI Acquisition.

Credit Facility
In September 2016, Buckeye and its indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, Buckeye Energy Services LLC (“BES”), Buckeye West Indies Holdings LP (“BWI”) and Buckeye Caribbean Terminals LLC (“BCT”), collectively the Buckeye Merchant Service Companies (“BMSC”), as borrowers, exercised their remaining option with consenting lenders to extend $1.4 billion of our Credit Facility by one year to September 30, 2021. At the time of the transaction, we had $3.4 million of remaining unamortized deferred financing costs, and we incurred additional debt issuance costs of $0.7 million in connection with the extension of the Credit Facility. At December 31, 2016, Buckeye and BMSC collectively had no outstanding balance under the Credit Facility. 
Term Loan

In September 2016, we entered into a credit agreement with SunTrust Bank, as administrative agent, and other lenders for a $250.0 million variable-rate term loan due September 30, 2019 (the “Term Loan”), with an option to extend the term with consenting lenders for up to two one-year periods. We incurred debt issuance costs of $0.5 million related to the Term Loan. We used the proceeds from the Term Loan to reduce the indebtedness outstanding under our Credit Facility. 
At-the-Market Offering Program

In March 2016, we entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, BB&T Capital Markets, a division of BB&T Securities, LLC, BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Jefferies LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, RBC Capital Markets, LLC, and SMBC Nikko Securities America, Inc. (collectively, the “ATM Underwriters”). Under the terms of the Equity Distribution Agreement, we may offer and sell up to $500.0 million in aggregate gross sales proceeds of LP Units from time to time through the ATM Underwriters, acting as agents of Buckeye or as principals, subject in each case to the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Distribution Agreement. This agreement replaced our prior four separate equity distribution agreements with each of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc. and UBS Securities LLC, which we entered into in May 2013 and, under the terms of which, we could sell up to $300.0 million in aggregate gross sales proceeds of LP Units from time to time.
During the year ended December 31, 2016, we sold 1.6 million LP Units in aggregate under the Equity Distribution Agreement and received $108.4 million in net proceeds after deducting commissions and other related expenses, including $1.1 million of compensation paid in aggregate to the agents under the Equity Distribution Agreement.

Business Activities

The following discussion describes the business activities of our business segments, which include Domestic Pipelines & Terminals, Global Marine Terminals and Merchant Services.

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals, Global Marine Terminals and Merchant Services segments derive a nominal amount of their revenue from U.S. governmental agencies.  All of our operations and assets are conducted and located in the continental United States, except for our terminals located in Puerto Rico, St. Lucia and The Bahamas and, from time to time, our Merchant Services segment buys and/or sells fuel oil to third parties at various locations in the Caribbean.  Detailed financial information regarding revenue, profits and total assets of each segment and major geographic area can be found in Note 25 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.  The following table shows our consolidated revenue and each segment’s revenue and percentage of consolidated revenue for the periods indicated (revenue in thousands):

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014 
 | Revenue | | Percent | | Revenue | | Percent | | Revenue | | Percent
Domestic Pipelines & Terminals | $ | 1,011,696 | | | 31.1 | % | | $ | 966,749 | | | 28.0 | % | | $ | 938,036 | | 14.2 | %

 ____________________________________

(1) | The decrease in revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014 was primarily related to a decrease in sales volume and a decline of refined petroleum products prices. The decrease in sales volume was primarily related to more effective inventory management. See “Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion. 

Domestic Pipelines & Terminals Segment

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment owns and operates approximately 6,000 miles of pipeline located primarily in the northeastern and upper midwestern portions of the United States, and services approximately 110 delivery locations.  This segment transports liquid petroleum products, including gasoline, jet fuel, diesel fuel, heating oil and kerosene, from major supply sources to terminals and airports located within end-use markets.  The pipelines within this segment also transport other refined petroleum products, such as propane and butane, refinery feedstock and blending components, as well as crude oil.  The segment also includes 115 active terminals that provide bulk storage and throughput services with respect to liquid petroleum products and renewable fuels, including ethanol, and have an aggregate storage capacity of over 55 million barrels.  In addition, three of our terminals provide crude oil services, including train loading/unloading, storage and throughput.  Of our terminals in the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment, over half are connected to our pipelines.  We generally own property on which the terminals are located.  The segment’s geographical diversity, connections to multiple sources of supply, and extensive delivery system help create a stable base business.
Pipelines

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s pipelines conduct business without the benefit of exclusive franchises from government entities.  In addition, our pipelines generally operate as a common carrier, providing transportation services at posted tariffs and without long-term contracts.  Demand for the services provided by our pipelines derives from end-users’ demand for liquid petroleum products in the regions served and the ability and willingness of refiners and marketers to supply such demand by deliveries through our pipelines.  Factors affecting demand for liquid petroleum products include price and prevailing general economic conditions.  Many of the factors impacting demand for the services provided by our pipelines are, therefore, partially or entirely beyond our control. Typically, this segment receives liquid petroleum products from refineries, connecting pipelines, and bulk and marine terminals and transports those products to other locations for a fee.

Buckeye Reno, Buckeye San Diego and Buckeye Memphis, collectively, have terminalling facilities with aggregate storage capacity of 0.5 million barrels.  Buckeye Reno, Buckeye San Diego and Buckeye Memphis were originally created as joint ventures between BPH and Kealine LLC, but in April 2015, BPH purchased the remaining 10% ownership interest in Buckeye Memphis from Kealine LLC, increasing our ownership interest in Buckeye Memphis to 100%.  As such, BPH currently owns 100% of Buckeye Reno, Buckeye San Diego and Buckeye Memphis.  Each of these entities is consolidated into our financial statements.
Additionally, BPH indirectly owns an approximate 63% interest in the Sabina crude butadiene pipeline (the “Sabina Pipeline”) and owns and operates approximately 25 miles of pipeline, which it leases to third parties, all located in Texas.
Terminals

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminals receive products from pipelines and, in certain cases, barges, ships or railroads, and distribute them to third parties, who in turn deliver them to end-users and retail outlets.  This segment’s terminals play a key role in moving products to the end-user market by providing efficient product receipt, storage and distribution capabilities, inventory management, ethanol and biodiesel blending, and other ancillary services that include the injection of various additives.  Typically, the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminalling facilities consist of multiple storage tanks and are equipped with automated truck loading equipment that is available 24 hours a day. 
The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminals derive most of their revenues from various fees paid by customers.  A throughput fee is charged for receiving products into the terminal and delivering them to trucks, barges, ships or pipelines.  In addition to these throughput fees, revenues are generated by charging customers fees for blending with renewable fuels, injecting additives and providing storage capacity to customers on either a short-term or long-term basis.  The terminals also derive revenue from recovering and selling vapors emitted during truck loading.  Finally, the terminals derive service fees and blending margins from butane blending activities during the winter months (mid-September through mid-March), whereby butane is blended into various grades of gasoline.  Blending margins depend upon pricing spreads between gasoline and butane, and we use financial derivative instruments to manage the commodity price risk associated with gasoline-to-butane pricing spreads, as deemed necessary.  The fair value of such derivative instruments is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets, with the change in fair value recorded in earnings.  These derivative instruments consist primarily of futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) that are executed and managed by our Merchant Services segment.

The following table sets forth the total average daily throughput for terminals and storage caverns within the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment for the periods indicated (volume of bpd in thousands):

Access to the St. Lucia terminal is provided through two ship docks and a truck rack.
Corpus Christi Facilities

In September 2014, we acquired an 80% interest in Buckeye Texas, which owns storage, petroleum processing and marine terminalling facilities that sit on approximately 730 acres along the Corpus Christi Ship Channel in Texas.  The Corpus Christi facilities have five vessel berths, including three deep-water docks, two 25,000 barrels per day condensate splitters and approximately 6.7 million barrels of liquid petroleum products storage capacity, including a refrigerated and compressed LPG storage complex, along with rail and truck loading/unloading capabilities. The platform also comprises three field gathering facilities with associated storage in the Eagle Ford play and pipeline connectivity that allows Buckeye Texas to move Eagle Ford play crude oil and condensate production directly to the terminalling complex in Corpus Christi. These assets form an integrated system with connectivity from the production in the field to the marine terminal infrastructure and the processing complex in Corpus Christi.
Merchant Services Segment

The Merchant Services segment is a wholesale distributor of refined petroleum products in the continental United States and in the Caribbean.  We increase the utilization of our existing pipeline and terminalling assets by marketing refined petroleum products in certain areas served by our pipelines and terminals.  The segment’s customers consist principally of product wholesalers and major commercial users of refined petroleum products including gasoline, propane, ethanol, biodiesel and petroleum distillates such as heating oil, diesel fuel and kerosene.  The segment also provides fuel oil supply and distribution services to third parties in the Caribbean.

The Merchant Services segment owns three terminals in Pennsylvania with aggregate storage capacity of approximately 1 million barrels, which are operated by the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment.  Each terminal is equipped with multiple storage tanks and automated truck loading equipment that is available 24 hours a day.  We also own the property on which the terminals are located.

The following table sets forth the total gallons of refined petroleum products sold by the Merchant Services segment for the periods indicated (in millions of gallons):

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | 2015 | | 2014
Sales volumes | 1,179.7 | | 1,215.0 | | 2,009.0


The Merchant Services segment’s operations are segregated into three categories based on the type of fuel delivered and the delivery method:


• | Wholesale — liquid fuels and propane gas are delivered to distributors and large commercial customers. These customers take delivery of the products using truck loading equipment at storage facilities; 


• | Wholesale Delivered — liquid fuels are delivered to commercial customers, construction companies, school districts and trucking companies through third-party carriers; or via vessel using our marine terminals.


• | Branded Gasoline — gasoline and on-highway diesel fuel are delivered through third-party trucking companies to independently owned retail gas stations under many leading gasoline brands.


The operations of the Merchant Services segment expose us to commodity price risk. The commodity price risk is managed by entering into derivative instruments to offset the effect of commodity price fluctuations on the segment’s inventory and fixed price contracts.  The fair value of our derivative instruments is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets, with the change in fair value recorded in earnings.  The derivative instruments the Merchant Services segment uses consist primarily of futures contracts traded on the NYMEX for the purposes of managing our market price risk from holding physical inventory and entering into physical fixed-price contracts.  A majority of the futures contracts executed are designated as fair value hedges of our refined petroleum inventory.  The changes in fair value of the hedging instruments and hedged items are both recognized in cost of product sales.  However, hedge accounting has not been elected for all of the Merchant Services segment’s derivative instruments.  Fixed-price purchase and sales contracts are generally economically hedged with financial instruments; however, these instruments are not designated in a hedge relationship.  In the cases in which hedge accounting has not been used for physical derivative contracts, changes in the fair values of the financial instruments, which are included in revenue and cost of product sales, generally are offset by changes in the values of the physical derivative contracts which are also derivative instruments whose changes in value are recognized in product sales or cost of product sales.  In addition, hedge accounting has not been elected for financial instruments that have been executed to economically hedge a portion of the Merchant Services segment’s refined petroleum products held in inventory.  The changes in value of the financial instruments that are economically hedging inventory are recognized in cost of product sales.
Discontinuation of Natural Gas Storage Segment

In December 2013, the Board of Directors of Buckeye GP (“the Board”) approved a plan to divest the natural gas storage facility and related assets that our former subsidiary, Lodi Gas Storage, L.L.C. (“Lodi”), owned and operated in Northern California.  We refer to this group of assets as our Natural Gas Storage disposal group.  We reported the results of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented in these financial statements.  In December 2014, we completed the sale of our Natural Gas Storage disposal group for $102.6 million in cash, net of expenses and working capital adjustments of $2.4 million.  We reported the final working capital adjustments as discontinued operations in the first quarter of 2015. For additional information, see Notes 4 and 5 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition and Customers

Competitive Strengths

We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:


• | We operate in a safe and environmentally responsible manner;


• | We own and operate high quality assets that are strategically located;


• | We have stable, long-term relationships with our customers;


• | We own relatively predictable and stable fee-based businesses with opportunistic revenue generating capabilities that support distribution growth; and


• | We maintain a conservative financial position with an investment-grade credit rating.

Domestic Pipelines & Terminals Segment

Generally, pipelines are the lowest cost method for long-haul overland movement of liquid petroleum products.  Therefore, the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s most significant competitors for large volume shipments are other pipelines, some of which are owned or controlled by major integrated oil and gas companies.  Although it is unlikely that a pipeline system comparable in size and scope to the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s pipeline systems will be built in the foreseeable future, new pipelines (including pipeline segments that connect with existing pipeline systems) could be built to effectively compete with the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment in particular locations.
The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment competes with marine transportation in some areas.  Tankers and barges on the Great Lakes account for some of the volume to certain Michigan, Ohio and upstate New York locations during the approximately eight non-winter months of the year.  Barges are presently a competitive factor for deliveries to and within the New York City area, the Pittsburgh area and locations on the Ohio River, such as Cincinnati, Ohio and locations on the Mississippi River, such as St. Louis, Missouri.  Additionally, the South Portland and Bangor, Maine terminals, and the pipeline connecting these terminals, compete with regional barge-supplied terminals.

Trucks competitively deliver liquid petroleum products in a number of areas that the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment serves.  While their costs may not be competitive for longer hauls or large volume shipments, trucks compete effectively for smaller volumes in many local areas.  The availability of truck transportation places a significant competitive constraint on the ability of the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment to increase its tariff rates.

Privately arranged exchanges of liquid petroleum products between marketers in different locations are another form of competition.  Generally, such exchanges reduce both parties’ costs by eliminating or reducing transportation charges.  In addition, consolidation among refiners and marketers that has accelerated in recent years has altered distribution patterns, reducing demand for transportation services in some markets and increasing them in other markets.

The production and use of biofuels may be a competitive factor in that, to the extent the usage of biofuels increases, some alternative means of transport that compete with our pipelines may be able to provide transportation services for biofuels that our pipelines cannot because of safety or pipeline integrity issues.  In particular, railroads competitively deliver biofuels to a number of areas and, therefore, are a significant competitor of pipelines with respect to biofuels.  Biofuel usage may also create opportunities for additional pipeline transportation and blending opportunities, if such biofuels can be transported through our pipelines, although that potential cannot be quantified at present.

Distribution of liquid petroleum products depends to a large extent upon the location and capacity of refineries.  Because the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s business is largely driven by the consumption of fuel in its delivery areas and the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s pipelines have numerous source points, generally we do not believe that the expansion or shutdown of any particular refinery is likely, in most instances, to have a material effect on the business of the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment.  As discussed in “Item 1A, Risk Factors”, however, a significant decline in production at the Wood River refinery, Paulsboro refinery or Lima refinery, or a fundamental change in the primary sources or supply of petroleum products to a region, could materially impact the business of the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment.

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment also generally competes with other terminals in the same geographic market.  Many competitive terminals are owned by major integrated oil and gas companies.  These major oil and gas companies may have the opportunity for product exchanges that are not available to the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminals.  While the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s terminal throughput fees are not regulated, they are subject to price competition from competitive terminals and alternate modes of transporting liquid petroleum products to end-users such as retail gasoline stations.

We also compete with independent pipeline companies, engineering firms, major integrated oil and gas companies and chemical companies to operate and maintain logistic assets for third-party owners.  In addition, in some instances it can be either more cost-effective or strategic for certain companies to operate and maintain their own pipelines as opposed to contracting with the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment for such services.  Numerous engineering and construction firms compete with the Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment for construction management business.
11

Global Marine Terminals Segment

Our Global Marine Terminals segment primarily competes with other marine terminals in the Caribbean, New York Harbor and the Gulf Coast.  Our terminalling facilities on Grand Bahama Island, The Bahamas and St. Lucia face competition from multiple proprietary or third-party terminal operators located elsewhere in the Caribbean region.  However, the geographical locations, deep drafts, storage capacity and ancillary service capabilities of our facilities provide certain advantages to our customers for handling and storing products for export to other locations within the Caribbean, North and South America, Europe, and Asia.  Internal transfer pricing of certain regional facilities and discounted incentive storage and handling rates at independent third-party facilities supported by quasi national oil companies adds competition for handling of remaining product demand in certain areas.
Our facility in Yabucoa, Puerto Rico faces competition for residual fuel oil storage as a result of the method by which the local utility company, a significant fuel oil user, sources fuel for their power generation needs.  Additionally, competition exists for clean products storage and throughput because of other third-party terminals on the island that have geographical advantages over the Yabucoa facility.

Our Perth Amboy, Port Reading, and Raritan Bay facilities, located in the New York Harbor, generally compete with pipelines and terminals owned by major oil and gas companies and major pipeline and terminal operators in the same geographic market as our Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment (as discussed above).
Our Corpus Christi facility, owned by Buckeye Texas, does not currently compete for customers, as it is almost fully contracted to one customer under long-term take-or-pay arrangements. 

Merchant Services Segment

The Merchant Services segment competes with major energy companies, their marketing affiliates and independent gatherers, investment banks that have established trading platforms, master limited partnerships with marketing businesses, and brokers and marketers of widely varying sizes, financial resources and experience.  Some of these competitors have capital resources greater than the Merchant Services segment, and control greater supplies of refined petroleum products.
Customers

For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, no customer contributed 10% or more of our consolidated revenue.  In the Global Marine Terminals segment, storage revenue represented approximately 82% of BBH’s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016, which accounted for approximately 29% of total revenue in the segment.  Currently, BBH has a limited number of long-term storage customers, consisting of major oil companies, energy companies, physical traders and national oil companies.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 31% and 60% of BBH’s storage revenue was derived from the top one and the top three customers, respectively.  We expect BBH to continue to derive a substantial portion of its total revenue from a small number of customers in the future.
Revenue from Buckeye Texas, which is almost fully contracted to one customer under long-term take-or-pay arrangements, accounted for approximately 33% of total revenue in the Global Marine Terminals segment for the year ended December 31, 2016.
Seasonality

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals segment’s mix and volume of products transported and stored tends to vary seasonally.  Declines in demand for heating oil during the summer months are, to a certain extent, offset by increased demand for gasoline and jet fuel.  Overall, this segment’s business has been only moderately seasonal, with somewhat lower than average volumes being transported and stored during March, April and May and somewhat higher than average volumes being transported and stored in November, December and January.

The Merchant Services segment’s mix and volume of product sales tend to vary seasonally, with the fourth and first quarters’ volumes generally being higher than the second and third quarters, primarily due to the increased demand for home heating oil in the winter months.

The Domestic Pipelines & Terminals and Merchant Services segments both benefit from increased sales of heating oil and butane blending activities at our terminals during the winter months.  From mid-September through mid-March, we are able to blend butane into various grades of gasoline.
12


The Global Marine Terminals segment’s mix and volume of products stored does not vary significantly by season. 
Employees

Except as noted below, we are managed and operated by employees of Buckeye Pipe Line Services Company (“Services Company”).  We reimburse Services Company for the cost of providing employee services pursuant to a services agreement.  At December 31, 2016, Services Company had approximately 1,590 employees, approximately 310 of whom were represented by labor unions.  Additionally, at December 31, 2016, certain of our wholly owned subsidiaries had approximately 275 employees, approximately 160 of whom are employed at our BBH facility.  We have never experienced any work stoppages or other significant labor problems. 
Regulation

General

We are subject to extensive laws and regulations and resulting regulatory oversight by numerous federal, state and local departments and agencies, many of which are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on the pipeline and natural gas storage industries, related businesses, and individual participants.  In some states, we are subject to the jurisdiction of public utility commissions and state corporation commissions, which have authority over, among other things, intrastate tariffs, the issuance of debt and equity securities, transfers of assets and safety.  The failure to comply with such laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties.  The regulatory burden on our operations increases our cost of doing business and, consequently, affects our profitability.  However, except for certain exemptions that apply to smaller companies, we do not believe that we are affected in a significantly different manner by these laws and regulations than are our competitors.

The following is a discussion of certain laws and regulations affecting us.  However, this discussion should not be relied upon as an exhaustive review of all regulatory considerations affecting our business and operations.

Rate Regulation

Overview.  BPLC, Wood River, BPL Transportation, Buckeye Linden Pipe Line Company LLC (“Buckeye Linden”) and NORCO operate pipelines subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) under the Interstate Commerce Act, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and the Department of Energy Organization Act.  FERC regulations require that interstate oil pipeline rates be posted publicly and that these rates be “just and reasonable” and not unduly discriminatory.  FERC regulations also enforce common carrier obligations and specify a uniform system of accounts, among certain other obligations.

The generic oil pipeline regulations issued under the Energy Policy Act of 1992 rely primarily on an index methodology that allows a pipeline to change its rates in accordance with an index that the FERC believes reflects cost changes appropriate for application to pipeline rates.  In December 2015, the FERC amended its regulations to change the index to the Producer Price Index (“PPI”) - finished goods plus 1.23% effective July 1, 2016.  

The indexing methodology is used to establish rates on the pipelines owned by Wood River, BPL Transportation, Buckeye Linden and NORCO, and for certain rates charged by BPLC, and such rates are therefore subject to change annually according to the index. If the index is negative in a future period, we could be required to reduce the rates charged by Wood River, BPL Transportation, Buckeye Linden and NORCO, and certain rates charged by BPLC, if they exceed the new maximum allowable rate.  Shippers may file protests against the application of the index to the rates of an individual pipeline and may also file complaints against indexed rates as being unjust and unreasonable, subject to the FERC’s standards.

Under the FERC’s rules, as one alternative to indexed rates, a pipeline is allowed to charge market-based rates if the pipeline establishes that it does not possess significant market power in a particular market. BPLC charges market-based rates in its competitive markets and index-based rates in certain of its other markets.

Other types of rate regulation.  Laurel operates a pipeline in intrastate service across Pennsylvania, and its tariff rates are regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission.  Wood River operates a pipeline providing some intrastate services in Illinois, and tariff rates related to this pipeline are regulated by the Illinois Commerce Commission.

Environmental Regulation

We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations, risks of substantial liabilities are inherent in pipeline, terminalling and processing operations, and we may incur material environmental liabilities in the future. Moreover, it is possible that other developments, such as increasingly rigorous environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies, and claims for damages to property or injuries to persons resulting from our operations, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us.  See “Item 3, Legal Proceedings.”  The following is a summary of the significant current environmental laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject and for which compliance may require material capital expenditures or have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or financial position.

The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA”) amended certain provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972, commonly referred to as the Clean Water Act (“CWA”), and other statutes, as they pertain to the prevention of and response to petroleum product spills into navigable waters.  The OPA subjects owners of facilities to strict joint and several liability for all containment and clean-up costs and certain other damages arising from a spill. The CWA provides penalties for the discharge of petroleum products in reportable quantities and imposes substantial liability for the costs of removing a spill. State laws for the control of water pollution also provide varying civil and criminal penalties and liabilities in the case of releases of petroleum or its derivatives into surface waters or into the ground.

Contamination resulting from spills or releases of liquid petroleum products sometimes occurs in the petroleum pipeline, terminalling and processing industry. Our pipelines cross, and certain facilities are located near, numerous navigable rivers and streams.  Although we believe that we comply in all material respects with the spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws, any spill or other release of petroleum products into navigable waters may result in material costs and liabilities to us.

The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), as amended, establishes a comprehensive program of regulation of “hazardous wastes.”  Hazardous waste generators, transporters, and owners or operators of hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities must comply with regulations designed to ensure detailed tracking, handling and monitoring of these wastes.  RCRA also regulates the disposal of certain non-hazardous wastes.  As a result of these regulations, certain wastes typically generated by pipeline, terminalling and processing operations are considered “hazardous wastes”, “special wastes” or regulated solid waste.  Hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non-hazardous wastes.  Changes in any of the RCRA regulations to, for example, expand the universe of regulated wastes or impose more stringent management requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses. 
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), also known as “Superfund,” authorizes the federal and state governments to address the release or threat of release of a “hazardous substance.” Although CERCLA contains a “petroleum exclusion,” that provision generally applies only to unused product not contaminated by contact with other substances, and may exclude product recovered after a release, as well as contact water.  A release of a hazardous substance, whether on or off-site, may subject the generator of that substance or the owner of the property on which the release occurred to joint and several liability under CERCLA for the costs of clean-up and other remedial action.  Pipeline and facility maintenance and other activities in the ordinary course of our business generate “hazardous substances.”  As a result, to the extent a hazardous substance generated by us or our predecessors is released or was released or otherwise disposed of in the past, we may in the future be required to remediate the contaminated property. Governmental authorities such as the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), and in some instances third parties, are authorized under CERCLA to seek to recover remediation and other costs from responsible persons, without regard to fault or the legality of the original disposal.  In addition to our potential liability as a generator of a “hazardous substance,” to the extent that our property or right-of-way is affected by a release of hazardous substances such that it becomes part of a Superfund or other hazardous waste site, we may be responsible under CERCLA for all or part of the costs required to clean up that site, which could be material.

The Clean Air Act, amended by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 (the “Amendments”), imposes controls on the emission of pollutants into the air.  The Amendments required states to develop facility-wide permitting programs to comply with a wide range of federal air pollution regulatory programs.  States also have their own air pollution regulatory programs that impose permitting and control requirements in addition to the federal requirements. EPA has promulgated greenhouse gas (“GHG”) regulations and is otherwise increasing its scrutiny of the oil and gas industry.  It is possible that new or more stringent controls will be imposed on us through these programs which could have a material adverse effect on our maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses.  In addition, certain states and regions have adopted or are considering various GHG regulations which may require controls separate from or in conjunction with federal programs.

14

We are also subject to other environmental laws and regulations adopted by the various states, localities and territories in which we operate.  In certain instances, the regulatory standards adopted by the states and/or territories are more stringent than applicable federal laws.  In addition, our BBH terminal in The Bahamas and our St. Lucia terminal are subject to the environmental regulatory programs applicable in those countries.  While these regulatory programs are today less stringent than in the United States, they have the potential to impose material liabilities on us, particularly in the event of a spill or other release, and if they are made more stringent in the future, we could be required to make significant capital expenditures to meet the new standards.

Pipeline and Terminal Maintenance and Safety Regulation

The pipelines we operate are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), its agency, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), and state pipeline regulatory bodies as appropriate and consistent with the federal Pipeline Safety Act (“PSA”). The PSA and PHMSA implementing regulations govern the design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of pipeline facilities and require any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with applicable safety standards, to establish and maintain plans for inspection and maintenance and to comply with such plans and programs. Among others, these programs include: construction, operation and maintenance, integrity management for pipelines located in high consequence areas, operator qualification, control room management, public awareness, and drug and alcohol. Certain states in which we operate participate in oversight and inspection of intrastate and interstate pipeline facilities through certifications and agreements with PHMSA. For intrastate pipelines located in PHMSA certified states, the State may impose additional or more stringent pipeline safety regulations as long as they are not inconsistent with minimum PHMSA standards. 
We believe that we currently comply in all material respects with the pipeline safety laws and regulations. However, the industry, including us, will incur additional pipeline and tank integrity expenditures in the future, and we are likely to incur increased operating costs based on these and other government regulations.
The PSA was amended in 2011 and again in 2016. Combined, those statutory amendments have extended the jurisdictional reach of federal pipeline regulation, and mandated additional rulemaking by PHMSA. PHMSA issued two Interim Final Rules in 2016, including its new ability to issue ‘Emergency Orders’ without prior notice or hearing and to establish minimum standards for underground natural gas storage.
In 2017, PHMSA issued final rules to, among other things, address incident notification, which would impact both gas (49 CFR Part 192) and liquid regulations (49 CFR Part 195), and liquid pipeline integrity assessment, integrity management, and leak detection requirements. Rules regarding incident notification, among other things, were issued in January 2017 and become effective in March 2017. PHMSA issued a final rule on liquid pipeline issues in January 2017.  Before that rule became effective, the new Administration issued an Executive Order on January 20, 2017, freezing all pending federal rules.  Because parts of the new PHMSA rule were directed by Congressional mandates, which are to be exempt from the regulatory freeze, it is not yet clear whether and to what extent the rule will continue to be subject to the regulatory freeze, or be allowed to become effective.

We are also subject to the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state statutes.  We believe that our operations comply in all material respects with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record-keeping and the training and monitoring of occupational exposures.

We cannot predict whether or in what form any new legislation or regulatory requirements might be enacted or adopted or the costs of compliance. In general, any such new regulations could increase operating costs and impose additional capital expenditure requirements, but we do not presently expect that such costs or capital expenditure requirements would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.

Environmental Hazards and Insurance

Our business involves a variety of risks, including the risk of natural disasters, adverse weather, fire, explosions, and equipment failures, any of which could lead to environmental hazards such as crude oil and petroleum product spills and other releases.  If any of these should occur, we could incur legal defense costs and environmental remediation costs, and could be required to pay amounts due to injury, loss of life, damage or destruction to property, natural resources and equipment, pollution or environmental damage, regulatory investigation and penalties and suspension of operations.

15

We are covered by site pollution incident legal liability insurance policies with per incident and aggregate limits of $100.0 million, subject to a maximum self-insured retention of $5.0 million.  The policies include coverage for sudden and accidental or gradual releases at our listed sites, and also include a contractor’s pollution coverage endorsement.  The policies insure: (i) claims, remediation costs, and associated legal defense expenses for pollution conditions at, or migrating from, a covered location, and (ii) the transportation risks associated with moving waste from a covered location to any location for unloading or disposal.  The premises pollution liability policies contain exclusions, conditions, and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and may not cover all claims or liabilities we incur.  The insurance policies expire on May 1, 2017.

In addition to the site pollution incident legal liability insurance policies, we maintain casualty insurance policies that provide coverage for claims involving sudden and accidental releases with aggregate and per occurrence limits of $400 million.  Coverage under the casualty insurance is secondary to the site pollution incident legal liability policies for sudden and accidental releases.  The pollution coverage provided in the casualty insurance policies contains exclusions, definitions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and may not cover all claims or liabilities we incur.  The insurance policies expire on May 1, 2017.
We generally are not entitled to seek indemnification from our contractual counterparties for any environmental damage caused by the release of products we store, throughput or transport for such counterparties. As discussed above, we maintain insurance policies that are designed to mitigate the risk that we may incur in connection with any such release of products from our facilities, and we believe that the policy limits under site pollution incident legal liability and casualty insurance policies are within the range that is customary for entities of our size that operate in our business segments and are appropriate for our business.

We attempt to reduce our exposure to third-party liability by requiring indemnification and access to third party insurance from our contractors or entities who require access to our facilities and our right-of-way. We have requirements for limits of insurance provided by third parties which we believe are in accordance with industry standards and proof of third-party insurance documentation is retained prior to commencement of work.

We have written plans for responding to emergencies along our pipeline systems and at our terminalling and processing facilities.  These plans, which describe the organization, responsibilities and actions for responding to emergencies, are reviewed annually and updated as necessary.  Our facilities are designed with product containment structures, and we maintain various additional crude oil containment and recovery equipment that would be deployed in the event of an emergency.  We are a member of ten oil spill cooperatives or mutual aid groups, and we maintain more than 50 contract relationships with United States Coast Guard certified spill response organizations, spill response contractors and remediation management consultants.  In 2013, we contracted with a third-party to provide enterprise-wide emergency spill response services for certain incidents, which includes the strategic staging of response equipment at our BBH, Yabucoa and St. Lucia terminals.  This service contract provides access to over 100 additional local United States Coast Guard certified spill response organizations.  This further ensures access to spill response equipment (including boom, recovery pumps, response vehicles, response vessels and response trailers), monitoring and sampling equipment, personal protective equipment and technical expertise needed to respond to an emergency event.  We also perform spill response drills to review and exercise the response capabilities of our personnel, contractors and emergency management agencies.  Additionally, we have a Crisis Management Team within our organization to provide strategic direction, ensure availability of company resources and manage communications in the event of an emergency situation.
