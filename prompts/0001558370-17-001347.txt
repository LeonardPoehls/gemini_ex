 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Overview
 The McClatchy Company (the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a news and information publisher of well-respected publications such as the Miami Herald, The Kansas City Star, The Sacramento Bee, The Charlotte Observer, The (Raleigh) News and Observer, and the (Fort Worth) Star-Telegram. Each of our publications also has online platforms serving their communities. In December 2016, we acquired certain assets and operations of The (Durham, NC) Herald-Sun, including related intangible assets. With the addition of this acquisition, we operate 30 media companies in 29 U.S. markets in 14 states, providing each of these communities with high-quality news and advertising services in a wide array of digital and print formats. Incorporated in Delaware, we are headquartered in Sacramento, California, and our Class A Common Stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol MNI.
 Our businesses are comprised of daily newspapers, websites and mobile apps, mobile news and advertising, video products, niche publications, direct marketing, direct mail services and nearby community newspapers. Our media companies range from large daily newspapers and news websites serving metropolitan areas to non‑daily newspapers with news websites and online platforms serving small communities. For the year ended December 25, 2016, we had an average aggregate paid daily print circulation of 1.5 million and Sunday print circulation of 2.2 million. We had 56.7 million average monthly unique visitors to our online platforms for the full year ended December 25, 2016. Our local websites, e-editions of the printed newspaper and mobile apps in each of our markets now provide us fully developed, but rapidly evolving channels, to extend our journalism and advertising products to our audience in each market. In 2016, we launched our full-service digital agency, excelerateTM, which provides digital marketing tools designed to customize digital marketing plans for our customers.
 Our business is roughly divided between those media companies operated west of the Mississippi River and those that are east of it, but include five operating regions: California, the Carolinas, Southeast, Midwest and Northwest. For the year ended December 25, 2016, no single media company represented more than 12.0% of total revenues.
 In addition to our media companies, we also own 15.0% of CareerBuilder, LLC, which operates a premier online job website, CareerBuilder.com, as well as certain other digital company investments. In September 2016, TEGNA Inc., the majority holder of CareerBuilder, LLC, announced that it and other owners, including us, would evaluate strategic alternatives for CareerBuilder. No specific timeline was announced for this process and no further action has been announced. 
 Our fiscal year ends on the last Sunday in December. The fiscal years ended December 25, 2016, December 27, 2015, and December 28, 2014, consist of 52‑week periods.
 Strategy
 We are committed to a three‑pronged strategy to grow our businesses and total revenues as a leading local media company:

 
  2

 


· | First, to maintain our position as the leading local media company in each market by providing high-quality journalism and advertising information to audiences throughout the day on digital platforms and in our printed newspapers; and to grow these audiences for the benefit of our advertisers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Second, to grow digital revenues. This strategy includes being a leader of local digital business in each of our markets, including websites, e-editions of the printed newspaper, mobile apps, e‑mail products, mobile services, video products and other electronic media; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Third, to extend these franchises by supplementing the reach of the newspaper and digital businesses with direct marketing, niche publications and events and direct mail products so advertisers can capture both mass and targeted audiences with one‑stop shopping.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  To assist us with these strategies, we continually reengineer our operations to reduce legacy costs and strengthen areas driving performance in news, audience, advertising and digital growth. As a result of our efforts, we saw growth in total digital revenues in 2016 and we continued our focus on driving results in direct marketing and audience revenues, while continuing to drive operating expenses down.
 Business Initiatives
 Our local media companies continue to undergo tremendous structural and cyclical change. In order to strengthen our position as a leading local media company and implement our strategies, we are focused on the following five major business initiatives: Increasing and Broadening Total Revenues
 Revenue initiatives in 2016 included revamping our sales forces in our markets, adding resources to our digital sales team, additional digital sales training, and growing our digital marketing solutions that provides agency services to small and medium-sized businesses in our markets. We realigned and improved delivery of our content on all platforms, from printed newspapers to websites to mobile apps in every market. In 2016, we launched our full-service digital agency, excelerateTM, which provides digital marketing tools designed to customize digital marketing plans for our customers. We also continued to expand our video efforts to improve storytelling and generate additional advertising revenues.
 Revenues exclusive of print newspaper advertising continue to grow as a percentage of total revenues and represented 70.6%, 66.7% and 62.4% of total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our strategy has been to focus on growing revenue sources that include digital and direct marketing advertising, audience and other non-traditional revenues. Management expects newspaper print advertising to continue to be a smaller share of overall advertising in the future, due in part to expected strong growth in digital-only advertising revenues and direct marketing advertising, and more stable performance in audience revenues. However, we continue to look for opportunities to expand our advertiser base, including advertisers outside of our markets using our excelerateTM agency services.
 Overall, advertising revenues comprise a majority of our total revenues, making the quality of our sales force of greatest importance. Advertising revenues were approximately 58.2% of total revenues in 2016, 60.3% in 2015 and 63.8% in 2014. We have a local sales force in each of our markets, and our goal is to have the largest sales force as compared to other local media outlets and websites in those markets. Our sales forces are responsible for delivering to advertisers the broad array of our advertising products, including print, direct marketing and digital marketing solutions. Our advertisers range from large national retail chains to local automobile dealerships to small businesses and classified advertisers.
 Increasingly, our emphasis has been on growing the breadth of products offered to advertisers, particularly our digital and direct marketing products, while expanding our relationships with local advertisers. For example, over the last several years we have provided a “Sunday Select” program, which delivers a package of preprinted advertisements on Sunday to non‑newspaper subscribers that are interested in circulars. For 2016, total digital and direct marketing advertising revenues represented 49.5% of total advertising revenues on a combined basis compared to 44.9% and 41.1% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our digital products are discussed in more detail below.
 In 2016, we expanded our sponsorship of special events programs in our markets, designed for advertisers to connect with their customers, and expect this type of advertising to grow in 2017.

 Audience revenues were approximately 37.3%, 34.8% and 32.0% of consolidated total revenues in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our subscription packages have helped diversify our revenues while continuing to drive growth in digital audience revenues. 
 Expanding McClatchy’s Digital Business
 We continue to be a leader in digital advertising revenues generated on our media companies’ websites and mobile platforms as a percent of total advertising. In 2016, 30.6% of advertising revenues came from digital products compared to 26.2% in 2015. For 2016, 69.9% of our digital advertising revenues came from digital-only advertisements where the online buy was not an “up-sell” from a print buy, compared to 63.5% in 2015. We believe this independent advertising revenue stream positions us well for the future of our digital business and is evidence of its importance as a delivery channel for advertisers. During 2016, total digital advertising revenues increased 4.3% compared to a decline of 3.7% in 2015, due primarily to our focus on growing our digital-only advertising in 2016. 
 Our media companies’ websites and mobile apps, e‑mail products, video and mobile services and other electronic media enable us to engage our readers with real‑time news and information that matters to them. During 2016, our websites attracted an average of approximately 56.7 million unique visitors per month, up 26.8% compared to an average of approximately 44.7 million unique visitors per month in 2015. Increasing our number of unique visitors brings additional digital advertising revenue opportunities to our sales teams. In addition, our average mobile traffic was up 35.2% as compared to 2015, and accounted for 56.9% of all digital traffic we received on a monthly basis.
 Our websites offer classified digital advertising products provided by companies in which we hold a minority investment, including CareerBuilder.com for employment. In 2016, we along with Gannett Co., Inc., Hearst, and tronc, Inc. launched Nucleus Marketing Solutions, LLC (“Nucleus”). This marketing solutions provider expects to connect national advertisers with the top 30 U.S. local publishers’ highly engaged audiences across existing and emerging digital platforms. We expect Nucleus to improve our reach with national advertisers in 2017 and beyond.
 We continue to pursue additional new digital products and offerings. In mid-2016, we expanded our concept of comprehensive digital marketing solutions for local businesses and launched a larger direct marketing business to serve all businesses in our markets called excelerateTM. We are also expanding this concept to markets beyond those served by our media companies. By offering advertisers integrated packages including website customization, search engine marketing and optimization, social media presence and marketing services, and other multi‑platform advertising opportunities, excelerateTM helps businesses improve the effectiveness of their marketing and advertising efforts.
 In 2016, we continued to expand our advertising efforts on ad exchanges. Our real-time, programmatic buying and selling of digital advertising inventory – often targeting very specific audiences at very specific times – grew 82.3% in 2016 compared to 2015. Our growth has been bolstered by our participation in the Local Media Consortium (“LMC”) and its more than 75 member companies representing more than 1,600 daily newspapers and broadcast members. The LMC has created a private advertising exchange that includes high-quality brand friendly advertising inventory from member publishers. The LMC’s goal is to provide advertisers with efficient access to high-quality ad impressions. In total, LMC members serve more than 13 billion ad impressions monthly. 
 Video revenue increased 257.7% in 2016 compared to 2015, due to our continued expansion of the use of video in our digital products to both enhance the content that we bring to readers and viewers and also to compete for a growing advertising stream. During 2016, more than 225 million video views were recorded across all of our digital platforms, including those on social media platforms and distribution partners, up from 82 million video views in 2015.
 All of our markets offer subscription packages for digital content. The packages include a combined digital and print subscription and a digital‑only subscription. Digital‑only subscriptions grew to approximately 83,100, an increase of 4.8% in 2016 compared to 79,300 subscriptions in 2015.
 Maintaining Our Commitment to Public Service Journalism    We believe high‑quality news content is the foundation of the mass reach necessary for the press to continue to play its role in a democratic society. It is also the underpinning of our success in the marketplace.
 We are committed to developing best‑in‑class journalism and local content. Every market is expected to improve annually 

 
  4

 
as evidenced by peer awards, readership studies in its market, maintenance of readership (both print and electronic) and review of its content and quality. Most importantly, when we talk about our mission, from news meetings to board meetings, a constant theme is staying true to the public service role we believe defines our work.
 During the transition that has reshaped the industry over the past decade, we have moved quickly to expand our digital reach and deliver the news in a changing technological landscape. We have also made it a focus in our evolution to maintain the deeper coverage that our communities need. We launched a broad revamping of our approach to news, beginning in 2015 and continuing through 2016, as an area of continuous improvement. One of the central concepts was how to enhance the depth of coverage along with the speed of our work. We have added resources in breaking news and restructured our Washington D.C. bureau to work closely with our local markets on coverage unique to their readers and viewers. Every market added an element across all platforms that highlighted the deeper story. Our larger media companies, from Sacramento to Charlotte to Miami, included a full section offering in-depth coverage.
 Our legacy of public service journalism is the cornerstone of our business and the work of McClatchy's journalists received significant recognition last year. The Sacramento Bee won the 2016 Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning. The Miami Herald was a 2016 Pulitzer Prize finalist for local reporting for its coverage of a local drug sting that cost tens of millions of dollars but yielded no significant arrests. With these honors we extend our impressive streak of being a Pulitzer winner or finalist every year for more than a decade.
     Our video journalists are also important to our story-telling capabilities and have won numerous awards. The Star Telegram won the Local Media Digital Innovation Award for Best Use of Video for their use of video in news stories.
 The Sacramento Bee, who was assisted by our Washington D.C. bureau video operations, won the Eppy Award for Best Photojournalism of a Website with 1 million unique monthly visitors for their series called No Safe Place. The story was about Afghans who risked their lives for the U.S. but who now struggle in the Sacramento area. 
     These are just a few of the hundreds of examples of powerful McClatchy journalism published across the company. We intend to build on our legacy in the years ahead, propelled by the success of our ongoing digital transformation.
     Broadening Media Companies’ Audiences in Their Local Markets
 Each of our media companies has the largest print circulation of any news media source serving its respective community, and coupled with its local website and other digital platforms in each community, reaches a broad audience in each market. We believe that our broad reach in each market is of primary importance in attracting advertising, which is our principal source of revenues. 
 Our digital audience continues to grow, which is partially driven by traffic on our websites and other digital platforms. During 2016, average monthly unique visitors to our digital sites grew 26.8% as a result of continued focus and initiatives to improve our total revenues. As discussed above, we realigned and improved delivery of our content on all platforms, from printed newspapers to websites to mobile apps in nearly every market. Our websites offer mobile‑friendly versions for smartphones, and our content is available on e‑readers, tablets and other mobile devices. 
 Daily newspapers paid circulation volumes for 2016 were down 9.3% compared to 2015. The declines in daily circulation reflect the fragmentation of audiences faced by all media, including our own digital‑only subscriptions, as available media outlets proliferate and readership trends change. Our Sunday circulation volumes were down 10.5% in 2016 compared to 2015.
 As noted earlier, in 2016, our monthly mobile traffic was up 35.2% as compared to 2015 and accounted for 56.9% of all monthly digital traffic we received. We work hard to appeal to our mobile audience. We have invested in new digital publishing systems to better serve this mobile audience and we have rebuilt all of our news websites to be responsive – that is, to automatically resize to best fit a user’s screen, be it a smartphone or a tablet or desktop computer, and provide the optimal viewing experience. 
 Our news and information follows readers throughout their day. To start their day, we reach our readers with the morning newspaper or they can check out our latest headlines and stories on their mobile phones. Our news websites, updated frequently throughout the day, are available to readers via their desktop computers at work and optimized for all of their different mobile devices.
 We also reach audiences through our direct marketing products. In 2016, we distributed approximately 650,000 Sunday 

 
  5

 
Select packages per week, which are packages of preprinted advertisements generally delivered on Sunday to non‑newspaper subscribers who have interest in circulars. We also distribute thousands of e-mail messages each day, including editorial and advertising content, alerts for dealsaver®, our proprietary daily deals service, and other alerts to subscribers and non‑subscribers in our markets which supplement the reach of our print and digital subscriptions. 
 To remain the leading local media company for the communities we serve and a must‑buy for advertisers, we are focused on maintaining a broad reach of print and digital audiences in each of our markets. We will continue to refine and strengthen our print platform, but our growth increasingly comes from our digital products and the beneficial impact those products have on the total audience we deliver for our advertisers.
 Focusing on Cost Efficiencies While Investing for the Future
 While continuing to maintain our core business in news, advertising sales and digital, we are also focused on cost efficiencies. Our cost initiatives in 2016 were focused on continuing to reduce legacy costs from our traditional print business and we have realized significant savings from these efforts, primarily in production and distribution, including substantial savings in newsprint costs. In addition, in 2016, we made additional reductions in costs to help protect our profitability in a period of declining print advertising. Total expenses, excluding depreciation, amortization and non-cash impairment charges, declined $39.9 million in 2016, compared to 2015. This decline was net of investments made in 2016 intended to generate future savings. The ongoing structural and cyclical changes in our markets demand that we respond by reengineering our operations, as needed, to achieve an efficient and sustainable cost structure. Over the past several years, we have substantially lowered our cost structure through reducing our workforce, optimizing technology and maximizing printing, distribution and content efficiencies, all while maintaining operating profitability at each of our media companies.
 In the fourth quarter of 2016, we completed regionalizing our audience distribution operations, our advertising production, certain human resource functions and certain finance functions. We will continue to outsource, regionalize and consolidate legacy operations to achieve a more streamlined and efficient cost structure. These changes will result in cost savings in future years, while giving our operating executives in each market the ability to focus more of their time on our growing digital and direct marketing media businesses.
 In 2016, we outsourced the printing production of four newspapers bringing the total of outsourced operations to 20 of our 30 media companies, which are printed through arrangements with nearby newspapers owned by us or third-party companies. In other cases, we in‑source the printing of nearby newspapers from other companies to maximize the use of our existing press capacity and generate additional revenues. Five markets (Charlotte, Columbia, Kansas City, Miami and Sacramento) have become hubs for in-sourcing printing in their areas.
 We also believe that using technology is an important component of our ability to continue to operate cost‑effectively and to invest in our business for the future. In 2016 we co-sourced our technology with the international company WIPRO, LTD to provide the flexibility to add development resources as needed and to cut back costs when those services were not needed. Much of our technology is employed behind the scenes with a digital publishing system that can distribute news content to any number of platforms and enterprise-wide systems to support audience and advertising in the digital environment.
 Other Operational Information
 Each of our media companies is largely autonomous in its local advertising and editorial operations in order to meet most effectively the needs of the particular community it serves. However, our operations across our local media companies have been engineered to strengthen the areas that are driving performance in news, audience, advertising and digital growth.
 We have two operating segments that are aggregated into a single reportable segment. Each operating segment consists primarily of a group of local media companies with similar economic characteristics, products, customers and distribution methods. Both operating segments report to one segment manager. One of our operating segments (“Western Segment”) consists of our media operations in California, the Northwest and the Midwest, while the other operating segment (“Eastern Segment”) consists primarily of media operations in the Southeast and the Carolinas. Publishers of each of the media companies make the day‑to‑day decisions and report to the segment manager, who is responsible for implementing the operating and financial plans at each operation within the respective operating segment. The corporate managers, including executive officers, set the basic business, accounting, financial and reporting policies.
 As noted previously under “Focusing on Cost Efficiencies While Investing for the Future,” our media companies also work together to consolidate functions and share resources regionally and across operating segments that lend themselves 

 
  6

 
to such efficiencies, such as certain regional or national sales efforts, accounting functions, digital publishing systems and products, information technology functions and others. Our corporate advertising department is headed by a vice president of advertising who works with our largest advertisers in placing advertising across our operating segments’ print and online products. These efforts are often coordinated through the vice president of operations and corporate personnel.
 Our business is somewhat seasonal, with peak revenues and profits generally occurring in the fourth quarter of each year, reflecting the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. The other quarters, when holidays are not as prevalent, are historically the slower quarters for revenues and profits.

  Other Operations
 In addition to our media companies, we also own 15.0% of CareerBuilder, LLC, which operates a premier online job website, CareerBuilder.com, as well as certain other digital company investments. In September 2016, TEGNA Inc., the majority holder of CareerBuilder, LLC, announced that it and other owners, including us, would evaluate strategic alternatives for CareerBuilder. No specific timeline was announced for this process and no further action has been announced. Our ownership interests and investments in unconsolidated companies and joint ventures including, but not limited to CareerBuilder, LLC, provided us with $6.0 million of cash distributions in 2016. 

 
  7

 

 We own 49.5% of the voting stock and 70.6% of the nonvoting stock of The Seattle Times Company. The Seattle Times Company owns The Seattle Times newspaper, weekly newspapers in the Puget Sound area and daily newspapers located in Walla Walla and Yakima, Washington, and all of their related websites and mobile applications.
 In addition, three of our wholly-owned subsidiaries own a combined 27.0% interest in Ponderay Newsprint Company (“Ponderay”), a general partnership that owns and operates a newsprint mill in the state of Washington. 
 In 2016, we along with Gannett Co., Inc., Hearst, and tronc, Inc. launched Nucleus Marketing Solutions, LLC (“Nucleus”). We own a 25.0% interest in Nucleus that is a marketing solutions provider that connects national advertisers with 30 U.S. local publishers’ highly engaged audiences across existing and emerging digital platforms.
 Raw Materials 
 During 2016 we consumed approximately 84,000 metric tons of newsprint for our operations compared to 99,000 metric tons in 2015. The decrease in tons consumed was primarily due to changes in our print products at numerous media companies, as well as lower print advertising sales and print circulation volumes. We estimate that we will use approximately 72,000 metric tons of newsprint in 2017, depending on the level of print advertising, circulation volumes and other business considerations. 
 During 2016, we obtained newsprint from Ponderay, as well as a number of other suppliers. We purchased approximately 20,000 metric tons of newsprint either directly from Ponderay or through a third-party intermediary in 2016.
 Our earnings are sensitive to changes in newsprint prices. In 2016, 2015 and 2014, newsprint expense accounted for 4.9%, 5.7% and 7.1%, respectively, of total operating expenses, excluding impairments and other asset write-downs. 
 Competition
 Our newspapers, direct marketing programs, websites and mobile content compete for advertising revenues and readers’ time with television, radio, other media websites, social network sites and mobile apps, direct mail companies, free shoppers, suburban neighborhood and national newspapers and other publications, and billboard companies, among others. In some of our markets, our newspapers also compete with other newspapers published in nearby cities and towns. Competition for advertising is generally based upon print readership levels and demographics, advertising rates, internet usage and advertiser results, while competition for circulation and readership is generally based upon the content, journalistic quality, service, competing news sources and the price of the newspaper or digital service.
 Our media companies are the largest print circulation of any news media source in each of their respective markets. However, our media companies have experienced difficulty maintaining or increasing print circulation levels because of a number of factors. These include increased competition from other publications and other forms of media technologies available in various markets, including the internet and other new media formats that are often free for users; and a proliferation of news outlets that fragments audiences. In addition, while our media companies’ internet sites are generally the leading local websites in each of our major daily newspaper markets, based upon research conducted by us and various independent sources, changes in readership trends, including a shift of readers to digital media and mobile devices have continued, and we have continued to experience a shift of advertising to digital advertising. We face greater competition, particularly in the areas of employment, automotive and real estate advertising, from online competitors. 
 To address the structural shift to digital media, we reengineered our operations to strengthen areas driving performance in news, audience, advertising and digital growth. Our newsrooms also provide editorial content on a wide variety of platforms and formats from our daily newspaper to leading local websites; on social network sites such as Facebook and Twitter; on smartphones and on e‑readers; on websites and blogs; in niche online publications and in e‑mail newsletters; through RSS (rich site summary) feeds and mobile applications. Upgrades are continually made to our mobile apps and websites. In addition, our websites offer leading digital classified products such as CareerBuilder.com, Cars.com and HomeFinder.com. We also operate dealsaver®, our proprietary daily deals service, in nearly all of our markets.
 Employees — Labor 
 As of December 25, 2016, we had approximately 5,400 full and part‑time employees (equating to approximately 4,600 full‑time equivalent employees), of whom approximately 5.3% were represented by unions. Most of our union‑represented employees are currently working under labor agreements with expiration dates through 2018. We have no unions at 24 of our 30 daily media companies.

 While our media companies have not had a strike for decades, and we do not currently anticipate a strike occurring, we cannot preclude the possibility that a strike may occur at one or more of our media companies when future negotiations take place. We believe that in the event of a strike we would be able to continue to publish and deliver to subscribers, a capability that is critical to retaining revenues from advertising and audience, although there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to publish in the event of a strike.
 Compliance with Environmental Laws
 We use appropriate waste disposal techniques for items such as ink and other hazardous materials. As of December 25, 2016, we have $1.0 million in a letter of credit shared among various state environmental agencies and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide collateral related to existing or previously removed storage tanks. However, we do not believe that we currently have any significant environmental issues and in 2016, 2015 and 2014 had no significant expenses or capital expenditures related to environmental control facilities.
