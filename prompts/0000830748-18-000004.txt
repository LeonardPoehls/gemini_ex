ITEM 1.  - BUSINESS
Pacific Office Properties Trust, Inc. (the “Company”) is a Maryland corporation which has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, which we refer to as the Code. We are a REIT that owns and operates primarily institutional-quality office properties in Hawaii. As of December 31, 2017, we owned three office properties, comprising 1.2 million rentable square feet, and were partners with third parties in joint ventures holding one office property and a sports club associated with that property in Phoenix, Arizona. Our ownership interest percentage in these joint ventures is 5.0%. As of December 31, 2017, our property portfolio included office buildings in Honolulu and Phoenix.
We were formed on March 19, 2008 via a merger, and related transactions, of The Shidler Group’s western U.S. office portfolio and joint venture operations into Arizona Land Income Corporation.  We are the sole general partner of our Operating Partnership, Pacific Office Properties, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership.
We are externally advised by Shidler Pacific Advisors, LLC (“Shidler Pacific Advisors”), an entity that is owned and controlled by Jay H. Shidler (“Mr. Shidler”), our Chairman of the Board. Lawrence J. Taff, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, also serves as President of Shidler Pacific Advisors. Shidler Pacific Advisors is responsible for the day-to-day operation and management of the Company, including management of our wholly-owned properties. 
Regulation
Our properties are subject to various covenants, laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas and fire and safety requirements. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate its business.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, or the ADA, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. Under the ADA, all public accommodations must meet federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons. The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and continual assessment of the properties is required. Although we believe that our wholly-owned properties in the aggregate substantially comply with present requirements of the ADA, we have not conducted a comprehensive audit or investigation of all of our properties to determine compliance. If one or more of our properties is not in compliance with the ADA, then we would be required to incur additional costs to bring the property into compliance. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages and/or attorneys’ fees to private litigants, or both. Additional federal, state and local laws also may require us to modify properties or could restrict our ability to renovate properties. Complying with the ADA or other legislation at noncompliant properties could be very expensive.
Environmental Matters
Environmental laws regulate, and impose liability for, releases of hazardous or toxic substances into the environment. Under some of these laws, an owner or operator of real estate may be liable for costs related to soil or groundwater contamination on or migrating to or from its property. In addition, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of cleaning up contamination at the disposal site. These laws often impose liability regardless of whether the person knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances that caused the contamination. The presence of, or contamination resulting from, any of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate them, may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent our property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral. In addition, persons exposed to hazardous or toxic substances may sue for personal injury damages. For example, some laws impose liability for release of or exposure to materials containing asbestos, a substance known to

be present in a number of our buildings. In addition, some of our properties may have been affected by contamination from past operations or from off-site sources. As a result, we may be potentially liable for investigation and cleanup costs, penalties and damages under environmental laws.
Although our wholly-owned properties have been subjected to preliminary environmental assessments, known as Phase I assessments, by independent environmental consultants that identify conditions that could pose potential environmental liabilities, Phase I assessments are limited in scope, and may not include or identify all potential environmental liabilities or risks associated with the property. Unless required by applicable law or any of our lenders, we may decide not to further investigate, remedy or ameliorate the liabilities disclosed in the Phase I assessments. Further, these or other environmental studies may not identify all potential environmental liabilities or accurately assess whether we will incur material environmental liabilities in the future. If we do incur material environmental liabilities in the future, we may face significant remediation costs, and we may find it difficult to sell any affected properties.
Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of our properties under blanket insurance policies. We believe the policy specifications and insured limits are appropriate and adequate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice; however, the insurance coverage may not be sufficient to fully cover losses.
Our business operations in Honolulu and Phoenix are susceptible to, and could be significantly affected by, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, volcanoes, wind, floods, landslides, drought and fires. These adverse weather conditions and natural disasters could cause significant damage to the properties in our portfolio, the risk of which is enhanced by the concentration of our properties’ locations. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover business interruption or losses resulting from adverse weather or natural disasters. In addition, our insurance policies include customary deductibles and limitations on recovery. As a result, we may be required to incur significant costs in the event of adverse weather conditions and natural disasters. We may discontinue earthquake or any other insurance coverage on some or all of our properties in the future if the cost of premiums for any of these policies in our judgment exceeds the value of the coverage discounted for the risk of loss.
Furthermore, we do not carry insurance for certain losses, including, but not limited to, losses caused by war or by certain environmental conditions, such as mold or asbestos. In addition, if a loss or damages are suffered at one or more of our properties, the insurer may attempt to limit or void coverage by arguing that the loss resulted from facts or circumstances not covered by our policy. Furthermore, our title insurance policies may not insure for the current aggregate market value of our portfolio, and we do not intend to increase our title insurance coverage as the market value of our portfolio increases. As a result, we may not have sufficient coverage against all losses that we may experience, including from adverse title claims. If we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy limits, we could incur significant costs and lose the capital invested in the damaged or otherwise adversely affected properties as well as the anticipated future cash flows from those properties.
In addition, our properties may not be able to be rebuilt to their existing height, size or utility at their existing location under current land-use laws and policies. In the event that we experience a substantial or comprehensive loss of one of our properties, we may not be able to rebuild such property to its existing specifications or operate it in accordance with its current use, or we may be required to upgrade such property in connection with any rebuilding to meet current code requirements.
Competition
We compete with a number of developers, owners and operators of office real estate, many of which own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located. If our competitors offer space at rental rates below current market rates, or below the rental rates we currently charge our tenants, we may lose existing or potential tenants and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge or to offer more substantial rent abatements, tenant improvements, early termination rights or below-market renewal options in order to retain tenants when our tenants’ leases expire or to entice new tenants to lease space in our properties. In that case, our financial condition,

results of operations, cash flow, market price of our Class A Common Stock and ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends may be adversely affected.
Employment
We are externally advised by Shidler Pacific Advisors and have no employees of our own.
