History and Development of the Company
This is the first Annual Report on Form 10-K (Form 10-K) that IHS Markit has filed since the completion of the Merger on July 12, 2016, pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated March 20, 2016 (the Merger Agreement), between IHS, Markit, and Marvel Merger Sub, Inc., an indirect and wholly owned subsidiary of Markit formed for the purpose of facilitating this transaction (Merger Sub). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into IHS, with IHS continuing as the surviving corporation and an indirect and wholly owned subsidiary of IHS Markit. Upon completion of the Merger, Markit became the combined group holding company and was renamed IHS Markit Ltd.
In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, IHS stockholders received 3.5566 common shares of IHS Markit for each share of IHS common stock they owned and IHS Inc. common stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act. IHS was treated as the acquiring entity for accounting purposes, which is reflected in the results of operations, financial position, financial statements, and Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Other sections of this report refer to legacy Markit and legacy IHS, as the context requires, for each of the entities prior to the Merger, and to IHS Markit, the combined company after completion of the Merger.
IHS was in business since 1959 and became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange in 2005. Markit was founded in 2003 with the goal of increasing transparency in the financial markets. Markit Ltd. was incorporated pursuant to the laws of Bermuda in 2014 to become the holding company for Markit's business in connection with its initial public offering on the NASDAQ Stock Market (NASDAQ) in June 2014. IHS Markit's common shares are now traded on the NASDAQ under the symbol "INFO."

Our Vision
Our vision is to be the leading source for critical information, analytics, and insight that powers growth, efficiency, and value for our customers. Our mission is to delight our customers daily by delivering a powerful combination of world-class expertise, knowledge, and solutions so they can make more informed decisions to enable their long-term, sustainable growth.
Our Business
We are a leading globally diversified provider of critical information, analytics, and expertise with deep sources of information, analytics, and solutions for the world’s major industries, financial markets, and governments. Our analytics reveal interdependencies across complex industries, which enhances transparency, reduces risk, and improves operational efficiency for our customers. We are deeply embedded in the systems and workflows of many of our customers and continue to become increasingly important to our customers’ operations. We leverage leading technologies and our industry expertise to create innovative products and services that provide information and insight to our customers to help them be more efficient and make more informed, confident decisions. We are committed to sustainable, profitable growth.
Our core competency is using our expertise to source and transform data into information, analytics, and solutions that our customers can use when making operational and strategic decisions. We are a sought-after resource for those who require and demand the most accurate and robust information available. We are dedicated to providing the information and analysis our customers need to make critical decisions that drive growth and value for their operations.
By integrating and connecting our information and analytics with proprietary and widely used decision-support technology on scalable platforms, we produce critical information and solutions designed to meet our customers’ needs. Our product development teams have also created proprietary Web services and application interfaces that enhance access to our information and allow our customers to integrate our offerings with other data, business processes, and applications (such as computer-aided design, enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management, and product data/lifecycle management).

Our Objectives
To achieve our vision, we are focusing our efforts primarily on the following objectives:

• | Improving customer satisfaction (which we refer to as customer delight);

•Enabling colleague success;
•Delivering on our key financial commitments while continuing to increase our financial strength; 
•Providing an opportunity for shareholder success relative to our peer group;
•Completing critical integration activities for the combined company; and
•Maintaining corporate sustainability efforts.
We benchmark our progress annually against these objectives through the use of external and internal metrics. For example, to measure customer delight and colleague success, we use third-party surveys and develop goals based on those metrics.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to bring together information, research, and analytics to deliver integrated solutions to customers in separate but interconnected industries. We believe that we can best implement our strategy by achieving the following:
Integrate organizational structure. We are in the process of completing key merger integration activities primarily related to our shared services and corporate organization. In terms of commercial operations, we are aligned around an industry- and workflow-focused organizational structure consistent with our segments, as further described below. We intend to integrate our people, platforms, processes, and products in a manner that allows us to take advantage of revenue and cost synergies that will strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of our business operations.
Innovate and develop new product offerings. We work closely with our customers to develop and introduce new offerings that are designed to increase visibility, reduce risk, and improve operational efficiency in their businesses. In recent years, we have launched new offerings addressing a wide array of customer needs, and we expect to continue to create new offerings from our existing data sets, converting core information to higher value analytics. Our investment priorities for new product offerings are primarily in energy, transportation, financial services, and product design, and we intend to continue to invest across the business to increase our customer value proposition.
Simplify capital allocation. In the near term, we are focusing our capital allocation strategy primarily on shareholder return through share repurchases. Longer term, we expect to balance capital allocation between returning capital to shareholders through consistent share repurchases and mergers and acquisitions focused primarily on fewer deals in our core end markets that will allow us to continue to build out our strategic position.
Our Global Organizational Structure
To serve our customers, we are organized into the following four industry- and workflow-focused segments:
•Resources, which includes our Energy and Chemicals product offerings; 

• | Transportation, which includes our Automotive; Maritime & Trade; and Aerospace, Defense & Security product offerings;


• | Consolidated Markets & Solutions, which includes our Product Design; Technology, Media & Telecom; and Economics & Country Risk product offerings; and


• | Financial Services, which includes our Information; Processing; and Solutions product offerings.

We believe that this sales and operating model helps our customers do business with us by providing a cohesive, consistent, and effective product, sales, and marketing approach by segment.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe that our competitive strengths include the following:

• | Trusted partner with diversified, global customer base and strong brand recognition. We believe that our customers trust and rely on us for our consultative approach to product development, dedication to customer delight, and ability

 6

to execute and deliver effective solutions. Our industry expertise allows us to anticipate and understand our customers’ needs in order to provide effective solutions with our product and service offerings. The Merger has increased our capacity to address new markets and opportunities, and our global footprint allows us to serve our customers throughout the world and to introduce our products and services to customers in new markets. Our brand is well established and recognized in multiple industries. We also own a number of well-known brands, including CARFAX, CERAWeek, the Purchasing Managers Index series, and the iBoxx indices.

• | Breadth and depth of information and analytics. Our customers benefit from a concentration of intellectual wealth and thought leadership in a variety of industries. We believe that our global team of information and industry experts, research analysts, and economists provides our customers with leading strategic information and research. We convert raw data into critical information through a series of transformational steps that reduce the uncertainty that is inherent in unrefined data. Our goal is to ensure that the data we use in our product offerings is correct, current, complete, and consistent; therefore, we place a high degree of emphasis on the data transformation process. With our process, we believe that we are able to provide information and analytics that are both useful to our customers and available where and when needed. Our process also provides the foundation for our integrated solutions that combine our products and services to create differentiated solutions for the customers in our target industries. 


• | Attractive financial model. We believe we have an attractive financial model due to our recurring revenue, margin expansion, cash generation, and capital flexibility characteristics.


◦ | Significant recurring revenue. We offer our products and services primarily through recurring fixed and variable fee agreements, and this business model has historically delivered stable revenue and predictable cash flows. For the year ended November 30, 2016, we generated approximately 82 percent of our revenue from recurring revenue streams. Many of our offerings are core to our customers’ business operations, and we have long-term relationships with many of our customers.


◦ | Solid margin expansion. Our customer focus and fiscal discipline has permitted us to progressively increase our margins as we streamline our operations and leverage our business model to provide valuable customer support even in a challenging economic environment.


◦ | High cash generation. Our business has low capital requirements for product enhancement and new product development, allowing us to generate strong cash flow.


◦ | Capital flexibility. Our cash flow model provides us with a significant amount of flexibility in decision-making, allowing us to balance internal resource and investment needs with shareholder return.

Our Growth Strategies

• | Increase in geographic, product, and customer penetration. We believe there are significant opportunities to increase the use of our products and services by existing customers globally and to add new customers to our products and services. We plan to add new customers and build our relationships with existing customers by leveraging our brand strength, broad portfolio of solutions, global footprint, and industry expertise to anticipate and respond to the changing demands of our end markets.


• | Introduce innovative offerings and enhancements. To maintain and enhance our position as a leading information services provider, we continuously strive to introduce enhancements to our products and services, as well as launch new products and services. We maintain an active dialogue with our customers and partners to allow us to understand their needs and anticipate market developments. We also seek to develop innovative uses for our existing products and services to generate incremental revenue, find more cost-effective inputs to support our existing products and services, and facilitate development of profitable new products and services.


• | Pursue strategic acquisitions and partnerships. We selectively evaluate technologies and businesses that we believe have potential to enhance, complement, or expand our product and service offerings and strengthen our value proposition to customers. We target acquisitions and partnerships that can be efficiently integrated into our global sales network, technology infrastructure, and operational delivery model to drive value. We believe we are an acquirer of choice among prospective acquisition targets and a partner of choice among our peers due to our entrepreneurial culture, growth, global scale, strong brand, broad distribution capabilities, and market position.

Our Customers
We have a diverse customer base, with more than 50,000 key business and government customers, including 85 percent of the Fortune Global 500 and 75 percent of the Fortune U.S. 1000. Our customers operate in global interconnected industries and 
 7

financial markets, and we continue to build on our existing scale to integrate our comprehensive content, expertise, tools, technology, and research and analysis to produce a differentiated solution set that makes us an important part of many of our customers’ core workflows. In 2016, no customer or group of affiliated customers represented more than 10 percent of our revenue.
Our Operating Segments
We develop our products and services based on customer needs in the target industries we serve and in the workflows that our customers use. We have organized our business to address the following key industries and workflows:
Resources
Energy and Chemicals. Approximately 90 percent of Resources revenue comes from our Energy offerings, with the remaining 10 percent coming from our Chemicals offerings.

Within the used car market, we support dealers, insurers, and consumers through our CARFAX (U.S.) and CARPROOF (Canada) products. These solutions provide critical information for used car dealers and their customers in the used car buying process. For example, CARFAX vehicle history reports provide maintenance, accident, odometer, and commercial use on cars in the United States. This history, based on more than 17 billion records collected from more than 100,000 data sources, provides confidence to dealers and consumers in the car buying process. We are extending our product line under CARFAX to include a used car listing service for dealers and vehicle-specific valuation solutions.

• | Information. Our Information solutions provide enriched content consisting of pricing and reference data, indices, and valuation and trading services across multiple asset classes and geographies through both direct and third-party distribution channels. Our Information products and services are used for independent valuations, research, trading, and liquidity and risk assessments. These products and services help our customers price instruments, comply with relevant regulatory reporting and risk management requirements, and analyze financial markets.


• | Processing. Our Processing offerings provide trade processing solutions globally for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives, foreign exchange (FX), and syndicated loans. Our trade processing services enable buy-side and sell-side firms to process transactions rapidly, which increases efficiency by optimizing post-trade workflow, reducing risk, complying with reporting regulations and improving connectivity. We believe we are the largest provider of end-to-end multiple asset OTC derivatives trade processing services.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales teams are located throughout the world and are organized within their respective business lines to align with our customers by industry and workflow. We also conduct regular customer surveys to understand both current customer satisfaction levels and potential opportunities for improvement, which we then use to provide additional direction to sales and marketing about key areas of focus.
Our marketing organization defines our marketing strategy and drives operational execution. A primary focus for marketing strategy is to empower IHS Markit brand awareness, revenue acceleration, and market leadership across our key industries and workflows for all products and services globally. Functionally, this includes corporate marketing, product marketing, and field marketing.
Competition
We believe the principal competitive factors in our business include the following:

• | Depth, breadth, timeliness, and accuracy of information provided

•Quality of decision-support tools and services
•Quality and relevance of our analysis and insight
•Ease of use
•Customer support
•Value for price

We believe that we compete favorably on each of these factors. Although we face competition in specific industries and with respect to specific offerings, we do not believe that we have a direct competitor across all of our workflows and industry solutions due to the depth and breadth of our offerings. Competitors within specific industries or with respect to specific offerings are described below.

• | Resources. Our Energy and Chemical offerings compete primarily with offerings from Verisk, Drilling Information, GeoScout, Platts (PIRA), Reed Elsevier, and Nexant. 


• | Transportation. In the Automotive market, we primarily compete with offerings from LMC Automotive, Urban Science, and Experian and, with respect to vehicle history reports, principally with Experian and various other providers approved by the National Motor Vehicle Title Information System of the United States Department of Justice. In Maritime & Trade markets, we primarily compete with offerings from Informa plc. In AD&S markets, we primarily compete with offerings from Forecast International and TEGNA. 


• | CMS. Our Product Design offerings primarily compete with offerings of SAI Global, Thomson Reuters, Thomas Publishing, and the standards developing organizations (SDOs), among others. Our electronics design offerings primarily compete with offerings from Arrow Electronics and parts manufacturers and distributors. Our Technology, 

 10

Media & Telecom offerings compete principally with offerings from Gartner, and our ECR offerings compete primarily with offerings from the Economist Group and Oxford Economics.

• | Financial Services. Our Information offerings primarily compete with offerings of Bloomberg, FactSet, IntercontinentalExchange, and Thomson Reuters. Our Processing products and services primarily compete with Bloomberg, IntercontinentalExchange, Traiana, and Thomson Reuters. Our Solutions offerings primarily compete with firms such as BlackRock, Bloomberg, IBM Algorithmics, Thomson Reuters, and global accounting and consulting firms. 

Government Contracts
We sell our products to various government agencies and entities. No individual contract is significant to our business. Although some of our government contracts are subject to terms that would allow renegotiation of profits or termination at the election of the government, we believe that no renegotiation or termination of any individual contract or subcontract at the election of the government would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.
Intellectual Property
We rely heavily on intellectual property, including the intellectual property we own and license. We regard our trademarks, copyrights, licenses, and other intellectual property as valuable assets and use intellectual property laws, as well as license and confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers, channel and strategic partners, and others, to protect our rights. In addition, we exercise reasonable measures to protect our intellectual property rights and enforce these rights when we become aware of any potential or actual violation or misuse.
We use intellectual property licensed from third parties, including SDOs, government agencies, public sources, market data providers, financial institutions, and manufacturers, as a component of our offerings and, in many cases, it cannot be independently replaced or recreated by us or others. We have longstanding relationships with most of the third parties from whom we license information. Almost all of the licenses that we rely upon are nonexclusive and expire within one to two years, unless renewed, although we have longer licenses with some of those third parties, particularly in the Financial Services segment.
We maintain registered trademarks and service marks in jurisdictions around the world. In addition, we have obtained patents and applied for patents in the United States, primarily related to our software portfolio, including our Kingdom and Goldfire products. For more information relating to our intellectual property rights, see "Risk Factors - We may not be able to protect intellectual property rights."
Employees
As of November 30, 2016, we had more than 12,500 employees located in 35 countries around the world.
Seasonality
Our business has seasonal aspects. Our fourth quarter typically generates our highest quarterly levels of revenue and profit. Conversely, our first quarter generally has our lowest quarterly levels of revenue and profit. We also experience event-driven seasonality in our business; for instance, CERAWeek, an annual energy conference, was held in the first quarter of 2016 and will be held in the second quarter of 2017. Another example is the biennial release of the Boiler Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC) engineering standard, which generates revenue for us predominantly in the third quarter of every other year. The most recent BPVC release was in the third quarter of 2015 and the next release will be in the third quarter of 2017.
