Introduction
Umpqua Holdings Corporation, an Oregon corporation, was formed as a bank holding company in March 1999. At that time, we acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of South Umpqua Bank, an Oregon state-chartered bank formed in 1953. We became a financial holding company in March 2000 under the provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 ("GLB Act"). Umpqua has two principal operating subsidiaries, Umpqua Bank (the "Bank") and Umpqua Investments, Inc. ("Umpqua Investments"). 
We file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may obtain these reports, and any amendments, from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. You may obtain copies of these reports, and any amendments, through our website at www.umpquaholdingscorp.com. These reports are available through our website as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed electronically with the SEC.
General Background
Headquartered in Roseburg, Oregon, Umpqua Bank is considered one of the most innovative community banks in the United States, recognized nationally and internationally for its unique company culture and customer experience strategy, which differentiate the Company from its competition. The Bank provides a broad range of banking, wealth management, mortgage and other financial services to corporate, institutional, and individual customers, and also has a wholly-owned subsidiary, Financial Pacific Leasing Inc., a commercial equipment leasing company. 
Umpqua Investments is a registered broker-dealer and registered investment advisor with offices in Oregon, Washington, and California, and also offers products and services through Umpqua Bank stores. The firm is one of the oldest investment companies in the Northwest and is actively engaged in the communities it serves. Umpqua Investments offers a full range of investment products and services including: stocks, fixed income securities (municipal, corporate, and government bonds, CDs, and money market instruments), mutual funds, annuities, options, retirement planning, advisory account services, goals based planning and insurance.
In 2014, the Company completed its merger with Sterling, and the combined company's banking operations joined together under the Umpqua Bank name and brand. 
In 2015, we formed Pivotus Ventures, Inc. as a subsidiary of Umpqua Holdings Corporation.  Pivotus will use a startup dynamic and collaboration with other institutions to validate, develop, and test new bank platforms that could have a significant impact on the experience and economics of banking. We believe the collaborative model will enhance Pivotus's ability to imagine and develop disruptive technologies, test them with a broad range of customers, and deliver them at scale.
Along with its subsidiaries, the Company is subject to the regulations of state and federal agencies and undergoes regular examinations by these regulatory agencies. 
Business Strategy
Umpqua Bank's primary objective is to become the leading community-oriented financial services organization throughout the Western United States. The Sterling merger expanded Umpqua Bank's footprint into Southern California, Eastern Washington, Eastern Oregon, and Idaho markets. We intend to continue to grow our assets and increase profitability and shareholder value by differentiating ourselves from competitors through the following strategies:
Capitalize on Innovative Product Delivery System. Our philosophy has been to create a unique delivery model that transforms banking from a chore into an experience that's both relevant to customers and highly differentiated from other financial institutions. With this approach in mind, in 1995 we introduced a bank store concept designed to reflect customer and community preferences and drive revenue growth by making the Bank's products and services more tangible and accessible. We've continued to evolve this model, introducing the next generation of our Neighborhood Store in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle, Washington, in 2010, and in 2013, rolling out the next generation of our flagship store in San Francisco.

In 2016, a new flagship store was opened in downtown Spokane, Washington, replacing an older store with a traditional bank setup.
Focus on Customer Experience. At every level of the Company, from the Board of Directors to our newest associates, and across all customer service delivery channels, we are focused on delivering an extraordinary customer experience. It's an integral part of our culture, and we believe we are among the first banks to introduce a measurable quality service program. Under our Return on Quality or ROQ program, the performance of each sales associate and store is evaluated based on specific measurable factors, including reports by incognito "mystery shoppers" and customer surveys. Based on scores achieved, Umpqua's ROQ program rewards both individual sales associates and store teams with financial incentives. Through such programs, we are able to measure the quality of the experience provided to our customers and maintain employee focus on quality customer service.
Establish Strong Brand Awareness. As a financial services provider, we devote considerable resources to developing the "Umpqua Bank" brand. This is done through design strategy, marketing, merchandising, and delivery through our customer-facing channels, as well as through active public relations, social media and community based events and initiatives. From Bank-branded bags of custom roasted coffee beans and Umpqua-branded ice cream trucks, to educational seminars, in-store events and social giving campaigns, Umpqua's goal is to engage our customers and communities in fresh and engaging ways. The unique look and feel of our stores and interactive displays help demonstrate our commitment to being an innovative, customer-friendly provider of financial products and services, and our active community engagement and investments stand out with commercial customers. Our brand activation approach is based on actions, not just advertising, and builds strong consumer awareness of our products and services.
Use Technology to Retain and Expand Customer Base. As consumer preferences evolve with technological changes, our strategy remains consistent: deliver an extraordinary experience across all customer touchpoints. As a result, we continue to expand user-friendly, technology-based systems that reflect and complement the distinct customer experience the company is known for. We believe this positions Umpqua well to adapt quickly as customer use of physical and digital channels evolves. We offer technology-based services including remote deposit capture, online banking, bill pay and treasury services, mobile banking, voice response banking, automatic payroll deposit programs, advanced function ATMs, interactive product kiosks, and our web site. We believe the combination of physical and electronic banking services enhances our ability to attract a broader range of customers and wrap our value proposition across all channels. 
Increase Market Share in Existing Markets and Expand Into New Markets. As a result of our innovative retail product orientation, measurable quality service program, strong brand awareness, and distinct customer experience across all delivery channels, we believe there is significant potential to increase business with current customers, to attract new customers in our existing markets and continue entering new markets. 
In April 2014 we completed the largest acquisition in Umpqua's history, merging with Sterling Financial Corporation. The Sterling acquisition was a strategic opportunity to enhance shareholder value through a transformative business combination. It allowed us to accelerate significantly our objective of creating something unique in the financial services industry: an organization that offers the products and expertise of a large bank but delivers them with the personal service and commitment of a community bank. As the landscape of the financial services industry is being reshaped by technological advances and the introduction of new digital customer delivery channels and technology-driven products and services, we believe the alignment of our physical and digital customer delivery channels is crucial in creating an exceptional customer experience. By doing so, we believe we can best serve our customers - anytime and anywhere - which will drive stronger growth, better customer retention, and create valuable fee and treasury management opportunities. During 2015, we focused on completing the integration of Sterling and realizing the financial benefits of the merger, as well as growing the combined bank and launching Pivotus Ventures, Inc. During 2016, we focused on expense discipline and adjusting the mix of the loan portfolio, entered new markets, expanded our product offerings, and enhanced the digital experience for our customers.
Prudently Manage Capital. An important part of our strategy is to continue to manage capital prudently, and to employ excess capital in a thoughtful and opportunistic manner that improves shareholder returns. We accomplish this through dividends, share repurchases, and pursuing strategic acquisitions, which could include technology-driven enterprises or banks and financial services companies in markets where we see growth potential. 
Marketing and Sales
Our goal of increasing our share of financial services in our market areas is driven by a marketing, communications and sales strategy with the following key components:
5

Integrated Marketing and Communications. Our comprehensive marketing and communications strategy aims to strengthen the Umpqua Bank brand and generate public awareness through innovative marketing and PR initiatives that stand out in our markets and our industry. The Bank has been recognized nationally for its use of new media and unique approach. From the Bank's Local Spotlight program, ice cream trucks and social giving platform, to interactive initiatives like Made to Grow, Umpqua is leveraging both traditional and emerging media channels in new ways to advance the brand and create meaningful connections with consumers. 
Retail Store Concept. Being in the financial services business, we believe that the physical environment continues to play a critical role both in creating awareness of our brand and franchise, as well as in successfully providing the right products and services to our customers. Using a more retailer-oriented approach, we encourage existing and potential customers to come in to our physical locations. To that end, we've designed our physical locations to display financial services and products in ways that are highly tactile and engaging. Unlike many financial institutions, we encourage all in our communities to visit our stores, where they are greeted by well-trained associates and encouraged to browse our products and services. Our "Next Generation" store model includes features like free wireless, free use of laptop computers, open rooms with refrigerated beverages and innovative product packaging. The stores host a variety of after-hours events, from poetry readings and yoga classes to movie nights and seminars on how to build an art collection. 
To bring financial services to our customers in a cost-effective way, we introduced "Neighborhood Stores." We build these stores in established neighborhoods and design them to be neighborhood hubs. These stand-alone, full-service stores are smaller and emphasize advanced technology. To strengthen brand recognition, all Neighborhood Stores are similar in appearance. In 2013, Umpqua Bank launched our flagship store in San Francisco which received international recognition as the Retail Design Institutes 2013 Store of the Year award, the first time in the organization's history that a financial services institution received the award.
Service Culture. We believe strongly that if we lead with a service culture, we will have more opportunity to provide our products and services and to create deeper customer relationships across all divisions, from retail to mortgage and commercial. Although a successful marketing program will attract customers to visit, a highly tuned service environment and well-trained associates are critical to selling products and services. Umpqua's service culture has become well established throughout the organization due to a clear focus and ongoing training of our associates on all aspects of sales and service. We provide training through our in-house training, known as "The World's Greatest Bank University," to recognize and celebrate exceptional service. This service culture has become iconic in our industry, and is a key element in our ability to attract both talented associates and loyal customers. 
Products and Services
We offer an array of traditional and digital financial products to meet the banking needs of our market area and target customers. To ensure the ongoing viability of our product offerings, we regularly examine the desirability and profitability of existing and potential new products. Other avenues through which customers can access our products include our web site, mobile banking app, and our 24-hour telephone voice response system.
Deposit Products. We offer a traditional array of deposit products, including non-interest bearing checking accounts, interest bearing checking and savings accounts, money market accounts and certificates of deposit. These accounts earn interest at rates established by management based on competitive market factors and management's desire to increase certain types or maturities of deposit liabilities. Our approach is to tailor fit products and bundle those that meet the customer's needs. This approach is designed to add value for the customer, increase products per household and generate related fee income. 
Private Bank. Umpqua Private Bank serves high net worth individuals and nonprofits, providing investment services. The private bank is designed to augment Umpqua's existing high-touch customer experience, and works collaboratively with the Bank's affiliate Umpqua Investments to offer a comprehensive, integrated approach that meets clients' financial goals, including financial planning, trust services, and investments.

Broker Dealer and Investment Advisory Services. In its combined role as a broker/dealer and a registered investment advisor, Umpqua Investments may provide comprehensive financial planning advice to its clients as well as investment services. This advice can include cash management, risk management (insurance planning/sales), investment planning (including investment advice and/or portfolio checkups), retirement planning (for employees and employers), or estate planning. The broker/dealer side of Umpqua Investments offers a full range of brokerage services including equity and fixed income products, mutual funds, annuities, options and life insurance products. At December 31, 2016, Umpqua Investments had 37 Series 7-licensed financial advisors serving clients at stand-alone retail brokerage offices, as well as "Investment Opportunity Centers" located in select Bank stores. 
Commercial Loans and Leases and Commercial Real Estate Loans. We offer a broad array of specialized loans for business and commercial customers, including accounts receivable and inventory financing, multi-family loans, equipment loans, commercial equipment leases, international trade, real estate construction loans and permanent financing and Small Business Administration ("SBA") program financing as well as capital markets and treasury management services. Additionally, we offer specially designed loan products for small businesses through our Small Business Lending Center, and have a business banking division to increase lending to small and mid-sized businesses. Ongoing credit management activities continue to focus on commercial real estate loans given this is a significant portion of our loan portfolio. We are also engaged in initiatives that continue to diversify the loan portfolio including a strong focus on commercial and industrial loans in addition to financing owner-occupied properties.
Residential Real Estate Loans. Real estate loans are available for the construction, purchase, and refinancing of residential owner-occupied and rental properties. Borrowers can choose from a variety of fixed and adjustable rate options and terms. We sell most residential real estate loans that we originate into the secondary market. Servicing is retained on the majority of these loans. We also support the Home Affordable Refinance Program and Home Affordable Modification Program.
Consumer Loans. We provide loans to individual borrowers for a variety of purposes, including secured and unsecured personal loans, home equity and personal lines of credit and motor vehicle loans. Loans may be made directly to borrowers or through Umpqua's dealer banking department. 
Market Area and Competition
The geographic markets we serve are highly competitive for deposits, loans, leases and retail brokerage services. We compete with traditional banking institutions, as well as non-bank financial service providers, such as credit unions, brokerage firms and mortgage companies. In our primary market areas of Oregon, Washington, California, Idaho, and Nevada, major banks and large regional banks generally hold dominant market share positions. By virtue of their larger capital bases, these institutions have significantly larger lending limits than we do and generally have more expansive branch networks. Competition also includes other commercial banks that are community-focused. 
As the industry becomes increasingly oriented toward technology-driven delivery systems, permitting transactions to be conducted on computers, phones, tablets, and other mobile devices, non-bank institutions are able to attract funds and provide lending and other financial services even without offices located in our primary service area. Some insurance companies and brokerage firms compete for deposits by offering rates that are higher than may be appropriate for the Bank in relation to its asset and liability management objectives. However, we offer a wide array of deposit products and believe we can compete effectively through rate-driven product promotions. We also compete with full service investment firms for non-bank financial products and services offered by Umpqua Investments. 
Credit unions present a significant competitive challenge for our banking services and products. As credit unions currently enjoy an exemption from income tax, they are able to offer higher deposit rates and lower loan rates than banks can on a comparable basis. Credit unions are also not currently subject to certain regulatory constraints, such as the Community Reinvestment Act ("CRA"), which, among other things, requires us to implement procedures to make and monitor loans throughout the communities we serve. Adhering to such regulatory requirements raises the costs associated with our lending activities, and reduces potential operating profits. Accordingly, we seek to compete by focusing on building customer relationships, providing superior service and offering a wide variety of commercial banking products, such as commercial real estate loans, inventory and accounts receivable financing, and SBA program loans for qualified businesses.

Lending and Credit Functions
The Bank makes both secured and unsecured loans to individuals and businesses. At December 31, 2016, commercial real estate, commercial, residential, and consumer and other represented approximately 53.7%, 20.4%, 22.3%, and 3.6%, respectively, of the total loan and lease portfolio. 
Inter-agency guidelines adopted by federal bank regulators mandate that financial institutions establish real estate lending policies with maximum allowable real estate loan-to-value limits, subject to an allowable amount of non-conforming loans as a percentage of capital. We have adopted as loan policy loan-to-value limits that range from 5% to 10% less than the federal guidelines for each category; however, policy exceptions are permitted for real estate loan customers with strong financial credentials. 
Loans and Leases 
We manage asset quality and control credit risk through diversification of the loan and lease portfolio and the application of policies designed to promote sound underwriting and loan and lease monitoring practices. The Bank's Credit Quality Group is charged with monitoring asset quality, establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the Bank. The provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management's judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable incurred losses. The amount of provision charged is dependent upon many factors, including loan and lease growth, net charge-offs, changes in the composition of the loan and lease portfolio, delinquencies, management's assessment of loan and lease portfolio quality, general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral, and other trends. The evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses. Reviews of non-performing, past due loans and leases and larger credits, designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses, and to determine the adequacy of the allowance, are conducted on a quarterly basis. These reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers, the value of the applicable collateral, loan and lease loss experience, estimated loan and lease losses, growth in the loan and lease portfolio, prevailing economic conditions and other factors. 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 4,295 full-time equivalent employees. None of the employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement and management believes its relations with employees to be good. Information regarding employment agreements with our executive officers is contained in Item 11 below, which item is incorporated by reference to our proxy statement for the 2017 annual meeting of shareholders.

Government Policies
The operations of our subsidiaries are affected by state and federal legislative and regulatory changes and by policies of various regulatory authorities, including, domestic monetary policies of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal Reserve"), United States fiscal policy, and capital adequacy and liquidity constraints imposed by federal and state regulatory agencies. 
Supervision and Regulation
General. We are extensively regulated under federal and state law. These laws and regulations are generally intended to protect depositors and customers, not shareholders. To the extent that the following information describes statutory or regulatory provisions, it is qualified in its entirety by reference to the particular statute or regulation. Any change in applicable laws or regulations may have a material effect on our business and prospects. We cannot accurately predict the nature or the extent of the effects on our business and earnings that fiscal or monetary policies, or new federal or state legislation or regulation may have in the future. Umpqua is subject to the disclosure and other requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and rules promulgated thereunder and administered by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a listed company on NASDAQ, Umpqua is subject to NASDAQ rules for listed companies.
The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have adopted non-capital safety and soundness standards for financial institutions. These standards cover internal controls, information and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, compensation, fees and benefits, and standards for asset quality, earnings and stock valuation. An institution that fails to meet these standards must develop a plan acceptable to the agency, specifying the steps that it will take to meet the standards. Failure to submit or implement such a plan may subject the institution to regulatory sanctions. 
Holding Company Regulation. We are a registered financial holding company under the GLB Act, and are subject to the supervision of, and regulation by the Federal Reserve. As a financial holding company, we are examined by and file reports with the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve expects a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and, under appropriate circumstances, to commit resources to support the subsidiary bank.
Financial holding companies are bank holding companies that satisfy certain criteria and are permitted to engage in activities that traditional bank holding companies are not. The qualifications and permitted activities of financial holdings companies are described below under "Regulatory Structure of the Financial Services Industry."
Federal and State Bank Regulation. Umpqua Bank, as a state chartered bank with deposits insured by the FDIC, is primarily subject to the supervision and regulation of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services Division of Financial Regulation("DCBS"), the Washington Department of Financial Institutions ("DFI"), the California Department of Business Oversight ("DBO"), the Idaho Department of Finance Banking Section, the Nevada Division of Financial Institutions, the FDIC and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ("CFPB"). These agencies may prohibit the Bank from engaging in what they believe constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices. Our primary state regulator, DCBS, regularly examines the Bank or participates in joint examinations with the FDIC. 
Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws. Umpqua Bank has a responsibility under the CRA, as implemented by FDIC regulations to help meet the credit needs of its communities, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution's discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community, consistent with the CRA. In connection with its examination, the FDIC assesses Umpqua Bank's record of compliance with the CRA. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. These factors are also considered in evaluating mergers, acquisitions and applications to open a branch or new facility. Umpqua Bank's failure to comply with the provisions of the CRA could, at a minimum, result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of Umpqua potentially resulting in the suspension of any growth of the Bank through acquisitions or opening de novo branches until the rating is improved. Umpqua Bank's failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions against it by the FDIC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies, including the CFPB and the Department of Justice.  As of the most recent CRA examination, the Bank's CRA rating was "Satisfactory."

Transactions with Affiliates and Insiders. Banks are also subject to certain restrictions imposed by the Federal Reserve Act on extensions of credit to executive officers, directors, principal shareholders or any related interest of such persons. Extensions of credit must be made on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with persons not affiliated with the bank, and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features. Banks are also subject to certain lending limits and restrictions on overdrafts to such persons. A violation of these restrictions may result in the assessment of substantial civil monetary penalties on the affected bank or any officer, director, employee, agent or other person participating in the conduct of the affairs of that bank, the imposition of a cease and desist order, and other regulatory sanctions. 
The Federal Reserve Act and related Regulation W limit the amount of certain loan and investment transactions between the Bank and its affiliates, require certain levels of collateral for such loans, and limit the amount of advances to third parties that may be collateralized by the securities of Umpqua or its subsidiaries. Regulation W requires that certain transactions between the Bank and its affiliates be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the Bank, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving nonaffiliated companies or, in the absence of comparable transactions, on terms and under circumstances, including credit standards, that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies. Umpqua and its subsidiaries have adopted an Affiliate Transactions Policy and have entered into various affiliate agreements in compliance with Regulation W.
Financial Privacy. Federal law and certain state laws currently contain client privacy protection provisions. These provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose non-public information about consumers to affiliated companies and non-affiliated third parties. These rules require disclosure of privacy policies to clients and, in some circumstances, allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to affiliates or non-affiliated third parties by means of opt out or opt in authorizations. Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) and certain state laws, companies are required to notify clients of security breaches resulting in unauthorized access to their personal information. In connection with the regulations governing the privacy of consumer financial information, the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information. 
Federal Deposit Insurance. Substantially all deposits with Umpqua Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the Deposit Insurance Fund ("DIF") of the FDIC and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. 
In October 2010, the FDIC adopted a new DIF restoration plan to ensure that the fund reserve ratio reaches 1.35% by September 30, 2020, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. At least semi-annually, the FDIC will update its loss and income projections for the DIF and, if needed, increase or decrease assessment rates. 
On February 7, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule modifying the risk-based assessment system from a domestic deposit base to a scorecard based assessment system, effective April 1, 2011. As of April 1, 2011, the Bank was categorized as a large institution as the Bank has more than $10 billion in assets. The initial base assessment rates range from 5 to 35 basis points. After potential adjustments related to unsecured debt and brokered deposit balances, the final total assessment rates range from 2.5 to 45 basis points. Initial base assessment rates for large institutions ranged from 5 to 35 basis points. Increases in the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, depending upon the amount of the increase.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act permanently raised the standard maximum federal deposit insurance amount from $100,000 to $250,000 per qualified account.
The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution if it determines that the institution has engaged in or is engaging in unsafe and unsound banking practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has violated any applicable law, regulation or order or any condition imposed in writing by, or pursuant to, any written agreement with the FDIC. The termination of deposit insurance for the Bank would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.

Dividends. Under the Oregon Bank Act and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 ("FDICIA"), the Bank is subject to restrictions on the payment of cash dividends to its parent company. A bank may not pay cash dividends if that payment would reduce the amount of its capital below that necessary to meet minimum applicable regulatory capital requirements. In addition, under the Oregon Bank Act, the amount of the dividend paid by the Bank may not be greater than net unreserved retained earnings, after first deducting to the extent not already charged against earnings or reflected in a reserve, all bad debts, which are debts on which interest is unpaid and past due at least six months unless the debt is fully secured and in the process of collection; all other assets charged-off as required by Oregon bank regulators or a state or federal examiner; and all accrued expenses, interest and taxes of the Bank. In addition, state and federal regulatory authorities are authorized to prohibit banks and holding companies from paying dividends that would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. The Federal Reserve has issued a policy statement on the payment of cash dividends by bank holding companies, which expresses the Federal Reserve's view that a bank holding company should pay cash dividends only to the extent that its net income for the past year is sufficient to cover both the cash dividends and a rate of earnings retention that is consistent with the holding company's capital needs, asset quality, and overall financial condition. 
Capital Adequacy. The federal and state bank regulatory agencies use capital adequacy guidelines in their examination and regulation of holding companies and banks. If capital falls below the minimum levels established by these guidelines, a holding company or a bank may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non-bank businesses or to open new facilities. 
The FDIC and Federal Reserve have adopted risk-based capital guidelines for holding companies and banks. The risk-based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profile among holding companies and banks, to account for off-balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off-balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with appropriate weightings. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk-weighted assets and off-balance sheet items. The capital adequacy guidelines limit the degree to which a holding company or bank may leverage its equity capital. 
Federal regulations establish minimum requirements for the capital adequacy of depository institutions, such as the Bank. Banks with capital ratios below the required minimums are subject to certain administrative actions, including prompt corrective action, the termination of deposit insurance upon notice and hearing, or a temporary suspension of insurance without a hearing. 
On July 2, 2013, federal banking regulators approved final rules that revised the regulatory capital rules to incorporate certain revisions by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to the Basel capital framework ("Basel III"). The phase-in period for the final rules began for the Company on January 1, 2015, with full compliance with the final rules' requirements phased in on January 1, 2019. 
The final rules, among other things, include a new common equity Tier 1 capital ("CET1") to risk-weighted assets ratio, including a capital conservation buffer, which will gradually increase from 4.5% on January 1, 2015 to 7.0% on January 1, 2019. The final rules also raise the minimum ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets from 4.0% to 6.0% on January 1, 2015 to 8.5% on January 1, 2019, as well as require a minimum leverage ratio of 4.0%. 
Under the final rules, as Umpqua grew above $15.0 billion in assets as a result of an acquisition, the combined trust preferred security debt issuances were phased out of Tier 1 and into Tier 2 capital (75% starting in the first quarter of 2015 and 100% starting in the first quarter of 2016). The final rules also provide for a number of adjustments to and deductions from the new CET1. Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, the Company and the Bank, have made a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items in order to avoid significant variations in the level of capital depending upon the impact of interest rate fluctuations on the fair value of the Company's securities portfolio. 
In addition, deductions include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, certain deferred tax assets not dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in non-consolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10% of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15% of CET1.

FDICIA requires federal banking regulators to take "prompt corrective action" with respect to a capital-deficient institution, including requiring a capital restoration plan and restricting certain growth activities of the institution. Umpqua could be required to guarantee any such capital restoration plan required of the Bank if the Bank became undercapitalized. Pursuant to FDICIA, regulations were adopted defining five capital levels: well capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, severely undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized. Under the regulations, the Bank is considered "well capitalized" as of December 31, 2016. 
Federal and State Regulation of Broker-Dealers. Umpqua Investments is a fully disclosed introducing broker-dealer clearing through Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC.  Umpqua Investments is regulated by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority ("FINRA"), as well as the SEC, and has deposits insured through the Securities Investors Protection Corp ("SIPC") as well as third party insurers.  FINRA and the SEC perform regular examinations of Umpqua Investments that include reviews of policies, procedures, recordkeeping, trade practices, and customer protection as well as other inquiries.
SIPC protects client securities and cash up to $500,000, including $100,000 for cash with additional coverage provided through Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC who maintains additional coverage through Lexington Insurance Company, for the remaining net equity balance in a brokerage account, if any.  This coverage does not include losses in investment accounts.
Broker-Dealer and Related Regulatory Supervision. Umpqua Investments is a member of, and is subject to the regulatory supervision of, FINRA. Areas subject to FINRA oversight review include compliance with trading rules, financial reporting, investment suitability, and compliance with stock exchange rules and regulations. 
Effects of Government Monetary Policy. Our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions, but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government, particularly the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession, through its open market operations in U.S. Government securities, control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the Federal Reserve, and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits. These activities influence growth of bank loans, investments and deposits, and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty. 
Regulation of the Financial Services Industry. Federal laws and regulations governing banking and financial services underwent significant changes in recent years and we believe will continue to undergo significant changes in the future. From time to time, legislation is introduced in the United States Congress that contains proposals for altering the structure, regulation, and competitive relationships of the nation's financial institutions. If enacted into law, these proposals could increase or decrease the cost of doing business, limit or expand permissible activities, or affect the competitive balance among banks, savings associations, and other financial institutions. Whether or in what form any such legislation may be adopted or the extent to which our business might be affected thereby cannot be predicted. 
The GLB Act, enacted in November 1999, repealed sections of the Banking Act of 1933, commonly referred to as the Glass-Steagall Act, that prohibited banks from engaging in securities activities, and prohibited securities firms from engaging in banking. The GLB Act created a new form of holding company, known as a financial holding company, that is permitted to acquire subsidiaries that are engaged in banking, securities underwriting and dealing, and insurance underwriting. 
A bank holding company, if it meets specified requirements, may elect to become a financial holding company by filing a declaration with the Federal Reserve, and may thereafter provide its customers with a broader spectrum of products and services than a traditional bank holding company is permitted to do. A financial holding company may, through a subsidiary, engage in any activity that is deemed to be financial in nature and activities that are incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature. These activities include traditional banking services and activities previously permitted to bank holding companies under Federal Reserve regulations, but also include underwriting and dealing in securities, providing investment advisory services, underwriting and selling insurance, merchant banking (holding a portfolio of commercial businesses, regardless of the nature of the business, for investment), and arranging or facilitating financial transactions for third parties. 
15

To qualify as a financial holding company, the bank holding company must be deemed to be well-capitalized and well-managed, as those terms are used by the Federal Reserve. In addition, each subsidiary bank of a bank holding company must also be well-capitalized and well-managed and be rated at least "satisfactory" under the CRA. A bank holding company that does not qualify, or has not chosen, to become a financial holding company must limit its activities to traditional banking activities and those non-banking activities the Federal Reserve has deemed to be permissible because they are closely related to the business of banking. 
The GLB Act also includes provisions to protect consumer privacy by prohibiting financial services providers, whether or not affiliated with a bank, from disclosing non-public personal, financial information to unaffiliated parties without the consent of the customer, and by requiring annual disclosure of the provider's privacy policy. 
The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 ("Riegle-Neal Act"), which became effective in 1995, permits interstate banking and branching, which allows banks to expand nationwide through acquisition, consolidation or merger. Under this law, an adequately capitalized bank holding company may acquire banks in any state or merge banks across state lines if permitted by state law. Further, banks may establish and operate branches in any state subject to the restrictions of applicable state law. Under Oregon law, an out-of-state bank or bank holding company may merge with or acquire an Oregon state chartered bank or bank holding company upon receipt of approval from the Director of the Oregon Department of Consumer and Business Services. The Bank now has the ability to open additional de novo branches in the states of Oregon, California, Washington, Idaho, and Nevada. 
Section 613 of the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated interstate branching restrictions that were implemented as part of the Riegle-Neal Act, and removed many restrictions on de novo interstate branching by national and state-chartered banks. The FDIC and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency now have authority to approve applications by insured state nonmember banks and national banks, respectively, to establish de novo branches in states other than the bank's home state if "the law of the State in which the branch is located, or is to be located, would permit establishment of the branch, if the bank were a State bank chartered by such State." The enactment of this Section 613 may significantly increase interstate banking by community banks in western states, where barriers to entry were previously high.
Anti-Terrorism Legislation. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act ("USA Patriot Act"), enacted in 2001: 

• | prohibits banks from providing correspondent accounts directly to foreign shell banks;


• | imposes due diligence requirements on banks opening or holding accounts for foreign financial institutions or wealthy foreign individuals;


• | requires financial institutions to establish an anti-money-laundering ("AML") compliance program; and


• | generally eliminates civil liability for persons who file suspicious activity reports.

The USA Patriot Act also increases governmental powers to investigate terrorism, including expanded government access to account records. The Department of the Treasury is empowered to administer and make rules to implement the Act, which to some degree, affects our record-keeping and reporting expenses. Should the Bank's AML compliance program be deemed insufficient by federal regulators, we would not be able to grow through acquiring other institutions or opening de novo branches. 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 addresses public company corporate governance, auditing, accounting, executive compensation and enhanced and timely disclosure of corporate information. 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act represents significant federal involvement in matters traditionally left to state regulatory systems, such as the regulation of the accounting profession, and regulation of the relationship between a Board of Directors and management and between a Board of Directors and its committees. 
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act provides for, among other things: 

• | prohibition on personal loans by Umpqua to its directors and executive officers except loans made by the Bank in accordance with federal banking regulations;


• | independence requirements for Board audit committee members and our external auditor;

16


• | certification of reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") by the chief executive officer, chief financial officer and principal accounting officer;


• | disclosure of off-balance sheet transactions;


• | expedited reporting of stock transactions by insiders; and


• | increased criminal penalties for violations of securities laws.

The Sarbanes-Oxley Act also requires:

• | management to establish, maintain, and evaluate disclosure controls and procedures;


• | management to report on its annual assessment of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting;


• | our external auditor to attest to the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting.

The SEC has adopted regulations to implement various provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, including disclosures in periodic filings pursuant to the Exchange Act. Also, in response to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, NASDAQ adopted new standards for listed companies.
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. On July 21, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act was signed, which was a sweeping overhaul of financial industry regulation. Among other provisions, the Act:

• | Created a systemic-risk council of top regulators, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, whose purpose is to identify risks and respond to emerging threats to the financial stability of the U.S. arising from large, interconnected bank holding companies or nonbank financial companies;


• | Gave the FDIC authority to unwind large failing financial firms. Treasury would supply funds to cover the up-front costs of winding down the failed firm, but the government would have to put a "repayment plan" in place. Regulators will recoup any losses incurred from the wind-down afterwards by assessing fees on financial firms with more than $50 billion in assets;


• | Directed the FDIC to base deposit-insurance assessments on assets minus tangible capital instead of on domestic deposits and requires the FDIC to increase premium rates to raise the Deposit Insurance Fund's ("DIF") minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% by September 30, 2020. Banks, like Umpqua, with consolidated assets greater than $10 billion would pay the increased premiums;


• | Permanently increased FDIC deposit-insurance coverage to $250,000, retroactive to January 1, 2008. The act also eliminated the 1.5% cap on the DIF reserve ratio and automatic dividends when the ratio exceeds 1.35%. The FDIC also has discretion on whether to provide dividends to DIF members; 


• | Authorized banks to pay interest on business checking accounts;


• | Created the CFPB, housed under the Federal Reserve and led by a director appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. All existing consumer laws and regulations enforcement will be transferred to this agency and each existing regulatory agency will contribute their respective consumer regulatory and exam staffs to the CFPB; 


• | Gave the CFPB the authority to write consumer protection rules for banks and nonbank financial firms offering consumer financial services or products and to ensure that consumers are protected from "unfair, deceptive, or abusive" acts or practices. The CFPB also now has authority to examine and enforce regulations for banks with greater than $10 billion in assets;


• | Authorized the CFPB to require banks to compile and provide reports relating to its consumer lending, marketing and other consumer business activities and to make that information available to the public if doing so is "in the public interest";


• | Directed the Federal Reserve to set interchange fees for debit card transactions charged by banks with more than $10 billion in assets. The Federal Reserve must establish what it determines are reasonable fees by factoring in their transaction costs compared to those for checks; 

17


• | Requires loan originators to retain 5% of any loan sold and securitized, unless it is a "qualified residential mortgage", which includes standard 30 and 15 year fixed rate loans. It also specifically exempts from risk retention FHA, VA, Farmer Mac and Rural Housing Service loans; 


• | Adopted additional various mortgage lending and predatory lending provisions;


• | Required federal regulators jointly to prescribe regulations mandating that financial institutions with more than $1 billion in assets to disclose to their regulators their incentive compensation plans to permit the regulators to determine whether the plans provide executive officers, employees, directors or principal shareholders with excessive compensation, fees or benefits, or could lead to material financial loss to the institution;


• | Imposed a number of requirements related to executive compensation that apply to all public companies, such as prohibition of broker discretionary voting in connection with a shareholder vote on executive compensation; mandatory shareholder "say on pay" (every one to three years) and "say on golden parachutes"; and clawback of incentive compensation from current or former executive officers following any accounting restatement;


• | Established a modified version of the "Volcker Rule" and generally prohibits banks from engaging in proprietary trading or holding or obtaining an interest in a hedge fund or private equity fund, to the extent that it would exceed 3% of the bank's Tier 1 capital. A bank's interest in any single hedge fund or private equity fund may not exceed 3% of the assets of that fund.

Stress Testing and Capital Planning. Umpqua is subject to the annual Dodd-Frank Act capital stress testing (DFAST) requirements of the Federal Reserve and the FDIC.  As part of the DFAST process, Umpqua is required to submit the results of the company-run stress tests to the FDIC by July 31, and Umpqua will disclose certain results from stress testing exercises, generally in October of each year. 
CFPB Regulation and Supervision. As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB authority to examine Umpqua and Umpqua Bank for compliance with a broad range of federal consumer financial laws and regulations, including the laws and regulations that relate to credit card, deposit, mortgage and other consumer financial products and services the Bank offers. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act gives the CFPB broad authority to take corrective action against Umpqua and Umpqua Bank as it deems appropriate. The CFPB is authorized to issue regulations and take enforcement actions to prevent and remedy acts and practices relating to consumer financial products and services that it deems to be unfair, deceptive or abusive. The agency also has authority to impose new disclosure requirements for any consumer financial product or service. These authorities are in addition to the authority the CFPB assumed on July 21, 2011 under existing consumer financial law governing the provision of consumer financial products and services. The CFPB has concentrated much of its initial rulemaking efforts on a variety of mortgage related topics required under the Dodd-Frank Act, including ability-to-repay and qualified mortgage standards, mortgage servicing standards, loan originator compensation standards, high-cost mortgage requirements, appraisal and escrow standards and requirements for higher-priced mortgages.
In January 2014, new rules issued by the CFPB for mortgage origination and mortgage servicing became effective. The rules require lenders to conduct a reasonable and good faith determination at or before consummation of a residential mortgage loan that the borrower will have a reasonable ability to repay the loan. The regulations also define criteria for making Qualified Mortgages which entitle the lender and any assignee to either a conclusive or rebuttable presumption of compliance with the ability to repay rule. The new mortgage servicing rules include new standards for notices to consumers, loss mitigation procedures, and consumer requests for information. Both the origination and servicing rules create new private rights of action for consumers in the event of certain violations. In addition to the exercise of its rulemaking authority, the CFPB is continuing its ongoing examination and supervisory activities with respect to a number of consumer businesses and products.
18

October 2015, the CFPB's final rules on integrated mortgage disclosures under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act became effective. Throughout 2015, the CFPB continued its focus on fair lending practices of indirect automobile lenders. This focus led to some lenders to enter into consent orders with the CFPB and Department of Justice. Indirect automobile lenders have also received continued pressure from the CFPB to limit or eliminate discretionary pricing by dealers. Banking regulatory agencies have increasingly used their authority under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act to take supervisory or enforcement action with respect to unfair or deceptive acts or practices (UDAP) by banks under standards developed many years ago by the Federal Trade Commission in order to address practices that may not necessarily fall within the scope of a specific banking or consumer finance law. The Dodd-Frank Act also gave to the CFPB similar authority to take action in connection with unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices (UDAAP) by entities subject to CFPB supervisory or enforcement authority. Banks face considerable uncertainty as to the regulatory interpretation of "abusive" practices. Financial services companies face increased regulation and exposure under the new Military Lending Act (MLA) final rules issued by the Department of Defense that become effective for new loans entered into on and after October 3, 2016. The new rules dramatically expand the scope of coverage of the MLA and compliance with the new rules will affect operations of more financial services companies than under the previous rules. We continue to monitor, evaluate, and implement new regulations.
Joint Agency Guidance on Incentive Compensation. On June 21, 2010, federal banking regulators issued final joint agency guidance on Sound Incentive Compensation Policies. This guidance applies to executive and non-executive incentive compensation plans administered by banks. The guidance says that incentive compensation programs must:

• | Provide employees incentives that appropriately balance risk and reward.


• | Be compatible with effective controls and risk- management; and


• | Be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the board;

The Federal Reserve reviews, as part of the regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of the Company and other banking organizations. The findings of the supervisory initiatives are included in reports of examination and any deficiencies will be incorporated into the Company's supervisory ratings, which can affect the Company's ability to make acquisitions and take other actions.
