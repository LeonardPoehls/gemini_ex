ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
Computer Sciences Corporation is a next-generation global provider of information technology services and solutions. We help lead our clients through their digital transformations to meet new business demands and customer expectations in a market of escalating complexity, interconnectivity, mobility and opportunity. CSC was founded in 1959, incorporated in the state of Nevada and was listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CSC” prior to the Merger (as defined below).
CSC’s mission is to enable superior returns on our clients' technology investments through best-in-class vertical industry solutions, domain expertise, strategic partnerships with key technology leaders and global scale. We generally do not operate through exclusive agreements with hardware or software providers and believe this independence enables us to better identify and manage solutions specifically tailored to each client’s needs.
Current and prospective clients are changing how they purchase and consume IT services. Clients today are seeking greater operational agility from their IT services and want to benefit from the insights provided by mobility, social media and big data analytics. As they do so, they continue to seek cost efficiencies by migrating from traditional IT infrastructure to the cloud. We strive to be a trusted IT partner to our clients by addressing these requirements and providing next-generation IT services that include applications modernization, cloud infrastructure, cyber security and big data solutions.
Merger with HPES
DXC was formed by the spin-off of the Enterprise Services business of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Company on March 31, 2017 and merger of CSC with a wholly owned subsidiary of DXC on April 1, 2017 (the "Merger"). As a result of the Merger, CSC became a wholly owned subsidiary of DXC. DXC common stock began regular-way trading under the symbol “DXC” on the New York Stock Exchange on April 3, 2017. 
The strategic combination of the two complementary businesses created a leading independent, end-to-end IT services company, which is expected to have annual revenues of approximately $25 billion and nearly 6,000 public and private sector enterprise clients across 70 countries. DXC will focus on leading clients on their digital transformation journeys and helping clients thrive on significant business and market changes.
Acquisitions and Divestitures
During the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017 ("fiscal 2017"), we completed the acquisition of Xchanging plc ("Xchanging"), a provider of technology-enabled business solutions to organizations in global insurance and financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, real estate and the public sector, for total cash consideration of $492 million, net of cash acquired. The acquisition expanded our market coverage in the global insurance industry.

Segments and Services
Our reportable segments are Global Business Services ("GBS") and Global Infrastructure Services ("GIS"). Geographically, we have significant operations throughout North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. Segment and geographic information is included in Note 18 - "Segment and Geographic Information" to the consolidated financial statements. For a discussion of risks associated with our foreign operations, see Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors" of this Annual Report.
Global Business Services
GBS provides innovative technology solutions including digital applications and applications services and software, which address key business challenges within the customer’s industry. GBS strives to help clients understand and take advantage of industry trends of IT modernization and virtualization of the IT portfolio (hardware, software, networking, storage and computing assets). GBS has three primary focus areas: industry aligned next-generation software and solutions ("IS&S"); digital applications, our consulting and applications business, and big data services. Industry aligned next-generation software and solutions is centered on the insurance, banking, healthcare and life sciences industries, as well as manufacturing and other diversified industries. Activities are primarily related to vertical alignment of software solutions and process-based intellectual property that power mission-critical transaction engines, in addition to the provision of tailored business processing services. The digital applications business helps organizations innovate, transform and create sustainable competitive advantage through a combination of industry, business process, technology, systems integration and change management expertise, while optimizing and modernizing clients' business and technical environments, enabling clients to capitalize on emerging services such as cloud and mobility as well as big data within new commercial models including "as a Service." Key competitive differentiators for GBS include its global scale, solution objectivity, depth of industry expertise, strong partnerships, vendor and product independence and end-to-end solutions and capabilities. Changing business issues such as globalization, fast-developing economies, government regulation and growing concerns around risk, security and compliance drive demand for these GBS offerings. Contract awards are estimated at the time of contract signing based on then existing projections of service volumes and currency exchange rates and include approved option years. During fiscal 2017, GBS had contract awards of $4.9 billion compared to $4.3 billion in the fiscal year ended April 1, 2016 ("fiscal 2016").
Global Infrastructure Services
GIS provides managed and virtual desktop solutions, unified communications and collaboration services, data center management, cyber security, computed and managed storage solutions to commercial clients globally. GIS also delivers CSC's next-generation cloud offerings, including Infrastructure as a Service ("IaaS"), private cloud solutions and Storage as a Service. GIS provides a portfolio of standard offerings that have predictable outcomes and measurable results while reducing business risk and operational costs for clients. To provide clients with differentiated offerings, GIS maintains a select number of key alliance partners to make investments in developing unique offerings and go-to-market strategies. This collaboration helps us determine the best technology, develop road maps and enhance opportunities to differentiate solutions, expand market reach, augment capabilities and jointly deliver impactful solutions. During fiscal 2017, GIS had contract awards of $3.7 billion compared to $4.3 billion during fiscal 2016.
Our revenues mix by line of business was as follows: 

 | Fiscal Years Ended
 | March 31, 2017 | | April 1, 2016 | | April 3, 2015
Global Business Services | 55 | % | | 51 | % | 50 | %
Global Infrastructure Services | 45 | | | 49 | | 50 | 
Total Revenues | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Trademarks and Service Marks
We own or have rights to various trademarks, logos, service marks and trade names that are used in the operation of our business. We also own or have the rights to copyrights that protect the content of our products.

Competition
The IT and professional services markets in which we compete are not dominated by a single company or a small number of companies. A substantial number of companies offer services that overlap and are competitive with those we offer. In addition, the increased importance of offshore labor centers has brought several foreign-based firms into competition with us. Offshore IT outsourcers selling directly to end-users have captured an increasing share of the market as they compete directly with U.S. domestic suppliers of these services. We continue to increase resources in offshore locations to mitigate this market development.
More recently, the accelerating demand for multi-tenant infrastructure services, commonly referred to as cloud computing offerings, is continuing to alter the landscape of competition. New entrants to our markets are offering service models that change the decision criteria and contracting expectations of our target customers. Major competitors in this area include large and well-funded technology companies that are increasingly using social, mobile, analytics and cloud technologies to create agile new business models. Smaller and more nimble companies also continue to enter and disrupt markets with innovations in cloud computing and other areas which could emerge as significant competitors to us.
We have responded to these changing market conditions with new capabilities, partnerships and offerings that are intended to position us favorably in high-growth markets for next-generation IT services and solutions. For example, our acquisition of UXC in fiscal 2016 strengthened our next-generation delivery model. We also expanded our range of cloud-based service-management solutions through our acquisition of Fruition and Aspediens, and strategic investments in Virtual Clarity and eBecs. Our strategic partnerships with AT&T and HCL Technologies similarly enable expanded cloud, applications modernization and other next-generation technology services.
Our ability to obtain new business and retain existing business is dependent upon our ability to offer improved strategic frameworks and technical solutions, better value, quicker responses, increased flexibility, superior quality, a higher level of experience, or a combination of these factors. Management believes that our lines of business are positioned to compete effectively in the GBS and GIS markets based on our technology and systems expertise and large project management skills. Management believes that our competitive position is enhanced by the full spectrum of IT and professional services we provide including consulting, software and systems design, implementation and integration, IT and business process outsourcing and technical services delivered to a broad commercial customer base.
Employees
We have offices worldwide and as of March 31, 2017, had approximately 60,000 employees in more than 50 countries. The services we provide require proficiency in many fields, comprising but not limited to computer sciences, programming, telecommunications networks, mathematics, physics, engineering, operations research, finance, economics, statistics and business administration.
