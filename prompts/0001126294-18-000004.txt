Item 1 — Business (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic)
General
The Registrants are wholesale power generation subsidiaries of NRG, which is a competitive power company that produces, sells and delivers electricity and related services, primarily in major competitive power markets in the U.S. GenOn is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of NRG. GenOn was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on August 9, 2000, under the name Reliant Energy Unregco, Inc. GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic are indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of GenOn. GenOn Americas Generation was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on November 1, 2001, under the name Mirant Americas Generation, LLC. GenOn Mid-Atlantic was formed as a Delaware limited liability company on July 12, 2000, under the name Southern Energy Mid-Atlantic, LLC. GenOn Mid-Atlantic is a wholly-owned subsidiary of NRG North America and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of GenOn Americas Generation. The Registrants are engaged in the ownership and operation of power generation facilities; the trading of energy, capacity and related products; and the transacting in and trading of fuel and transportation services.
The Registrants’ generation facilities are located in the U.S. and comprise generation facilities across the merit order. The sale of capacity and power from baseload and intermediate generation facilities accounts for a majority of the Registrants’ generation revenues. In addition, the Registrants’ generation portfolio provides each Registrant with opportunities to capture additional revenues by selling power during periods of peak demand, offering capacity or similar products, and providing ancillary services to support system reliability.
The following table summarizes the generation portfolio as of December 31, 2017, by Registrant: 

 | (In MW)(a)
Generation Type | GenOn | GenOn Americas Generation | | GenOn Mid-Atlantic
Natural gas(b)(c)(d)(e) | 9,348 | | 3,011 | | | 1,864
Coal | 4,199 | | 2,433 | | | 2,433
Oil | 1,847 | | 1,434 | | | 308 
Total generation capacity | 15,394 | | 6,878 | | 4,605


(a) | MW figures provided represent nominal summer net MW capacity of power generated as adjusted for the Registrants' owned or leased interest excluding capacity from inactive/mothballed units. MW for GenOn Americas Generation are included within GenOn and MW for GenOn Mid-Atlantic are included within GenOn Americas Generation.


(b) | GenOn's natural gas generation portfolio excludes 1,029 MW related to Pittsburg generation station, a natural gas-fired facility located in California, which was deactivated by GenOn Americas Generation on January 1, 2017, as a result of notification received during 2016 that its bid for a resource adequacy contract for 2017 with Pacific Gas & Electric was not accepted.


(c) | GenOn's natural gas generation portfolio includes 275 MW related to Choctaw Unit 1 which was in forced outage but returned to service on November 30, 2017.


(d) | On February 28, 2018, GenOn notified the CPUC and CAISO of its intent to retire Etiwanda by June 1, 2018, Ormond Beach by October 1, 2018 and Ellwood by January 1, 2019, collectively 2,210 MW.


(e) | GenOn retired Mandalay in February 2018, representing 560 MW.

GenOn Chapter 11 Cases
On the Petition Date, the GenOn Entities filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, or the Chapter 11 Cases. GenOn Mid-Atlantic, as well as its consolidated subsidiaries, REMA, and certain other subsidiaries, did not file for relief under Chapter 11.
The GenOn Entities remain in possession of their property and continue their business operations in the ordinary course uninterrupted as "debtors-in-possession" under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and orders of the Bankruptcy Court. See Item 15 — Note 3, Chapter 11 Cases for more information on the Chapter 11 Cases.
On June 29, 2017, the GenOn Entities filed the Plan and the Disclosure Statement with the Bankruptcy Court consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement. On September 18, 2017 and October 2, 2017, the GenOn Entities filed amendments to the Plan and the Disclosure Statement, which primarily provided the GenOn Entities with the flexibility to complete sales of certain assets pursuant to the Plan, as amended, and removed the GenOn Entities' requirement to conduct a rights offering in connection with the GenOn Entities' exit financing. On or about October 6, 2017, the Debtors commenced solicitation of the Plan.
6

On October 31, 2017, the GenOn Entities announced that they entered into a Consent Agreement with certain holders of GenOn’s Senior Notes and GenOn Americas Generation's Senior Notes, collectively, the Consenting Holders, whereby the GenOn Entities and the Consenting Holders agreed to extend the milestones in the Restructuring Support Agreement, by which the Plan must become effective, or the Effective Date. Specifically, the Consent Agreement extends the Effective Date milestone to June 30, 2018 or September 30, 2018, if regulatory approvals are still pending, or the Extended Effective Dates.
On December 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan, and effective December 12, 2017, GenOn and NRG entered into agreements concerning (i) timeline and transition, (ii) cooperation and co-development matters, (iii) post-employment and retiree health and welfare benefits and pension benefits, (iv) tax matters, and (v) intercompany balances and releases, consistent with the Restructuring Support Agreement, which among other things, provide for the transition of GenOn to a standalone enterprise, the resolution of substantial intercompany claims between GenOn and NRG, and the allocation of certain costs and liabilities between GenOn and NRG. On December 12, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court also entered an order giving effect to the Consent Agreement.
The Bankruptcy Court order confirming the Plan also approved the settlement terms agreed to among the GenOn Entities, NRG, the Consenting Holders, GenOn Mid-Atlantic, and certain of GenOn Mid-Atlantic’s stakeholders, or the GenMA Settlement, and directed the settlement parties to cooperate in good faith to negotiate definitive documentation consistent with the GenMA Settlement term sheet in order to pursue consummation of the GenMA Settlement. The GenMA Settlement remains subject to definitive documentation.
Certain terms of the compromise as reached by the GenMA Settlement parties are as follows, as qualified by the full settlement framework on file with the Bankruptcy Court:

• | settlement of all pending litigation and objections to the Plan (including with respect to releases and feasibility);


• | GenOn will provide a $55.0 million one-year 15% senior secured bridge facility;


• | cash redemption or purchase of certain outstanding lessor notes/pass-through certificates, funded by (i) GenOn Mid-Atlantic cash on hand; (ii) proceeds from a J.P. Morgan letter of credit draw; (iii) the $55.0 million bridge facility provided by GenOn; (iv) a $20.0 million cash contribution by GenOn; and (v) proceeds from the Natixis letter of credit facility;


• | the option to defer certain equity rent and shared services to support GenOn Mid-Atlantic’s liquidity;


• | GenOn and NRG will provide $57.5 million of new qualifying credit support to GenOn Mid-Atlantic, consisting of:


• | $20.0 million cash contribution by GenOn; and


• | $37.5 million in letters of credit from NRG.


• | GenOn will retain $125.0 million from the pre-petition transfer from GenOn Mid-Atlantic and all proceeds of NRG’s settlement payment of approximately $261.3 million to GenOn to fully settle the disputes existing between such parties and their respective affiliates (subject to setoff of approximately $125.0 million in NRG claims against GenOn under the parties’ Intercompany Revolver), or the NRG Settlement Payment;


• | debt and lien covenants will permit a secured working capital facility in an amount not to exceed $75.0 million, which GenOn Mid-Atlantic will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain; and


• | GenOn Mid-Atlantic will have one independent director appointed by the Owner Lessor Plaintiffs (as defined in the Plan).

The terms of the GenMA Settlement are subject to further negotiations between the parties and the consummation of the GenMA Settlement on any terms is subject to certain conditions and may not be consummated on the terms as currently contemplated or at all. To the extent the GenMA Settlement is not consummated, GenOn Mid-Atlantic will retain the right to opt out of the releases given to each other releasing party prior to the Effective Date.
Liquidity and Ability to Continue as a Going Concern
As described above, GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation submitted the Plan in connection with the Chapter 11 Cases and the Bankruptcy Court entered an order confirming the Plan. There is no assurance that all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the Plan will be satisfied. GenOn's and GenOn Americas Generation’s ability to continue as going concerns is dependent on many factors, including the consummation of the Plan in a timely manner, and GenOn's and GenOn Americas Generation's ability to achieve profitability following emergence from bankruptcy. Given the uncertainty as to the outcome of these factors, there is substantial doubt about GenOn's and GenOn Americas Generation's ability to continue as going concerns. 
With respect to GenOn Mid-Atlantic, a consolidated subsidiary of GenOn, management has determined that while it has sufficient cash on hand to fund current obligations including operating lease payments due under the GenOn Mid-Atlantic operating leases as of December 31, 2017, the potential significant adverse impact of financial stresses at GenOn Mid-Atlantic's parent companies and, to a lesser extent, any adverse impact resulting from the notification by GenOn Mid-Atlantic's lessors alleging the existence of certain lease events of default as further described in Item 15 — Note 10, Debt and Capital Leases has caused there to be substantial doubt about GenOn Mid-Atlantic's ability to continue as a going concern.
7

Seasonality and Price Volatility
Annual and quarterly operating results of the Registrants' wholesale power generation segments can be significantly affected by weather and energy commodity price volatility. Significant other events, such as the demand for natural gas, interruptions in fuel supply infrastructure and relative levels of hydroelectric capacity, can increase seasonal fuel and power price volatility. The preceding factors related to seasonality and price volatility are fairly uniform across the Registrants' wholesale generation business.
Significant Events
GenOn Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Filing 

• | On the Petition Date, the GenOn Entities filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court, as discussed in more detail including related matters in Item 15 — Note 1, Nature of Business, Note 3, Chapter 11 Cases, and Note 14, Related Party Transactions. 

Tax Act

• | As of December 31, 2017, as a result of the Tax Act, GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic reduced their deferred tax assets by $766 million, $314 million and $266 million, respectively. The impact of the reduction in deferred tax assets is fully offset by valuation allowances for corresponding amounts, resulting in no net impact to the tax expense for 2017. While the Registrants have not yet completed their assessment of the effects of the Tax Act, reasonable estimates for the impact of the items specified above were able to be determined. 

Impairments and Asset Sales

• | During 2017, GenOn recorded impairment losses of $274 million related to various facilities, which included $220 million within both GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic. The impairment losses are discussed in more detail in Item 15 —Note 9, Impairments.


• | On February 22, 2018, subsidiaries of GenOn entered into an agreement to sell the Hunterstown generation station, an 810 MW natural gas facility in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, for cash consideration of $498 million, subject to working capital adjustments which are expected to be approximately $22 million. The transaction is expected to close in the second quarter of 2018 and is subject to various customary closing conditions, approvals and consents.


• | On March 22, 2018, subsidiaries of GenOn entered into an agreement to sell the Canal Units 1 and 2 electricity generating facilities with a combined 1,112 MW capacity in Sandwich, Massachusetts, for cash consideration of $320 million. The closing purchase price is subject to working capital adjustments (including a downward adjustment for distributions or dividends made after June 30, 2018) and upward adjustment of $13.5 million if a concurrent transaction for the sale of the Canal 3 project does not close between those parties due to a debt financing failure. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2018 and is subject to various customary closing conditions, approvals and consents.

In December 2017, GenOn made a one-time payment to NRG of $15 million as compensation for being granted a purchase option and a rejection option with respect to the Canal 3 project. NRG is expected to reimburse GenOn $13.5 million when and if NRG closes the agreed upon sale of the Canal 3 project to an affiliate of the third party purchaser in the Canal Units 1 and 2 transaction. On March 22, 2018, an affiliate of the Canal Units 1 and 2 purchaser entered into an agreement to purchase Canal 3 directly from an affiliate of NRG. GenOn elected to allow the rejection option to expire unexercised and has agreed to not exercise the purchase option.
Financing Activities 

• | On February 1, 2018, pursuant to the confirmation of the Plan, the GenOn Entities elected to make a partial payment in the amount of $300 million, consisting of $158 million and $142 million to be applied to the outstanding balance of the GenOn Americas Generation Senior Notes due 2021 and 2031, respectively.

Operational Matters
GenOn Americas Generation deactivated the Pittsburg generation station, a 1,029 MW natural gas-fired facility located in California, on January 1, 2017.
8

GenOn, through its subsidiary, NRG California South LP, owns and operates the Mandalay generation station, Units 1, 2 and 3 (“Mandalay”) located in Oxnard, California. On October 19, 2017, NRG California South LP provided notice to the CPUC and the CAISO of its intent to shut down and retire Mandalay by December 31, 2017. Mandalay was retired in February 2018.
On February 28, 2018, GenOn, through its subsidiary, NRG California South LP, provided additional notices to the CPUC and the CAISO of its intent to shut down and retire the Etiwanda generation station by June 1, 2018, the Ormond Beach generation station by October 1, 2018, and the Ellwood generation station by January 1, 2019.
Competition
Wholesale power generation is a capital-intensive and commodity-driven business with numerous industry participants that compete on the basis of the location of their plants, fuel mix, plant efficiency and the reliability of the services offered. The Registrants compete on the basis of the location of their plants and ownership of portfolios of plants in various regions, which increases the stability and reliability of their energy revenues. Wholesale power generation is a regional business that is currently highly fragmented and diverse in terms of industry structure. As such, there is a wide variation in terms of the capabilities, resources, nature and identity of the companies the Registrants compete with depending on the market. Competitors include regulated utilities, municipalities, cooperatives and other independent power producers, and power marketers or trading companies, including those owned by financial institutions.
Competitive Strengths 
The Registrants’ power generation assets are diversified by fuel-type, dispatch level and region, which helps mitigate the risks associated with fuel price volatility and market demand cycles. The Registrants' baseload and intermediate facilities provide each with a significant source of cash flow, while the peaking facilities provide the Registrants with opportunities to capture significant upside potential that can arise from time to time during periods of high demand.
Many of the Registrants’ generation assets are located within densely populated areas, which tend to have higher wholesale pricing as a result of relatively favorable local supply-demand balance. The Registrants have generation assets located in or near major metropolitan areas. These facilities, some of which are aging, are often ideally situated for repowering or the addition of new capacity because their location and existing infrastructure provide significant advantages over undeveloped sites.
Regulatory Matters 
As owners of power plants and participants in wholesale energy markets, certain of the Registrants' subsidiaries are subject to regulation by various federal and state government agencies. These include the CFTC and FERC, as well as other public utility commissions in certain states where the Registrants' generating assets are located. In addition, the Registrants are subject to the market rules, procedures and protocols of the various ISO markets in which they participate. The Registrants must also comply with the mandatory reliability requirements imposed by NERC and the regional reliability entities in the regions where they operate.
PJM (GenOn, GenOn Americas Generation and GenOn Mid-Atlantic)
Minimum Offer Price Rule Exemption Appeal — On July 7, 2017, the D.C. Circuit vacated a FERC order from 2013 related to an exemption to the Minimum Offer Price Rule, or MOPR, and remanded the issue back to FERC. On October 23, 2017, PJM re-filed its initial 2012 MOPR. On December 8, 2017, FERC rejected PJM's filing and directed PJM to submit a compliance filing reinstating the MOPR in effect prior to PJM's December 2012 filing. PJM submitted a compliance filing modifying certain PJM tariff sections, retaining the unit-specific exception, which FERC has accepted.
2020/2021 PJM Auction Results — On May 23, 2017, PJM announced the results of its 2020/2021 base residual auction. 
9

The tables below provide a detailed description of the Registrants' base residual auction results:
GenOn:

 | Capacity Performance Product
Zone | Cleared Capacity (MW) | Price ($/MW-day) | | Expected capacity revenues
EMAAC | 496 | $ | 187.87 | | 
MAAC | 6,040 | 86.04 | | | 
RTO | 537 | 76.53 | | | 
Total | 7,073 | | | $ | 239

GenOn Americas Generation & GenOn Mid-Atlantic:

 | Capacity Performance Product
Zone | Cleared Capacity (MW) | Price ($/MW-day) | | Expected capacity revenues
MAAC (1) | 3,824 | $ | 86.04 | | 
Total | 3,824 | | | $ | 120

(1) Plants that participate in the PJM auctions for GenOn Americas Generation are solely those operated by GenOn Mid-Atlantic.
Complaints Related to Extension of Base Capacity — In 2015, FERC approved changes to PJM's capacity market, which included moving from the Base Capacity product to the higher performance Capacity Performance product over the course of a five year transition. Under this transition, as of the May 2017 BRA, the Base Capacity product will no longer be available. Several parties have filed complaints at FERC seeking to maintain the RPM Base Capacity product for at least one more delivery year or until such time as PJM develops a model for seasonal resources to participate. If the transition is delayed, capacity prices could be materially impacted. The matters are pending at FERC.  
Complaints Regarding Pseudo-Ties for Capacity — On April 6, 2017, Potomac Economics, the market monitor for MISO and NYISO, filed a complaint against PJM regarding the participation of external capacity resources in PJM's auction. Currently, external resources must enter into a pseudo-tie agreement in order to sell capacity into PJM. The complaint alleges that the pseudo-tie requirements is causing market inefficiencies in PJM, New York and MISO and suggests a new protocol for incorporating external resources into PJM’s markets. In addition, other market participants have filed separate complaints at FERC against MISO or PJM, respectively, for issues resulting from pseudo-tied generators. The complainants argue that the generation owners with pseudo-ties from MISO to PJM are receiving double-charges for congestion. The outcome could impact the PJM, NYISO and MISO capacity markets. 
New England (GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation)
2021/2022 ISO-NE Auction Results — On February 6, 2018, ISO-NE announced the results of its 2021/2022 forward capacity auction.  GenOn cleared 1,135 MW at $4.631 kW-month providing expected annualized capacity revenues of $63 million.
Peak Energy Rent Adjustment Complaint — On September 30, 2016, the New England Power Generators Association, or NEPGA, filed a complaint against ISO-NE asking FERC to find the Peak Energy Rent, or PER, unjust and unreasonable. The PER adjustment reduces capacity payments on days where energy prices exceed a pre-defined level, known as the "PER strike price." On January 9, 2017, FERC granted NEPGA’s complaint requiring a change to the methodology used to calculate the PER strike price. FERC also directed the parties to determine any refunds for PER paid between September 30, 2016 and May 31, 2018. On July 26, 2017, NEPGA filed settlement documents at FERC, which the Registrants did not oppose. On February 20, 2018, FERC accepted the settlement and directed ISO-NE to submit a compliance filing consistent with the terms of the settlement.
10

New York (GenOn and GenOn Americas Generation)
Independent Power Producers of New York (IPPNY) Complaint — On January 9, 2017, EPSA requested FERC to promptly direct the NYISO to file tariff provisions to address pending market concerns related to out-of-market payments to existing generation in the NYISO. This request was prompted by the ZEC program initiated by the NYSPSC. This request follows IPPNY’s complaint at FERC against the NYISO on May 10, 2013, as amended on March 25, 2014. The generators asked FERC to direct the NYISO to require that capacity from existing generation resources that would have exited the market but for out-of-market payments. Failure to implement buyer-side mitigation measures could result in uneconomic entry, which artificially decreases capacity prices below competitive market levels.
MISO (GenOn)
Revisions to MISO Capacity Construct — On February 28, 2018, FERC issued two orders on MISO’s capacity market design, which together, re-affirm MISO’s existing capacity market structure. FERC also held that, even though there was a period of time between where MISO’s capacity market structure may not have just and reasonable, that FERC exercised its remedial authority not to rerun past auctions. The Registrants have 30 days to seek an administrative rehearing with FERC. The eventual outcome of this proceeding will affect capacity prices in MISO and the incentive for generators in MISO to sell capacity into neighboring markets.
General
State Out-Of-Market Subsidy Proposals — Certain states including Connecticut, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania have considered but have not enacted proposals to provide out-of-market subsidy payments to potentially uneconomic nuclear and fossil generating units.  The Registrants have opposed those efforts to provide out of market subsidies, and intend to continue opposing them in the future.
Environmental Matters
The Registrants are subject to a wide range of environmental laws in the development, construction, ownership and operation of projects. These laws generally require that governmental permits and approvals be obtained before construction and maintained during operation of power plants. Requirements regarding GHGs, combustion byproducts, water discharge and use, and threatened and endangered species have been put in place in recent years. However, under the current U.S. presidential administration some of these rules are being reconsidered and reviewed. Future laws may require the addition of emissions controls or other environmental controls or impose restrictions on the operations of the Registrants' facilities, which could have a material effect on the Registrants' operations. Complying with environmental laws involves significant capital and operating expenses. The Registrants decide to invest capital for environmental controls based on the relative certainty of the requirements, an evaluation of compliance options, and the expected economic returns on capital. 
A number of regulations with the potential to affect the Registrants and their facilities have been recently promulgated by the EPA but are being reconsidered, including ESPS/NSPS for GHGs, NAAQS revisions and implementation, and effluent guidelines. The Registrants are evaluating the potential outcomes and any resulting impacts of recently promulgated regulations that the EPA is now reconsidering and cannot fully predict such impacts until administrative reconsiderations and legal challenges are resolved. Federal and state environmental laws generally have become more stringent over time, although this trend could slow or pause in the near term with respect to federal laws under the current U.S. presidential administration.
Ozone NAAQS — On October 26, 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule that reduces the ozone NAAQS to 0.070 ppm. Challenges to this rule have been stayed at the request of the EPA so that it can evaluate the rule. If the rule is not altered by the EPA and survives legal challenges, this more stringent NAAQS will obligate the states to develop plans to reduce NOx (an ozone precursor), which could affect some of the Registrants' units.
11

Cross-State Air Pollution Rule — The EPA finalized CSAPR in 2011, which was intended to replace CAIR in January 2012, to address certain states' obligations to reduce emissions so that downwind states can achieve federal air quality standards. In December 2011, the D.C. Circuit stayed the implementation of CSAPR and then vacated CSAPR in August 2012 but kept CAIR in place until the EPA could replace it. In April 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed and remanded the D.C. Circuit's decision. In October 2014, the D.C. Circuit lifted the stay of CSAPR. In response, the EPA in November 2014 amended the CSAPR compliance dates. Accordingly, CSAPR replaced CAIR on January 1, 2015. On July 28, 2015, the D.C. Circuit held that the EPA had exceeded its authority by requiring certain reductions that were not necessary for downwind states to achieve federal standards. Although the D.C. Circuit kept the rule in place, the court ordered the EPA to revise the Phase 2 (or 2017) (i) SO2 budgets for four states and (ii) ozone-season NOx budgets for 11 states including Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. On October 26, 2016, the EPA finalized the CSAPR Update Rule, which reduces future NOx allocations and discounts the current banked allowances to account for the more stringent 2008 Ozone NAAQS and to address the D.C. Circuit's July 2015 decision. This rule has been challenged in the D.C. Circuit. The Registrants believe that their investment in pollution controls and cleaner technologies leave the fleet well-positioned for compliance.
Clean Power Plan — The attention in recent years on GHG emissions has resulted in federal regulations and state legislative and regulatory action. In October 2015, the EPA finalized the Clean Power Plan, or CPP, addressing GHG emissions from existing EGUs. On February 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the CPP. The D.C. Circuit, sitting en banc, heard oral argument on the legal challenges to the CPP in September 2016. At the EPA's request, the D.C. Circuit agreed on April 28, 2017 to hold the case in abeyance. On October 16, 2017, the EPA proposed a rule to repeal the CPP. Accordingly, the CPP is not likely to survive.
Effluent Limitations Guidelines — In November 2015, the EPA revised the Effluent Limitations Guidelines for Steam Electric Generating Facilities, which will impose more stringent requirements (as individual permits are renewed) for wastewater streams from flue gas desulfurization, or FGD, fly ash, bottom ash, and flue gas mercury control. In April 2017, the EPA granted two petitions to reconsider the rule and also administratively stayed some of the deadlines. On September 18, 2017, the EPA promulgated a final rule that (i) postpones the compliance dates to preserve the status quo for FGD wastewater and bottom ash transport water by two years to November 2020 until the EPA completes its next rulemaking and (ii) withdrew the April 2017 administrative stay. The legal challenges have been suspended while the EPA reconsiders and likely modifies the rule. Accordingly, the Registrants have largely eliminated its estimate of the environmental capital expenditures that would have been required to comply with permits incorporating the revised guidelines. The Registrants will revisit these estimates after the rule is revised.
See Item 15 — Note 16, Regulatory Matters, Note 17, Environmental Matters, and Note 18, Guarantees, to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Regional Environmental Issues
RGGI — The Registrants operate generating units in Maryland, Massachusetts and New York that are subject to RGGI, which is a regional cap and trade system. In 2013, each of these states finalized a rule that reduced and will continue to reduce the number of allowances through 2020.  The nine RGGI states re-evaluated the program and published a model rule to further reduce the number of allowances. The revisions being currently contemplated could adversely impact the Registrants' results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Other states (e.g., New Jersey) may join or rejoin RGGI. This action could adversely impact generating assets in the subject state(s) and may affect the RGGI budgets and the likelihood that more states may join the program.
Massachusetts Global Warming Solutions Act Proposed Regulation — In May 2016, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court held that Massachusetts DEP had not complied with the 2008 Global Warming Solutions Act, which requires establishing limits for sources of GHGs. The Court held that participation in RGGI was not sufficient. In August 2017, the Massachusetts DEP finalized a regulation that, if it survives legal challenges, would limit GHG emissions, and may limit operations, from electric generating facilities located in Massachusetts.  On September 11, 2017, the New England trade association and GenOn filed a complaint in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Superior Court of Suffolk County. On January 31, 2018, the court transferred the case to the Supreme Judicial Court for Suffolk County. Briefing is underway.
Employees
As of December 31, 2017, GenOn had 1,339 employees of which 506 employees were part of GenOn Americas Generation and 401 employees were part of GenOn Mid-Atlantic, approximately 65.7%, 66.2% and 69.1%, respectively, of whom were covered by bargaining agreements. During 2017, the Registrants did not experience any labor stoppages or labor disputes at any of their facilities.
