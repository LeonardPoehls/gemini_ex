Item 1. Business
Overview
We are an autologous cell and gene therapy company focused on translating personalized biologics into medical breakthroughs for diseases affecting the skin and connective tissue. Our distinctive approach to personalized biologics is based on our proprietary autologous fibroblast technology. Fibroblasts are the most common cell in skin and connective tissue and are responsible for synthesizing extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen and other growth factors, that provide structure and support. Because fibroblasts naturally reside in the localized environment of the skin and connective tissue, they represent an ideal delivery vehicle for proteins targeted to these areas. We target the underlying cause of disease by using fibroblast cells from a patient’s skin and genetically modifying them to create localized therapies that are compatible with the unique biology of the patient (i.e., which are autologous).
We are focused on discovering and developing localized therapies for diseases affecting the skin and connective tissue, where there are high unmet needs, to improve the lives of patients and their families. In that regard, we commit significant resources to our research and development programs. Currently, all of our research and development operations and focus are on gaining regulatory approvals to commercialize our product candidates in the United States; however, we may seek to expand into international markets in the future.
Our current pipeline consists of the following product candidates which we are developing in collaboration with Intrexon Corporation (Intrexon):

Our most advanced product candidate, FCX-007, has entered the Phase 2 portion of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for the treatment of recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). Our second gene therapy product candidate, FCX-013, is in development for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma. We submitted an investigational new drug (IND) application for FCX-013 to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in January 2018 and in March 2018, the FDA allowed the IND to progress to clinical trials. We expect to initiate enrollment for an open label, single arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial in third quarter of 2018. In addition, we have a third program in the research phase for the treatment of arthritis and related conditions. See further discussion of our gene therapy product candidates under the heading “Development Programs” included within section “Item 1—Business” of this Form 10-K.

Our Strategy
Our strategy is to develop and commercialize transformational therapies for diseases affecting the skin and connective tissue to improve the lives of patients and their families. Key elements of our strategy are:

• | Leveraging our proprietary autologous fibroblast technology and patented manufacturing process;


• | Advancing our clinical stage gene therapy product candidate, FCX-007, through human clinical trials;


• | Advancing our gene therapy product candidate, FCX-013, into and through human clinical trials;


• | Advancing our research stage gene therapy program focused on arthritis and related conditions through research and into pre-clinical development; and


• | Leveraging our FDA-compliant current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacturing facility and our expertise in cell therapy manufacturing to advance the development of our autologous cell and gene therapy pipeline.

Our Platform
Our proprietary autologous fibroblast technology is the foundation for creating personalized biologics for diseases of the skin and connective tissue. This technology uses a patented manufacturing process, which involves collecting small skin biopsies from patients, isolating cells and expanding them in culture, transducing the fibroblast cells with an integrative lentiviral vector to express a targeted protein, followed by continued expansion of the gene modified cells in culture. In this manner, each patient is treated with cells that were cultivated from his or her own dermal tissue (i.e., autologous).
The Science of Autologous Fibroblasts 
Fibroblasts are the basis of our personalized biologics platform because they are the most common cell in skin and connective tissue and are responsible for synthesizing extracellular matrix proteins, including collagen and other growth factors, that provide structure and support. 
Personalized Biologics Approach

Because fibroblasts naturally reside in the localized environment of the skin and connective tissue, they represent an ideal delivery vehicle for proteins targeted to these areas. Utilizing our autologous fibroblast technology, we use a patient’s fibroblast cells to create localized gene therapies that are compatible with the unique biology of the patient and have the potential to address the underlying cause of disease.

We believe our personalized biologics approach provides the following distinct advantages for creating gene therapies:

• | Localized administration—avoids side effects typically associated with systemic therapy


• | Reduced rejection and immunogenicity concerns—because autologous fibroblasts are compatible with the unique biology of each patient


• | Fibroblast cells are genetically modified ex vivo—to enable testing for safety and confirmation of protein expression levels prior to administration to the patient


• | Demonstrated expertise in manufacturing our fibroblast cell therapy



We are developing all of our gene therapy product candidates in collaboration with Intrexon, a leader in synthetic biology. Through our collaboration with Intrexon, we have access to:

• | Intrexon’s proprietary vector technology, which is designed to facilitate the assembly and delivery of the necessary target gene constructs for delivery to autologous fibroblast cells. Access to this technology allows us to rapidly screen and construct genetic therapeutic solutions. 


• | Intrexon’s proprietary RheoSwitch Therapeutic System® (RTS®) technology. The RTS® biologic switch is activated by an orally-administered compound (veledimex) to control level and timing of protein expression in those diseases where such control is ideal.

Development Programs
Our development programs are focused on diseases affecting the skin and connective tissue for which there are high unmet needs. Our programs consist of the following:

Program | Potential Indication | Status 
FCX-007 | RDEB | Phase 1/2
FCX-013 | Moderate to severe localized scleroderma | Post-IND 
Research Program | Arthritis | Research 

FCX-007 for Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (RDEB) 
RDEB is the most severe form of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), a congenital, progressive, devastatingly painful and debilitating genetic disorder that often leads to death. RDEB is caused by a mutation of the COL7A1 gene, the gene which encodes for type VII collagen (COL7), a protein that forms anchoring fibrils. Anchoring fibrils hold together the layers of skin, and without them, skin layers separate causing severe blistering, open wounds and scarring in response to friction, including normal daily activities like rubbing or scratching. Children who inherit this condition are often called “butterfly children” because their skin can be as fragile as a butterfly’s wings. We estimate that there are approximately 1,100 - 2,500 RDEB patients in the U.S. Currently, treatments for RDEB address only the sequelae, including daily bandaging (which can cost a patient in excess of $10,000 per month), hydrogel dressings, antibiotics, feeding tubes and surgeries.
Our lead product candidate, FCX-007, is in clinical development for the treatment of RDEB. FCX-007 is a genetically-modified autologous fibroblast that encodes the gene for COL7 for localized treatment of RDEB and is being developed in collaboration with Intrexon. By genetically modifying autologous fibroblasts ex vivo to produce COL7, culturing them and then treating blisters and wounds locally via injection, FCX-007 offers the potential to address the underlying cause of the disease by providing high levels of COL7 directly to the affected areas, thereby avoiding systemic treatment. In addition, we believe the autologous nature of the cells, localized delivery, use of an integrative vector and the low turnover rate of the protein will contribute to long-term persistence of the COL7 produced by FCX-007.
FCX-007 has received Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of DEB, including RDEB, Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for the treatment of RDEB and fast track designation for the treatment of RDEB from the FDA.
Phase 1/2 Trial of FCX-007 for RDEB
The primary objective of this open-label trial is to evaluate the safety of FCX-007 in RDEB patients. Additionally, the trial will assess (i) the pharmacology of FCX-007 through the presence of vector DNA or COL7 mRNA evaluation of COL7 expression and/or the presence of anchoring fibrils and (ii) the efficacy of FCX-007 through intra-subject paired analysis of target wound areas by comparing FCX-007 treated wounds to untreated wounds in Phase 1 and to wounds administered with sterile saline in Phase 2 through the evaluation of digital imaging of wounds. Prior to treating pediatric patients in this trial, we were required to and obtained allowance from the FDA by submitting evidence of FCX-007 safety and benefit in the adult 
6

patients and data from our completed pre-clinical toxicology study. After submission of the requested data, the FDA granted allowance to include pediatric patients in the clinical trial in January 2018.
Four patients are enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the clinical trial and continue to progress through follow-up study visits. In September 2017, we reported interim results from the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of FCX-007. Three adult NC1+ patients were dosed with a single intradermal injection session of FCX-007 in the margins of and across targeted wounds, as well as in separate intact skin sites. Five wounds were treated on the three patients, ranging in size from 4.4cm2 to 13.1cm2. Data from these patients show FCX-007 was well-tolerated through 12 weeks post-administration. There were no serious adverse events and no product related adverse events reported.
Our study is currently designed to recruit two additional patients in the NC1- (patients who do not express the first non-collagenous portion of the COL7 protein) cohort of the Phase 1 portion of the clinical trial. The most recent scientific thinking and the rarity of NC1- patients compared to NC1+, i.e., the difficulty in recruiting this group, we are seeking a modification in the protocol to close out the Phase 1 cohort of this clinical trial without including any additional patients. The clinical trial protocol is designed to allow a cohort to move into the Phase 2 portion of the trial even if the other cohort is still enrolling or in the follow-up evaluation period; therefore, the modification of the protocol for the trial does not impact ongoing enrollment of Phase 2 patients. As data is collected, progress will be reported.
The targeted wounds of the three adult patients were evaluated during a monitoring period prior to dosing and were observed to be open for up to eight months. Compared to the baseline measurement collected at Day 0 before the single intradermal injection session of FCX-007, at four weeks post-administration 100% (5/5) of wounds were ≥ 75% healed. At 12 weeks post-administration, 80% (4/5) of wounds were ≥ 70% healed.  The wound that was < 70% healed from the 12 week data set was biopsied by the investigator in the middle of the wound bed rather than on the wound edge, which we believe may have contributed to the wound’s instability. We also monitored and evaluated untreated wounds of similar size to the matched treated wounds on the same patient. Compared to the baseline measurement collected at Day 0, at four weeks and 12 weeks post-administration 80% (4/5) of wounds were < 25% healed. We will continue to monitor all treated and untreated wounds throughout follow-up visits.
Various pharmacology signals for vector DNA, COL7 mRNA, or COL7 protein expression were detected throughout the data set in each patient for one or more assays up to 12 weeks post-administration (qPCR, electron microscopy or immunofluorescence). Anchoring fibrils have not been detected to date, whereas expressed COL7 mRNA and COL7 protein have been confirmed in multiple patient samples including one that detected linear expression of COL7 at the basement membrane zone. The Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the trial reviewed the interim data and concluded that safety and potential benefit were established, and allowed continuation of enrollment and dosing.
We completed dosing of the fourth adult patient and performed additional dosing of existing adult patients in the Phase 1 portion of the trial in the fourth quarter of 2017. We expect to report additional interim adult data and provide a trial update in the second quarter of 2018, which includes presenting at the 7th International Investigative Dermatology meeting in May 2018.
We plan to enroll six patients ages seven and older in the Phase 2 portion of the clinical trial. One RDEB adult patient has been enrolled as the first patient in Phase 2 and dosing of this patient is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2018. With the allowance from the FDA, we will now include enrollment of pediatric patients. We expect to complete enrollment of Phase 2 patients in the third quarter of 2018. We plan to report another interim data readout and trial update in the first quarter of 2019.
We plan to use the existing data from the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial to also support a petition for Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy or Breakthrough Therapy Designation for FCX-007.
We have designated our existing, cGMP cell therapy manufacturing facility in Exton, PA as the production site for FCX-007 in our IND application. FCX-007 drug product dosed in the fourth quarter of 2017 was produced and distributed from our Exton, PA facility. The facility will be used for the remaining clinical and future commercial manufacture of FCX-007, with capacity to serve the U.S. market for RDEB. The approximately 13,000 square foot facility previously supported commercial autologous fibroblast manufacturing, with multiple FDA inspections conducted at the site. The facility includes cleanroom cell therapy manufacturing, quality control testing, cryogenic storage, shipping/receiving and warehousing space.

FCX-013 for Moderate to Severe Localized Scleroderma
Localized scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune skin disorder that manifests as excess production of extracellular matrix, specifically collagen, resulting in thickening of the skin and connective tissue. Localized scleroderma encompasses several subtypes which are classified based on the depth and pattern of the lesion(s). The moderate to severe forms of the disorder include any subtype that affects function or produces symptoms of discomfort, tightness and pain. Current treatments for localized scleroderma include systemic or topical corticosteroids which target inflammation, UVA light therapy and physical therapy. There are few treatment options to address excessive collagen accumulation in the skin and connective tissue. We estimate that there are approximately 90,000 patients in the U.S. considered to have moderate to severe localized scleroderma.
Our second gene therapy product candidate, FCX-013, is in development for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma. FCX-013 is an autologous fibroblast genetically-modified using lentivirus and encoded for matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), the protein responsible for breaking down collagen. FCX-013 incorporates Intrexon’s proprietary RheoSwitch Therapeutic System® (RTS®), a biologic switch activated by an orally administered compound (veledimex) to control protein expression at the site of localized scleroderma lesions. FCX-013 is designed to be injected under the skin at the location of the fibrotic lesions where the genetically-modified fibroblast cells will produce MMP-1 to break down excess collagen accumulation. With the FCX-013 therapy, the patient will take an oral compound (veledimex) to facilitate protein expression. Once the fibrosis is resolved, the patient will stop taking the oral compound which will halt further MMP-1 production.
We previously completed a proof-of-concept study for FCX-013 in which the primary objective was to determine whether FCX-013 had the potential to reduce dermal thickness in fibrotic tissue. In this study, FCX-013 was evaluated in a bleomycin-induced scleroderma model utilizing severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice. Data from the study demonstrated that FCX-013 reduced dermal thickness of fibrotic tissue to levels similar to that of the non-bleomycin treated control and further reduced the thickness of the sub-dermal muscle layer. Based upon these data and the FDA’s feedback to our pre-IND briefing package, we advanced FCX-013 into a pre-clinical dose-ranging study which has been completed. 
In December 2017, we completed a good laboratory practice (GLP) toxicology/biodistribution study that assessed FCX-013 in a bleomycin fibrosis model using immunocompromised (NOD/SCID) mice. Data from this study showed no test article-related clinical observations, body weight changes, changes in clinical pathology parameters, gross observations or organ weight change. In addition, there was no significant vector biodistribution to target organs. 
We submitted an IND for FCX-013 to FDA in January 2018, and in March 2018, the FDA allowed the IND to progress to clinical trials. We expect to initiate enrollment for an open label, single arm Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the third quarter of 2018. The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate the safety of FCX-013. Secondary analyses consist of several fibrosis assessments including histology, skin scores, ultrasound and additional measurements of targeted sclerotic lesions and control sites at various time points up to 16 weeks post-administration of FCX-013. Ten patients with any subtype of localized scleroderma are targeted for enrollment (approximately 5 patients per Phase). The Phase 1 portion will enroll adult patients, and dosing for the first three adult patients will be staggered prior to dosing the rest of the trial’s population. Fibrocell intends to include pediatric patients in the Phase 2 portion of the trial after submission and approval of safety and activity data from the adult Phase 1 patients to the FDA and the DSMB for the trial. We plan to manufacture FCX-013 at our Exton, PA cGMP manufacturing facility.
FCX-013 has received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of localized scleroderma and Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for moderate to severe localized scleroderma.
Gene Therapy Research Program for Arthritis and Related Conditions
Arthritis is a broad term that covers a group of more than 100 different types of diseases that affect the joints, as well as connective tissues and organs, including the skin. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, arthritis—characterized by joint inflammation, pain and decreased range of motion—is the United States’ most common cause of disability affecting more than 52 million adults as well as 300,000 children at a cost exceeding $120 billion.
Our third gene therapy program is in the research phase and is focused on the treatment of arthritis and related conditions. Our goal is to deliver a protein therapy locally to the joint to provide sustained efficacy while avoiding key side effects typically associated with systemic therapy.

Intrexon Collaborations
2012 Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement (2012 ECC)
In October 2012, we entered into an Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement, with Intrexon, which was amended in June 2013 and January 2014 (as amended, the 2012 ECC) pursuant to which we are Intrexon’s exclusive channel collaborator in the research, development and commercialization of products in the following areas (the 2012 Fields):

• | the enhanced production and purification of autologous fibroblasts (without genetic modification) for all aesthetic and therapeutic indications;


• | the enhanced production and purification of autologous dermal cells (without genetic modification) for aesthetic and therapeutic treatment of dermal, vocal cord, and periodontal indications;


• | the development of genetically modified autologous fibroblasts for all aesthetic and therapeutic indications where an autologous fibroblast itself is the principal effector of the product in contrast to the use of autologous fibroblasts as the source of expression of a systemically available therapeutic protein in which that protein (and not the fibroblast) is the principal therapeutic effector;


• | the development of genetically modified autologous dermal cells for aesthetic and therapeutic treatment of dermal, vocal cord, and periodontal indications;


• | autologous fibroblasts genetically modified to express a therapeutic protein and/or bioactive ribonucleic acid for the treatment of autoimmune and non-infectious inflammatory disorders that manifest in cutaneous tissues, fascia and/or muscle; and


• | autologous human fibroblasts with gene therapy to express bioactive Tenascin-X locally to correct connective tissue disorders associated with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobility type).

Pursuant to the terms of the 2012 ECC, Intrexon has granted us a license to use its proprietary technologies and other intellectual property to research, develop and commercialize products in the 2012 Fields within the United States. We are responsible for all costs incurred in connection with the research, development and commercialization of products under the 2012 ECC and own all clinical data, regulatory filings and regulatory approvals relating to such products. We engage Intrexon for support services for the research and development of products under the 2012 ECC, and reimburse Intrexon for its cost for time and materials for such services.  
We are required to pay Intrexon quarterly cash royalties on all products developed under the 2012 ECC in an amount equal to 7% of aggregate quarterly net sales up to $25 million, plus 14% on aggregate quarterly net sales greater than $25 million. We are also required to pay Intrexon half of any sublicensing revenues we receive from third parties in consideration for sublicenses granted by us with respect to products developed under the 2012 ECC, but only to the extent such sublicensing revenues are not included in net sales subject to royalties. Sales from other products that we develop and commercialize outside of the 2012 ECC are not subject to royalty payments unless we are able to reduce the product’s cost of goods sold through the 2012 ECC, in which case, we are required to pay quarterly cash royalties on such products equal to one-third of the cost of goods sold savings less any such savings developed by us outside of the 2012 ECC.  
The 2012 ECC may be terminated by Intrexon if we fail to exercise diligent efforts in developing products through the collaboration or if we elect not to pursue the development of a therapy identified by Intrexon within the 2012 Field and that qualifies as a “Superior Therapy” as defined in the 2012 ECC.  Upon such termination, the products covered by the 2012 ECC in active and ongoing Phase II clinical trials or later stage development shall be entitled to be continued by us with a continuation of the related milestone, royalty and other payment obligations for such products, and all rights to products covered by the 2012 ECC still in an earlier stage of development shall revert to Intrexon.
In September 2015, we and Intrexon entered into a letter of agreement pursuant to which we mutually agreed to terminate our collaboration with respect to the development of potential therapies to treat Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hypermobility type) due to technical hurdles. As a result, we no longer have any rights or obligations under the 2012 ECC with respect to the development of “autologous human fibroblasts genetically modified to express bioactive Tenascin-X locally to correct connective tissue disorders”. 
Currently, we are in development of two gene therapy product candidates, FCX-007 and FCX-013, under the 2012 ECC, as more fully described under the heading “Development Programs” within “Item 1—Business” of this Form 10-K.

2015 Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement (2015 ECC)
In December 2015, we entered into an additional Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement with Intrexon (the 2015 ECC) pursuant to which we are Intrexon’s exclusive channel collaborator in the research, development and commercialization of products for the treatment of chronic inflammation and degenerative diseases of human joints through intra-articular or other local administration of genetically-modified fibroblasts (the 2015 Field). The collaboration leverages our autologous fibroblast technology with Intrexon’s synthetic biology technology to identify and develop cell-based therapeutics that will be genetically modified to express one or more proteins at sites of joint inflammation. We believe this treatment approach has the potential to overcome the limitations of existing therapies for chronic inflammation and degenerative diseases of the joint, including arthritis and related conditions.
Pursuant to the terms of the 2015 ECC, Intrexon has granted us a license to use its proprietary technologies and other intellectual property to develop and commercialize products in the 2015 Field throughout the world. We are responsible for all costs incurred in connection with the research, development and commercialization of products under the 2015 ECC and own all clinical data, regulatory filings and regulatory approvals relating to such products. We engage Intrexon for support services in connection with the research and development of products under the 2015 ECC, and reimburse Intrexon for its cost for time and materials for such services. 
In consideration for the license and the other rights that we receive under the 2015 ECC, we paid Intrexon an up-front technology access fee of $10 million in cash in January 2016. For each product that we develop under the 2015 ECC, we are required to pay Intrexon development milestones of up to $30 million for the first product developed under the 2015 ECC (and development milestones up to $55 million for each subsequent product developed under the 2015 ECC) and commercialization milestones of up to $22.5 million, for each product developed, a low double-digit royalty on our net sales of such products and half of any sublicensing revenues we receive from third parties in consideration for sublicenses granted by us with respect to such products but only to the extent such sublicensing revenues are not included in net sales subject to royalties.
The 2015 ECC may be terminated by Intrexon if we fail to exercise diligent efforts in developing products through the collaboration or if we elect not to pursue the development of a therapy identified by Intrexon within the 2015 Field and that qualifies as a “Superior Therapy” as defined in the 2015 ECC.  Upon such termination, the products covered by the 2015 ECC in active and ongoing Phase II clinical trials or later stage development shall be entitled to be continued by us with a continuation of the related milestone, royalty and other payment obligations for such products, and all rights to products covered by the 2015 ECC still in an earlier stage of development shall revert to Intrexon.
To date, we have only conducted research for a gene therapy product candidate for arthritis and related conditions under the 2015 ECC. We have deferred further development under the 2015 ECC in order to focus our efforts and our resources on our ongoing development of FCX-007 and FCX-013.
Manufacturing
We lease and operate our own manufacturing facility located in Exton, Pennsylvania. We have historically used this facility to manufacture our non-genetically modified products and during 2016 began using this facility for pre-clinical manufacturing of our gene therapy product candidate, FCX-013.  We designated our Exton, PA cGMP manufacturing facility in Exton, PA as the production site for FCX-007 in the fourth quarter of 2017, and are currently producing the drug product for the FCX-007 clinical trial at that facility. We also plan to manufacture FCX-013 at the same location. Previously we outsourced certain manufacturing of our genetically-modified product candidate, FCX-007, to a contract manufacturer with a facility located in Mountain View, California. We adhere to FDA cGMP regulations. We believe that we have adequate manufacturing capacity to satisfy our pre-clinical and clinical demands.
The fibroblast cells that constitute our product candidates are cultured by our proprietary cGMP manufacturing process, beginning with the collection of skin biopsies from the patient’s skin.  Fibroblasts are extracted from the biopsies and cultured using standard culture techniques to increase the cell population. A viral transduction is then performed to introduce targeted genes to the cells. The fibroblasts are then further expanded and cryopreserved for storage. When a treatment is requested, the cells are thawed, washed and prepared for shipment.
All component parts, including raw materials and other supplies utilized in our manufacturing process are available from various third party suppliers and manufacturers in quantities adequate to meet our needs. We seek to ensure continuity of supply of such component parts, raw materials and supplies using a strategy of dual sourcing, where possible. Some of our raw materials are currently sourced from one vendor; however, alternate vendors are available should they be required, although we would need sufficient lead time to qualify those vendors. 
10

We use certain hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our manufacturing process which are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling, disposal of and human exposure to these materials, including regulation by governmental regulatory agencies, such as the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. We incur capital and operating expenditures and other costs in the ordinary course of our business in complying with these laws and regulations. We dispose of minimal hazardous biological waste as a result of our manufacturing process.
Intellectual Property
We believe that patents, trademarks, copyrights and other proprietary rights are important to our business.  We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.  We seek to protect our intellectual property rights by a variety of means, including obtaining patents, maintaining trade secrets and proprietary know-how and technological innovation to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights.  
As of December 31, 2017, we own or license 11 issued U.S. patents, 8 pending U.S. patent applications, 1 granted foreign patent, 1 pending international patent and 14 pending foreign patent applications.  Our issued patents and patent applications primarily cover the method of using autologous cell fibroblasts for the repair of skin and soft tissue defects and the use of autologous fibroblast cells for tissue regeneration.  In particular, we own an issued patent in the U.S. that is directed to methods of long-term augmentation of subcutaneous or dermal tissue by injecting an effective amount of a suspension of autologous passaged dermal fibroblasts into subadjacent tissue, which is set to expire in July 2020. In addition, we own an issued U.S. patent, an issued Australian patent, and pending applications in Canada, China, Europe, India, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and the U.S. directed to dosage formulations for injection containing particular amounts of autologous human fibroblasts and uses thereof, which naturally expire in 2030 and 2031. We also own pending applications in the U.S. and several foreign countries related to topical formulations of autologous dermal fibroblasts and uses thereof, the earliest of which, if issued, would naturally expire in 2027. We have also in-licensed from Intrexon Corporation an international application directed to compositions and methods for treating Type VII collagen deficiencies which, if issued, would expire in 2037. We have also in-licensed from Intrexon Corporation U.S. provisional applications directed to delivery of autologous cells comprising matrix metalloproteinase-1 for treating scleroderma which, if a non-provisional application would issue therefrom, would expire in 2038. 
Competition
There is significant competition in the biopharmaceutical industry which can be attributed to companies ranging from small specialized biotechnology firms to large well-established pharmaceutical companies. More specifically, there are many companies currently competing in drug development for new therapies for the treatment of diseases affecting the skin, connective tissue and joints, our focus area. Some of our competitors have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development organizations.  In addition, our experience in clinical trials, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals, manufacturing and commercialization of products may be more limited. 
Product competition is based on a variety of factors, including but not limited to: product safety, efficacy, convenience of dosing, availability, price, as well as brand recognition. Our product candidates, if approved for commercial use, will contend with treatments offered by our competitors. Although we believe the autologous nature and localized treatment approach of our product candidates provide advantages over our competitors, existing and new treatments may also possess certain advantages. Additionally, the development of other drug technologies and methods of treating diseases are occurring at a rapid pace. These developments may render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. Currently, we believe the primary competitors for our product candidates are as follows: 
FCX-007 for RDEB. Our product candidate FCX-007 is being developed for the treatment of RDEB. Current treatments for RDEB, which include bandaging, antibiotics, feeding tubes, and surgery (hand and esophageal), only address the symptoms of this disorder. There are currently no products approved by the FDA for the treatment of RDEB. We are aware of a potentially competing product candidate, EB-101, which is a genetically-modified keratinocyte graft being developed by Abeona Therapeutics (Abeona). Following presentation of Phase 1/2 clinical data at the Society of Investigative Dermatology conference in 2017, Abeona received guidance from the FDA to initiate a Pivotal Phase 3 trial in 2018. In addition, we are aware of several other products in development for the treatment of various forms of epidermolysis bullosa (including DEB and RDEB).

11

FCX-013 for Moderate to Severe Localized Scleroderma. Our product candidate FCX-013 is being developed for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma. Current treatments for localized scleroderma include systemic or topical corticosteroids which target inflammation, UVA light therapy, and physical therapy. There are few treatment options to address excessive collagen accumulation in the skin and connective tissue. There are currently no products approved by the FDA for the treatment of localized scleroderma. We are aware of a potentially competing product, ECCS-50 Cellular Therapy, which is being developed by Cytori Therapeutics (Cytori), for the treatment of systemic scleroderma that affects the hands. Cytori recently released data from its clinical trial and is working with statisticians and study investigators in preparation for publication of these results in a peer-reviewed journal. We are also aware that miRagen Therapeutics has a product candidate, MRG-201, which utilizes microRNA biology and is in a Phase 1 clinical trial for the treatment of systemic and localized scleroderma.
Research and Development
We expense research and development costs as they are incurred.  For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred total research and development expenses of approximately $12.2 million and $12.1 million, respectively. Additionally, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we incurred expenses of less than $0.1 million related to a research and development agreement that we have with a third party to investigate potential new non-pharmaceutical applications for our conditioned fibroblast media technology. Expenses pertaining to this research and development agreement are classified under the caption “Cost of collaboration revenue” in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 
Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive government regulation, principally by the FDA and state and local authorities in the United States and by comparable agencies in foreign countries.  Governmental authorities in the United States extensively regulate the pre-clinical and clinical testing, safety, efficacy, research, development, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export, marketing and distribution, among other things, of pharmaceutical and biologic products under various federal laws including the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) and under comparable laws by the states and in most foreign countries.
Domestic Regulation
In the United States, the FDA, under the FFDCA, the PHSA, and other federal statutes and regulations, subjects pharmaceutical and biologic products to rigorous review.  If we do not comply with applicable requirements, we may be subjected to various enforcement actions, such as product seizures and court injunctions, the government may refuse to approve our marketing applications, and we could even be criminally prosecuted in certain circumstances.  The FDA also has the authority to suspend or revoke a Biologics License Application (BLA), issue adverse publicity, and take other measures if we fail to comply with applicable regulatory standards.
FDA Approval Process
To obtain approval of a new drug product from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data demonstrating its safety, purity, and potency, which includes efficacy, as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate.  In most cases, this entails extensive laboratory tests and pre-clinical and clinical trials.  This testing and the preparation of necessary applications and processing of those applications by the FDA are expensive and typically take many years to complete.  The FDA may deny our applications or may not act quickly or favorably in reviewing these applications, and we may encounter significant difficulties or costs in our efforts to obtain FDA approvals that could delay or preclude us from marketing any products we may develop.  The FDA also may require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the effects of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the commercial applications of these products.  Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems following initial marketing.  With respect to patented products or technologies, delays imposed by the governmental approval process may materially reduce the period during which we may have the exclusive right to exploit the products or technologies.
The FDA does not apply a single regulatory scheme to human cells and tissues and products derived from human cells and tissue.  On a product-by-product basis, the FDA may regulate such products as drugs, biologic products, or medical devices, in addition to regulating them as human cells, tissues, or cellular or tissue-based products (HCT/Ps), depending on whether or not the particular product triggers any of an enumerated list of regulatory factors.  A fundamental difference in the treatment of products under these classifications is that the FDA permits certain HCT/Ps, sometimes referred to as section 361 HCT/Ps, that do not trigger any of those regulatory factors to be commercially distributed without regulatory approval.  In 
12

contrast, HCT/P products that trigger those factors, such as if they are more than minimally manipulated, are regulated as drugs, biologics, or medical devices and require FDA approval prior to commercial distribution.  We have determined that our product candidates trigger regulatory factors that make them biologic products, in addition to HCT/Ps, and consequently, we must obtain approval from the FDA before marketing such products and must also satisfy all regulatory requirements for HCT/Ps.
The process required by the FDA before a new drug or biologic product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests or studies and formulation studies;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application for a new drug or biologic product, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug, or safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biologic product for its intended use;


• | detailed information on product characterization and manufacturing process; and


• | submission and approval of a New Drug Application (NDA) for a drug, or a BLA for a biologic product.

Pre-clinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry formulation and stability, as well as animal and other studies to evaluate toxicity.  Under FDA regulations, the results of any pre-clinical testing, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application.  The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND application before clinical trials may begin, in order to ensure that human research patients will not be exposed to unreasonable health risks.  At any time during this 30-day period or at any time thereafter, the FDA may halt proposed or ongoing clinical trials, may authorize trials only on specified terms, or may require additional trials.  The IND application process may become extremely costly and substantially delay development of our products.  Moreover, positive results of pre-clinical tests will not necessarily forecast positive results in clinical trials. 
The sponsor typically conducts human clinical trials in three sequential phases, which may overlap.  These phases generally include the following:

• | Phase 1: The product candidate is usually first introduced into healthy humans or, on occasion, into patients, and is tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, distribution, excretion and metabolism;


• | Phase 2: The product candidate is introduced into a limited patient population to:


• | assess its efficacy in specific, targeted indications;


• | assess dosage tolerance and optimal dosage; and


• | identify possible adverse effects and safety risks.


• | Phase 3: These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies. If a product candidate is found to have an acceptable safety profile and to be potentially effective in Phase 2 clinical trials, clinical trials in Phase 3 will be initiated to further demonstrate clinical efficacy, optimal dosage and safety within an expanded and diverse patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites; and 


• | If the FDA does ultimately approve the product candidate, it may require post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase 4 studies, to confirm or further evaluate its safety and effectiveness. Continued ability to commercialize the product may be based on the successful completion of these additional studies. 

Before proceeding with a trial, the sponsor may seek a written agreement from the FDA regarding the design, size, and conduct of a clinical trial.  This is known as a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA).  Among other things, SPAs can cover clinical trials for pivotal studies whose data will form the primary basis to establish a product’s efficacy.  SPAs thus help establish up-front agreement with the FDA about the adequacy of a clinical trial design to support a regulatory approval, but the agreement is not binding if new circumstances arise.  Even if the FDA agrees to a SPA, the agreement may be changed by the sponsor or the FDA on written agreement by either parties, or if a senior FDA official determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the product was identified after the testing began.  There is no guarantee that a study will ultimately be adequate to support an approval, even if the study is subject to a SPA.  The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA. The FDA may revoke or alter its SPA agreement under the following circumstances:
13


• | a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug has been identified after testing has begun;


• | the protocol that was agreed upon with the FDA has not been followed by a sponsor;


• | the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by a sponsor in a request for a SPA change are found to be false or misleading, or are found to exclude relevant facts; or


• | the FDA and sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study.

Clinical trials must meet requirements for Institutional Review Board (IRB) oversight, patient informed consent and the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements.  Prior to commencement of each clinical trial, the sponsor must submit to the FDA a clinical plan, or protocol, accompanied by the approval of the committee responsible for overseeing clinical trials at the clinical trial sites.  The FDA or the IRB at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time if it believes that the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients.  Data safety monitoring boards, which monitor certain studies to protect the welfare of study patients, may also require that a clinical trial be discontinued or modified.
The sponsor must submit to the FDA the results of the pre-clinical and clinical trials, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacturing and composition of the product, and proposed labeling, in the form of an NDA, or, in the case of a biologic product, a BLA.  The applicant must also submit with the NDA or BLA a substantial user fee payment, unless a waiver or reduction applies.  In some cases, a sponsor may be able to expand the indications in an approved NDA or BLA through a submission of a Prior Approval Supplement.  Each NDA or BLA submitted for FDA approval is usually reviewed for administrative completeness and reviewability within 60 days following submission of the application.  If deemed complete, the FDA will “file” the NDA or BLA, thereby triggering substantive review of the application.  The FDA can refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable.  Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA will review the application and will usually respond to the applicant in accordance with performance goals the FDA, industry and Congress have negotiated for the review of NDAs and BLAs. For NDAs for new molecular entity drugs and for original BLA submissions, the review period is currently six months from the filing date of the application for priority applications and ten months from the filing date for standard applications.  The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information, pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, or clarification, or by changes to the application submitted by the applicant in the form of amendments.  The FDA may refer applications for novel product candidates which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation, and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions.  The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA generally inspects the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements which govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product.  Manufacturers of human cellular or tissue-based biologics also must comply with the FDA’s Good Tissue Practices, as applicable, and the general biologic product standards.  
It is possible that our product candidates will not successfully proceed through this approval process or that the FDA will not approve them in any specific period of time, or at all.  The FDA may deny or delay approval of applications that do not meet applicable regulatory criteria, or if the FDA determines that the clinical data do not adequately establish the safety and efficacy of the product.  Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements for a new biologic product is a process that may take a number of years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.  The FDA reviews these applications and, when and if it decides that adequate data are available to show that the product is both safe and effective and that other applicable requirements have been met, approves the drug or biologic product for marketing.  Government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and imposes costly procedures upon our activities.  Success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials.  Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval.  Upon approval, a product candidate may be marketed only for those indications approved in the NDA or BLA and will be subject to labeling and promotional requirements or limitations, including warnings, precautions, contraindications and use limitations, which could materially impact profitability.  Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-market regulatory standards and requirements are not maintained or if safety, efficacy or other problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace.
14

The FDA may, during its review of an NDA or BLA, ask for additional study data.  If the FDA does ultimately approve the product, approval may be subject to limitations based on the FDA’s interpretation of the existing pre-clinical and clinical data and the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including potentially expensive Phase IV studies, to confirm or otherwise further evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the product.  The FDA also may require, as a condition to approval or continued marketing of a drug, a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) to ensure that the benefits of a drug or biologic product outweigh its risks.  A REMS can include additional educational materials for healthcare professionals and patients such as Medication Guides and Patient Package Inserts, a plan for communicating information to healthcare professionals, and restricted distribution of the product.  In addition, the FDA may, in some circumstances, impose restrictions on the use of the product, which may be difficult and expensive to administer and may require prior approval of promotional materials.  Following approval, the FDA may require labeling changes or impose new post-approval study, risk management, or distribution restriction requirements.
The FDA has developed several programs intended to expedite the development and review of drugs that address unmet medical needs for serious or life threatening conditions, especially when the drugs are the first available treatment or have advantages over existing treatments: 

• | Accelerated Approval. The FDA may grant accelerated approval to drugs or biologic products that treat serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefits to patients over existing treatments. Under this program, the FDA may approve a product based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints that can be measured earlier than mortality or irreversible morbidity. When approval is based on surrogate endpoints or clinical endpoints that can be measured earlier than mortality or irreversible morbidity, the sponsor will be required to conduct additional post-approval clinical trials to verify and describe clinical benefit. Under the agency’s accelerated approval regulations, if the FDA concludes that a product that has been shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require certain post-marketing restrictions as necessary to assure safe use. In addition, for products approved under accelerated approval, sponsors will be required to submit all copies of their promotional materials, including advertisements, to the FDA at least thirty days prior to initial dissemination unless otherwise informed by the FDA. After a hearing, the FDA may withdraw a previously granted accelerated approval if, for instance, post-marketing studies fail to verify any clinical benefit, it becomes clear that restrictions on the distribution of the product are inadequate to ensure its safe use, or if a sponsor fails to comply with the conditions of the accelerated approval. 


• | Breakthrough Therapy. The FDA may grant “breakthrough therapy” status to drugs or biologic products designed to treat, alone or in combination with another drug(s) or biologic(s), a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and for which preliminary evidence suggests a substantial improvement on clinically-meaningful endpoints over existing therapies. Such products need not address an unmet need, but are nevertheless eligible for expedited review if they offer the potential for an improvement over existing therapies. Breakthrough therapy status entitles the sponsor to earlier and more frequent meetings with the FDA regarding the development of nonclinical and clinical data and permits the FDA to offer product development or regulatory advice for the purpose of potentially shortening the time to product approval. The FDA may rescind breakthrough therapy designation if it believes the designated product no longer meets the qualifying criteria. Breakthrough therapy status does not guarantee that a product will be developed or reviewed more quickly and does not ensure FDA approval. 


• | Fast Track. The FDA may grant “fast track” status to drugs or biologic products that are intended to treat serious diseases or illness and demonstrate the potential to fill an unmet medical need. Fast track is a process designed to expedite the review of such products by providing, among other things, more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the product’s development plan, more frequent written correspondence from the FDA about trial design, potential eligibility for accelerated approval, and rolling review, which allows submission of individually completed sections of a NDA or BLA for the FDA’s review before the entire filing is completed. Fast track status does not ensure that a product will be developed more quickly or receive FDA approval more quickly, if at all. 


• | Priority Review. The FDA may grant “priority review” status to products that, if approved, would be significant improvements in safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Priority review is intended to reduce the time it takes for the FDA to review an NDA or BLA. 


• | Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy. A product may be eligible for regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation if: 


a. | The drug is a regenerative medicine therapy, which is defined as a cell therapy, therapeutic tissue engineering product, human cell and tissue product, or any combination product using such therapies or products, except

15

for those regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and part 1271 of Title 21, Code of Federal Regulations;

b. | The drug is intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; and


c. | Preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for such disease or condition

Advantages of the RMAT designation include all of the benefits of the fast track breakthrough designation programs, including early interactions with sponsors.
Additionally, there are various incentives to support development and approval of certain product candidates, including, but is not limited to, orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs or biologic products intended to treat a “rare disease or condition,” which is generally defined as having a prevalence of less than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA for the product. Orphan drug designation does not shorten the regulatory review and approval process, nor does it provide any advantage in the regulatory review and approval process. However, if an orphan drug later receives approval for the indication for which it has designation, the relevant regulatory authority may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years in the U.S. Although obtaining approval to market a product with orphan drug exclusivity may be advantageous, we cannot be certain:

• | that we will be the first to obtain approval for any drug for which we obtain orphan drug designation;


• | that orphan drug designation will result in any commercial advantage or reduce competition; or


• | that the limited exceptions to this exclusivity will not be invoked by the relevant regulatory authority.

Additionally, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights may be lost under certain conditions, such as if the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug.
FCX-007 and FCX-013 have received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA, for the treatment of DEB (including RDEB) and localized scleroderma, respectively.
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation
FCX-007 has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA for the treatment of RDEB and FCX-013 has received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation from the FDA for the treatment of moderate to severe localized scleroderma. The FDA generally defines a “rare pediatric disease” as a disease that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. primarily under the age of 18 years old. Under the FDA’s Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) program, upon the approval of an NDA or BLA for a product for the treatment of a rare pediatric disease that is serious or life-threatening, the sponsor of such application is eligible for a Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher. Currently, the Priority Review Voucher can be used to obtain priority review for any subsequent NDA or BLA and may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Under the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress extended the PRV program for rare pediatric diseases through 2020. A drug designated as a drug for a rare pediatric disease by September 30, 2020, and approved by September 30, 2022, may receive a voucher. Because this program has been subject to criticism, including by the FDA, it is possible that even if we obtain approval for FCX-007 and FCX-013 and qualify for such a PRV, the program may no longer be in effect at the time of approval.

Ongoing FDA Requirements and Post-Marketing Obligations
All approved drug products are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, sampling and distribution requirements, notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of certain manufacturing or labeling changes, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, submitting periodic reports to the FDA, maintaining and providing updated safety and efficacy information to the FDA, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements.  Failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, criminal prosecution, or civil penalties.
16

The FDA may require post-marketing studies or clinical trials to develop additional information regarding the safety of a product.  These studies or trials may involve continued testing of a product and development of data, including clinical data, about the product’s effects in various populations and any side effects associated with long-term use.  The FDA may require post-marketing studies or trials to investigate possible or known serious risks or signals of serious risks, or to identify unexpected serious risks, and may require periodic status reports if new safety information develops.  Failure to conduct these studies in a timely manner may result in substantial civil penalties, or withdrawal of product approval. 
Also, newly discovered or developed safety or efficacy data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, additional pre-clinical studies or clinical trials, or even in some instances, withdrawal of the approval.  Violations of regulatory requirements at any stage, including after approval, may result in various adverse consequences, including the FDA’s withdrawal of an approved product from the market, other voluntary or FDA-initiated action that could delay or restrict further marketing, and the imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties against the manufacturer or the NDA or BLA holder.  In addition, later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on the product, manufacturer or NDA or BLA holder, including withdrawal of the product from the market.  
The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA requirements which include, among other things, promotional activities, standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, promotional activities involving the internet, and industry sponsored scientific and educational activities.  In general, all product promotion must be consistent with the labeling approved by the FDA for such product, contain a balanced presentation of information on the product’s uses, benefits, risks, and important safety information and limitations on use, and otherwise not be false or misleading.  The FDA has very broad enforcement authority, and failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties, including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from regulatory standards and enforcement actions that can include seizures, injunctions and criminal prosecution.  Failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements and restrictions also may subject a company to adverse publicity and enforcement action by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) or the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as well as state authorities.  This could subject the company to a range of penalties that could have a significant commercial impact, including civil and criminal fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which a company promotes or distributes its products.
Drug and biologic product manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and to list their products with the FDA.  The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities in the United States and abroad in order to assure compliance with the applicable cGMP regulations and other requirements. These cGMP requirements apply to all stages of the manufacturing process, including production, processing, sterilization, packaging, labeling, storage and shipment. Facilities also are subject to inspections by other federal, foreign, state and local agencies.  In complying with the cGMP regulations, manufacturers must continue to assure that the product meets applicable specifications, regulations and other post-marketing requirements.  Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal, regulatory or voluntary action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product. 
Sponsors and their third-party contractors are also subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with their research. The FDA has regulatory and enforcement power to disqualify nonclinical laboratory studies performed by a violative facility from being considered by FDA in support of any application for a research or marketing permit; to publicly disclose the fact of such disqualification; and to pursue any other available and appropriate judicial proceeding or regulatory action, such as court-ordered injunctions denial or withdrawal of regulatory approvals and referral to other federal, state or local government law enforcement or regulatory agencies.
Furthermore, new government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development, or affect the conditions under which approved products are marketed. 
17

HIPAA Requirements
Other federal legislation may affect our ability to obtain certain health information in conjunction with our research activities.  We may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.  The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH), and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. HIPAA also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements or representation, or making or using any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or entry in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
In addition, numerous federal and state laws and regulations that address privacy and data security, including state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. Failure to comply with data protection laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our business.
Failure to achieve and sustain compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws could result in government enforcement actions and create liability for us (which could include civil and/or criminal penalties), private litigation and/or adverse publicity that could negatively affect our operating results and business.
Other U.S. Regulatory Requirements
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale, and promotion of drug and biologic products are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), other divisions of the HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the DOJ and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments.  For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the False Claims Act and other federal and state fraud and abuse laws, as described in detail below.
If we successfully commercialize any of our products, we may participate in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Participation is required for federal funds to be available for our products that we successfully commercialize under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, we would be required to pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for our covered outpatient drugs that are dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program as a condition of having federal funds being made available to the states for our drugs under Medicaid and Part B of the Medicare program.
Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program also participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available for the manufacturer’s drugs under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. The 340B drug pricing program requires participating manufacturers to agree to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. These 340B covered entities include a variety of community health clinics and other entities that receive health services grants from the Public Health Service, as well as hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of low-income patients.
Under Section 603 of the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992 (VHCA), drug companies that participate in Medicaid or Medicare Part B are required to offer their “covered drugs” (biologic products and innovator drugs) for sale on a Federal Supply Schedule (FFS) contract at a statutorily reduced price to four federal agencies including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, the U.S. Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and the Coast Guard. Participation under Section 603 the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulation. In addition, pursuant to regulations issued by the Department of Defense TRICARE Management Activity, now the Defense Health Agency, to implement Section 703 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, manufacturers are required to pay rebates on “covered drug” prescriptions dispensed to TRICARE beneficiaries by TRICARE network retail pharmacies.  All of these activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection, unfair competition, and other laws.
In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together, the Affordable Care Act). The Affordable Care Act substantially changed the 
18

way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The Affordable Care Act intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for health care and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms.  The Affordable Care Act has resulted in, and we expect it will continue to result in, downward pressure on coverage and the price of products covered by Medicare and other government programs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments and coverage from private payors.  The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our products.  In addition, certain legislative changes to and regulatory changes under the Affordable Care Act have occurred in the 115th United States Congress and under the Trump Administration. For instance, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 increased the Affordable Care Act required manufacturer point-of-sale discount from 50% to 70% off the negotiated price for Medicare Part D beneficiaries during their coverage gap period beginning in 2019. It is possible that there will be further legislation or regulation that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.
At such time as we market, sell and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval, it is possible that our business activities could be subject to scrutiny and enforcement under one or more federal or state health care fraud and abuse laws and regulations, which could affect our ability to operate our business. These include the following fraud and abuse laws and regulations:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some business arrangements from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from federal Anti-Kickback Statute liability. The Affordable Care Act, among other things, clarified that liability may be established under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute without proving actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below) or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 


• | The federal civil False Claims Act prohibits any person from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment of government funds; knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government; or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the statute and to share in any monetary recovery. Many pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been investigated and have reached substantial financial settlements with the federal government under the civil False Claims Act for a variety of alleged improper marketing activities, including: providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing sham consulting fees, grants, free travel and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe the company’s products; and inflating prices reported to private price publication services, which are used to set drug payment rates under government healthcare programs. In addition, in recent years the government has pursued civil False Claims Act cases against a number of pharmaceutical companies for causing false claims to be submitted as a result of the marketing of their products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. False Claims Act liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties in the tens of thousands of dollars. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies also are subject to other federal false claim laws, including, among others, federal criminal healthcare fraud and false statement statutes that extend to non-government health benefit programs. 


• | HIPAA created federal criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors,

19

knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.

• | Analogous state laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may apply to items or services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Some state laws also require pharmaceutical companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of pharmaceutical products and to report gifts and payments to certain healthcare providers in the states. Other states prohibit providing meals to prescribers or other marketing related activities. Other states restrict the ability of manufacturers to offer co-pay support to patients for certain prescription drugs. Still other states and cities require identification or licensing of sales representatives. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes of conduct. 


• | The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, being implemented as the Open Payments Program, requires certain pharmaceutical manufacturers to engage in extensive tracking of payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, and to submit such data to CMS, which will then make all of this data publicly available on the CMS website. Pharmaceutical manufacturers with products for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Program are required to track reportable payments and must submit a report to CMS on or before the 90th day of each calendar year disclosing reportable payments made in the previous calendar year. Failure to comply with the reporting obligations may result in civil monetary penalties. 


• | The federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997 and other similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from providing money or anything of value to officials of foreign governments, foreign political parties, or international organizations with the intent to obtain or retain business or seek a business advantage. Recently, there has been a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity by U.S. regulators, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both DOJ and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Violations of United States or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of supplier, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses and permits and other legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or government investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. 

Violations of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations are punishable by significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines and exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.
International Regulation
The regulation of our product candidates outside of the United States varies by country.  Certain countries regulate human tissue products as a pharmaceutical product, which would require us to make extensive filings and obtain regulatory approvals before selling our product candidates.  Certain other countries classify our product candidates as human tissue for transplantation but may restrict its import or sale.  Other countries may have no application regulations regarding the import or sale of products similar to our product candidates, creating uncertainty as to what standards we may be required to meet.
Employees 
As of December 31, 2017, we had 20 full-time employees, all located in the United States.  Of these full-time employees, 15 are engaged in research, development and manufacturing (including facilities) functions and 5 are engaged in finance, legal, human resources, information technology, and other general administrative functions. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
