Products segment
Our Products segment sells equipment and provides services to drilling contractors and exploration and production ("E&P") companies throughout the world. We provide equipment rental services on a day-rate basis for land and offshore drilling rigs and we also provide aftermarket sales and support services to our customers.
We assemble top drives, automated catwalks and other automated pipe handling equipment based upon our proprietary designs, which are used in drilling operations to either convey tubulars to and from the rig floor or rotate the drill string and/or casing while suspended from the derrick above the rig floor. Our equipment offers portability and flexibility; permitting drilling companies to utilize their assets in both permanent and temporary installations. We offer for sale a range of portable and permanently installed top drive products that includes both hydraulically and electrically powered machines capable of delivering 400 to 1,350 horsepower, with a rated lifting capacity of 150 to 750 tons while our automated catwalk systems are suitable for rig floor heights ranging from 4 feet through 35 feet. Our systems automate both the conveyance of tubulars and the drilling process, requiring fewer people as compared to conventional pipe conveyance methods and kelly drilling with a rotary table. With each system we sell, we offer installation and support services, including training.
We offer six distinct series of top drive systems, using either hydraulic, induction alternating current ("AC"), or permanent magnet AC technology and two models of automated catwalks. We believe that we are an industry leader in the development and provision of both portable and permanently installed top drive systems. Our designs and technology provide very high power density, allowing for a high power to weight ratio. We use AC induction technology and late generation power electronics throughout our entire line of electric top drives, allowing the end user to specify its preferred power electronics and motor combination and permitting us to select components from a larger vendor base. Our EMI top drive units are available with 150 to 250 ton load path configurations. We also developed our EXI system in response to market demands for a high performance compact electric top drive system, commonly required on modern fast moving rigs frequently used in pad drilling operations. The EXI system has a load path rating of 350 to 400 tons and generates 600 horsepower. In 2015, an 800 horsepower version of the EXI was released, available in both 350 and 400 ton load path configurations. The ESI is our latest model, which has a load path rating of 500 to 750 tons and generates 1,000 to 1,350 horsepower. The HXI is a new generation of our current hydraulic HMI system, incorporating a full suite of operational features and providing a significant gain in performance. The HXI system has a load path rating of 150 to 250 tons and is driven by a 700 horsepower self-contained diesel-driven hydraulic power unit. Our automated catwalk designs utilize a dual articulating design that seamlessly automates the conveyance of tubulars to and from the rig floor, allowing the catwalk to be remotely set and operated for any rig floor height ranging from 4 feet to 35feet. 
In addition to our top drive sales, we maintain a fleet of 116 top drives and four catwalks deployed strategically throughout the world that we rent on a day-rate basis for land and offshore drilling rigs. Our rental fleet is highly transportable; offers a range of systems that can be installed in practically any mast configuration, including workover rigs; and are mobilized to meet the needs of our customers. Our rental fleet is composed principally of hydraulically powered top drive systems, with power ratings of 475 to 1,205 horsepower and load path ratings of 150 to 650 tons, each equipped with its own independent diesel engine driven hydraulic power unit. This unique combination permits a high level of portability and installation flexibility. We currently maintain top drive rental units in Argentina, Mexico, United States, Canada, Russia, Indonesia, and the U.A.E. 
We also provide aftermarket sales and services to our installed customer base through our facilities around the globe. Our service offerings include initial rig up and training for our sold units, onsite supervision, and recertification and repair services. In 2014, we extended our aftermarket support beyond our own equipment to service competitor brand top drives and other automated pipe handling equipment. Entry into this market was primarily at the request of our current customer base with mixed fleets and represents an attractive growth opportunity for us. We maintain regional stocks of high-demand parts in order to expedite top quality, original replacement parts for top drive systems. Our highly experienced field personnel are responsible for the rig up and installation of most units, which includes both rental units and customer-owned units. In addition, our technicians are available to perform work under callout maintenance and fleet management arrangements.
Markets and Competition
Demand for our top drives and pipe handling products, rental services, and aftermarket sales and service depends primarily upon the level of drilling activity and capital spending of drilling contractors and "E&P" companies. Our customers for product sales and aftermarket sales and service primarily consist of drilling contractors, rig builders, and equipment brokers. Occasionally, we may also sell products and provide aftermarket sales and services to major and independent "E&P" companies and national oil companies ("NOCs") who wish to own and manage their own top drive and automated pipe handling systems. Our rental fleet customers include drilling contractors, major and independent "E&P" companies, and "NOCs".

We estimate that approximately 70% of land drilling rigs drilling deviated and horizontal wells are currently equipped with top drive systems, including Russia, China and India, where a lower number of rigs operate with top drives today. By contrast, we estimate that approximately 95% of offshore rigs are equipped with top drives. We were the first top drive manufacturer to provide portable top drives for land drilling rigs. We believe that land-based market potential still exists for our top drive drilling system technology, including both portable and permanently installed applications. Further, when many top drive systems approach the end of their useful lives and are inefficient or may not have legacy parts available, we see the development of a conversion market, which provides an important opportunity for us. In addition, the current technology demand associated with complex drilling is driving the demand for newer more capable Top Drives to replace older existing equipment.
Our primary competitors in the sale of top drive systems are National Oilwell Varco, Inc. ("NOV") and Canrig Drilling Technology Ltd., a subsidiary of Nabors Industries Ltd. In addition, low-cost manufacturers, notably from China, have entered the market in recent years. We believe that we have the second largest installed base and are the number two global provider of top drives, following NOV. Of the three major top drive system providers, we believe that we maintain the largest fleet of assets solely for rental purposes. Top drive sales competition in our industry takes place primarily on the basis of equipment features and capacities , the quality of the services and technical support offered, delivery lead time, and price.
Backlog
Historically we have reported product sales backlog as an indicator of our business trends. In the current environment, however, we are experiencing product sales that were not previously part of reported backlog as customers' willingness to commit to long lead time purchases diminishes. For that reason, we maintain a supply of finished goods top drives to rapidly satisfy top drive demand. We consider a product sales order as backlog when the customer has signed a purchase contract; submitted the purchase order; and, if required by the purchase agreement, paid a deposit. Revenue from services is recognized as the services are rendered, based upon agreed daily, hourly, or job rates. Accordingly, we have no backlog for services.
Our top drive sales backlog at December 31, 2016 was 10 units with a total potential revenue value of $9.3 million, compared to eight units with a total potential revenue value of $7.2 million at December 31, 2015. The backlog revenue varies depending on the product mix and the scope of the equipment supplied. 
We have the ability to adjust our top drive assembly capacity to meet current and expected customer demand. In the past, we reduced our assembly operations substantially in response to market conditions and later, when conditions improved, we expanded them to meet demand.
Tubular Services segment
Our Tubular Services segment includes a suite of proprietary offerings, as well as conventional casing and tubing running services for both onshore and offshore markets. These services are typically contracted on a callout basis. Casing is steel pipe that is installed in oil, natural gas, or geothermal wells to maintain the pressure and structural integrity of the well bore, isolate water bearing surface sands, prevent communication between subsurface strata, and provide structural support of the wellhead and other casing and tubing strings in the well. Most operators and drilling contractors install casing and tubing using service companies like ours that use specialized equipment and personnel trained for this purpose. Wells can have from two to ten casing strings of various sizes installed. These jobs encompass wells from vertical holes to high angle extended reach wells and include both onshore and offshore applications. Our Tubular Services business segment also includes the sale of new and used Casing Drive System ("CDSTM") tools and accessories.
Our patented "CDS" is a tool which facilitates running, reaming and drilling casing into a well bore on most rigs equipped with a top drive. This tool offers improved safety and efficiency over traditional methods by eliminating operations that are associated with high risk of personal injury. It also increases the likelihood that the casing can be run to casing point on the first attempt, offers the ability to simultaneously rotate and reciprocate the casing string as required while circulating drilling fluid and requires fewer people on the rig for casing running operations than traditional methods.
We developed and employ a suite of complementary tools within our tubular services business. Our Side Entry Swivel Sub ("SESS") tool works in conjunction with the "CDS" tool to allow rotation and reciprocation of the casing string during cementing operations. Reciprocation and rotation is recognized by the industry as greatly improving uniformity and quality around the casing, in turn helping to reduce the potential of environmental incidents and future intervention costs. Our Multi-Plug Launching System ("MPLS"), expected to be launched in the market in Q1 2017, complements our "SESS" and "CDS" tools. Its stackable design allows for a compact, robust, and user friendly system for most rig types. It gives us the ability to launch the vast majority of our customers’ cement plugs and significantly reduces the transition time between casing running and cementing operations. In 2016,

we commercialized our Wireless Torque and Tension System ("TesTORK"), which ensures greater accuracy to the make-up of premium casing connections.
We offer a full range of offshore casing and tubing running services, in both deep water and shelf applications. Tesco believes it has the industry leading equipment and highly trained personnel available to run everything from the largest casing strings to the most complex completions. As part of our suite of equipment, we have the Multiple Control Line Running System ("MCLRSTM") which is a proprietary and patented technology for running DW completions, as well as ultra-high torque power tongs and handling equipment available to run casing strings of up to 1250 tons.
Our conventional service offerings provide automated and manual equipment and personnel for the installation of tubing and casing, including power tongs, pick-up/lay-down units, torque monitoring services for new well construction and work-over and re-entry operations.
Markets and Competition
Our Tubular Services customers primarily consist of oil and natural gas operating companies, including major and independent "E&P" companies; "NOCs"; drilling contractors; and other service companies, particularly those providing integrated project management services to operating companies that under these projects have contractual obligations to provide tubular running and handling services. Demand for our tubular services strongly depends upon capital spending of oil and natural gas companies, the actual number of wells drilled by these companies, and the complexity of the wells drilled.
The tubular services market consists generally of very few large, global operators and a large number of small and medium-sized operators that typically operate in limited geographic areas where the market is highly fragmented. The largest global competitors in the service market are Weatherford International, Ltd., Franks International, Inc. and Baker Hughes Incorporated. The largest global competitors for the "CDS" equipment sales are Volant and "NOV". Competition in the service and "CDS" equipment sales market takes place primarily on the basis of price, safety, service quality, utility and quality of the equipment provided and the proximity of the service provider and equipment to the work site. We leverage our existing global infrastructure to maintain a competitive tubular service and "CDS" equipment sales business that is able to respond to customer needs in most regions of the world. We believe that the demand for our proprietary automated tubular services will increase as non-conventional drilling technologies such as directional and horizontal drilling are more frequently implemented in new wells being drilled.
While we are aware of competitive technology similar to our "CDS" tool, we believe that we continue to be a market leader in this technology. Our "CDS" system is easily and quickly installed on any top drive system, and we offer skilled and trained personnel at the field level who have specialized knowledge of top drive drilling system operations.
Research and Engineering segment
As a technology-driven company, we continue to invest significantly in research and development activities, primarily related to the further development and enhancement of our automated product offerings. We hold rights, through patents and patent license agreements, to patented and/or patent pending technologies for certain innovations that we believe will have application to our core businesses. We pursue patent protection in appropriate jurisdictions including, but not limited to, the United States, Canada and Europe, where we believe our innovations could have significant potential application to our core businesses. We generally retain all intellectual property rights to our technology through non-disclosure and technology ownership agreements with our employees, suppliers, consultants and other third parties with whom we do business.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, we invested 4.3% of our revenue in research and engineering activities. We expect to continue to invest in the development, commercialization, and enhancement of proprietary technologies.
Corporate and Other
The Corporate and Other segment consists of expense at the corporate level, which includes executive management, general and administrative costs, selling, marketing and other expenses that are not directly related to or allocated down to other segments in our internal reporting.

(1) On June 4, 2012, we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets of the Casing Drilling segment to the Schlumberger Group. 
Procurement of Materials and Supplies
We believe that materials and components used in our servicing and assembly operations and purchased for sales are generally available from multiple sources. The prices paid by us for our raw materials may be affected by, among other things, energy, steel and other commodity prices; tariffs and duties on imported materials; foreign currency exchange rates and the general level of activity within our industry. For a discussion of the procurement of materials and supplies, see Part II, Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 12" included in this Report.
Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal cycles associated with winter-only, summer-only, dry-season, or regulatory-based access to drilling locations. The most significant of these occur in Canada and Russia, where traditionally, the first and fourth calendar quarters of each year are the busiest, as certain drilling locations are only accessible when frozen. As of December 31, 2016, approximately 17% of our top drive rental fleet was located in Canada and Russia.
In certain regions in Asia Pacific, South America, and the Gulf of Mexico we are subject to a decline in activities due to seasonal rains and storms. Further, seasonal variations in the demand for hydrocarbons and accessibility of certain drilling locations in North America can affect our business as our activity generally follows the active drilling rig count. We seek to actively manage our asset base around the world to minimize the impact of geographically specific seasonality.
Customers

Our accounts receivable are principally with major independent "E&P" companies, other oil field services companies, and "NOCs" and are subject to normal industry credit risks. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of customers and grant credit based upon past payment history, financial condition and anticipated industry conditions. Customer payments are regularly monitored and a provision for doubtful accounts is established based upon specific situations and overall industry conditions. Many of our customers are located in international areas that are inherently subject to risks of economic, political and civil instabilities, including the effects of currency fluctuations and exchange controls, such as devaluation of foreign currencies and other economic problems, which may impact our ability to collect those accounts receivable. We monitor customers who are at risk for non-payment and will, if warranted by the set of circumstances, lower available credit extended to those customers or establish alternative arrangements, including increased deposit requirements or payment schedules.
No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our consolidated revenue in the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Employees
As of December 31, 2016, the total number of our employees worldwide was 1,215. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees. We seek to maintain a high level of employee satisfaction and we believe our employee compensation systems are competitive. As required by local regulations in Argentina, our employees, representing approximately 10% of total employees, are subject to union contracts. As of February 28, 2017 the total number of our employees worldwide was approximately 1,184.
