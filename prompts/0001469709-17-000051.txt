ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction

We are a development stage company and are focused on delivering targeted therapies. We are developing our ACX-31 program to deliver two chemotherapy drugs, temozolomide in combination with BCNU, locally to brain tumor sites. Our ACX-31 program is based on an issued patent licensed from Accelerating Combination Therapies LLC which is co-owned by Dr. Henry Brem, Director of the Neurosurgery Department at Johns Hopkins University (ACL License). We are collaborating in the development of our ACX-31 program with Dr. Henry Brem who built one of the largest brain tumor research and treatment centers in the world at Johns Hopkins University. Dr. Brem is a pioneer in the development of local drug delivery treatments, and invented and developed Gliadel® which is a FDA approved, local chemotherapy for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. We entered into an agreement with the Yissum Research Development Company of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Ltd. (Yissum) to develop and supply a polymeric formulation of a combination of temozolomide and BCNU. Professor Avi Domb of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem had previously worked on the formulation of Gliadel® and leads the development efforts provided by Yissum. We are also developing other cancer therapies combining our ACX-31 polymer wafer formulation with other drugs, such as DelMar Pharmaceuticals VAL-083 (dianhydrogalactitol), or a PARP inhibitor. We cannot assure you that we will be successful with our development activities. 
Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company

As a company with less than $1.0 billion in revenue, we qualify as an "emerging growth company" as defined in the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. An emerging growth company may take advantage of specified reduced reporting and other burdens that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include:

·
 exemption from the auditor attestation requirement on the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting; 
 ·
 reduced disclosure about the company's executive compensation arrangements; and 
 ·
 no requirements for non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements. 

We may take advantage of these provisions until December 31, 2017 or such earlier time that we are no longer an emerging growth company. We would cease to be an emerging growth company if we have more than $1.0 billion in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our capital stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced burdens. To the extent that we take advantage of these reduced burdens, the information that we provide stockholders may be different than you might get from other public companies in which you hold equity interests. 

Section 107(b) of the JOBS Act provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. Thus, an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this extended transition period and, as a result, we will adopt new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for other companies.

Development Pipeline

We are a development stage company and focused on the targeted delivery of therapies through the use of innovative technologies. We are developing our ACX-31 program to deliver two chemotherapy drugs, temozolomide in combination with BCNU, locally to brain tumor sites. Temozolomide is a generic, approved chemotherapy drug that is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme concomitantly with radiotherapy and then as maintenance treatment. Local delivery of temozolomide has been demonstrated to be superior to oral administration in an animal model. In the scientific publication at Johns Hopkins University Brem S, Tyler BM, Li K, Pradilla G, Legnani F, Caplan J, et al. Local delivery of temozolomide by biodegradable polymers is superior to oral administration in a rodent glioma model. Cancer Chemother Pharmacol 2007;60:643-50, it was demonstrated that that intracranial concentrations of temozolomide increased threefold compared with orally delivered temozolomide. In a rodent glioma model, animals treated with a single temozolomide polymer (50% w/w) had a median survival of 28 days (P < 0.001 vs. controls, P < 0.001 vs. oral treatment), whereas animals treated with oral temozolomide had a median survival of 22 days compared to control animals (median survival of 13 days). 

5

Animals treated with two temozolomide polymers (50% w/w) had a median survival of 92 days (P < 0.001 vs. controls, P < 0.001 vs. oral treatment). The percentage of long-term survivors (LTS) for groups receiving intracranial temozolomide ranged from 25 to 37.5%; there were no LTS with oral temozolomide treatment. Animals treated with radiation therapy (XRT) and intracranial temozolomide (median survival not reached, LTS = 87.5%) demonstrated improved survival compared to those with intracranial temozolomide alone (median survival, 41 days; LTS = 37.5%), or oral temozolomide and XRT (median survival, 43 days, LTS = 38.9%). BCNU (carmustine) is a chemotherapy drug that is contained in Gliadel®, a biodegradable polymer that is implanted locally into the resection cavity after surgical removal of a brain tumor and is indicated for the treatment of newly diagnosed and recurrent glioblastoma multiforme. In another scientific publication at Johns Hopkins University Renard Recinos V, Tyler BM, Brem H, et al. Combination of intracranial temozolomide with intracranial carmustine improves survival when compared with either treatment alone in a rodent glioma model. Neurosurgery 2010; 66:530-537, it was shown that the additive effect of combined delivery of local temozolomide with local BCNU, especially in combination with radiotherapy, was significantly more effective than delivery of either drug alone or one systemically and one locally, either with or without radiation. Groups treated with combination of local temozolomide, local BCNU and radiation therapy had 75% long-term survivors.

We are also developing other cancer therapies combining our ACX-31 polymer wafer formulation with other drugs. In our collaboration with DelMar Pharmaceuticals, we are formulating within our proprietary ACX-31 implantable polymer wafer a combination of locally delivered VAL-083 with temozolomide and/or BCNU for the treatment of brain cancer. After the filing of a new patent application related to the combination therapy of a PARP inhibitor and our ACX-31 local temozolomide slow-release wafer polymer formulation for the treatment of solid tumors, we are formulating and studying such a combination therapy.

The development of our programs is estimated to cost approximately $5-7 million over 4-5 years as a standalone company. However, we may seek to pursue a strategic collaboration partnership which may accelerate the development timeline, share expenses, and also provide access to ex-US markets. The development of our programs may also cost substantially more than $5-7 million and may require a substantially longer development timeline than 4-5 years. Higher development expenses and delays may be caused by but are not limited to sub-optimal product performance and continued product optimization cycles, adverse clinical results and repeat of clinical trials, or delays of an FDA approval. In such a scenario, we may not be able to secure sufficient funding or a strategic collaboration partnership and could cease operations under such circumstances.

We are actively seeking additional capital investment. We cannot assure you that we will have access to the necessary funding or that if available it will be available on terms that are not dilutive to our present shareholders. If the funding is not available, we may have to severely curtail or cease operations. 

ACL License

On August 11, 2015 (Effective Date), we entered into an exclusive license agreement (ACL License) with Accelerating Combination Therapies LLC (ACL) in regards to the exclusive licensing of the issued U.S. Patent No. 8,895,597 B2 Combination of Local Temozolomide with Local BCNU (Patent Rights). ACL is beneficially owned by the original Patent Rights holders and Inventors Violette Renard Recinos, Betty Tyler, Sarah Brem Sunshine and Henry Brem (Inventors) who assigned the Patent Rights to ACL. Henry Brem is the Harvey Cushing Professor of Neurosurgery, Director of the Department of Neurosurgery, and Neurosurgeon-in-Chief at The Johns Hopkins University, and invented and developed Gliadel® wafers to deliver local chemotherapy to brain tumors. Betty Tyler is Associate Professor of Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University. Violette Renard Recinos is a Neurosurgeon at the Cleveland Clinic. The Patent Rights relate to formulations for chemotherapy, especially of brain tumors such as gliomas. They claim a composition for treating an individual with a solid tumor comprising a combination of BCNU and temozolomide in a pharmaceutically acceptable polymeric carrier for sustained local administration of an effective amount of BCNU and temozolomide to reduce tumor size or prolong survival of the individual with greater efficacy or reduced systemic side effects as compared to administration of either BCNU or temozolomide systemically (Invention). Under the ACL License, we obtained rights to develop and commercialize the Patent Rights, and have been granted the right to sublicense to third parties. The ACL License requires us to initiate a first human clinical trial within 30 months and to pay ACL royalties and other consideration which includes (i) a license issue fee of 1,000,000 shares of the Companys common stock to be issued within 6 months after the Effective Date; (ii) reimbursement of past patent expenses of $19,392; (iii) license maintenance fees of $8,000 annually until the first commercial sale; (iv) running royalties of 4% of net sales; and (v) certain minimum annual royalties and milestone payments. The ACL License remains in effect from the Effective Date until expiration of the Patent Rights. For a full description of payment obligations and the ACL License itself, the license agreement is filed and can be reviewed as an exhibit to the Form 8-K as filed on August 12, 2015.

 https://www.google.com/patents/US8895597

Background of the Invention:

New strategies are needed to improve the outcome of patients with adult glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). In addition to surgical resection (Rostomily et al. Baillieres Clin Neurol 5:345-369, 1996) and radiotherapy (Castro et al. Pharmacol Ther 98:71-108, 2003), numerous chemotherapeutic agents have been used to treat this disease (Parney et al. Cancer J 9:149-156, 2003), but limitations including poor central nervous system drug penetration and dose limiting toxicities have restricted their use (Rautioa et al. Curr Pharm Des 10:1341-1353, 2004). Temozolomide (TMZ), given orally as Temodar®, has been shown in randomized, placebo controlled, multi-institutional clinical trials, to be effective in prolonging survival and has received FDA approval for the treatment of newly diagnosed (Stupp et al. J Clin Oncol 20:1375-1382, 2002; Stupp et al. N Engl J Med 352:987-996, 2005) or recurrent (Yung et al. J Clin Oncol 17:2762-2771, 1999) malignant glioma. TMZ is an imidazotetrazine second-generation alkylating agent which, when given with radiation treatment has been shown to extend median survival 2.5 months compared to radiation alone (Stupp 2005) (Temodar® dose of 150-200 mg/m2). Higher doses of Temodar®, which might increase efficacy, are associated with dose-limiting myelosuppression including severe leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (Stupp 2002, 2005; Yung 1999; Gerber et al. Neuro Oncol 9:47-52, 2007). Research efforts have been directed towards local delivery of agents to the site of the tumor to achieve maximal drug concentrations while limiting toxicity. Recent advances in the local delivery of chemotherapeutic agents have shown encouraging results in the treatment of patients with malignant gliomas. See Attenello 2008; Soffietti et al. Anticancer Drugs 18:621-632, 2007; Raza et al. Expert Opin Biol Ther 5:477-494, 2005. While a number of therapeutic clinical trials are currently underway, there continues to be a limited number of agents in the armamentarium to effectively combat this disease. Gliadel®, a biodegradable polymer containing the alkylating agent Carmustine (BCNU), is implanted locally into the surgical bed at the time of high grade glioma resection, and has been shown to increase survival in both newly diagnosed (Brem et al. J Neurooncol 26:111-123, 1995; Westphal et al. Neuro Oncol 5:79-88, 2003; Valtonen et al. Neurosurgery 41:44-48, 1997; Westphal et al. Acta Neurochir (Wien) 148:269-275, 2006) and recurrent (Brem et al. Lancet 345:1008-1012, 1995) malignant gliomas. Alklyating agents, such as BCNU and TMZ, have clearly shown effective dose-response cytotoxicity for many glioma cell lines in vitro (Raza 2005; Wedge Anticancer Drugs 8:92-97, 1997). The maximal doses for each drug, however, are limited due to dose dependent systemic toxicity. To this end, Gliadel® is used to maximize local concentrations of BCNU and minimize systemic exposure. Based on similar principles and on the fact that systemic toxicity has been observed as a dose limiting factor for TMZ (Stupp 2005; Gerber 2007; Brock et al. Cancer Res 58:4363-4348, 1998), it has been shown in rodents that intracranial delivery of TMZ has improved efficacy when compared to the systemic administration of TMZ (Brem 2007).

Recent clinical evidence has suggested that treatment with a combination of modalities consisting of surgical excision, locally delivered BCNU, concurrent and adjuvant systemic TMZ, and radiotherapy is safe and effective, and provides improved survival compared to each treatment group alone. See Menei 2008; McGirt 2010; La Rocca 2008; Gururangan et al. Neuro Oncol 3:246-250, 2001; Pan et al. J Neurooncol 88:353-357, 2008. These clinical advances in glioma therapy, with multimodality treatments, have led to an improvement in expected survival for GBM from 9 to 20 months (Menei Biodegradable carmustine-impregnated wafers (Gliadel®): the French experience. Presented at the 8th Congress of the European Association of Neurooncology, Barcellona, Spain, Sep. 12-14, 2008; McGirt Gliadel (BCNU) wafer plus concomitant temozolomide therapy after primary resection of glioblastoma multiforme J Neurosurg (2010 in press); La Rocca A phase 2 study of multi-modal therapy with surgery, carmustine (BCNU) wafer, radiation therapy (RT), and temozolomide (TMZ) in patients (pts) with newly diagnosed supratentorial malignant glioma (MG) Presented at the 8th Congress of the European Association of Neurooncology, Barcellona, Spain, Sep. 12-14, 2008; Attenello et al. Ann Surg Oncol 15:2887-2893, 2008.

Although the survival time has increased from nine to twenty months, on average, there remains a critical need for even greater prolongation of survival, preferably while maintaining the best possible quality of life.

It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide compositions providing significantly great efficacy in treating tumors, with far fewer side effects that limit the dosage that can be used, and cause patient discomfort.

Summary of the Invention:

The additive effect of combined intracranial carmustine (BCNU) with intracranial temozolomide (TMZ), and particularly in combination with radiation (XRT), in the treatment of two rat intracranial glioma models, the 9L gliosarcoma and the F98 glioma, demonstrates that local, preferably sustained, delivery of both drugs, especially in combination with radiation, is far more effective than delivery of either drug alone or one systemically and one locally, either with or without radiation. TMZ and BCNU were incorporated into biodegradable polymer discs that were implanted in F344 rats bearing established intracranial tumors useful as glioma models, the 9L gliosarcoma and the F98 glioma. In the 9L rodent glioma model, groups treated with the combination of local TMZ, local BCNU, and radiation (XRT) had 75% long-term survivors (LTS), which was superior to the combination of local TMZ and local BCNU (median survival of 95 days, LTS=25%) and the combination of oral TMZ, local BCNU and XRT (median survival of 62 days, LTS=12.5%). In order to simulate the effect of this treatment in chemo-resistant gliomas, a second rodent model was used with the F98 glioma, a cell line relatively resistant to alkylating agents due to expression of high levels of alkyltransferase, an enzyme that deactivates alkylating agents and is the major mechanism of resistance of gliomas. The triple therapy showed a significant improvement in survival when compared to controls (p=0.0004), local BCNU (p=0.0043), oral TMZ (p=0.0026), local TMZ (p=0.0105), and the combinations of either BCNU and XRT (p=0.0378) or oral TMZ and local BCNU (p=0.0154).

The survival of tumor-bearing animals in the 9L and F98 glioma models was improved with the local delivery of BCNU and TMZ, especially when combined with XRT, when compared with either treatment alone and with the clinically used modality of oral TMZ, local BCNU and XRT.

UCSF License

On September 16, 2014 (Effective Date), we entered into an exclusive license agreement (UCSF License) with the Regents of the University of California acting through its Office of Innovation, Technology, and Alliances, University of California San Francisco (UCSF) in regards to the exclusive licensing of a medical stereotactic device for the delivery of therapeutics to the human brain, characterized as Microinjection Brain Catheter, a.k.a. BranchPoint device ("Invention"). The invention was made in the course of research at UCSF by Drs. Daniel A. Lim, Matthew Silvestrini, and Tejal A. Desai, (collectively, the Inventors) and claimed in U.S. Patent Application No. PCT/US2013/052301, Microinjection Catheter; UC Case No. SF2012-063 (Patent Rights). The Invention was developed under funding from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine ("CIRM") and sponsored in part by the National Institutes of Health. The UCSF License remains in effect from the Effective Date until expiration or abandonment of the Patent Rights.

Under the UCSF License, we are obligated to develop, manufacture, market and sell the invention, and have been granted the right to sublicense to third parties. Specifically, the UCSF License requires us to: (i) market the Invention for research use within three (3) months from the Effective Date; (ii) sell the Invention for research use within 12 months of the Effective Date; (iii) file and finalize any necessary regulatory documentation for FDA 510(k) approval within 6 months after the 510(k) application has been filed; (iv) market the Invention for clinical use within 6 months of receiving market approval from FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory agency; (v) sell the Invention for clinical use within 12 months of receiving market approval from FDA or equivalent foreign regulatory agency; (vi) within 1 year of the Effective Date, raise at least $750,000 in funding or revenue; (vii) market the Invention in the United States within 6 months of receiving approval from the FDA; and (viii) use commercially reasonable efforts to fill the market demand for the Invention following commencement of marketing. We are also required to pay UCSF 35% of our net sales or any sublicense royalty as defined therein, and a non-refundable license issue fee of $50,000. For a full description of further payment obligations and the UCSF License itself, the license agreement was filed as exhibit 10.1 to the Form 8-K as of September 17, 2014.

Government Regulation of Pharmaceutical Products

The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development, manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other federal, state, and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, tracking, approval, import, export, advertising, and promotion of our products.

The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

8

·
 nonclinical laboratory and animal tests, including some that must be conducted in accordance with Good Laboratory Practices; 
 ·
 submission of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin; 
 ·
 adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug candidate for its intended use; 
 ·
 pre-approval inspection of manufacturing facilities and selected clinical investigators for their compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and Good Clinical Practices; and 
 ·
 FDA approval of an NDA to permit commercial marketing for particular indications for use.

The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort, and financial resources. Prior to commencing the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial by imposing a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND may not result in FDA authorization to commence a clinical trial. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial and its informed consent form before the clinical trial commences at that center. Regulatory authorities or an institutional review board or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Some studies also include a data safety monitoring board, which receives special access to unblinded data during the clinical trial and may halt the clinical trial if it determines that there is an unacceptable safety risk for subjects or other grounds, such as no demonstration of efficacy.

In general, for purposes of NDA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.

·
 Phase 1: Studies are initially conducted to test the product candidate for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion in healthy volunteers or patients. 
 ·
 Phase 2: Studies are conducted with groups of patients with a specified disease or condition to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule, and expanded evidence of safety. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 ·
 Phase 3: These clinical trials are undertaken in larger patient populations to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy, and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. These trials may be done globally to support global registrations.

The FDA generally requires that sponsors successfully complete two Phase 3 studies to obtain approval for a new drug, though in certain circumstances a single Phase 3 study is sufficient. The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved. These so-called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to be satisfied after approval. The results of Phase 4 studies can confirm the effectiveness of a product candidate and can provide important safety information.

Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate, as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.

ANDA Approval Process

The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, established abbreviated FDA approval procedures for drugs that are shown to be equivalent to proprietary drugs previously approved by the FDA through its NDA process. Approval to market and distribute these drugs is obtained by filing an abbreviated NDA, or ANDA, with the FDA. An ANDA is a comprehensive submission that contains, among other things, data and information pertaining to the active pharmaceutical ingredient, drug product formulation, specifications, and stability of the generic drug, as well as analytical methods, manufacturing process validation data, and quality control procedures. Premarket applications for 

9

generic drugs are termed abbreviated because they generally do not include preclinical and clinical data to demonstrate safety and effectiveness. Instead, a generic applicant must demonstrate that its product is bioequivalent to the innovator drug. In certain situations, an applicant may obtain ANDA approval of a generic product with a strength or dosage form that differs from a referenced innovator drug pursuant to the filing and approval of an ANDA suitability petition. The FDA will approve the generic product as suitable for an ANDA application if it finds that the generic product does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness as compared to the innovator product. A product is not eligible for ANDA approval if the FDA determines that it is not equivalent to the referenced innovator drug, if it is intended for a different use, or if it is not subject to an approved suitability petition. However, such a product might be approved under an NDA, with supportive data from clinical trials.

505(b)(2) Approval Process

Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA provides an alternate regulatory pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved drug products. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) permits the filing of an NDA where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. The applicant may rely upon the FDA's findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved product that acts as the Reference Listed Drug, or RLD. The FDA may also require 505(b)(2) applicants to perform additional studies or measurements to support the change from the RLD. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the labeled indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Orange Book Listing

In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, including a 505(b)(2) NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA certain patents whose claims cover the applicant's product. Upon approval of an NDA, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, also known as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA seeking approval of a generic equivalent version of a drug listed in the Orange Book or a 505(b)(2) NDA referencing a drug listed in the Orange Book must certify to the FDA that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA; (2) such patent has expired; (3) the date on which such patent expires; or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use, or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. This last certification is known as a Paragraph IV certification. If the competitor has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the competitor must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the holder of the NDA for the RLD and the patent owner once the application has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA holder or patent owner may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification prevents the FDA from approving the application until the earlier of 30 months from the date of the lawsuit, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the applicant. The applicant may also elect to submit a "Section VIII" statement certifying that its proposed label does not contain, or carves out, any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. 

NDA Submission and Review by the FDA

The results of product development, nonclinical studies, and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. The submission of an NDA requires payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. The FDA reviews applications to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the manufacturing controls are adequate to assure and preserve the product's identity, strength, quality, and purity. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Once the NDA submission has been accepted for filing, which occurs, if at all, within 60 days after submission of the NDA, the FDA's goal for a non-priority review of a 505(b)(2) NDA is ten months to complete the review process for the application and respond to the applicant, which can take the form of either a Complete Response Letter or Approval. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information, studies, or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of an NDA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information, and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product. FDA approval of any NDA submitted by us will be at a time the FDA chooses. Also, if regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing regulatory standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the 

10

marketplace. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 post-marketing studies to monitor the effect of approved products, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.

Post-Approval Requirements

Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences. Drug and biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. We cannot be certain that we or our present or future suppliers will be able to comply with the cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements. If our present or future suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements, the FDA may halt our clinical trials, require us to recall a product from distribution, or withdraw approval of the NDA.

The FDA closely regulates the marketing and promotion of drugs. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity, and potency that are approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising, and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product's labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer's communications on the subject of off-label use.

Moreover, the recently enacted Drug Supply Chain Security Act imposes new obligations on manufacturers of pharmaceutical products related to product and tracking and tracing. Among the requirements of this new legislation, manufacturers will be required to provide certain information regarding the drug products to individuals and entities to which product ownership is transferred, label drug product with a product identifier, and keep certain records regarding the drug product. The transfer of information to subsequent product owners by manufacturers will eventually be required to be done electronically. Manufacturers will also be required to verify that purchasers of the manufacturers' products are appropriately licensed. Further, under this new legislation, manufactures will have drug product investigation, quarantine, disposition, and notification responsibilities related to counterfeit, diverted, stolen, and intentionally adulterated products, as well as products that are the subject of fraudulent transactions or which are otherwise unfit for distribution such that they would be reasonably likely to result in serious health consequences or death.

Medical Device Approval Process

Medical devices are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the US. The Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act) and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern the research, design, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, safety, approval or clearance, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, servicing, promotion, import and export, and distribution of medical devices. 

Unless an exemption applies, each medical device we wish to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either prior premarket notification, or 510(k) clearance, or premarket approval (PMA) from the FDA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes. Devices requiring fewer controls because they are deemed to pose lower risk are placed in Class I or II. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, premarket notification, and adherence to the FDAs Quality System Regulation (a set of current good manufacturing practice requirements put forth by the FDA which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of finished devices) (QSR). Class II devices are subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, as well as general controls. Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the premarket notification, or 510(k), clearance requirement or the requirement of compliance with certain provisions of the QSR. Devices are placed in Class III, which requires approval of a PMA application, if insufficient information exists to determine that the application of general controls or special controls are sufficient to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness, or they are life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or the FDA deems these devices to be not substantially equivalent either to a previously 510(k) cleared device or to a pre-amendment Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which PMA applications have not been required. A PMA application must be supported by valid scientific evidence, which typically requires extensive data, including technical, pre-clinical, clinical, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDAs satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device. A PMA application must include, among other things, a complete description of the device and its components, a detailed description of the methods, facilities and controls

used to manufacture the device, and proposed labeling. A PMA application also must be accompanied by a user fee, unless exempt. For example, the FDA does not require the submission of a user fee for a small businesss first PMA. After a PMA application is submitted and found to be sufficiently complete, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information, or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA maybe convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the FDA generally will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with the QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures. 

The FDA can delay, limit, or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:

·
 the product may not be safe or effective to the FDAs satisfaction; 
 ·
 the data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval; 
 ·
 the manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements; and 
 ·
 changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 

If the FDA evaluations of both the PMA application and the manufacturing facilities are favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions which must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device for certain indications. If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA may also determine that additional clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed while the trials are conducted and the data acquired is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. Even with additional trials, the FDA may not approve the PMA application. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain, and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved for marketing. 

New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling and device specifications, materials or design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel. 

Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA application, and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) to the FDA. If a trial is considered a Non-Significant Risk (NSR) study subject to abbreviated IDE regulations, a formal IDE submission is not required by the FDA. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent form are approved by appropriate institutional review boards (IRBs) at the clinical trial sites. The FDAs approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the products safety and effectiveness, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDAs IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and effectiveness success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product.

Delays in receipt of or failure to receive FDA approval, the withdrawal of previously received approvals, or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if granted, the approvals may include significant limitations on the intended use and indications for use for which our products may be marketed. 

After a device is approved or cleared and placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: 

·
 establishing registration and device listing; 

12

·
 implementing QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures; 
 ·
 labeling regulations, which prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or off-label uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; 
 ·
 medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur; and 
 ·
 corrections and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FD&C Act that may present a risk to health. 

Also, the FDA may require us to conduct post market studies or order us to establish and maintain a system for tracking our products through the chain of distribution to the patient level. The FDA enforces regulatory requirements by conducting periodic, unannounced inspections and market surveillance.


Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including those applicable to the conduct of our clinical trials, can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may lead to any of the following sanctions: 

·
 warning letters; 
 ·
 fines and civil penalties; 
 ·
 unanticipated expenditures; 
 ·
 delays in approving or refusal to approve our applications, including supplements; 
 ·
 withdrawal of FDA approval; 
 ·
 product recall or seizure; 
 ·
 interruption of production; 
 ·
 operating restrictions; 
 ·
 injunctions; and 
 ·
 criminal prosecution. 

Our products will need to be manufactured in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, equipment, purchase and handling of components, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections If the FDA believes that we are not in compliance with QSR, it can shut down the manufacturing operations, require recall of our products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations, or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees. Any such action by the FDA would have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with all applicable FDA regulations. 

Non-FDA Government Regulation 

The advertising of our products will be subject to both FDA and Federal Trade Commission regulations. In addition, the sale and marketing of our products will be subject to a complex system of federal and state laws and regulations intended to deter, detect, and respond to fraud and abuse in the healthcare system. These laws and regulations restrict and may prohibit pricing, discounting, commissions and other commercial practices that may be typical outside of the healthcare business. In particular, anti-kickback and self-referral laws and regulations will limit our flexibility in crafting promotional programs and other financial arrangements in connection with the sale of our products and related services, especially with respect to physicians seeking reimbursement through Medicare or Medicaid. These federal laws include, by way of example, the following: 

·
 the anti-kickback statute prohibits certain business practices and relationships that might affect the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by Medicare or other federal healthcare programs; 

 ·
 the physician self-referral prohibition, commonly referred to as the Stark Law, which prohibits referrals by physicians of Medicare or Medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated healthcare services in which 

13

the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership interests or with which they have certain other financial arrangements; 
 ·
 the anti-inducement law, which prohibits providers from offering anything to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program; 
 ·
 the Civil False Claims Act, which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by the federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs; and 
 ·
 the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, which authorizes the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts. 

Sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions, damage assessments, money penalties, imprisonment, denial of Medicare and Medicaid payments, or exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or both. These laws also impose an affirmative duty on those receiving Medicare or Medicaid funding to ensure that they do not employ or contract with persons excluded from the Medicare and other government programs. 

Many states have adopted or are considering legislative proposals similar to the federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which extend beyond the Medicare and Medicaid programs to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self-referrals regardless of whether the service was reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid. Many states have also adopted or are considering legislative proposals to increase patient protections, such as limiting the use and disclosure of patient-specific health information. These state laws typically impose criminal and civil penalties similar to the federal laws. 

In the ordinary course of their business, medical device manufacturers and suppliers have been and are subject regularly to inquiries, investigations and audits by federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations. Recent federal and state legislation has greatly increased funding for investigations and enforcement actions, which have increased dramatically over the past several years. This trend is expected to continue. Private enforcement of healthcare fraud also has increased, due in large part to amendments to the Civil False Claims Act in 1986 that were designed to encourage private persons to sue on behalf of the government. These whistleblower suits by private persons, known as qui tam relaters, may be filed by almost anyone, including physicians and their employees and patients, our employees, and even competitors. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), in addition to its privacy provisions, created a series of new healthcare-related crimes. 

Competition

The business for delivery of therapeutics is highly competitive, while our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological change. Our products must gain acceptance by the medical community and show clinically meaningful advantages in performance, and we may face competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, academic institutions, government agencies, research institutions, and others.

Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources than we have. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and medical device industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop or market products or other novel technologies that are more effective, safer, or less costly than any that will be commercialized by us, or obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop, and manage a portfolio of products that are safer, more efficacious, and/or more cost-effective than alternative therapies.

Backlog

We are in a development stage and do not have any backlog.

Proposed Sales, Marketing and Advertising

We are planning to seek commercial partners to market the products upon approval by the FDA.

Environmental Matters

Laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment have not had and should not have a material impact on our business.

Proprietary Rights

In addition to our licensed patent rights, we have entered into an employment agreement with our CEO and intend to enter into similar agreements with other key employees that require them to keep all of our proprietary information confidential. We cannot assure that such protections will prove adequate should they be challenged in litigation. 
Research and Development

We anticipate that our expenses in 2017 will include product development, contractor expenses, and professional fees. 

Employees

We have three employees and have retained approximately 5 individuals or companies as consultants or independent contractors that are involved in regulatory affairs, product development, scientific advisory and administrative functions. 
Seasonality

We do not anticipate that our business will be seasonal to any material extent.
