 CymaBay Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and providing access to innovative therapies for patients with liver and other chronic diseases with high unmet medical need. 
 Our lead product candidate, seladelpar, is a potent and selective agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR δ), a nuclear receptor that regulates genes involved in bile acid/sterol, lipid and glucose metabolism and inflammation. We are currently developing seladelpar for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), an autoimmune disease that causes progressive destruction of the bile ducts in the liver. We are also planning to develop seladelpar for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a prevalent and serious chronic liver disease caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver that results in inflammation and cellular injury that can progress to fibrosis and cirrhosis, and potentially liver failure and death. 
 Data from two Phase 2 studies of seladelpar in patients with PBC have established seladelpar’s anti-cholestatic and anti-inflammatory effects. In July 2017, we announced positive interim results from an ongoing low-dose Phase 2 study of seladelpar in patients with PBC. In the first part of the study, patients with an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), as characterized by a persistent elevation in alkaline phosphatase (AP), or who were intolerant to UDCA, received either 5 mg or 10 mg of seladelpar once daily. A planned interim analysis of these two dose groups demonstrated after 12 weeks of treatment a significant AP reduction from baseline of 39% and 45% for the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively. After 12 weeks of treatment with seladelpar, 45% of patients in the 5 mg and 82% of patients in the 10 mg dose groups, had AP values < 1.67 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). AP is a recognized biomarker of cholestasis, and reaching a level of < 1.67 ULN is the key component in the composite endpoint used for regulatory approval. In addition to the reduction in AP, patients in both dose groups experienced decreases in other liver markers of cholestasis including gamma glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin. Seladelpar also improved metabolic and inflammatory markers with patients experiencing decreases in low-density lipoprotein-C (LDL-C) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). There were no serious adverse events and no safety transaminase signal was observed at either dose. Instead, mean transaminase levels decreased over the course of treatment, further supporting seladelpar’s anti-inflammatory activity. Consistent with prior studies, there was no signal for drug-induced pruritus. 
 In 2017, we expanded the number of patients in the 5 and 10 mg dose groups of the low-dose study and extended dosing to 52-weeks. In addition, a 2 mg dose group was added in order to identify a minimally effective dose. We expect to report data on a subset of patients in the study through 26-weeks of dosing in the first half of 2018 and a subset through 52-weeks of dosing in the second half of 2018. In the first half of 2018, we also plan to conclude End of Phase 2 discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Scientific Advice discussions with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in order to finalize the design of a Phase 3 study of seladelpar in patients with PBC, which we intend to initiate in the second half of 2018.
 In November 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to seladelpar for the treatment of PBC, and in September 2017, the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) similarly granted orphan drug designation to seladelpar for the treatment of PBC. In October 2016, seladelpar received EMA PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation for the treatment of PBC.
 
We believe that seladelpar could also have utility in the treatment of NASH. Seladelpar was found to reverse NASH pathology, decrease fibrosis, inflammation, hepatic lipids and reverse insulin resistance in the foz/foz mouse, which is a diabetic obese model of NASH. We are currently planning to start a Phase 2 study of seladelpar in patients with NASH in the first half of 2018.

Our second product candidate, arhalofenate, is a dual-acting anti-inflammatory and uric acid lowering agent being developed for the treatment of gout. In 2016, we entered into an exclusive licensing agreement granting Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. (Kowa) the rights to develop and commercialize arhalofenate in the U.S. (including all possessions and territories). Arhalofenate has been studied in five Phase 2 clinical trials in patients with gout and consistently demonstrated the ability to reduce gout flares and reduce serum uric acid (sUA). Gout flares are recurring and painful episodes of joint inflammation that are triggered by the presence of monosodium urate crystals that form as a result of elevated sUA levels. We believe the potential for arhalofenate to prevent or reduce flares while also lowering sUA could differentiate it from currently available treatments for gout and classify it as the first potential drug in what we believe could be a new class of gout therapy referred to as Urate Lowering Anti-Flare Therapy (ULAFT). Arhalofenate has established a favorable safety profile in clinical trials involving over 1,100 subjects exposed to date. Under the terms of the agreement with Kowa, we received an up-front payment of $5 million in January 2017, and in January 2018 received a $5 million milestone payment for the initiation of a study evaluating the pharmacokinetics of arhalofenate in subjects with renal impairment. We are entitled to receive an additional milestone payment of $5 million on the initiation of a Phase 3 study and up to an additional $190 million in payments based upon the achievement of specific development and sales milestones. We are also eligible to receive tiered, double digit royalties on future sales of arhalofenate products. Kowa will be responsible for all development and commercialization costs. We retain full development and commercialization rights for the rest of the world and intend to partner arhalofenate in geographies outside the U.S. and its possessions and territories. 
 We reported net loss of approximately $27.6 million and $26.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, our cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $97.2 million. We believe these funds, together with net proceeds of $135.5 million received in our February 2018 public offering and a $5 million milestone payment received pursuant to our license agreement with Kowa in January 2018, are sufficient to fund our current operating plan into 2021.

CymaBay Pipeline Overview 
 Our pipeline includes three clinical stage product candidates: seladelpar (MBX-8025); arhalofenate (MBX-102) and MBX-2982  
 Seladelpar (MBX-8025) 
 Seladelpar is a selective agonist for the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ). An agonist is a substance that elicits a response by binding to a receptor. The PPARδ receptor is a nuclear receptor that regulates genes involved in lipid, bile acid/sterol and glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and regulation of certain inflammatory cells. Seladelpar has the potential to treat a variety of disorders of lipid metabolism and certain diseases of the liver.

Previously, seladelpar had been in development for the treatment of mixed dyslipidemia, which is characterized by elevated LDL-C and triglycerides (TGs). Results from our Phase 2 clinical study of seladelpar in patients with mixed dyslipidemia established effects of the drug that we believe have the potential to benefit patients affected with other conditions. In this study, seladelpar demonstrated an anti-atherogenic profile in which it lowered LDL-C, decreased the more atherogenic small dense LDL-C particles and raised high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C). In addition, seladelpar decreased TGs and free fatty acids. Seladelpar also decreased C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic and local inflammation. Treatment with seladelpar also resulted in significant reductions in AP and in gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT). Taken together these metabolic improvements suggest that seladelpar can address disorders manifested by increases in LDL-C, increases in TGs, liver cholestasis (the impairment of the flow of bile from the liver) and liver fat accumulation with subsequent inflammation. 
 Based on our understanding of the mechanism of action of seladelpar, our prior clinical experience with the compound, and our evaluation of other possible indications, we decided to focus the development of seladelpar on orphan diseases or more prevalent diseases with high unmet medical need. We currently believe seladelpar may provide a significant benefit for patients with rare cholestatic liver diseases, such as PBC and more prevalent, but high unmet need liver diseases, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). 
 To date, we have completed six-month and twelve-month toxicology studies of seladelpar in rats and monkeys, respectively, as well as two-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats.  In addition, five Phase 1 and three Phase 2 clinical studies with seladelpar have been completed. A fourth Phase 2 clinical study is currently ongoing in patients with PBC. In addition, a long-term safety extension study for PBC patients is currently enrolling patients as they complete 52 weeks of treatment in the ongoing Phase 2 PBC study. 
 Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) 
 PBC is a slowly progressive autoimmune disease of the liver characterized by portal inflammation and immune-mediated destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts. The loss of bile duct function leads to decreased bile secretion and the retention of toxic substances within the liver, resulting in further hepatic damage, fibrosis, cirrhosis and, eventually, liver failure. It is a common cause of liver transplantation. 
 PBC affects primarily women with peak incidence in the fifth decade of life. It has been recognized as an orphan disease both in the U.S. and in the E.U. It is a long-term debilitating and life-threatening disease. Fatigue and pruritus (itching) are the most common presenting symptoms. Pruritus, which occurs in 20 to 70% of patients, can be extremely distressing for patients. Other common findings include jaundice, hyperlipidemia (notably hypercholesterolemia), hypothyroidism, osteopenia and osteoporosis, and coexisting autoimmune diseases. Portal hypertension is a late complication of the disease, as is malabsorption, deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins, and steatorrhea (excess fat in feces). 
 Currently, the only FDA-approved treatments are ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), also known as ursodiol, an isomer of chenodeoxycholic acid and the synthetic bile acid analog obeticholic acid (Ocaliva®, Intercept Pharmaceuticals). Ursodiol decreases serum levels of AP, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, cholesterol, and immunoglobulin M, all of which are elevated in patients with PBC and can serve as biochemical markers of the disease. In a study that combined data from three controlled trials with a total of 548 patients, ursodiol significantly reduced the likelihood of liver transplantation or death after four years. Ursodiol also delayed the progression of hepatic fibrosis in early-stage PBC but was not effective in advanced disease. It is also known that up to 50% of PBC patients fail to respond adequately to ursodiol therapy. 
 Ocaliva was approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency in 2016 for the treatment of PBC in combination with ursodiol in adults with an inadequate response to ursodiol, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate ursodiol. Ocaliva also received orphan designations in the U.S. and the E.U. A Phase 3 study was completed with a primary composite endpoint defined as a responder rate comprised of the percentage of patients with AP < 1.67 times upper limit of normal (ULN) with a decrease in AP of at least 15% and total bilirubin less than or equal to upper limit of normal. This study met its goals and Ocaliva was granted an accelerated approval based on meeting this primary composite endpoint.

Other therapies, such as colchicine, methothrexate, prednisone and multiple immunosuppressive regimens have been attempted. However, these therapies have efficacy that is limited, or unproven and are associated with multiple side-effects impacting tolerance and safety. Liver transplantation improves survival in patients with PBC, and it is the only effective treatment for those with liver failure. Liver transplantation however is problematic because of its costs, the limited availability of donor organs, and by the fact that the disease may recur after an initially successful transplantation.
 As a result, despite the previously mentioned therapeutic interventions, it is recognized that PBC continues to progress in many patients and additional medical treatment is needed to address this disease.
 Additional potential therapies in early stage clinical development for PBC include FXR agonists that act through the same mechanism of action as Ocaliva (tropifexor -LJN452-, GS-9674 and EDP-305), the mixed PPARα/δ agonist elafibranor, the dual PPARδ/γ agonist saroglitazar, the selective NOX inhibitor GKT137831, the oxy-sterol sulfate DUR-928, and the selective S1P receptor modulator etrasimod (APD334). GSK23306772 is an inhibitor of the Intestinal Bile Acid Transporter (IBAT) and is evaluated for the treatment of itch associated with PBC and maralixibat, another IBAT inhibitor, was recently discontinued for this indication due to lack of efficacy. NGM-282, a FGF-19 variant was also studied in PBC, but the clinical program has been re-focused towards the treatment of NASH.
 Phase 2 Studies of Seladelpar in PBC
In November 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 study of seladelpar in patients with PBC. The study was a placebo controlled, double blind, dose ranging study of 12 weeks duration in patients who had an inadequate response to ursodiol, as characterized by a persistent elevation in AP. The study planned to enroll approximately 75 patients who were randomized to receive placebo, 50 or 200 mg daily doses of seladelpar. The goal of the study was to assess whether the improvements in biochemical markers of cholestasis observed previously for seladelpar in other patient populations would be observed in patients with PBC. 
 The primary endpoint was the percent change in AP. A secondary endpoint was the responder rate for patients achieving the composite criteria of serum AP values less than 1.67xULN with a decrease of at least 15% and with normal levels of total bilirubin (TBIL). AP values were blinded, but other secondary endpoints that are also recognized as biochemical markers of cholestasis, such as changes in GGT, TBIL and 5’-nucleotidase, were only blinded with respect to treatment group because they were part of the safety surveillance. 
 During the study, three cases of asymptomatic increases (5-8 times the upper limit of normal) in transaminases were observed (two in the 200 mg and one in the 50 mg cohorts). All three were reversible on discontinuation of treatment and were not accompanied by elevation of TBIL. After unblinding of study data, changes in the primary endpoint AP were analyzed using data available for the 38 subjects enrolled in the study and who had completed at least two weeks of treatment. The primary analysis of changes in AP were calculated using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) as specified in the study statistical analysis plan. 
 The mean decreases from baseline in AP for the 50 and 200 mg dose groups were 53% and 63%, respectively, vs. 2% for placebo (p < 0.0001 for both). There was no statistically meaningful difference in efficacy between both seladelpar groups. All patients on seladelpar who received treatment for 12 weeks (three on 50 mg and two on 200 mg) normalized their AP levels. Thus, in this study seladelpar demonstrated a rapid and potent anti-cholestatic effect in patients with PBC. The lack of a dose response suggested that lower doses could be effective as well. 
 Patients receiving study drug also demonstrated improvements in metabolic parameters, including reductions in LDL-C, and reductions in inflammatory markers (e.g. hs-CRP). Seladelpar was also associated with a decrease in a plasma marker of hepatic bile acid synthesis, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4). Seladelpar did not appear to be associated with drug-induced pruritus. In summary, the study was discontinued early after review of safety and efficacy data demonstrated proof-of-concept for anti-cholestatic effects and it was recognized that another study was needed with further dose reduction to establish optimal clinical safety and efficacy.

In December 2016, we initiated a second Phase 2 study of seladelpar in patients with PBC. A prospectively planned interim analysis was conducted to evaluate the treatment effects of seladelpar. The study is an open label, randomized, dose-ranging study evaluating lower doses of seladelpar and the primary efficacy endpoint is the percent change in AP. Similarly, secondary outcomes are shared with the previous study.
 
In the first part of the study, initially planned for 26 weeks of treatment, patients at high risk of disease progression, with an inadequate response to UDCA, as characterized by a persistent elevation in AP, or who were intolerant to UDCA, received either 5 mg or 10 mg of seladelpar once daily. A planned interim analysis of the first 24 patients enrolled in these two dose groups demonstrated after 12 weeks of treatment a significant AP reduction from baseline of 39% and 45% for the 5 mg and 10 mg groups, respectively. On seladelpar, 45% of patients in the 5 mg and 82% of patients in the 10 mg dose groups had AP values < 1.67 ULN. AP is an established surrogate marker of disease progression in PBC and reaching a level of < 1.67 x ULN is a key component in the composite endpoint used for regulatory approval. Alongside substantial reductions in AP, patients in both dose groups experienced decreases in other liver markers of cholestasis including gamma glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin. Seladelpar also improved metabolic and inflammatory markers with patients experiencing decreases in LDL-C and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP).  There were no serious adverse events and no safety transaminase signal was observed at either dose. Instead, mean transaminase levels decreased over the course of treatment, further supporting seladelpar’s anti-inflammatory activity. Consistent with prior studies, there was no signal for drug-induced pruritus. These results were presented as a late-breaking abstract at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD; Washington DC, October 2017). After sharing preliminary results from this study, the FDA agreed to allow continuation of seladelpar treatment beyond six months for the 5 mg and 10 mg doses. Following the planned interim analysis and in concordance with regulators, the study, in its second part, was thus modified to expand its sample size for the 5 and 10 mg doses (from N=12 per group to N=49 per group), include an additional arm of seladelpar 2 mg/day to complete the dose-ranging evaluation, and extend its duration to 52 weeks. 
 
In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we initiated a long-term safety extension study of seladelpar. The study is open to patients participating in a current or future PBC study that is part of our clinical development program. The first patients initially enrolled in the low dose Phase 2 study were transferred into the long-term safety extension study in December 2017.
 
Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) / Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) 
 NAFLD is a disease characterized by accumulation of fat in the liver in individuals that consume little or low amounts of alcohol (< 70 g/week for women and < 140 g/week for men). Approximately one-third of NAFLD patients develop NASH, which is characterized by inflammation in the liver that is often accompanied by fibrosis. This can progress to cirrhosis, followed by eventual liver failure and death. NASH is the third most common reason for liver transplantation in the United States. NASH is a major challenge to healthcare systems worldwide. NASH is initially a silent disease, the first sign of which may be elevations in transaminases such as alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) from routine blood testing. When further evaluation rules out medications, viral hepatitis, alcohol, etc. as a cause, or when imaging studies of the liver show fat, NASH is suspected. A confirmation of a diagnosis of NASH requires a liver biopsy. 
 There are currently no drugs approved by the FDA for the treatment of NASH. However, several clinical studies have been carried out or are underway with drug candidates that may affect disease outcomes in patients with non-cirrhotic NASH, including Phase 3 studies with OCA (Intercept Pharmaceuticals) and elafibranor (GFT505), a PPARα/δ agonist (Genfit SA), cenicriviroc, a CCR2/5 receptor antagonist (Allergan), and selonsertib, an ASK1 inhibitor (Gilead). Over two dozen other compounds are currently in Phase 2 development in NASH. 
 We believe seladelpar may have utility in treating patients with NASH. Seladelpar is a potent and selective PPARδ agonist, and is a key regulator of lipid metabolism, cholesterol transport, bile acid synthesis, and inflammation/fibrosis. Ligand binding to PPARδ results in activation and repression of its target genes by which it regulates the above processes. In the liver, PPARδ is expressed in hepatocytes, cholangiocytes, Kupffer and stellate cells (Iwaisako et al., 2012; Xia et al., 2012).

The mode of action for seladelpar in NASH was established in a diabetic and dyslipidemic obese mouse model (the foz/foz mouse model; Haczeyni et al., 2017).  These mice develop liver pathology similar to humans with NASH consisting of steatohepatitis complicated by pericellular fibrosis (Van Rooyen et al., 2011; Haczeyni et al., 2015).   The pathogenic progression of NASH and seladelpar’s actions in this model are broadly summarized as follows: (1) The accumulation of fat with an accompanying development of insulin resistance: Seladelpar reduced hepatic steatosis by increasing expression of genes associated with mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, which was accompanied by restoration of full insulin sensitivity; (2) Cell stress and injury response: Seladelpar reduced hepatocellular toxic species, including lipotoxic lipids and free cholesterol, with strong reductions in apoptosis and cell regeneration response to injury.  There was a complete abrogation of cellular ballooning (necroinflammation), which is a defining characteristic of NASH; (3) Initiation and perpetuation of inflammation: Seladelpar treatment led to strong reductions in liver macrophages, which was accompanied by reductions in inflammatory mediators; (4) Extracellular matrix deposition and remodeling: Seladelpar reduced collagen deposition and characteristic fibrogenic transcripts that accompany stellate cell activation and fibrosis.  We are currently planning to start a Phase 2 study of seladelpar in patients with NASH in the first half of 2018. 
 Arhalofenate  (MBX-102) — Gout 
 Gouty arthritis, or gout, is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men and affects more than eight million people in the United States. Gout is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood, or hyperuricemia. A great majority, approximately 90%, of gout patients have an under excretion of uric acid. The hallmark symptom of gout is a flare, characterized by debilitating pain, along with tenderness and inflammation of affected joints. Gout has a significant impact on patients’ quality of life and health care utilization. Patients experiencing gout flares miss an average of 4.6 more days of work per year than those without gout. Gout flares also result in increased health care utilization with approximately 35% of patients with moderate flare and 50% of patients with severe flare having at least one acute care visit per year. 
 Gout flares are triggered by the presence of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in joints. These crystals are formed in tissues when the concentration of sUA exceeds its solubility limit (approximately 6.8 milligrams per deciliter mg/dL). Long term accumulation of MSU crystals in the body leads to the progression of gout with an increase in the frequency of flares, the involvement of multiple joints, their progressive deformation, and the appearance of masses of MSU crystals called tophi. Hence, the goal of treatment is to maintain sUA below 6 mg/dL, or even 5 mg/dL when tophi needs to be dissolved. Elevated levels of sUA, or hyperuricemia, most commonly results from the under excretion of uric acid by the kidney. Uric acid is normally filtered through the glomerular section of the kidney and reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubule back to the blood by specialized urate transporters/exchangers. 
 Multiple clinical studies indicate that gout patients have a high incidence of comorbidities, such as hypertension (50% or more), chronic kidney disease (~40%), coronary artery disease (>35%), and diabetes (~20%). Managing patients with these comorbidities is challenging because medication currently used to treat gout flares could be contraindicated. For instance, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have renal toxicity and corticosteroids worsen hypertension and diabetes. 
 Unmet Needs in the Treatment of Gout 
 To halt the progression of gout and provide long term reduction in flares, MSU crystals must be eliminated from the body. Therefore, the major goals of gout treatment are to prevent flares and lower sUA to below 6 mg/dL in order to dissolve MSU crystals. Of the eight million patients with gout in the U.S., we estimate that over three million patients are on urate lowering therapy (ULT) and of these patients on ULTs, as many as 60% may not get to their sUA goal of below 6.0 mg/dL. In addition, we estimate about one million patients continue to experience three or more flares per year. According to a 2012 study, patients having three or more flares per year typically incur $10,000 more in annual health care costs than patients without gout. With a large number of patients not reaching the sUA goal of below 6 mg/dL on current therapies, gout remains a significantly undermanaged disease. Studies have also shown that abrupt decreases in sUA with existing ULTs paradoxically cause an increase in flares, leading many patients to discontinue or avoid therapy. Non-adherence to therapy is thus a significant problem.

Current Treatment 
 Xanthine oxidase (XO) inhibitors are ULTs that decrease the production of uric acid. The XO inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat (marketed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited as Uloric®), are the most commonly prescribed drugs in the ULT market. Generic allopurinol at doses up to 300 mg accounts for about 90% of ULT prescriptions in the U.S. Studies have shown that the most commonly prescribed doses of these drugs (allopurinol 300 mg or febuxostat 40 mg) in the U.S. result in only about 40% of patients reaching the sUA goal of below 6.0 mg/dL. In addition, both allopurinol and febuxostat can cause an increase in gout flares for up to 6 – 12 months following initiation of treatment. 
 Uricosurics are ULTs that lower sUA by promoting the excretion of uric acid by the kidney. Lesinurad (Zurampic®, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and AstraZeneca PLC) is a uricosuric that blocks URAT1, the main urate transporter/exchanger in renal proximal tubules. Zurampic 200mg in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor was approved in the U.S. in 2015 and in the E.U. in 2016 for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients that have not reached target serum uric acid levels with an XO inhibitor alone. The FDA approved Zurampic with a black-box warning regarding the potential for acute renal failure and the approved indication is restricted to its use in combination with an XO inhibitor. 
 To address the increase in flare rate associated with initiation of ULT therapy, anti-inflammatory drugs such as colchicine and NSAIDs are co-prescribed with ULTs. These agents cause adverse effects. The risks associated with colchicine include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and neuromuscular toxicity. Long term use of colchicine should be carefully monitored. NSAIDs are associated with gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding that can be severe and life-threatening. Their long-term use is associated with an increased risk of renal toxicity, chronic renal insufficiency and increased cardiovascular morbidity. Steroids are also associated with GI bleedings. They can severely worsen hypertension and diabetes that are frequent comorbities of gout patients and their chronic use is associated with debilitating osteoporosis and bone fractures. 
 Arhalofenate Has the Potential to Address the Unmet Needs in Gout 
 We believe that a significant opportunity exists for arhalofenate as a result of its combined anti-flare activity and its sUA lowering activity. As an investigational Urate Lowering Anti-Flare Therapy (ULAFT), arhalofenate has the potential to address the unmet needs of gout patients by preventing flares while helping patients to achieve sUA target goals. This dual activity might also be advantageous when combining arhalofenate with febuxostat to increase the number of patients reaching their desired sUA targets, to limit the number of flares and, in patients with tophaceous gout, to potentially resolve tophi. 
Clinical Studies with Arhalofenate 
 The Gout Development Program 
 Arhalofenate is a prodrug which upon absorption is converted to its active form, arhalofenate acid. Arhalofenate acid’s dual actions are to inhibit uric acid reabsorption by urate transporters in the kidney and to block the MSU crystal-stimulated production of IL-1ß by macrophages (white blood cells that play an important role in the body’s defense against pathogens and foreign matter) in inflamed joints. 
 Arhalofenate has been studied in five Phase 2 gout clinical studies. Collectively across these studies, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of arhalofenate in doses ranging from 400 mg – 800 mg as monotherapy and in combination with the two approved XO inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat. The results of these studies collectively support further development of arhalofenate as a potential urate-lowering anti-flare therapy (ULAFT) for the large number of gout patients that are inadequate responders or are intolerant to XO inhibitors. 
 10


Conclusions of Arhalofenate’s Clinical Experience 
 Arhalofenate has been studied in a total of 17 clinical studies with over 1,100 subjects in healthy volunteer, type 2 diabetic and gout populations. These include Phase 1 studies of safety, tolerability and PK, Phase 2 studies of blood glucose effects in diabetics, and Phase 2 studies of sUA and flare effects in gout patients. Arhalofenate was generally well tolerated with a safety profile that supports development for gout. 
 In clinical studies conducted to date that included over two hundred patients with hyperuricemia and a diagnosis of gout, arhalofenate was found to be well tolerated when dosed at 400 mg, 600 mg or 800 mg once daily up to twelve weeks. Arhalofenate treatment resulted in reductions in sUA whether administered alone or in combination with a XO inhibitor. As a uricosuric, arhalofenate decreases sUA by increasing the urinary excretion of uric acid. In clinical trials to date, Arhalofenate has increased the fractional excretion of uric acid with levels that were at or near normal without overcorrection. 
 In addition, arhalofenate when administered at 800 mg daily without colchicine decreased the incidence of flares and also increased the proportion of patients not experiencing any flare. Activity against flares would address one of the most burdensome symptoms for gout patients. 
 Gout Partnership with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. 
 In late December 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kowa for the development and commercialization of arhalofenate in the U.S. Pursuant to the license agreement, we granted to Kowa an exclusive license to certain patent rights and technology related to arhalofenate. Kowa will have exclusive rights to, among other things, develop, use, manufacture, sell and otherwise exploit the licensed technology in the United States (including all possessions and territories). 
 We plan to enter into licensing agreements with other parties for development and commercialization rights to arhalofenate in other geographies. 
 MBX-2982 
 MBX-2982 is an oral, G-protein coupled receptor (GPR119) agonist being evaluated as a novel therapeutic agent for an undisclosed therapeutic indication. 
 GPR119 is expressed in pancreatic islet cells and gastrointestinal hormone secreting cells (enteroendocrine cells). Activation of GPR119 in pancreatic ß-islets either by natural (endogenous) substances or by drugs developed to interact with it (GPR119 agonists) results in direct stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin secretion in vitro. Activation of GPR119 in intestinal enteroendocrine cells either by endogenous substances or by GPR119 agonists results in stimulation of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and gastrointestinal inhibitory peptide release, and subsequent enhanced glucose-dependent insulin secretion and suppression of glucagon, leading to improved acute glucose tolerance, both in vitro and in vivo. MBX-2982 was synthesized and screened as a GPR119 agonist, and is capable of activating endogenous GPR119 in a cell line over-expressing the receptor. MBX-2982 has been shown to increase glucose-dependent insulin secretion in both in vitro and in animal models. MBX-2982 also increases incretin hormone levels in animals, which may contribute to its pharmacological effects. 
 Nonclinical studies show that MBX-2982 has desirable effects on blood glucose levels, and this effect is additive to the effect of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, sitagliptin. Based on these results, there may be an important role for MBX-2982 as a novel therapeutic agent.
 Extensive preclinical toxicological studies (up to 6 months in rats and dogs) have been completed, and PK profiling of MBX-2982 has shown low potential for safety risk. We filed an IND for MBX-2982 with the FDA in January 2008.

Clinical Studies with MBX-2982 
 Four Phase 1 clinical studies and one Phase 2 clinical study with MBX-2982 have been completed and the safety review showed no safety or tolerability concerns with escalating doses (25, 100, and 300 mg/day) tested for up to 4 weeks of dosing. MBX-2982 at doses of 25, 100, and 300 mg exhibited a profile consistent with a once daily oral drug and appeared to be safe and was well tolerated.  Based on these results, we believe further evaluation is warranted for MBX-2982 in pre-clinical models for undisclosed indications.  If successful, the next step would be evaluation in a clinical proof-of-concept study.
License Agreements and Intellectual Property 
 General 
 We actively seek to obtain, where appropriate, patent protection and regulatory exclusivity for the proprietary technology that we consider important to our business, including compounds, compositions and formulations, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture both in the United States and other countries. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and enforce proprietary protection for our product candidates, technology and know–how, to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others, and to exclude others from infringing our proprietary rights. However, patent protection may not afford us complete protection against competitors who seek to circumvent our patents. 
 We also depend upon the skills, knowledge, experience and know-how of our management, research and development personnel, as well as that of our advisors, consultants and other contractors. To help protect our proprietary know-how, which is not patentable, and for inventions for which patents may be difficult to enforce, we currently rely, and will in the future rely, on trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our interests. To this end, we require all of our employees, consultants, advisors and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information and, where applicable, require disclosure and assignment to us of the ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions important to our business. 
 Collaborations and Licensing Agreements 
 We have entered into various arrangements with licensors and licensees. Our current significant collaborations are summarized below. 
 Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc.: In December 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Kowa Pharmaceuticals America, Inc. for the development and commercialization of arhalofenate in the U.S. Pursuant to the license agreement, we granted to Kowa an exclusive license to certain patent rights and technology related to arhalofenate. Kowa will have exclusive rights to, among other things, develop, use, manufacture, sell and otherwise exploit the licensed technology in the United States (including all possessions and territories). Under the license agreement, Kowa paid us an up-front payment of $5 million in January 2017, and in January 2018 we received a $5 million milestone payment for the initiation of a study evaluating the pharmacokinetics of arhalofenate in subjects with renal impairment. We are entitled to receive an additional milestone payment of $5 million on the initiation of a Phase 3 study and up to an additional of $190 million upon the achievement of additional development and sales milestones, and tiered, double digit royalties on future net sales of arhalofenate products. Kowa is responsible for all development and commercialization costs in the US. We retain full development and commercialization rights for the rest of the world and intend to partner arhalofenate in geographies outside the U.S. and its possessions and territories. 
 Johnson and Johnson: In June 2006, we entered into a license agreement with Janssen Pharmaceutical NV (Janssen NV), an affiliate of Johnson and Johnson, in which we received an exclusive worldwide, royalty-bearing license to seladelpar and certain other PPARδ compounds (the “PPARδ Products”) with the right to grant sublicenses to third parties to make, use and sell such PPARδ Products. Under the terms of the agreement, we have full control and responsibility over the research, development and registration of any PPARδ Products and are required to use diligent efforts to conduct all such activities. Janssen NV has the sole responsibility for the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance of, and defense of the patents with respect to, the PPARδ Products. Janssen NV has a right of first negotiation under the agreement to license a particular PPARδ Product from us in the 
 12


event that we elect to seek a third party corporate partner for the research, development, promotion, and/or commercialization of such PPARδ Products. Under the terms of the agreement Janssen NV is entitled to receive up to an 8% royalty on net sales of PPARδ Products. Under the terms of the agreement, if we do not expend more than a de minimus amount of effort and resources on the research and/or development of at least one PPARδ product, such action would constitute a default under the agreement. In addition, if we fail to use diligent efforts to promote, market and sell any PPARδ Product under the agreement, such action would constitute a default under the agreement. In the event of such default, or upon our termination of the agreement, we are obligated to grant Janssen NV a worldwide, exclusive, irrevocable license under the agreement in all information that is controlled, developed or acquired by us which relate to a PPARδ compound or PPARδ Product and in all patents that are filed during the term of the agreement with a priority date after the effective date of the agreement and relate to a PPARδ compound or PPARδ Product. 
 In June 2010, we entered into two development and license agreements with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Janssen) to further develop and discover undisclosed metabolic disease target agonists for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes and other disorders and received a one-time nonrefundable technology access fee related to the agreements. We received a termination notice from Janssen, effectively ending these development and licensing agreements in early April 2015. In December 2015, we exercised an option pursuant to the terms of one of the original agreements to continue work to research, develop and commercialize compounds with activity against an undisclosed metabolic disease target. Janssen granted us an exclusive, worldwide license (with rights to sublicense) under the Janssen know-how and patents to research, develop, make, have made, import, use, offer for sale and sell such compounds. We have full control and responsibility over the research, development and registration of any products developed and/or discovered from the metabolic disease target and are required to use diligent efforts to conduct all such activities. 
 DiaTex: On June 30, 1998, we entered into a License and Development Agreement with DiaTex, Inc. Under the agreement, DiaTex granted us an exclusive license to develop and commercialize therapeutic products containing halofenate, its enantiomers (mirror images, including arhalofenate), derivatives, and analogs (the licensed products) for the treatment of diseases. 
 The license agreement contains a $2,000 per month license fee as well as a requirement to make additional payments for development achievements and royalty payments on any sales of licensed products. DiaTex is entitled to up to $0.8 million for the future development of arhalofenate, as well as a 2% royalty payment on any net sales of products containing arhalofenate. Under the terms of the agreement, if we fail to use diligent efforts to conduct preclinical and clinical testing of halofenate and its enantiomers to determine its efficacy for use in the treatment or prevention of human diseases or conditions, fail to make any payment called for under the agreement, or disclose non-exempt confidential information under the agreement, such action would constitute a material breach under the agreement. In addition, if we fail to execute all instruments and assignments or fail to take any action to effect joint ownership of any enantiomer patent with DiaTex, such action would constitute a material breach under the agreement. We may terminate the agreement at any time if we determine we are no longer interested in DiaTex’s license grant, provided we provide sufficient written notice within a specified time period. 
 Research and Development 
 We do not currently own or operate research and development facilities. We rely on contract service providers (CSPs) including clinical research organizations, clinical trial sites, central laboratories and other service providers to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials. While we have agreements governing their activities, we have limited influence over their actual performance. We have relied and plan to continue to rely upon CSPs to monitor and manage data for our ongoing clinical programs for our product candidates, as well as the execution of nonclinical studies. We control only certain aspects of our CSPs’ activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CSPs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific and clinical advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be employed by employers other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us, which could also adversely affect the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives. 
 13


Intellectual Property
 We own and co-own approximately 50 United States patents, 150 foreign patents, as well as 20 United States patent applications and 120 foreign and Patent Cooperation Treaty applications that are counterparts to certain United States patents and patent applications. In addition, we license from third parties approximately 20 United States patents and 5 United States patent applications, 300 foreign patents and 50 foreign and Patent Cooperation Treaty applications that are counterparts to certain United States patents and patent applications. These patents and patent applications include claims covering various aspects of our product pipeline and research and development strategies, including: arhalofenate crystal forms, methods of use both alone and in combination with other drugs and methods of manufacture, certain PPARδ agonists (including seladelpar), their compositions and uses, certain GPR119 agonist compositions and uses and undisclosed metabolic disease target agonist compositions and uses. 
 The arhalofenate portfolio consists of approximately 100 issued patents and 50 pending patent applications relating to composition, method of use or methods of manufacture. We believe our issued patents protect arhalofenate through at least 2019-2032 before accounting for any potential patent term extension. The seladelpar portfolio consists of approximately 300 issued patents and 100 pending patent applications related to composition and method of use that we believe protect it through at least 2025-2035 before accounting for any potential patent term extension. Patent and trade secret protection is critical to our business. Our success will depend in large part on our ability to obtain, maintain, defend and enforce patents and other intellectual property, to extend the life of patents covering our product candidates, to preserve trade secrets and proprietary know-how, and to operate without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. 
 
Manufacturing 
 We do not currently own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production or testing of seladelpar, arhalofenate or other product candidates that we develop, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We presently depend on third party contract manufacturers to obtain all of our required raw materials, Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and finished products for our clinical studies for seladelpar. We have executed manufacturing agreements for our API and clinical supplies of seladelpar and arhalofenate with established manufacturing firms that are responsible for sourcing and obtaining the raw materials necessary for the finished products. The raw materials necessary to manufacture the API for seladelpar and arhalofenate are available from more than one source. 
Competition 
 The biopharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant innovation. Although we believe that our development expertise and scientific knowledge provide us with advantages over our competitors, particularly in the therapeutic areas in which we are focused, other biopharmaceutical companies in the industry may be able to develop therapeutics that are able to achieve better results. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies, universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we have. 
 We are currently developing seladelpar for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Currently, the only FDA-approved treatments for PBC are ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA), also known as ursodiol, an isomer of chenodeoxycholic acid and the synthetic bile acid analog obeticholic acid (Ocaliva®, Intercept Pharmaceuticals). Ursodiol decreases serum levels of AP, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, cholesterol, and immunoglobulin M, all of which are elevated in patients with PBC and can serve as biochemical markers of the disease. In a study that combined data from three controlled trials with a total of 548 patients, ursodiol significantly reduced the likelihood of liver transplantation or death after four years. Ursodiol also delayed the progression of hepatic fibrosis in early-stage PBC, but was not effective in advanced disease. It is also known that up to 50% of PBC patients fail to respond adequately to ursodiol therapy. Ursodiol is available as a generic and is priced at a discount to typical branded therapies. 
 Ocaliva was approved by the FDA and European Medicines Agency in 2016 for the treatment of PBC in combination with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. Ocaliva also received orphan designations in the U.S. and the E.U. A Phase 3 study was completed with a primary composite endpoint defined as a responder rate comprised of the percentage of patients with AP < 1.67 times upper limit of normal with a decrease in AP of at least 15% and total bilirubin less than or equal to upper limit of normal. This study met its goals and Ocaliva was granted accelerated approval based on meeting this primary composite endpoint.

Although not approved for use in PBC, off-label use of fibrate drugs has been reported, though many fibrates are specifically contraindicated for use in PBC due to potential concerns over acute and long-term safety in this patient population. Other therapies, such as colchicine, methothrexate, prednisone and multiple immunosuppressive regimens have been attempted. However, their efficacy is limited or unproven, and they are associated with multiple side-effects impacting tolerance and safety. Liver transplantation improves survival in patients with PBC, and it is the only effective treatment for those with liver failure. Liver transplantation however is problematic because of its costs, the limited availability of donor organs, and by the fact that the disease may recur after an initially successful transplantation.  As a result, despite the previously mentioned therapeutic interventions, it is recognized that PBC continues to progress in many patients and additional medical treatment is needed to address this disease. 
 Additional potential therapies in early stage clinical development for PBC include FXR agonists that act through the same mechanism of action as Ocaliva (tropifexor (LJN452, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp.), GS-9674 (Gilead Sciences, Inc.) and EDP-305 (Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)), the mixed PPARα/δ agonist elafibranor, the dual PPARα/γ agonist saroglitazar, the selective NOX inhibitor GKT137831, the oxy-sterol sulfate DUR-928, and the selective S1P receptor modulator etrasimod (APD334) (Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). GSK23306772 is an inhibitor of the Intestinal Bile Acid Transporter (IBAT) and is evaluated for the treatment of itch associated with PBC and maralixibat, another IBAT inhibitor, was recently discontinued for this indication due to lack of efficacy. NGM-282, a FGF-19 variant was also studied in PBC, but the clinical program has been re-focused towards the treatment of NASH.
 Arhalofenate is being developed for the treatment of patients with gout. The xanthine oxidase inhibitors, allopurinol and febuxostat (marketed by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited as Uloric®), are the most commonly prescribed drugs to lower uric acid in patients with gout. Lesinurad (Zurampic®, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and AstraZeneca PLC) is a uricosuric that blocks URAT1, the main urate transporter/exchanger in renal proximal tubules. Zurampic 200mg in combination with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor is approved in the U.S. and in the E.U. for the treatment of hyperuricemia associated with gout in patients that have not reached target serum uric acid levels with a xanthine oxidase inhibitor alone. Pegloticase (marketed by Horizon Pharma plc as KRYSTEXXA®) is a PEGylated uric acid specific enzyme indicated for the treatment of chronic gout in adult patients refractory to conventional therapy. Anti-inflammatory drugs, such as colchicines, steroids and NSAIDs, are prescribed to manage gout flares. 
 Research & Development Costs 
 Our research and development costs for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, all of which are borne by us, were $18.9 million, $15.9 million, and $17.0 million, respectively. 
 Government Regulation and Product Approval 
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. The pharmaceutical drug product candidates that we develop must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before they may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 15


United States Pharmaceutical Product Development Process 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates pharmaceutical products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and implementing regulations. Pharmaceutical products are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. The process required by the FDA before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 

• | Completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies according to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) or other applicable regulations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (IND), which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies according to the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practices (GCP), to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed pharmaceutical product for its intended use;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application (NDA) for a new pharmaceutical product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the pharmaceutical product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practice standards (cGMP), to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the pharmaceutical product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential FDA audit of selected preclinical and clinical study sites that generated the data in support of the NDA; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

 The lengthy process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources and approvals are inherently uncertain. 
 Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the pharmaceutical product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the pharmaceutical product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including Good Laboratory Practices. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA has concerns and notifies the sponsor by way of a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a pharmaceutical product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. Submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin and, once begun, issues may arise that lead to suspension or termination of such clinical study. 
 During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points. These points may be prior to submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date, for the FDA to provide advice, and for the sponsor and FDA to reach agreement on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the End-of-Phase 2 meeting to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support approval of the new drug. 
 16


Clinical studies involve the administration of the pharmaceutical product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical study sponsor’s control. Clinical studies are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical study, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, how the results will be analyzed and presented and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP. Further, each clinical study must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at, or servicing, each institution at which the clinical study will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of study participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical studies are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical study subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical study until completed. 
 Human clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1. The pharmaceutical product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The pharmaceutical product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases, to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule and to identify patient populations with specific characteristics where the pharmaceutical product may be more effective.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical studies are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These clinical studies are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. The studies must be well-controlled and usually include a control arm for comparison. One or two Phase 3 studies are required by the FDA for an NDA approval, depending on the disease severity and other available treatment options.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Post-approval studies, or Phase 4 clinical studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical studies must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the pharmaceutical product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Concurrent with clinical studies, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the pharmaceutical product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the pharmaceutical product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final pharmaceutical product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the pharmaceutical product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 United States Review and Approval Processes 
 The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical studies, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests conducted on the chemistry of the pharmaceutical product, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees; a waiver of such fees may be obtained under certain limited circumstances. 
 17


In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), an NDA or supplement to an NDA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the pharmaceutical product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any pharmaceutical product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. 
 The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting an NDA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), the FDA has 10 months from filing in which to complete its initial review of a standard NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from filing for a priority NDA. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or if the NDA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. 
 After the NDA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the NDA application to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel pharmaceutical products or pharmaceutical products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the pharmaceutical product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the pharmaceutical product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the NDA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites as well as the site where the pharmaceutical product is manufactured to assure compliance with GCP and cGMP. If the FDA determines the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. In addition, the FDA will require the review and approval of product labeling. 
 The NDA review and approval process is lengthy and difficult and the FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical data or other data and information. Even if such data and information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the NDA. The complete response letter describes the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require Phase 4 testing which involves clinical studies designed to further assess pharmaceutical product safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 18


Post-Approval Requirements 
 Any pharmaceutical products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, prohibitions on promoting pharmaceutical products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the pharmaceutical product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, enforcement letters from the FDA, actions by the United States Department of Justice and/or United States Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors, and civil or criminal penalties. Although physicians may prescribe legally available pharmaceutical products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not directly or indirectly market or promote such off-label uses. 
 Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Pharmaceutical product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved pharmaceutical products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, risk minimization action plans and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product or place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. 
 U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
 The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits certain individuals and entities, including us, from promising, paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, directly or indirectly, to obtain or retain business or an improper advantage. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, have increased their enforcement efforts with respect to the FCPA. Violations of the FCPA may result in large civil and criminal penalties and could result in an adverse effect on a company’s reputation, operations, and financial condition. A company may also face collateral consequences such as debarment and the loss of export privileges. 
 Federal and state fraud and abuse laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal healthcare laws have been applied to restrict certain business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes, data privacy and security laws, as well as transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease, or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and 
 19


regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exemptions or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases, or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The intent standard of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (discussed below). 
 The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Additionally, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under the PPACA, and its implementing regulations, require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually information related to certain payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and group purchasing organizations to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates”—independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal fraud and abuse laws, some of which are broader in scope and apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Further, some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians and other health care providers and entities or marketing expenditures. 
 20


These federal and state laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate its business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our product candidates are ultimately sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals. 
 Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our pharmaceutical product candidates, some of our patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved pharmaceutical product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending upon the expected length of the clinical studies and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s NDA. Currently seven years of reference product exclusivity are available to pharmaceutical products designated as Orphan Drugs, during which the FDA may not approve generic products relying upon the reference product’s data. Pediatric exclusivity is another type of regulatory market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric clinical study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a clinical study. 
 Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part upon the availability of reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government payors such as Medicare and Medicaid, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. While commercial payors often follow Medicare cover policy and payment limitations, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a pharmaceutical product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the pharmaceutical product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific pharmaceutical products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved pharmaceutical products for a particular indication. 
 Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of its products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our pharmaceutical product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a 
 21


pharmaceutical product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, in the United States there is a growing emphasis on comparative effectiveness research, both by private payors and by government agencies. To the extent other drugs or therapies are found to be more effective than our products, payors may elect to cover such therapies in lieu of our products and/or reimburse our products at a lower rate. 
 Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. 
 The marketability of any pharmaceutical product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect this will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect our future results of operations. In particular, there have been and continue to be a number of initiatives at the United States federal and state levels that seek to reduce healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010 the PPACA was enacted, which includes measures to significantly change the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry are the following: 
  
• | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | an increase in the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts to negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | extension of manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability to covered drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the Federal Poverty Level, thereby potentially increasing manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of the entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service pharmaceutical pricing program;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | new transparency reporting requirements under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under Section 6002 of the PPACA;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a requirement to annually report drug samples that manufacturers and distributors provide to physicians;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expansion of health care fraud and abuse laws, including the False Claims Act and the Anti-Kickback Statute, new government investigative powers, and enhanced penalties for noncompliance;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------

 22


 
• | a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act, and we expect there will continue to be additional challenges and amendments to it in the future. 
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the president signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, or joint committee, to recommend proposals in spending reductions to Congress. The joint committee did not achieve its targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering automatic reductions to several government programs. These reductions include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the president signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. More recently, there have been several recent congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. 
 
International Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, there are a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our future product candidates. Whether or not FDA approval is obtained for a product, approval of a product must be obtained by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before clinical studies or marketing of the product can commence in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. In addition, certain regulatory authorities in select countries may require us to repeat previously conducted preclinical and/or clinical studies under specific criteria for approval in their respective country which may delay and/or greatly increase the cost of approval in certain markets targeted for approval by us.

Implications of Being an “Emerging Growth Company” 
 We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As an “emerging growth company,” we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are otherwise applicable generally to public companies. These provisions include: 

• | only two years of audited financial statements in addition to any required unaudited interim financial statements with correspondingly reduced “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” disclosure;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure about our executive compensation arrangements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | no requirement that we solicit non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exemption from the auditor attestation requirement in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In addition, under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards, and, therefore, are subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. 
 We could remain an emerging growth company for up to five years or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1 billion, (ii) the date that we becomes a “large accelerated filer” as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period and (iv) the last day of 2019, which will be the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of our common equity securities pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act (a date which occurred in July 2014).
