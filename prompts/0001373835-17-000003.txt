Competition
Spectra Energy Partners’ natural gas transmission and storage businesses compete with similar facilities that serve our supply and market areas in the transmission and storage of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.
The natural gas transported in our transmission business competes with other forms of energy available to our customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors.
16

Spectra Energy Partners’ crude oil transportation business competes with pipelines, rail, truck and barge facilities that transport crude oil from production areas to refinery markets. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, flexibility and reliability of service.
Customers and Contracts
In general, Spectra Energy Partners’ natural gas pipelines provide transmission and storage services for local distribution companies (LDCs, companies that obtain a major portion of their revenues from retail distribution systems for the delivery of natural gas for ultimate consumption), electric power generators, exploration and production companies, and industrial and commercial customers, as well as energy marketers. Transmission and storage services are generally provided under firm agreements where customers reserve capacity in pipelines and storage facilities. The vast majority of these agreements provide for fixed reservation charges that are paid monthly regardless of the actual volumes transported on the pipelines or injected or withdrawn from our storage facilities, plus a small variable component that is based on volumes transported, injected or withdrawn, which is intended to recover variable costs.
Spectra Energy Partners also provides interruptible transmission and storage services where customers can use capacity if it is available at the time of the request. Interruptible revenues depend on the amount of volumes transported or stored and the associated rates for this interruptible service. New projects placed into service may initially have higher levels of interruptible services at inception. Storage operations also provide a variety of other value-added services including natural gas parking, loaning and balancing services to meet our customers’ needs.
Customers on the Express-Platte system are primarily refineries located in the Rocky Mountain and Midwestern states of the U.S. Other customers include oil producers and marketing entities. Express capacity is typically contracted under long-term committed contracts where customers reserve capacity and pay commitment charges based on a contracted volume even if they do not ship. A small amount of Express capacity and all Platte capacity is used by uncommitted shippers who only pay for the pipeline capacity that is actually used in a given month.
17

DISTRIBUTION
We provide distribution services in Canada through our subsidiary, Union Gas Limited (Union Gas). Union Gas is a major Canadian natural gas storage, transmission and distribution company based in Ontario with over 100 years of experience and service to customers. The distribution business serves approximately 1.5 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in more than 400 communities across northern, southwestern and eastern Ontario. Union Gas’ storage and transmission business offers storage and transmission services to customers at the Dawn Hub (Dawn), the largest integrated underground storage facility in Canada and one of the largest in North America. It offers customers an important link in the movement of natural gas from western Canada and U.S. supply basins to markets in central Canada and the northeast U.S.
Union Gas’ distribution system consists of approximately 40,000 miles of main and service pipelines. Distribution pipelines carry or control the supply of natural gas from the point of local supply to customers. Union Gas’ underground natural gas storage facilities have a working capacity of approximately 165 Bcf in 25 underground facilities located in depleted gas fields. Its transmission system consists of approximately 3,000 miles of high-pressure pipeline and associated mainline compressor stations.
Competition
Union Gas’ distribution system is regulated by the Ontario Energy Board (OEB) pursuant to the provisions of the Ontario Energy Board Act (1998) and is subject to regulation in a number of areas, including rates. Union Gas is not generally subject to third-party competition within its distribution franchise area. However, physical bypass of Union Gas’ system may be permitted, even within Union Gas’ distribution franchise area. In addition, the OEB Decision in the Generic Proceeding on Community Expansion provides a framework that facilitates the entry of new participants and allows for competition as it pertains to serving rural and First Nation communities that do not currently have access to natural gas.
Union Gas provides storage services to customers outside its franchise area and new storage services under a framework established by the OEB that supports unregulated storage investments and allows Union Gas to compete with third-party storage providers on basis of price, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service. Existing storage services to 
18

customers within Union Gas’ franchise area, however, have continued to be provided at cost-based rates and are not subject to third-party competition.
Union Gas competes with other forms of energy available to its customers and end-users, including electricity, coal, propane and fuel oils. Factors that influence the demand for natural gas include weather, price changes, the availability of natural gas and other forms of energy, the level of business activity, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels and other factors.
Customers and Contracts
Most of Union Gas’ power generation customers, industrial and large commercial customers, and a portion of residential customers, purchase their natural gas directly from suppliers or marketers. Because Union Gas earns income from the distribution of natural gas and not from the sale of the natural gas commodity, gas distribution margins are not affected by either the source of customers’ gas supply or its price, except to the extent that prices affect actual customer usage.
Union Gas provides its in-franchise customers with regulated distribution, transmission and storage services. Union Gas also provides unregulated natural gas storage and regulated transmission services for other utilities and energy market participants, including large natural gas transmission and distribution companies. A substantial amount of Union Gas’ annual transportation and storage revenue is generated by fixed demand charges.

WESTERN CANADA TRANSMISSION & PROCESSING 
Our Western Canada Transmission & Processing business is comprised of the BC Pipeline, BC Field Services, Canadian Midstream and M&N Canada.
On August 4, 2016, Westcoast Energy Inc. (Westcoast) completed the sale of its ownership interest in the Empress NGL operations (Empress) to Plains Midstream Canada ULC. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.
BC Pipeline and BC Field Services provide fee-based natural gas transmission and gas gathering and processing services. BC Pipeline is regulated by the NEB under full cost-of-service regulation. BC Pipeline transports processed natural gas from facilities primarily in northeast British Columbia (BC) to markets in BC, Alberta and the U.S. Pacific Northwest. BC Pipeline has approximately 1,750 miles of transmission pipeline in BC and Alberta, as well as associated mainline compressor stations.
The BC Field Services business, which is regulated by the NEB under a “light-handed” regulatory model, consists of raw gas gathering pipelines and gas processing facilities, primarily in northeast BC. These facilities provide services to natural gas producers to remove impurities from the raw gas stream including water, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and other substances. Where required, these facilities also remove various NGLs for subsequent sale by the producers. NGLs are liquid hydrocarbons extracted during the processing of natural gas. Principal commercial NGLs include butanes, propane, natural gasoline and ethane. The BC Field Services business includes eight gas processing plants located in BC, associated field compressor stations and approximately 1,400 miles of gathering pipelines.
The Canadian Midstream business provides similar gas gathering and processing services in BC and Alberta and consists of nine natural gas processing plants and approximately 600 miles of gathering pipelines. This business is primarily regulated by the province where the assets are located, either BC or Alberta.
We own approximately 78% of M&N Canada, with affiliates of Emera, Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corporation directly owning the remaining 13% and 9% interests, respectively. M&N Canada is an approximately 550-mile mainline interprovincial natural gas transmission system which extends from Goldboro, Nova Scotia to the U.S. border near Baileyville, Maine. M&N Canada is connected to the U.S. portion of the Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline system, M&N U.S., which is directly owned by SEP (part of our Spectra Energy Partners segment) and affiliates of Emera, Inc. and Exxon Mobil Corporation. M&N Canada facilities have a market delivery capability of approximately 0.6 Bcf/d of natural gas. The pipeline’s location and key interconnects with Spectra Energy’s transmission system link regional natural gas supplies to the northeast U.S. and Atlantic Canadian markets.
Competition
Western Canada Transmission & Processing businesses compete with third-party midstream companies, exploration and production companies, and pipelines in the gathering, processing and transmission of natural gas. The principal elements of competition are location, rates, terms of service, and flexibility and reliability of service.
20

Natural gas competes with other forms of energy available to Western Canada Transmission & Processing’s customers and end-users, including electricity, coal and fuel oils. The primary competitive factor is price. Changes in the availability or price of natural gas and other forms of energy, levels of business activity, long-term economic conditions, conservation, legislation, governmental regulations, the ability to convert to alternative fuels, weather and other factors affect the demand for natural gas in the areas that Western Canada Transmission & Processing serves.
Customers & Contracts
BC Pipeline provides: (i) transmission services from the outlet of natural gas processing plants primarily in northeast BC to LDCs, end-use industrial and commercial customers, marketers, and exploration and production companies requiring transmission services to the nearest natural gas trading hub; and (ii) transmission services primarily to downstream markets in the Pacific Northwest (both in the U.S. and Canada) using the southern portion of the transmission pipeline and markets in Alberta through pipeline interconnects in northern BC with Nova/TransCanada. The majority of transportation services are provided under firm agreements, which provide for fixed reservation charges that are paid monthly regardless of actual volumes transported on the pipeline, plus a small variable component that is based on volumes transported to recover variable costs. BC Pipeline also provides interruptible transmission services where customers can use capacity if it is available at the time of request. Payments under these services are based on volumes transported.
The BC Field Services and Canadian Midstream operations in western Canada provide raw natural gas gathering and processing services to exploration and production companies under agreements which are fee-for-service contracts which do not expose us to direct commodity-price risk. However, a sustained decline in natural gas prices has impacted our ability to negotiate and renew expiring service contracts with customers in certain areas of our operations. The BC Field Services and Canadian Midstream operations provide both firm and interruptible services.
21

FIELD SERVICES 
Field Services consists of our 50% investment in DCP Midstream, which is accounted for as an equity investment. DCP Midstream gathers, compresses, treats, processes, transports, stores and sells natural gas. In addition, this segment produces, fractionates, transports, stores and sells NGLs, recovers and sells condensate and trades and markets natural gas and NGLs. Phillips 66 owns the other 50% interest in DCP Midstream. As of December 31, 2016, DCP Midstream owned an approximate 21% interest in DCP Midstream Partners, LP (DCP Partners), a publicly traded master limited partnership which traded on the NYSE under the symbol “DPM.” As its general partner, DCP Midstream accounts for its investment in DCP Partners as a consolidated subsidiary. On January 1, 2017, DCP Midstream and DCP Partners closed a transaction combining the two companies. The combined company was renamed DCP Midstream, LP which currently trades on the NYSE under the symbol "DCP." DCP Midstream currently owns an approximate 38% interest in DCP Midstream, LP following the transaction. 
In October 2015, Spectra Energy contributed our 33.3% interests in Sand Hills and Southern Hills NGL pipelines to DCP Midstream. See Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of this transaction.
As of December 31, 2016 DCP Midstream owned or operated assets in 17 states in the U.S. DCP Midstream’s gathering systems include connections to several interstate and intrastate natural gas and NGL pipeline systems, one natural gas storage facility and one NGL storage facility. DCP Midstream operates in a diverse number of regions, including the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford, Niobrara/DJ Basin and Midcontinent. DCP Midstream owns or operates approximately 64,000 miles of gathering and transmission pipeline.
As of December 31, 2016, DCP Midstream also owned or operated 61 natural gas processing plants, which separate raw natural gas that has been gathered on DCP Midstream’s and third-party systems into condensate, NGLs and residue gas.
The NGLs separated from the raw natural gas are either sold and transported as NGL raw mix or further separated through a fractionation process into their individual components (ethane, propane, butane and natural gasoline) and then sold as components. As of December 31, 2016, DCP Midstream owned or operated 12 fractionators. In addition, DCP Midstream operates a propane wholesale marketing business and an eight million barrel propane and butane storage facility in the northeastern U.S.
22

The residue natural gas (gas that has had associated NGLs removed) separated from the raw natural gas is sold at market-based prices to marketers and end-users, including large industrial customers and natural gas and electric utilities serving individual consumers. DCP Midstream also stores residue natural gas at its 12 Bcf Southeast Texas natural gas storage facility located near Beaumont, Texas.
DCP Midstream uses NGL trading and storage at its Mont Belvieu, Texas and Conway, Kansas NGL market centers to manage price risk and to provide additional services to its customers. Asset-based gas trading and marketing activities are supported by ownership of the Southeast Texas storage facility and various intrastate pipelines which provide access to market centers/hubs such as Katy, Texas and the Houston Ship Channel.
DCP Midstream’s operating results are significantly affected by changes in average NGL, natural gas and crude oil prices. DCP Midstream closely monitors the risks associated with these price changes. See Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for a discussion of DCP Midstream’s exposure to changes in commodity prices.
Competition
In gathering, processing, transporting and storing natural gas, as well as producing, marketing and transporting NGLs, DCP Midstream competes with major integrated oil companies, major interstate and intrastate pipelines, national and local natural gas gatherers and processors, NGL transporters and brokers, marketers and distributors of natural gas supplies. Competition for natural gas supplies is based mostly on the reputation, efficiency and reliability of operations, the availability of gathering and transportation to high-demand markets, pricing arrangements offered by the gatherer/processor and the ability of the gatherer/processor to obtain a satisfactory price for the producer’s residue natural gas and extracted NGLs. Competition for sales to customers is based mostly upon reliability, services offered and the prices of delivered natural gas and NGLs.
Customers and Contracts
DCP Midstream sells a portion of its NGLs to Phillips 66 and Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). In addition, DCP Midstream purchases NGLs from CPChem. Prior to December 31, 2014 approximately 35% of DCP Midstream’s NGL production was committed to Phillips 66 and CPChem under 15-year contracts, the primary production commitment of which began a ratable wind down period in December 2014 and expires in January 2019. Approximately 27% of DCP Midstream’s NGL production was committed to Phillips 66 and CPChem as of December 31, 2016. DCP Midstream anticipates continuing to purchase and sell commodities with Phillips 66 and CPChem, in the ordinary course of business.
The residual natural gas, primarily methane, that results from processing raw natural gas is sold at market-based prices to marketers and end-users, including large industrial companies, natural gas distribution companies and electric utilities. DCP Midstream purchases or takes custody of substantially all of its raw natural gas from producers, principally under the following types of contractual arrangements. More than 75% of the volumes of gas that are gathered and processed are under percentage-of-proceeds contracts.

• | Percentage-of-proceeds/index arrangements. In general, DCP Midstream purchases natural gas from producers at the wellhead or other receipt points, gathers the wellhead natural gas through its gathering system, treats and processes it, and then sells the residue natural gas and NGLs based on index prices from published index market prices. DCP Midstream remits to the producers either an agreed-upon percentage of the actual proceeds received by DCP Midstream from the sale of the residue natural gas, NGLs and condensate, or an agreed-upon percentage of the proceeds based on index-related prices or contractual recoveries for the natural gas, NGLs and condensate, regardless of the actual amount of sales proceeds which DCP Midstream receives. DCP Midstream keeps the difference between the proceeds received and the amount remitted back to the producer. Under percentage-of-liquids arrangements, DCP Midstream does not keep any amounts related to the residue natural gas proceeds and only keeps amounts related to the difference between the proceeds received and the amount remitted back to the producer related to NGLs and condensate. Certain of these arrangements may also result in the producer retaining title to all or a portion of the residue natural gas and/or the NGLs in lieu of DCP Midstream returning sales proceeds to the producer. Additionally, these arrangements may include fee-based components. DCP Midstream’s revenues from percentage-of-proceeds/index arrangements are directly related to the prices of natural gas, NGLs or condensate. DCP Midstream’s revenues under percentage-of-liquids arrangements are directly related to the price of NGLs and condensate.


• | Fee-based arrangements. DCP Midstream receives a fee or fees for one or more of the following services: gathering, compressing, treating, processing, transporting or storing natural gas, and fractionating, storing and transporting NGLs. The revenue DCP Midstream earns from these arrangements is directly related to the volume of natural gas or NGLs that flows through its systems and is not dependent on commodity prices. However, to the extent that a

23

sustained decline in commodity prices results in a decline in volumes, DCP Midstream’s revenues from these arrangements would be reduced.

• | Keep-whole and wellhead purchase arrangements. DCP Midstream gathers raw natural gas from producers for processing, the NGLs and condensate are sold and the residue natural gas is returned to the producer with a British thermal unit (Btu) content equivalent to the Btu content of the natural gas gathered. This arrangement keeps the producer whole to the thermal value of the natural gas received. Under the terms of a wellhead purchase contract, DCP Midstream purchases natural gas from the producer at the wellhead or defined receipt point for processing and markets the resulting NGLs and residue natural gas at market prices. Under these types of contracts, DCP Midstream is exposed to the difference between the value of the NGLs extracted from processing and the value of the Btu-equivalent of the residue natural gas, or frac spread. DCP Midstream benefits in periods when NGL prices are higher relative to natural gas prices, where that frac spread exceeds our cost.

As defined by the terms of the above arrangements, DCP Midstream also sells condensate, which is generally similar to crude oil and is produced in association with natural gas gathering and processing. The revenues that DCP Midstream earns from the sale of condensate correlate directly with crude oil prices.
Supplies and Raw Materials
We purchase a variety of manufactured equipment and materials for use in operations and expansion projects. The primary equipment and materials utilized in operations and project execution processes are steel pipe, compression engines, pumps, valves, fittings, polyethylene plastic pipe, gas meters and other consumables.
We operate a North American supply chain management network with employees dedicated to this function in the U.S. and Canada. Our supply chain management group uses economies-of-scale to maximize the efficiency of supply networks where applicable. The price of equipment and materials may vary however, perhaps substantially, from year to year. DCP Midstream performs its own supply chain management function.

Most of our U.S. gas transmission, crude oil pipeline and storage operations are regulated by the FERC. The FERC regulates natural gas transmission and crude oil transportation in U.S. interstate commerce including the establishment of rates for services. The FERC also regulates the construction of U.S. interstate natural gas pipelines and storage facilities, including the extension, enlargement and abandonment of facilities. In addition, certain operations are subject to oversight by state regulatory commissions. To the extent that the natural gas intrastate pipelines that transport or store natural gas in interstate commerce provide services under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, they are subject to FERC regulations. The FERC may propose and implement new rules and regulations affecting interstate natural gas transmission and storage companies, which remain subject to the FERC’s jurisdiction. These initiatives may also affect certain transmission of gas by intrastate pipelines.
Our Spectra Energy Partners and DCP Midstream operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various other federal, state and local environmental agencies. See “Environmental Matters” for a discussion of environmental regulation. Our U.S. interstate natural gas pipelines and certain of DCP Midstream’s gathering and transmission pipelines are also subject to the regulations of the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) concerning pipeline safety.
Express-Platte pipeline system rates and tariffs are subject to regulation by the NEB in Canada and the FERC in the U.S. In addition, the Platte pipeline also operates as an intrastate pipeline in Wyoming and is subject to jurisdiction by the Wyoming Public Service Commission.
The intrastate natural gas and NGL pipelines owned by us and DCP Midstream are subject to state regulation. To the extent that the natural gas intrastate pipelines that transport natural gas in interstate commerce provide services under Section 311 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978, they are subject to FERC regulation. DCP Midstream’s interstate natural gas pipeline operations are also subject to regulation by the FERC. The natural gas gathering and processing activities of DCP Midstream are not subject to FERC regulation.
Our Canadian operations are governed by various federal and provincial agencies with respect to pipeline safety, including the NEB and the Transportation Safety Board, the British Columbia Oil and Gas Commission, the Alberta Energy Regulator and the Ontario Technical Standards and Safety Authority.
Our Canadian natural gas transmission and distribution operations and approximately two-thirds of the storage operations in Canada are subject to regulation by the NEB or the provincial agencies in Canada, such as the OEB. These agencies have 
24

jurisdiction similar to the FERC for regulating rates, the terms and conditions of service, the construction of additional facilities and acquisitions. Our BC Field Services business in western Canada is regulated by the NEB pursuant to a framework for light-handed regulation under which the NEB acts on a complaints-basis for rates associated with that business. Similarly, the rates charged by our Canadian Midstream operations for gathering and processing services in western Canada are regulated on a complaints-basis by applicable provincial regulators.
Environmental Matters
We are subject to various U.S. federal, state and local laws and regulations, as well as Canadian federal and provincial regulations, regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters.
Environmental laws and regulations affecting our U.S.-based operations include, but are not limited to:

• | The Clean Air Act (CAA) and the 1990 amendments to the CAA, as well as state laws and regulations affecting air emissions (including State Implementation Plans related to existing and new national ambient air quality standards), which may limit new sources of air emissions. Our natural gas processing, transmission and storage assets are considered sources of air emissions and are thereby subject to the CAA. Owners and/or operators of air emission sources, like us, are responsible for obtaining permits for existing and new sources of air emissions and for annual compliance and reporting.


• | The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Clean Water Act), which requires permits for facilities that discharge wastewaters into the environment. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) amended parts of the Clean Water Act and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to oil spills. The OPA imposes certain spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements. Although we are primarily a natural gas business, the OPA affects our business primarily because of the presence of liquid hydrocarbons (condensate) in our offshore pipelines.


• | The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), which imposes liability for remediation costs associated with environmentally contaminated sites. Under CERCLA, any individual or entity that currently owns or in the past owned or operated a disposal site can be held liable and required to share in remediation costs, as well as transporters or generators of hazardous substances sent to a disposal site. Because of the geographical extent of our operations, we have disposed of waste at many different sites and therefore have CERCLA liabilities.


• | The Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which requires certain solid wastes, including hazardous wastes, to be managed pursuant to a comprehensive regulatory regime. As part of our business, we generate solid waste within the scope of these regulations and therefore must comply with such regulations.


• | The Toxic Substances Control Act, which requires that polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) contaminated materials be managed in accordance with a comprehensive regulatory regime. Because of the historical use of lubricating oils containing PCBs, the internal surfaces of some of our pipeline systems are contaminated with PCBs, and liquids and other materials removed from these pipelines must be managed in compliance with such regulations.


• | The National Environmental Policy Act, which requires federal agencies to consider potential environmental effects in their decisions, including site approvals. Many of our capital projects require federal agency review, and therefore the environmental effects of proposed projects are a factor in determining whether we will be permitted to complete proposed projects.

Environmental laws and regulations affecting our Canadian-based operations include, but are not limited to:

• | The Fisheries Act (Canada), which regulates activities near any body of water in Canada.


• | The Environmental Management Act (BC), the Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (Alberta) and the Environmental Protection Act (Ontario) are provincial laws governing various aspects, including permitting and site remediation obligations, of our facilities and operations in those provinces.


• | The Canadian Environmental Protection Act, which, among other things, requires the reporting of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from our operations in Canada. Additional regulations to be promulgated under this Act may require the reduction of GHGs, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, volatile organic compounds and particulate matter.


• | The Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (CEAA 2012) requires the NEB to consider potential environmental effects in its decisions for designated projects. The NEB under its enabling statute also conducts

25

environmental assessments for projects that are not specifically designated under CEAA 2012. In either case, prior to receiving an approval to construct or operate a federally-regulated pipeline or facility, the NEB must consider a series of environmental factors, in particular whether the project has the potential to have adverse environmental effects. These types of assessments occur in relation to both maintenance and capital projects.
For more information on environmental matters, including possible liability and capital costs, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 5 and 21, of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Except to the extent discussed in Notes 5 and 21, compliance with international, federal, state, provincial and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise protecting the environment, is incorporated into the routine cost structure of our various business units and is not expected to have a material effect on our competitive position or consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
Geographic Regions
For a discussion of our Canadian operations and the risks associated with them, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk—Foreign Currency Risk, and Notes 4 and 20 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Employees
We had approximately 6,000 employees as of December 31, 2016, including approximately 3,600 employees in Canada. In addition, DCP Midstream employed approximately 2,700 employees as of such date. Approximately 1,300 of our Canadian employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements governing their employment with us. Approximately 80% of those employees are covered under agreements that either have expired or will expire by December 31, 2017.
