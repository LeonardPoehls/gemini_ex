Item 1. | Business.
--------+----------

 
uSell.com, Inc. is a large market maker of used smartphones. uSell acquires products from both individual consumers, on its website, uSell.com, and from major carriers, big box retailers, and manufacturers through its subsidiary, We Sell Cellular. The Company maximizes the value of these devices by reclassifying them, adding value to them, and moving them throughout the world to those who want them most. In order to serve its global and highly diverse customer base, uSell leverages both a traditional sales force and an online marketplace where professional buyers of used smartphones can buy inventory on-demand. Through participation on uSell’s online platform and through interaction with uSell’s salesforce, buyers can acquire high volumes of inventory in a cost effective manner, while minimizing risk.
 
Device Acquisition
 
uSell has two primary means of sourcing devices to satisfy demand from its global base of customers. The first source is through its wholly-owned subsidiary, We Sell Cellular, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2015. We Sell Cellular is among a handful of top tier wholesalers whose primary business is to buy used smartphones that have been traded in with the major carriers and the big box retailers, fully inspect and grade these devices, and then sell these devices wholesale and retail through its highly experienced sales force. We Sell Cellular is one of a few wholesalers that has qualified for R2 certification, the industry standard for both data destruction and environmental protection.
 
uSell’s second method of sourcing devices is through its website, uSell.com, where individual consumers can find cash offers for their items based on the make, model, and condition of each item. Upon accepting an offer, consumers can ship their devices for free using either a prepaid shipping kit or shipping label, and then track the progress of their orders online from initiation to final payment of their devices. We have historically utilized consumer oriented advertising efforts, such as direct response television commercials and various forms of Internet advertising, to attract sellers to our website. However, during 2015, we decided to strategically reduce our marketing spend in favor of seeking out wholesale supply.
 
Device Disposition
 
We sell devices through three primary means:
 

● | Utilizing our proprietary marketplace bidding platforms where buyers can source devices on demand 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Employing our highly experienced sales force to sell devices to our global customer base 
● | Leveraging third party eCommerce platforms such as eBay and Amazon 

 
While a minority of our product is sold directly to consumers via third party eCommerce platforms, the majority of our sales are to professional buyers. These buyers include brick and mortar retailers, online retailers, large and small wholesalers, small repair shops, large refurbishing providers, and insurance companies. Approximately two-thirds of our customer base is in the United States, with the balance abroad. We are able to provide all of our buyers with a low risk, cost-efficient way to acquire inventory. Through participation on uSell’s online marketplace or through interaction with our salesforce, our buyers gain access to the high volume of devices that we acquire through both wholesale and retail means, without taking on the risk and investment involved in marketing directly to consumers or purchasing directly from carriers, big box retailers, and manufacturers.
 
Revenue Model
 
We generate revenue by either taking possession of devices and selling these devices for a premium (“Principal Device Revenue”) or by facilitating transactions between buyers and sellers and collecting a commission (“Agent Commission Revenue”). The bulk of our revenue is from Principal Device Revenue.
 
Business derived from our uSell.com website utilizes an Agent Commission Revenue model, whereby we do not take possession of the devices that are sold to us by sellers, but rather facilitate transactions between these consumers and our network of professional buyers. Historically, some of the devices we acquired through our usell.com website utilized our Managed by uSell service, whereby we partnered with a third party logistics company to inspect and process devices before passing them along to buyers offering the highest prices for each device. Through this approach, we took possession of devices for a brief period of time before they were passed on to the ultimate buyer. However, by the end of 2016, we shut down our Managed by uSell service and shifted all of our business from uSell.com to the Agent Commission Revenue model.
 
Devices sourced wholesale through our subsidiary, We Sell Cellular, are all bought and sold using the Principal Device Revenue model. Given that our wholesale sourcing channel is substantially larger than our retail sourcing channel, the vast majority of our business is characterized by the Principal Device Revenue approach.

Company Evolution
 
Our vision to build the premier online platform to match supply and demand of used mobile devices was established in 2010, as the smartphone trade in market was just beginning to take shape. From the beginning, we recognized the value of connecting a global marketplace of smaller wholesalers, distributors, and retailers with supply that they could otherwise not access. In April, 2012, we acquired ecoSquid Inc., or Acquisition Corp, which had developed the intellectual property that we licensed in order to implement the first iteration of our online platform.
 
Over the next two years, uSell acquired supply by advertising the uSell.com website directly to consumers, primarily through direct response, television advertising. Over time, an analysis of consumer price elasticity indicated that price, more so than any form of paid marketing, was what drove seller behavior. It became apparent that the way to increase the price that our buyers would pay our sellers for their devices was to reduce risk and eliminate friction in the transaction. These reductions in risk and friction came in many forms: automated shipping and logistics, seamless payment processing, and finally, centralized grading of devices with the launch of our Managed by uSell offering in October, 2014.
 
By the end of 2014, the trade in market had gone mainstream, as the carriers realized that trade-in was their means of eliminating the costly smartphone subsidies that they had been funding. During the launch of the iPhone 6 and 6S, major carriers like AT&T and Verizon and big box retailers, like Apple and Best Buy, became very aggressive in marketing their trade in programs. While this market shift created a challenge in terms of marketing directly to consumers, it presented the much larger opportunity of leveraging our technology to connect supply from major carriers, retailers, and manufacturers with demand from our large and growing global customer base
 
In 2015, we began seeking partnerships with wholesalers and distributors with direct access to this supply. Our efforts culminated in the acquisition of a top tier wholesaler, We Sell Cellular, in October, 2015. We Sell Cellular is among a handful of top tier wholesalers whose primary business is to buy used smartphones that have been traded in with the major carriers and the big box retailers, fully test and grade these devices, and then sell these devices wholesale and retail through its highly experienced sales force.
 
In 2016, we validated the synergy between uSell and We Sell Cellular by successfully integrating the two companies and migrating a meaningful portion of We Sell Cellular’s business online through the launch on our online auction platform. Furthermore, by empowering We Sell Cellular’s sales force with better technology and actionable data, we were able to drive meaningful improvements in efficiency.
 
In 2017, we continued to develop the platforms and technologies required to move the bulk of our customer interactions online. We also invested resources in optimizing the processes and technology needed to test and grade devices in our warehouse, with the aim of increasing processing efficiency while providing device level traceability to our suppliers. These improvements in our capabilities enabled us to expand relationships with both new and existing suppliers. Moving forward, the Company intends to complete the migration of its sales online and to continue to optimize its processes and technology to reduce waste throughout the entire transaction lifecycle.
 
Market Opportunity
 
Seven years ago, trade-in was merely an idea. Less than 10% of consumers at the time reported selling their used mobile devices. The vast majority of these valuable devices wasted away in potential sellers’ drawers. Numerous concepts arose to capture this untapped value, from websites that offered to purchase devices directly, to marketplaces that enabled consumers to sell devices peer to peer, to ATM machines that offered cash for smartphones on the spot, and finally to point of sale trade-in systems marketed through carriers and retailers.
 
At first it was unclear which of these concepts was going to win, but these doubts have been erased over the last four years, as the wireless carriers realized that trade-in was their means of eliminating the costly smartphone subsidies that they had been funding. The dominant model that has evolved has two components: a leasing or financing component where the consumer is able to defer the cost of a device, and a trade-in component at the end of the term whereby the carrier can capture the residual value of the device. This model has achieved such rapid adoption that Apple offered its own solution in early September, 2015, with the launch of its iPhone Upgrade Program. For retailers like Apple, this model offers a different opportunity: the chance to control the relationship with the consumer.
 
As programs like these continue to proliferate throughout the world, the used smartphone market will expand dramatically. Deloitte Global estimates that the global used smartphone market was worth $17 billion in 2016, representing 50% growth over 2015. Furthermore, it forecasts that the growth rate of the used smartphone market is 4-5 times higher than the overall smartphone market and that it will likely accelerate through 2020 as both consumers and suppliers increasingly embrace the practice of selling or acquiring second-hand smartphones.
 
Despite this massive opportunity, there is no dominant online platform for smartphones geared towards professional merchants looking to acquire inventory.

Competition
 
The trade-in market for used mobile devices has gained significant momentum. Competitors include:
 

● | Wireless carriers offering trade-in as a way for consumers to self-subsidize smartphones, either through a direct trade-in program, an Equipment Installment Plan (EIP), or a handset lease. While these carriers compete directly with our uSell.com trade-in platform, we also view them as an important channel to source wholesale inventory 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Retailers and big box stores such as Best Buy and Walmart that have implemented buyback programs. These retailers offer trade-in programs that issue gift cards or store credit. As in the case of the wireless carriers, these retailers compete directly with our uSell.com trade in platform, but they are also a channel to source wholesale inventory 


● | Large handset distributors and handset insurance providers that process and resell traded in devices for the carriers. As in the above cases, these companies also act as a channel to source wholesale inventory 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Large wholesalers and distributors, similar to We Sell Cellular, that purchase traded in devices from major carriers, big box retailers, manufacturers, and logistics providers. We estimate that, in the United States, there are fewer than five wholesalers of similar size to We Sell Cellular with the required certifications and financial resources to service the major carriers and retailers. We believe that, among these wholesalers, there is little to no technology enablement and a general lack of professional management 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct-to-consumer buyers such as Gazelle.com and ecoATM (both owned by Outerwall, Inc.) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Traditional online marketplaces such as eBay and online classified sites such as Craigslist. These sites continue to offer an alternative to sellers but require a time intensive review of all available offers and less streamlined logistics. While we compete with these platforms to source devices, we also utilize them to sell devices

Government Regulation
 
Advertising and promotional information presented to visitors on our websites and other marketing activities that we have undertaken are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws that regulate unfair and deceptive practices. In the United States, Congress has begun to adopt legislation that regulates certain aspects of the Internet, including online content, user privacy, taxation, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. Such legislation includes the Communications Decency Act of 1996, which regulates content of material on the Internet and the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, which provides recourse for owners of copyrighted material who believe that their rights under U.S. copyright law have been infringed on the Internet. In the area of data protection, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and certain state agencies have investigated various Internet companies’ use of their customers’ personal information, and certain federal and state statutes regulate specific aspects of privacy and data collection practices. We are also subject to a variety of state and federal regulations and laws including state telemarketing laws, federal and state privacy laws, the CAN-SPAM Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act and its accompanying regulations and guidelines, including “little” unfair trade practice laws. Because we have in the past and may in the future engage in marketing activities over the Internet and email, we may be subject to some of these laws and regulations.
 
Federal, state, local and foreign governments are also considering other legislative and regulatory proposals that would regulate the Internet in more and different ways than exist today. It is impossible to predict whether new restrictions, fees, or taxes will be imposed on our services, and whether and how we would be affected. Increased regulation of the Internet both in the United States and abroad may decrease its growth and hinder technological development, which may negatively impact the cost of doing business via the Internet or otherwise materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or operational results.
 
Employees
 
As of March 23, 2018, we had 88 full-time employees and no part-time employees. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our proprietary intellectual property consists of trade secrets. We rely primarily on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, trade secret laws, and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. We enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial buyers and control access to, and distribution of our software documentation and other proprietary information. Our copyrights, trademarks and licenses expire at various dates, and we believe that none is individually significant.
