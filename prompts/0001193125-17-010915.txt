Overview 
 AEP Industries Inc., founded in 1970 and incorporated in Delaware in 1985, is a leading manufacturer of flexible plastic packaging films in North America. We manufacture and market an extensive and diverse line of polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride flexible plastic packaging products, with consumer, industrial and agricultural applications. Our flexible plastic packaging films are used in the packaging, transportation, beverage, food, automotive, pharmaceutical, chemical, electronics, construction, agriculture, carpeting, furniture and textile industries. 
 We manufacture plastic films, principally from resins blended with other raw materials, which we either sell or further process by printing, laminating, slitting or converting. Our processing technologies enable us to create a variety of value-added products according to the specifications of our customers. Our manufacturing operations are located in the United States and Canada. 
 We manufacture both industrial grade products, which are manufactured to general industry specifications, and specialty products, which are manufactured under more exacting standards to assure certain required chemical and physical properties. Specialty products generally sell at higher margins than industrial grade products. 
 The Companys operations are conducted within one business segment. Information about our operations by geographical area, with United States and Canada stated separately, as of and for the years ended October 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, is as follows:

 No single customer accounted for more than 10% of net sales in any of the last three fiscal years. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance at October 31, 2016 or 2015. See Note 13 in our consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Companys operations by geographical area (United States and Canada). 
 Custom Films 
 We believe that the strength of our custom film operations lies in our variety of product applications, high quality control standards, well-trained and knowledgeable sales force and commitment to customer service. Most of the custom films manufactured by us, which may be as many as 35,000 separate and distinct products in any given year, are custom designed to meet the specific needs of our customers. 
 We manufacture a broad range of custom films, generally for industrial applications, including sheeting, tubing and bags. Bags are drum, box, carton and pail liners that are usually cut, rolled or perforated. These bags can also be used to package specialty items such as furniture and mattresses. We also manufacture films to protect high value items stored outdoors or in transit, such as boats and cars, and a wide array of shrink films, barrier films and overwrap films. 
 Stretch (Pallet) Wrap 
 We manufacture an extensive line of stretch film products for both hand wrap and rotary applications, using both monolayer and co-extruded constructions used to wrap pallets of industrial and commercial goods for shipping or storage. We also market a wide variety of pre stretch and high performance products designed for specialty uses. 
Food Contact 
 We manufacture specifically formulated in-store and pre-store films with our Resinite® line of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) food wrap for the supermarket and industrial markets. We offer a broad 
 
5 
 
 range of products with approximately 50 different formulations. Our Griffin, Georgia facility also produces dispenser (Zip Safe® cutter) boxes containing polyvinyl chloride food wrap for sale to consumers and institutions, including restaurants, schools, hospitals and penitentiaries. These institutional polyvinyl chloride food wrap products are marketed under several private labels and under our own SealWrap® name. The oxygen transmission properties of our PVC films make them ideal for packaging fresh red meats, poultry, fish, fruits, vegetables and bakery products. 
 We also produce high quality plastic cast film bags with a non-color reclosable zipper seal (SealNLoc) and other food contact products including blown plastic film fold-top bags. The SealNLoc product line consists of sandwich bags, snack bags, quart size and gallon size bags. 
 PROformance Films®
We offer a comprehensive range of coextruded polyethylene film products used as a critical component in flexible packaging laminations, direct food contact, protective masking, medical, pharmaceutical and industrial applications. We manufacture these products using both blown and cast processes and offer mono to seven layer films. They are custom designed for strength, clarity, oxygen and moisture barriers, as well as other specifications required for demanding packaging applications. 
 Canliners 
 The canliners product line includes retail kitchen and standard trash bags, retail lawn and leaf trash bags and institutional trash bags all of which are available with flap ties, handles and draw tape closures. In addition to the different closures, the canliners come in different sizes, gauges (thickness), colors, scents and strengths. 
Printed and Converted Films 
 We manufacture up to ten color printing, sheeting, and wicketed bags. Our printed and converted films provide printed rollstock to the food and beverage industries and other manufacturing and distributing companies. We also convert printed rollstock to bags for use by bakeries, fresh or frozen food processors, manufacturers or other dry goods processors. 
Other Products and Specialty Films 
 We also manufacture other products in order to meet the full spectrum of our customers total packaging requirements. We manufacture unplasticized polyvinyl chloride (UPVC) film for use in battery labels, credit card laminates, and a variety of film products with agricultural applications such as silage (Sunfilm® sheet materials), smooth mulch films, and fumigation films. We also produce disposable consumer and institutional plastic products for the food service, party supply and school/collegiate markets, marketed under the Sta-Dri® brand name. Products produced include table covers and skirts, aisle runners, aprons, bibs, gloves, boots, freezer/storage bags, saddle pack bags, locker wrap and custom imprint designs. 
Manufacturing 
 We currently conduct our manufacturing operations at 14 strategically located and integrated facilities in the United States and Canada. 12 manufacturing facilities are ISO-certified (International Organization for Standardization), with the exception of our Mankato institutional products facility and the West Hill, Ontario, Canada facility. We manufacture both industrial grade products, which are manufactured to industry specifications or for distribution from inventory, and specialty products, which are manufactured under more exacting standards to assure that their chemical and physical properties meet the particular requirements of the customer or the specialized application appropriate to its intended market. Specialty products generally sell at higher margins than industrial grade products. The size and location of our manufacturing facilities, as well as their ability to manufacture multiple 
 
6 
 
 types of flexible packaging products and to flexibly adjust product mix as market conditions warrant enable us to minimize overhead and transportation costs to better serve our customers and remain competitive. See Item 2, Properties for a discussion of product lines manufactured at each facility as of October 31, 2016. 
 In the film manufacturing process, resins with various properties are blended with chemicals and other additives to achieve a wide range of specified product characteristics, such as color, clarity, tensile strength, toughness, thickness, shrinkability, surface friction, transparency, sealability and permeability. The gauges of our products range from less than one mil (.001 inches) to more than 10 mils (.01 inches). Our extrusion equipment can produce printed products and film up to 40 feet wide. The blending of various kinds of resin combined with chemical and color additives is computer controlled to avoid waste and to maximize product consistency. The blended mixture is melted by a combination of applied heat and friction under pressure and is then mechanically mixed. The mixture is then forced through a die, at which point it is expanded into a flat sheet or a vertical tubular column of film and cooled. Several mixtures can be forced through separate layers of a co-extrusion die to produce a multi-layered film (co-extrusion), each layer having specific and distinct characteristics. The cooled film can then be shipped to a customer or can be further processed and then shipped. Generally, our manufacturing plants operate 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
 We regularly upgrade or replace older equipment in order to keep abreast of technological advances and to maximize production efficiencies by reducing labor costs, waste, maintenance and production time. During the past four fiscal years, we have invested an aggregate of $101.3 million, of which $15.9 million was spent in fiscal 2016, primarily in new machinery and equipment in order to boost output and productivity in those product lines we believe provide us significant growth opportunities, enhance automation to control labor costs, satisfy increasing demand in certain product lines, improve service to our customers and prepare us for anticipated long term growth concurrent with anticipated increase in resin production. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 focused primarily in our custom films and canliner businesses. 
 Raw Materials 
 We manufacture film products primarily from polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride resins, all of which are available from a number of domestic and foreign suppliers. We select our suppliers based on the price, quality and characteristics of the resins they produce. We currently purchase resins from major North American resin suppliers and believe any combination of purchases from such suppliers, as well as other suppliers we do not currently do business with, could satisfy our ongoing resin requirements. Our top three suppliers of resin during fiscal 2016 supplied us with 28%, 22% and 13%, respectively, of our aggregate resin purchases, which is consistent with our historical resin purchases from our top three suppliers in aggregate. Given the significant effect of resin costs on our operations and financial results, we have elected to focus our purchases with three suppliers in order to take advantage of the volume rebates which are customary among resin suppliers and critical to our success. Although the plastics industry has from time to time experienced shortages of resin supply and we have limited contractual protections in the event of such shortage, we believe we are well positioned to deal with such risks given our significant relationships and history with existing suppliers, as well as suppliers with whom we currently do not do business. 
 The resins used by us are produced from petroleum and natural gas. Instability in the world markets for petroleum and natural gas could adversely affect the prices of our raw materials, and this could have an adverse effect on our profitability if there is an increase in resin costs that cannot be passed on to customers in full or on a timely basis. See Item 1A, Risk Factors.

Quality Control 
 We believe that maintaining the highest standards of quality in all aspects of our manufacturing operations plays an important part in our ability to maintain our competitive position. We have adopted strict quality control systems and procedures designed to test the mechanical properties of our products, such as strength, puncture resistance, elasticity, abrasion characteristics and sealability, which we regularly review and modify as appropriate. As part of our commitment in providing the highest level of quality to our customers, we maintain an ISO 9001:2008 quality system in 12 of our 14 of manufacturing operations. ISO 9001:2008 is a quality management standard that helps organizations achieve standards of quality that are recognized and respected throughout the world. 
Marketing and Sales 
 We believe that our ability to provide superior service to our customers is critical to our success. Even in those markets where our products are considered commodities and price is the single most important factor, we believe that our sales and marketing capabilities, our ability to offer a broad line of products to our customers, and our timely delivery is a competitive advantage. To that end, we have established good relations with our suppliers and have long-standing relationships with most of our customers. We serve approximately 3,000 customers worldwide, none of which individually accounted for more than 10% of our net sales in fiscal 2016. 
 We believe that our research and development efforts, much of our high-efficiency, automated and microprocessor-controlled equipment, and the technical training given to our sales personnel enhance our ability to expand our sales in all of our product lines. An important component of our marketing philosophy is the ability of our sales personnel to provide technical assistance to customers. Our sales force regularly consults with customers with respect to performance of our products and the customers particular needs and then communicates with appropriate research and development staff regarding these matters. In conjunction with the research and development staff, sales personnel are often able to recommend a product or suggest a resin blend to produce the product with the characteristics and properties which best suit the customers requirements. 
 We generally sell either directly to customers who are end-users of our products or to distributors, including nation-wide brokers, for resale to end-users. In each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, approximately 60% of our worldwide sales were directly to distributors with the balance representing sales to end-users.
Distribution 
 We believe that the timely delivery of our products to customers is a critical factor in our ability to maintain and grow our market position. In North America, the majority of our deliveries are by contracted third parties, with approximately 12.5% of US shipments handled by the AEP private fleet in fiscal 2016. The private fleet is used strategically to support most of the AEP logistics facilities. The Company is increasing its use of the private fleet and will continue to do so as it provides the Company a cost effective option in areas where there are carrier capacity issues. We monitor and control all shipments through On Demand Transportation Management System (TMS) software. The TMS system provides detailed reports, tracking of every shipment to customer delivery and carrier management. This enables us to better control the distribution process and ensure priority handling and direct transportation of products to our customers, thus improving the speed, reliability and efficiency of delivery. 
 Because of the geographic dispersion of our plants, we are able to deliver most of our products within a 500 mile radius of our plants. This enables us to reduce our use of warehouse space to store products and utilize the most efficient and economical shipping methods. We also ship products great distances when necessary and export from the United States and Canada.

Research and Development 
 As of October 31, 2016, we had a research and development department with a staff of 17 persons. In addition, other members of management and supervisory personnel, from time to time, devote various amounts of time to research and development activities. The principal efforts of our research and development department are directed to assisting sales personnel in designing specialty products to meet an individual customers needs, developing new products and reformulating existing products to improve quality and/or reduce production costs. During fiscal 2016, due to the anticipated increase in raw material supply in the next few years, our research and development department increased its focus on approving new suppliers and new resin which resulted in short-term savings as well as expected long-term savings. Our research and development department has developed a number of products with unique properties, which we consider proprietary, certain of which are protected by patents. In each of fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we spent $2.0 million for research and development activities. Research and development expense is included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of operations. 
Intellectual Property 
 We own a number of patents, trademarks and licenses that relate to some of our products and manufacturing processes, and apply for new patents on significant product and process developments when appropriate. Although we believe that our patents and trademarks collectively provide us with a competitive advantage, we are not dependent on any single patent or trademark. Rather, we believe our success depends on our marketing, manufacturing, and purchasing skills, as well as our ongoing research and development and unpatented proprietary know-how. We believe that the expiration or unenforceability of any of our patents, trademark registrations or licenses would not be material to our financial conditions or results of operations. 
Competition 
 The business of supplying flexible plastic packaging products is extremely competitive, and we face competition from a substantial number of companies which sell similar and substitute packaging products. Some of our competitors are subsidiaries or divisions of large, international, diversified companies with extensive production facilities, well-developed sales and marketing staffs and substantial financial resources. 
 We compete principally with (i) local manufacturers, who compete with us in specific geographic areas, generally within a 500 mile radius of their plants, (ii) companies which specialize in the extrusion of a limited group of products, which they market nationally, and (iii) a limited number of manufacturers of flexible packaging products who offer a broad range of products and maintain production and marketing facilities domestically and internationally. 
 Because many of our products are available from a number of local, national and international manufacturers, competition is highly price-sensitive and margins are relatively low. We believe that all of our products require efficient, low cost and high-speed production to remain cost competitive. We believe we also compete on the basis of quality, service and product differentiation. 
 We believe that there are few barriers to entry into many of our markets, enabling new and existing competitors to rapidly affect market conditions. As a result, we may experience increased competition resulting from the introduction of products by new manufacturers. In addition, in several of our markets, products are generally regarded as commodities. As a result, competition in such markets is based almost entirely on price and service. 
 Environmental Matters 
 We believe that there are no current environmental matters which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See discussion of environmental risk factors in Item 1A, Risk Factors. 
 
9 
 
Employees 
 At October 31, 2016, we had approximately 2,600 full and part time employees worldwide, including officers and administrative personnel. As of such date, we had three collective bargaining agreements covering 479 employees, which expire in March 2017, December 2018 and January 2020, respectively. While we believe that our relations with our employees are satisfactory, a dispute between our employees and us could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.
