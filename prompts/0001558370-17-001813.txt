     ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
     OVERVIEW 
     Merchants Bancshares, Inc. (“Merchants”) is a bank holding company originally organized under Vermont law in 1983 (and subsequently reincorporated in Delaware in 1987) for the purpose of owning all of the outstanding capital stock of Merchants Bank. Merchants Bank, which is Merchants’ primary subsidiary, is a Vermont-based commercial bank with thirty-one full-service banking offices located throughout the state of Vermont and one full-service banking office in Massachusetts.
     Merchants Bank was organized in 1849; and as of December 31, 2016, is the sole remaining independent statewide commercial banking operation headquartered in Vermont, with deposits totaling $1.53 billion, gross loans of $1.51 billion, and total assets of $2.06 billion.  On December 4, 2015, Merchants completed the acquisition of NUVO Bank & Trust Company, which was merged with and into Merchants Bank.  As used herein, “Merchants,” “the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our” shall mean Merchants Bancshares, Inc. and our subsidiaries unless otherwise noted or the context otherwise requires. 
     Merchants Bank’s trust division offers investment management, financial planning and trustee services.  As of December 31, 2016, this division had fiduciary responsibility for assets having a market value in excess of $541 million, of which more than $516 million constituted managed assets. 
     MBVT Statutory Trust I (the “Trust”) was formed on December 15, 2004 as part of our private placement of an aggregate of $20.62 million of trust preferred securities through a pooled trust preferred program.  The Trust was formed for the sole purpose of issuing non-voting capital securities.  The proceeds from the sale of the capital securities were loaned to us under junior subordinated debentures issued to the Trust. The debentures are the only asset of the Trust and payments under the debentures are the sole revenue of the Trust. 
     On October 22, 2016, the Company entered into a definitive merger agreement to be acquired by Community Bank System, Inc.  The merger is subject to the approval by the stockholders of Merchants Bancshares, Inc. and regulatory authorities and is expected to close in the late second or early third quarter of 2017.
     EMPLOYEES 
     As of December 31, 2016, we employed 278 full-time and 23 part-time employees. We maintain comprehensive employee benefits programs for employees, including major medical and dental insurance, long-term and short-term disability insurance, life insurance and a 401(k) plan. We believe that relations with our employees are favorable.       COMPETITION
     Merchants Bank’s primary market areas are Vermont (statewide) and Western Massachusetts (Hamden County). Based upon the FDIC deposit market share data report for June 30, 2016, Merchants Bank had 10.78% of the Vermont deposit market, representing the third largest market share of deposits in Vermont; NUVO, a division of Merchants Bank, held 0.04% of the Massachusetts deposit market, with a 0.98% market share in their primary market of Hamden County.  Merchants Bank and its divisions compete for commercial loans, deposits, trust and investment services, and mortgages, primarily with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking companies, and credit unions. Presently, there are eleven independent banks headquartered in the state of Vermont and twelve regional or national banks have operations in Vermont.  Merchants Bank remains the only independent statewide bank headquartered in Vermont. 
     We believe the growth in average loans and deposits between 2006 and 2016 contributed to Merchants Bank remaining the largest Vermont-based independent bank. Customers have cited the local management and decision-making as important considerations when choosing our bank.  This structure allows Merchants Bank to enter the market with a premier service offering to our customers. Our approach for deposit and loan growth is the interest rate paid, related fees,

access to services through convenient delivery channels, and development of relationships.  Customer behavior necessitates increased technology in delivery channels for banking services which operate without the traditional costs of a local retail infrastructure; this has compelled Merchants Bank to compete in mobile and online technologies.
     No material part of our business is dependent upon one, or a few, customers, or upon a particular industry segment, the loss of which would have a material adverse impact on our operations.
     REGULATION AND SUPERVISION
     General 
     As a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “BHCA”), we are subject to regulation and supervision by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”). As an FDIC-insured state-chartered commercial bank, Merchants Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the “FDIC”) and by the Commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation of the State of Vermont (the “Commissioner”). This regulatory framework is intended to protect depositors, the federal deposit insurance fund, consumers and the banking system as a whole, and not necessarily investors in the Company. The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the statutes, regulations, policies and guidelines described below.     Bank Holding Company Regulation
     Source of Strength. Under the BHCA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the Company is required to serve as a source of financial strength for Merchants Bank. This support may be required at times when the Company may not have the resources to provide support to Merchants Bank. In the event of a bank holding company’s bankruptcy, any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a bank subsidiary will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment.
     Acquisitions and Activities. The BHCA prohibits a bank holding company, without prior approval of the FRB, from acquiring all or substantially all the assets of a bank, acquiring control of a bank, merging or consolidating with another bank holding company, or acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company if, after such acquisition, the acquiring bank holding company would control more than 5% of any class of the voting shares of such other bank or bank holding company. The BHCA also prohibits a bank holding company from engaging directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking, managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its subsidiary banks.  However, a bank holding company may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities that the FRB had determined to be closely related to banking or managing and controlling banks.
     Limitations on Acquisitions of Company Common Stock. The Change in Bank Control Act prohibits a person or group of persons acting in concert from acquiring “control” of a bank holding company unless the FRB has been notified and has not objected to the transaction. Under a rebuttable presumption established by the FRB, the acquisition of 10% or more of a class of voting securities of a bank holding company, such as the Company, with a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, would, under the circumstances set forth in the presumption, constitute the acquisition of control of a bank holding company. In addition, the BHCA prohibits any company from acquiring control of a bank or bank holding company without first having obtained the approval of the FRB. Among other circumstances, under the BHCA, a company has control of a bank or bank holding company if the company owns, controls or holds with power to vote 25% or more of a class of voting securities of the bank or bank holding company, controls in any manner the election of a majority of directors or trustees of the bank or bank holding company, or the FRB has determined, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that the company has the power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of the bank or bank holding company.
     Enforcement Powers. The FRB has the authority to issue orders to bank holding companies to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices and violations of law and regulations or conditions imposed by, or violations of agreements 

 
  6

 
with, or commitments to, the FRB. The FRB is also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals who violate the BHCA or orders or regulations thereunder, to order termination of non-banking activities of non-banking subsidiaries of bank holding companies, and to order termination of ownership and control of a non-banking subsidiary by a bank holding company.
     Regulation of Merchants Bank
     As an FDIC-insured state-chartered bank, Merchants Bank is subject to the supervision of and regulation by the Commissioner and the FDIC. This supervision and regulation is for the protection of depositors, the Deposit Insurance Fund (“DIF”) of the FDIC, and consumers, and is not for the protection of Merchants’ stockholders. The prior approval of the FDIC and the Commissioner is required, among other things, for Merchants Bank to establish or relocate an additional branch office, assume deposits, or engage in any merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of all or substantially all of the assets of any bank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, the FRB may directly examine the subsidiaries of Merchants, including Merchants Bank.
     Deposit Insurance. The deposit obligations of Merchants Bank are insured up to applicable limits by the DIF and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the DIF. The Dodd-Frank Act permanently increased the FDIC deposit insurance limit to $250,000 per depositor for deposits maintained in the same right and capacity at a particular insured depository institution. The Federal Deposit Insurance Act (the “FDIA”), as amended by the Federal Deposit Insurance Reform Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, requires the FDIC to take steps as may be necessary to cause the ratio of deposit insurance reserves to estimated insured deposits – the designated reserve ratio – to reach 1.35% by September 30, 2020, and it mandates that the reserve ratio designated by the FDIC for any year may not be less than 1.35%.   Further, the Dodd-Frank Act required that, in setting assessments, the FDIC offset the effect of the increase in the minimum reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35% on banks with less than $10 billion in assets. 
     To satisfy these requirements, on March 15, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors approved a final rule to increase the DIF’s reserve ratio to the statutorily required minimum ratio of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits.  The final rule imposes on large banks a surcharge of 4.5 basis points of their assessment base, after making certain adjustments. Large banks will pay quarterly surcharges in addition to their regular risk-based assessments. Overall, regular risk-based assessment rates will decline once the reserve ratio reaches 1.15%.  Small banks, such as the Bank, will receive credits to offset the portion of their assessments that help to raise the reserve ratio from 1.15% to 1.35%.  After the reserve ratio reaches 1.38%, the FDIC will automatically apply a small bank’s credits to reduce its regular assessment up to the entire amount of the assessment.  The final rule provided that these changes would become effective July 1, 2016 if the reserve ratio reached 1.15% prior to that date.  On June 30, 2016, the reserve ratio rose to 1.17%, which resulted in the revised deposit insurance assessment pricing becoming effective on July 1, 2016.
     Deposit premiums are based on assets.  To determine its deposit insurance premium, the Bank computes the base amount of its average consolidated assets less its average tangible equity (defined as the amount of Tier 1 capital) and the applicable assessment rate.  On April 26, 2016, the FDIC’s Board of Directors adopted a final rule that changed the manner in which deposit insurance assessment rates are calculated for established small banks, generally those banks with less than $10 billion of assets that have been insured for at least five years.  The rule updated the data and methodology that the FDIC uses to determine risk-based assessment rates for these institutions with the intent of better reflecting risks and ensuring that banks that take on greater risks pay more for deposit insurance than their less risky counterparts. The rule revised the financial ratios method used to determine assessment rates for these banks so that it is based on a statistical model that estimates the probability of failure over three years.  The rule eliminated risk categories for established small banks and uses the financial ratios method.  Under this method each of seven financial ratios and a weighted average of CAMELS component ratings will be multiplied by a corresponding pricing multiplier. The sum of these products will be added to a uniform amount, with the resulting sum being an institution’s initial base assessment rate (subject to minimum or maximum assessment rates based on a bank’s CAMELS composite rating).  This method takes into account various measures that are similar to the factors that the FDIC previously considered in assigning institutions to risk categories, including an institution’s leverage ratio, brokered deposit ratio, one year asset growth, the ratio of net income before taxes to total assets and considerations related to asset quality.   Under the small bank pricing rule, beginning the first assessment period after June 30, 2016, where the DIF’s reserve ratio has reached 1.15%, assessments for established small banks with a CAMELS rating of 1 or 2 will range from 1.5 to 16 basis points, after adjustments, while assessment rates for established small banks 

 
  7

 
with a CAMELS composite rating of 4 0r 5 may range from 11 to 30 basis points, after adjustments. Assessments for established small banks with a CAMLES rating of 3 will range from 3 to 30 basis points.
     The FDIC has the power to adjust deposit insurance assessment rates at any time. In addition, under the FDIA, the FDIC may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. Merchants Bank’s FDIC insurance expense in 2016 was $916 thousand.
     Acquisitions and Branching. Merchants Bank must seek prior regulatory approval from the Commissioner and the FDIC to acquire another bank or establish a new branch office. Well capitalized and well managed banks may acquire other banks in any state, subject to certain deposit concentration limits and other conditions, pursuant to the Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorizes a state-chartered bank, such as Merchants Bank; to establish new branches on an interstate basis to the same extent a bank chartered by the host state may establish branches.
     Activities and Investments of Insured State-Chartered Banks. Section 24 of the FDIA generally limits the types of equity investments an FDIC-insured state-chartered bank, such as Merchants Bank, may make and the kinds of activities in which such a bank may engage, as a principal, to those that are permissible for national banks. Further, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) permits national banks and state banks, to the extent permitted under state law, to engage – via financial subsidiaries – in certain activities that are permissible for subsidiaries of a financial holding company. In order to form a financial subsidiary, a state-chartered bank must be well capitalized, and such banks would be subject to certain capital deduction, risk management and affiliate transaction rules, among other things.
     Lending Restrictions. Federal law limits a bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons. Among other things, extensions of credit to insiders are required to be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons. Also, the terms of such extensions of credit may not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and may not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the bank’s capital. The Dodd-Frank Act explicitly provides that an extension of credit to an insider includes credit exposure arising from a derivatives transaction, repurchase agreement, reverse repurchase agreement, securities lending transaction or securities borrowing transaction. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act requires that asset sale transactions with insiders must be on market terms, and if the transaction represents more than 10% of the capital and surplus of Merchants Bank, be approved by a majority of the disinterested directors of Merchants Bank.
     Brokered Deposits. Section 29 of the FDIA and FDIC regulations generally limit the ability of an insured depository institution to accept, renew or roll over any brokered deposit unless the institution’s capital category is “well capitalized” or, with the FDIC’s approval, “adequately capitalized.” Depository institutions that have brokered deposits in excess of 10% of total assets will be subject to increased FDIC deposit insurance premium assessments. However, for institutions that are well capitalized and have a CAMELS composite rating of 1 or 2, reciprocal deposits are deducted from brokered deposits.
     Community Reinvestment Act. The Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”) requires the FDIC to evaluate Merchants Bank’s performance in helping to meet the credit needs of the entire communities it serves, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with its safe and sound banking operations, and to take this record into consideration when evaluating certain applications. The FDIC’s CRA regulations are generally based upon objective criteria of the performance of institutions under three key assessment tests: (i) a lending test, to evaluate the institution’s record of making loans in its service areas; (ii) an investment test, to evaluate the institution’s record of investing in community development projects, affordable housing, and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses; and (iii) a service test, to evaluate the institution’s delivery of services through its branches, ATMs, and other offices. Failure of an institution to receive at least a “Satisfactory” rating could inhibit Merchants Bank or the Company from undertaking certain activities, including engaging in activities permitted as a financial holding company under GLBA and acquisitions of other financial institutions. Merchants Bank has achieved a rating of “Satisfactory” on its most recent examination dated February 17, 2015.

     Enforcement Powers. The FDIC and the Commissioner have the authority to issue orders to banks under their supervision to cease and desist from unsafe or unsound banking practices and violations of law and regulation or conditions imposed by, or violations of agreements with, or commitments to, the FDIC or Commissioner. The FDIC and the Commissioner are also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals who violate banking laws, orders or regulations. 
     Massachusetts Banking Regulation.  As a result of the acquisition of NUVO Bank, Merchants Bank now operates a branch office in Massachusetts.  As a result, Merchants Bank is also subject to supervision and regulation by the Massachusetts Commissioner of Banks and to various Massachusetts statutes and regulations, including Massachusetts consumer protection and civil rights laws and regulations. 
     Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness
     Regulatory Capital Requirements. The FRB and the FDIC have issued substantially similar risk-based and leverage capital rules applicable to U.S. banking organizations such as the Company and the Bank. These rules are intended to reflect the relationship between the banking organization’s capital and the degree of risk associated with its operations based on transactions recorded on-balance sheet as well as off-balance sheet items. The FRB and the FDIC may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels discussed below, due to the banking organization’s financial condition or actual or anticipated growth.
     The capital adequacy rules define qualifying capital instruments and specify minimum amounts of capital as a percentage of assets that banking organizations are required to maintain. Common equity Tier I capital generally includes common stock and related surplus, retained earnings and, in certain cases and subject to certain limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries, less goodwill, other non-qualifying intangible assets and certain other deductions. Tier I capital for banks and bank holding companies generally consists of the sum of common equity Tier I capital, non-cumulative perpetual preferred stock, and related surplus and, in certain cases and subject to limitations, minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries that does not qualify as common equity Tier I capital, less certain deductions. Tier II capital generally consists of hybrid capital instruments, perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt securities, cumulative perpetual preferred stock, term subordinated debt and intermediate-term preferred stock, and, subject to limitations, allowances for loan losses. The sum of Tier I and Tier II capital less certain required deductions represents qualifying total risk-based capital. Prior to the effectiveness of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act, bank holding companies were permitted to include trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock in Tier I capital, subject to limitations. However, the FRB’s capital rule applicable to bank holding companies permanently grandfathers non-qualifying capital instruments, including trust preferred securities, issued before May 19, 2010 by depository institution holding companies with less than $15 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2009, subject to a limit of 25% of Tier I capital. In addition, under rules that became effective January 1, 2015, accumulated other comprehensive income (positive or negative) must be reflected in Tier I capital; however, the Company was permitted to make a one-time, permanent election to continue to exclude accumulated other comprehensive income from capital. The Company has made this election.
     Under the capital rules, risk-based capital ratios are calculated by dividing common equity Tier I capital, Tier I capital and total risk-based capital, respectively, by risk-weighted assets. Assets and off-balance sheet credit equivalents are assigned a risk weight based primarily on relative credit risk. 
     Under the Federal Reserve’s (FRB) capital rules applicable to the Company and the FDIC’s capital rules applicable to the Bank, the Company and the Bank are each required to maintain a minimum common equity Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 4.5%, a minimum Tier I capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 6%, a minimum total capital to risk-weighted assets ratio of 8% and a minimum leverage ratio of 4%. Additionally, subject to a transition schedule, the capital rules require an institution to establish a capital conservation buffer of common equity Tier I capital in an amount above the minimum risk-based capital requirements for “adequately capitalized” institutions equal to 2.5% of total risk weighted assets, or face restrictions on the ability to pay dividends, pay discretionary bonuses, and to engage in share repurchases.

 Under rules effective January 1, 2015, a bank holding company, such as Merchants Bancshares, is considered well capitalized if the bank holding company (i) has a total risk based capital ratio of at least 10%, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8%, and (iii) is not subject to any written agreement order, capital directive or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure. In addition, the FDIC has amended its prompt corrective action rules to reflect the new capital rules. Under the FDIC’s revised rules, which became effective January 1, 2015, an FDIC supervised institution, such as Merchants Bank is considered well capitalized if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of 10.0% or greater; (ii) a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 8.0% or greater; (iii) a common Tier 1 equity ratio of at least 6.5% or greater, (iv) a leverage capital ratio of 5.0% or greater; and (iv) is not subject to any written agreement, order, capital directive, or prompt corrective action directive to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure.  
     Generally, a bank, upon receiving notice that it is not adequately capitalized (i.e., that it is “undercapitalized”), becomes subject to the prompt corrective action provisions of Section 38 of FDIA that, for example, (i) restrict payment of capital distributions and management fees, (ii) require that is federal bank regulator monitor the condition of the institution and its efforts to restore its capital, (iii) require submission of a capital restoration plan, (iv) restrict the growth of the institution’s assets and (v) require prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals. A bank that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must concurrently submit a performance guarantee by each company that controls the bank. A bank that is “critically undercapitalized” (i.e., has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than 2.0%) will be subject to further restrictions, and generally will be placed in conservatorship or receivership within 90 days.
     The final rule also requires unrealized gains and losses on certain “available-for-sale” securities holdings to be included for purposes of calculating regulatory capital requirements unless a one-time opt-out is exercised.  Merchants elected to opt-out of this regulatory capital provision.  By opting out of the provision, Merchants retains what is known as the accumulated other comprehensive income filter.  The final rule limits a banking organization’s capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The phase-in period for the “capital conservation buffer” requirement began January 1, 2016 with a requirement to be 0.625% above the minimum risk-based capital requirements.  When fully phased in on January 1, 2019, banks must maintain a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.50%.
     The Company and Merchants Bank are considered “well capitalized” under all regulatory definitions.
     Safety and Soundness Standards. The FDIA requires the federal bank regulatory agencies to prescribe standards, by regulations or guidelines, relating to internal controls, information systems and internal audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings, stock valuation and compensation, fees and benefits, and such other operational and managerial standards as the agencies deem appropriate. Guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies establish general standards relating to internal controls and information systems, internal audit systems, risk management, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate exposure, asset growth, asset quality, earnings and compensation, fees and benefits. In general, these guidelines require, among other things, appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines. The guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer, employee, director or principal stockholder. In addition, the federal banking agencies adopted regulations that authorize, but do not require, an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan. If, after being so notified, an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan, the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order restricting asset growth, requiring an institution to increase its ration of tangible equity to assets or directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject under the “prompt corrective action” provisions of the FDIA. See “—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. If an institution fails to comply with such an order, the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties.

 Dividend Restrictions
    
We are a legal entity separate and distinct from Merchants Bank. Our revenue (on a parent company only basis) is derived primarily from interest and dividends paid to us by Merchants Bank. Our right, and consequently the right of our stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary through the payment of such dividends or otherwise is necessarily subject to the prior claims of creditors of the subsidiary (including depositors, in the case of Merchants Bank), except to the extent that certain claims of Merchants in a creditor capacity may be recognized.
    
It is the policy of the FRB that bank holding companies should pay dividends only out of current earnings and only if, after paying such dividends; the bank holding company would remain adequately capitalized. The FRB has the authority to prohibit a bank holding company, such as us, from paying dividends if it deems such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice. The FRB has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bank holding companies to pay dividends unless the bank holding company’s net income over the preceding year is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Further, our ability to pay dividends would be restricted if we do not maintain the capital conservation buffer. See “—Capital Adequacy and Safety and Soundness—Regulatory Capital Requirements” above. 
    
The FDIC has the authority to use its enforcement powers to prohibit a bank from paying dividends if, in its opinion, the payment of dividends would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. Federal law also prohibits the payment of dividends by a bank that will result in the bank failing to meet its applicable capital requirements on a pro forma basis. Vermont law requires the approval of state bank regulatory authorities if the dividends declared by state banks exceed prescribed limits.
     Certain Transactions by Bank Holding Companies with their Affiliates
     There are various statutory restrictions on the extent to which bank holding companies and their non-bank subsidiaries may borrow, obtain credit from or otherwise engage in “covered transactions” with their insured depository institution subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act amended the definition of affiliate to include an investment fund for which the depository institution or one of its affiliates is an investment adviser. An insured depository institution (and its subsidiaries) may not lend money to, or engage in covered transactions with, its non-depository institution affiliates if the aggregate amount of covered transactions outstanding involving the bank, plus the proposed transaction, exceeds the following limits: (i) in the case of any one such affiliate, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 10% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution; and (ii) in the case of all affiliates, the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the insured depository institution and its subsidiaries cannot exceed 20% of the capital stock and surplus of the insured depository institution. For this purpose, “covered transactions” are defined by statute to include a loan or extension of credit to an affiliate; a purchase of or investment in securities issued by an affiliate; a purchase of assets from an affiliate unless, exempted by the FRB; the acceptance of securities issued by an affiliate as collateral for a loan or extension of credit to any person or company; the issuance of a guarantee, acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate; securities borrowing or lending transactions with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate; or a derivatives transaction with an affiliate that creates a credit exposure to such affiliate. Covered transactions are also subject to certain collateral security requirements. Covered transactions as well as other types of transactions between a bank and a bank holding company must be on market terms and not otherwise unduly favorable to the holding company or an affiliate of the holding company. Moreover, the Bank Holding Company Act Amendments of 1970 provide that, to further competition, a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from engaging in certain tying arrangements in connection with any extension of credit, lease or sale of property of any kind, or furnishing of any service.     Consumer Protection Regulation
     We are subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect consumers and prohibit unfair or deceptive business practices, including the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, Home Ownership Protection Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, as amended by the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the “FACT Act”), the GLBA, the Truth in Lending Act, the CRA, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, the National Flood Insurance Act and various state law counterparts. These laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must interact with customers when taking 

 
  11

 
deposits, making loans, collecting loans and providing other services. Further, the Dodd-Frank Act established the CFPB, which has the responsibility for making rules and regulations under the federal consumer protection laws relating to financial products and services. The CFPB also has a broad mandate to prohibit unfair, deceptive or abusive acts and practices and is specifically empowered to require certain disclosures to consumers and draft model disclosure forms. Failure to comply with consumer protection laws and regulations can subject financial institutions to enforcement actions, fines and other penalties. The FDIC examines Merchants Bank for compliance with CFPB rules and enforces CFPB rules with respect to Merchants Bank.
     Mortgage Reform. The Dodd-Frank Act prescribes certain standards that mortgage lenders must consider before making a residential mortgage loan, including verifying a borrower’s ability to repay such mortgage loan, and allows borrowers to assert violations of certain provisions of the Truth in Lending Act as a defense to foreclosure proceedings.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, prepayment penalties are prohibited for certain mortgage transactions and creditors are prohibited from financing insurance policies in connection with a residential mortgage loan or home equity line of credit.  In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act prohibits mortgage originators from receiving compensation based on the terms of residential mortgage loans and generally limits the ability of a mortgage originator to be compensated by others if compensation is received from a consumer.  The Dodd-Frank Act requires mortgage lenders to make additional disclosures prior to the extension of credit, in each billing statement and for negative amortization loans and hybrid adjustable rate mortgages.
     Privacy and Customer Information Security. The GLBA requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties. In general, we must provide our customers with an initial and annual disclosure that explains our policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and, except as otherwise required or permitted by law, we are prohibited from disclosing such information except as provided in such policies and procedures. However, an annual disclosure is not required to be provided by a financial institution if the financial institution only discloses information under exceptions from GLBA that do not require an opt out to be provided and if there has been no change in its privacy policies and practices since its most recent disclosure provided to consumers. The GLBA also requires that we develop, implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information (as defined under the GLBA), to protect against anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information; and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer. We are also required to send a notice to customers whose sensitive information has been compromised if unauthorized use of this information is reasonably possible. Most of the states, including the states where we operate, have enacted legislation concerning breaches of data security and our duties in response to a data breach. Congress continues to consider federal legislation that would require consumer notice of data security breaches. Pursuant to the FACT Act, we must develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or certain existing accounts. Additionally, the FACT Act amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act to generally prohibit a person from using information received from an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer, unless the consumer is given notice and a reasonable opportunity and a reasonable and simple method to opt out of the making of such solicitations.
     Anti-Money Laundering
     The Bank Secrecy Act. Under the Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) a financial institution is required to have systems in place to detect certain transactions, based on the size and nature of the transaction. Financial institutions are generally required to report to the United States Treasury any cash transactions involving more than $10,000. In addition, financial institutions are required to file suspicious activity reports for any transaction or series of transactions that involve more than $5,000 and which the financial institution knows, suspects or has reason to suspect involves illegal funds, is designed to evade the requirements of the BSA or has no lawful purpose. The Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “USA PATRIOT Act”), which amended the BSA, together with the implementing regulations of various federal regulatory agencies, has caused financial institutions, such as Merchants Bank, to adopt and implement additional policies or amend existing policies and procedures with respect to, among other things, anti-money laundering compliance, suspicious activity, currency transaction reporting, customer identity verification and customer risk analysis. In evaluating an application under Section 3 of the BHCA to acquire a bank or an application under the Bank Merger Act to merge banks or affect a purchase of assets and assumption of deposits

and other liabilities, the applicable federal banking regulator must consider the anti-money laundering compliance record of both the applicant and the target. 
     OFAC. The U.S. has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries, nationals and others. These sanctions, which are administered by the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), take many different forms. Generally, however, they contain one or more of the following elements: (i) restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country, including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on “U.S. persons” engaging in financial or other transactions relating to a sanctioned country or with certain designated persons and entities; (ii) a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest, by prohibiting transfers of property subject to U.S. jurisdiction (including property in the possession or control of U.S. persons); and (iii) restrictions on transactions with or involving certain persons or entities. Blocked assets (for example, property and bank deposits) cannot be paid out, withdrawn, set off or transferred in any manner without a license from OFAC. Failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the Company.
     Volcker Rule Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Sponsorship of Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds
     The Dodd-Frank Act bars banking organizations, such as the Company, from engaging in proprietary trading and from sponsoring and investing in hedge funds and private equity funds, except as permitted under certain circumstances, in a provision commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule.” Under the Dodd-Frank Act, proprietary trading generally means trading by a banking entity or its affiliate for its trading account. Hedge funds and private equity funds are described by the Dodd-Frank Act as funds that would be registered under the Investment Company Act but for certain enumerated exemptions. The Volcker Rule restrictions apply to the Company, Merchants Bank and all of their subsidiaries and affiliates.     Federal Home Loan Bank System 
     Merchants Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank (the “FHLB”) of Boston, which is one of the regional Federal Home Loan Banks comprising the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Each Federal Home Loan Bank provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions. A member institution is required to acquire and hold shares of capital stock in the FHLB in an amount at least equal to the sum of 0.35% of the aggregate principal amount of its unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year and 4.5% of its advances (borrowings) from the FHLB. We were in compliance with this requirement at December 31, 2016 with an investment in FHLB stock as of December 31, 2016 of $4.98 million. We receive dividends on our FHLB stock. As of December 31, 2016, the year to date dividend rate was 3.57%. Dividend income on FHLB stock of $212 thousand was recorded during 2016.
     Any advances from the FHLB must be secured by specified types of collateral, and long-term advances may be used for the purpose of providing funds for residential housing finance, commercial lending and to purchase investments. Long term advances may also be used to help alleviate interest rate risk for asset and liability management purposes. As of December 31, 2016, we had $40.00 million in FHLB advances.
