ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Corporate Information
 
We were incorporated on May 10, 2010 in the State of Nevada. We have one wholly-owned subsidiary, Premier Biomedical Pain Relief Meds, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company, organized on September 14, 2017.
 
Our corporate headquarters are located in Jackson Center, PA. Our mailing address is P.O. Box 25, Jackson Center, PA 16133, and our telephone number is (724) 633-7033. We have offices virtually in the homes of our management team who reside in Pennsylvania, Michigan and various other states. Our websites are www.premierbiomedical.com and www.painreliefmeds.com. Information contained on our website is not incorporated into, and does not constitute any part of, this Annual Report. 
 
Overview
 
We are a research-based company that primarily intends to discover and develop medical products. Our current focus is on the development and distribution of our pain products. We also conduct research and development of proprietary drugs and techniques to target cancer, multiple sclerosis and other diseases. 
 
In the first quarter of 2017, initial sales of our pain management products were made through a joint venture. In the third quarter of 2017, the joint venture was terminated and we began sales of our pain management products directly from the Company.

Pain Management
 
In the first quarter of 2017, we entered the pain management industry with one product: a 96-hour pain relief patch with 48 mg of hemp oil extract. We have now expanded our product offerings to four products: 

1. | 96-hour pain relief patch with 50 mg of hemp oil extract, the highest level of pain relief ingredient available in the industry;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | 120 mg/ 10 ml water-based roll-on applicator; 
3. | 150 mg/ 10 ml oil-based roll-on applicator; and 
4. | 150 mg/ 30 ml oil-based pump spray applicator. 

 
We have also designed and developed a fifth new product, a 2-ounce hemp oil cream that will debut into the market in the near future. We believe that this five-product array positions us with the majority of the hemp oil extract customers in the marketplace.
 
Our pain relief patch is a CBD, or Cannabidiol, topical patch. The patent-pending reservoir patch design from our manufacturer features a unique barrier between the foam adhesive and the pain relieving ingredients to ensure that the adhesive is not transmitted and absorbed through the skin, as with many competitive patches. The formulations for the products contain no psychoactive components and, therefore, are not expected to affect drug test results. The other products consist of the same primary ingredients as contained in our reservoir patch, but offer other convenient methods of application. 
 
We are also continuing to develop additional pain relief products, including creams, sprays, gel pens and capsules. These products are designed to provide natural relief from: 
 
 
· | Knee pain, 
--+--------------------------------
· | Shoulder pain, 
· | Joint pain, 
· | Arthritis pain, 
· | Muscle soreness and tenderness,
· | Headaches, and 
· | Migraines. 


Sales of our pain management products began on February 1, 2017 through our former joint venture. Upon termination of the joint venture, we began selling our products via our website at www.painreliefmeds.com and through various distributors. To date, three pharmacies and three chiropractic clinics have approved our products for sale and are distributing our products. We anticipate that our products will eventually be placed in several large pharmacy chains and sold in several states. 
 
Research and Development
 
We intend to continue to discover and develop medical treatments for humans, specifically targeting the pain management industry and the treatment of: 
 

- Cancer | - Fibromyalgia 
-------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------
- Multiple Sclerosis (MS) | - Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) 
- Neuropathic Pain | - Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) 
- Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS/Lou Gehrig’s Disease) | - Blood Sepsis and Viremia

To target cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, blood sepsis, leukemia, and other life-threatening cancers, we intend to develop our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique. The methodology involved in this technique is largely unexplored and has been described by scientists as the “wild west” of modern medicine. Consequently, our first entry into the therapeutics market for medications that work against cancer, multiple sclerosis, infectious diseases, Alzheimer’s disease, strokes and traumatic brain injury carries significant obstacles before reaching the opportunities of a $700 billion industry.
 
Feldetrex®
 
We also are in the process of developing our proprietary drug candidate Feldetrex™, a potential treatment for multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain and traumatic brain injury. The formulation used in the current Feldetrex® will be individually tailored to the various illnesses we intend to target, with each formulation being given a unique proprietary brand name. The annual market size of multiple sclerosis treatment is $500 million and the annual market size for all proposed Feldetrex® market segments is $16 billion.
 
To overcome the significant obstacles inherent to the development of our Sequential-Dialysis Technique and Feldetrex® candidate drug, we are seeking to partner with prestigious institutions and pharmaceutical companies with the substantial infrastructure and resource capacity to perform experimentation and to engage in product development in an inexpensive and efficient manner.
 
Innovation by our research and development operations is very important to our success. Our goal is to discover, develop and bring to market innovative products and treatments that address major unmet medical needs, including initially, multiple sclerosis, septicemia, and cancer. We expect this goal to be supported by substantial research and development investments. 
 
We plan on conducting research internally and may also research through contracts with third parties, through collaborations with universities and biotechnology companies, and in cooperation with pharmaceutical firms. We may also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery or development methods and procedures or projects, as well as our future product lines, through acquisition, licensing or other arrangements.
 
In addition to discovering and developing new products, methods and procedures of treatment and treatments, we expect our research operations to add value to our existing products and methods and procedures of treatment in development by improving their effectiveness and by discovering new uses for them. 
 
Sequential-Dialysis Technique
 
Our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique is a methodology for the removal of those molecules which are harmful and responsible for causing diseases. A significant disappointment in the practice of modern medicine is that the capabilities do exist to eliminate the presence of most illnesses, including life-threatening diseases such as AIDS and cancer, but with a caveat that the process of treatment comes with catastrophic side effects that can and often do kill the patient.
 

5

 
Our development is that the innovative Sequential-Dialysis Methodology is done extracorporeally (outside the body). This is a truly unique and innovative method for alleviating disease.
 
We believe that this methodology can be used for the prevention of cancer metastasis, for directly attacking the causation of intractable seizures, for preventing the death of anterior motor neurons in ALS, for preventing the cause of the neuropathological changes in Alzheimer’s disease and traumatic brain injury and for eradicating the causations of infectious diseases, and our intention is that the effectiveness of this technique will be demonstrated and supported in future clinical studies.
 
Through our Sequential-Dialysis Technique, we ultimately hope to provide a cure for cancer if not only to dramatically extend the lives of suffering patients. Our initial focus is on lab and animal tests. Clinical trials, as required, will be undertaken subsequently.
 
Feldetrex™
 
Although a combination of generic medications, we have a U.S. Patent (No. 8,865,733) on our Feldetrex® candidate drug. In this way, Feldetrex® is similar to Viagra®, which was a proprietary cardiac drug prior to its current use and ownership by Pfizer. Consequently, we have one pending patent application for our Feldetrex® candidate drug—intending to increase our Feldetrex® related patent applications to three in the near future.
 
Feldetrex® may serve as an additional medication utilized by physicians for the treatment of multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, or traumatic brain injury, and is designed to decrease symptomatology in those conditions. Feldetrex® will not compete against our proprietary Sequential-Dialysis Technique in the market to treat traumatic brain injury, but rather the two will work conjunctively.
 
Feldetrex® utilizes a low dosage of Naltrexone which has been shown in multiple medical articles in the medical literature to increase endogenous enkephalins1 (endogenous enkephalins are pain-relieving pentapeptides produced in the body, located in the pituitary gland, brain, and GI tract. Axon terminals that release enkephalins are concentrated in the posterior horn of the gray matter of the spinal cord, in the central part of the thalamus, and in the amygdala of the limbic system of the cerebrum. Endogenous Enkephalins function as neurotransmitters that inhibit neurotransmitters in the pathway for pain perception, thereby reducing the emotional as well as the physical impact of pain). We have not independently conducted medical or laboratory tests to show the mechanism of action of this medication. While Naltrexone in high dosages acts as an opioid antagonist, it inhibits opiate receptors. Naltrexone in low dosages causes a compensatory upregulation (increase in the number of receptors) of native endorphins and enkephalins, which last beyond the effects of the Naltrexone itself. We believe that this means, paradoxically, that a daily dose of low dose Naltrexone can be used to chronically increase endorphin and enkephalin levels. We believe that by utilizing a low dosage, Naltrexone has a unique ability to increase enkephalins and other neurotransmitters in the brainstem of patients.

Marketing 
 
Currently, we manage our marketing responsibilities internally. Sales of our pain management products are made primarily online through our website: www.painreliefmeds.com. We intend to seek a partnership with and/or sale of our product candidates/technologies to large pharmaceutical and/or medical devices firms. These firms have the ability to effectively promote our product candidates to healthcare providers and patients. Through their marketing organizations, they can explain the approved uses, benefits and risks of our product candidates to healthcare providers such as doctors, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, pharmacists, hospitals, Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs), Managed Care Organizations (MCOs), employers and government agencies. They also market directly to consumers in the U.S. through direct-to-consumer advertising that communicates the approved uses, benefits, and risks of our product candidates while continuing to motivate people to have meaningful conversations with their doctors. In addition, they sponsor general advertising to educate the public on disease awareness, important public health issues, and patient assistance programs.
 
The large pharmaceutical/medical devices firms principally sell their products to wholesalers, but they also sell directly to retailers, hospitals, clinics, government agencies and pharmacies and also work with MCOs, PBMs, employers and other appropriate healthcare providers to assist them with disease management, patient education and other tools that help their medical treatment routines.
 
Patents and Intellectual Property Rights 
 
We have licensed three U.S. patents: Sequential Extracorporeal Treatment of Bodily Fluids, U.S. Patent No. 9,216,386 and Utilization of Stents for the Treatment of Blood Borne Carcinomas, U.S. Patent No. 8,758,287 (both from Marv Enterprises, LLC), and Medication and Treatment for Disease, U.S. Patent No. 8,865,733 (from Altman Enterprises, LLC), in the areas of cancer, sepsis, and multiple sclerosis. We expect these patents to cover the medical treatments discussed above for multiple sclerosis, blood sepsis, and cancer and be effective until 2029. Marv and Altman have licensed these technologies to us pursuant to the terms of license agreements. Because our license agreements cover the patents and “all applications of the United States and foreign countries that claim priority to the above PCT applications, including any non-provisionals, continuations, continuations-in-part, divisions, reissues, re-examinations or extensions thereof,” we anticipate that other technologies that derive from these patents will also belong to us and are covered by the license agreements.
 
Patents extend for twenty years from the date of patent filing. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. 
 
Dr. Felder is the owner of the Feldetrex mark, and has also licensed this to us pursuant to the terms of a license agreement.
 
We expect our patent and related rights to be of material importance to our business.

Competition
 
Our business is conducted in an intensely competitive and often highly regulated market. Our treatments face competition in the form of branded drugs, generic drugs and the currently practiced treatments for multiple sclerosis, blood sepsis, and cancer. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. Where possible, companies compete on the basis of the unique features of their products, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use or fewer side effects. A lower overall cost of therapy is also an important factor. Products that demonstrate fewer therapeutic advantages must compete for inclusion based primarily on price. Though the means of competition vary among product categories, demonstrating the value of our medications and procedures will be a critical factor for our success.
 
Our competitors include large worldwide research-based drug companies, smaller research companies with more limited therapeutic focus, and generic drug manufacturers. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat similar diseases as our major medications and procedures.
 
Environment

Our business may be subject to a variety of federal, state and local environmental protection measures. We intend to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws and regulations.
Regulation

Pain Management Products
 
A major obstacle to our growth is the public perception that hemp and marijuana are the same thing. This perception drives much of the regulation of hemp products. Although hemp and marijuana are both part of the cannabis family, they differ in cultivation, function, and application. Despite the use of marijuana becoming more widely legalized, it is viewed by many regulators and many others as an illegal product. Hemp, on the other hand, is used in a variety of other ways that include clothing, skin products, pet products, dietary supplements (the use of CBD oil), and thousands of other applications. Hemp may be legally sold, however the inability of many to understand the difference between hemp and marijuana often causes burdensome regulation and confusion among potential customers. Therefore, we are affected by laws related to cannabis and marijuana, even though our products are not the direct targets of these laws. 

8

 
Cannabis is currently a Schedule I controlled substance under the Controlled Substance Act (“CSA”) and is, therefore, illegal under federal law. Even in those states in which the use of cannabis has been legalized pursuant to state law, its use, possession and/or cultivation remains a violation of federal law. A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as one that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety for use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. The U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) describes Schedule I controlled substances as “the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological or physical dependence.” If the federal government decides to enforce the CSA in the states, persons that are charged with distributing, possessing with intent to distribute or growing cannabis could be subject to fines and/or terms of imprisonment, the maximum being life imprisonment and a $50 million fine.
 
Notwithstanding the CSA, 29 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and the U.S. territories of Guam and Puerto Rico allow their residents to use medical cannabis. The states of Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont (effective July 1, 2018) and Washington, and the District of Columbia, allow cannabis for adult recreational use. Such state and territorial laws are in conflict with the federal CSA, which makes cannabis use and possession illegal at the federal level.
 
In light of such conflict between federal laws and state laws regarding cannabis, the previous administration under President Obama had effectively stated that it was not an efficient use of resources to direct federal law enforcement agencies to prosecute those lawfully abiding by state-designated laws allowing the use and distribution of medical cannabis. For example, the prior DOJ Deputy Attorney General of the Obama administration, James M. Cole, issued a memorandum (the “Cole Memo”) to all United States Attorneys providing updated guidance to federal prosecutors concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. In addition, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”) provided guidelines (the “FinCEN Guidelines”) on February 14, 2014, regarding how financial institutions can provide services to cannabis-related businesses consistent with their Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) obligations.
 
Additional existing and pending legislation provides, or seeks to provide, protection to persons acting in violation of federal law but in compliance with state laws regarding cannabis. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment (formerly known as the Rohrbacher-Farr Amendment) to the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which funds the DOJ, since 2014 has prohibited the DOJ from using funds to prevent states with laws authorizing the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis from implementing such laws. On August 2016, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in United States v. McIntosh that the Amendment bars the DOJ from spending funds on the prosecution of conduct that is allowed by state medical cannabis laws, provided that such conduct is in strict compliance with applicable state law. The Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment is currently effective through September 30, 2018, but as an amendment to an appropriations bill, it must be renewed annually.
 
These developments previously were met with a certain amount of optimism in the cannabis industry, but (i) neither the CARERS Act nor the Respect State Marijuana Laws Act of 2017 have yet been adopted, (ii) the Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment, being an amendment to an appropriations bill that must be renewed annually, has not currently been renewed beyond September 30, 2018, and (iii) the ruling in United States v. McIntosh is only applicable precedent in the Ninth Circuit.

Because of the discrepancy between the laws in some states, which permit the distribution and sale of medical and recreational cannabis, from federal law that prohibits any such activities, DOJ Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole issued the Cole Memo concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA.
 
At the time of its issuance, the Cole Memo reiterated Congress’s determination that cannabis is a dangerous drug and that the illegal distribution and sale of cannabis is a serious crime that provides a significant source of revenue to large-scale criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels. The Cole Memo noted that the DOJ was committed to enforcement of the CSA consistent with those determinations. It also noted that the DOJ was committed to using its investigative and prosecutorial resources to address the most significant threats in the most effective, consistent, and rational way. In furtherance of those objectives, the Cole Memo provided guidance to DOJ attorneys and law enforcement to focus their enforcement resources on persons or organizations whose conduct interferes with any one or more of the following important priorities (the “Enforcement Priorities”) in preventing:
 
 
· | the distribution of cannabis to minors; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | revenue from the sale of cannabis from going to criminal enterprises, gangs, and cartels; 
· | the diversion of cannabis from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states; 
· | state-authorized cannabis activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity; 
· | violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of cannabis; 
· | drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with cannabis use; 
· | the growing of cannabis on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by cannabis production on public lands; and
· | cannabis possession or use on federal property. 


However, on January 4, 2018, the U.S. Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, issued a memorandum for all U.S. Attorneys (the “Sessions Memo”) stating that the Cole Memo was rescinded effective immediately. In particular, Mr. Sessions stated that “prosecutors should follow the well-established principles that govern all federal prosecutions,” which require “federal prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute to weigh all relevant considerations, including federal law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.” The Sessions Memo went on to state that given the DOJ’s well-established general principles, “previous nationwide guidance specific to marijuana is unnecessary and is rescinded, effective immediately.”
 
It is unclear at this time whether the Sessions Memo indicates that the Trump administration will strongly enforce the federal laws applicable to cannabis or what types of activities will be targeted for enforcement. However, a significant change in the federal government’s enforcement policy with respect to current federal laws applicable to cannabis could cause significant financial damage to us. We do not currently cultivate, distribute or sell cannabis, but our hemp oil products are closely tied to the cannabis industry.

Although the Sessions Memo has rescinded the Cole Memo and it is unclear at this time what the ultimate impact of that rescission will have on our business, if any, we intend to continue to conduct rigorous due diligence to verify the legality of all activities that we engage in and ensure that our activities do not interfere with any of the Enforcement Priorities set forth in the Cole Memo.
 
On March 26, 2018, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, announced plans to introduce The Hemp Farming Act of 2018 to exclude hemp from the CSA. The proposed bill would legalize hemp as an agricultural commodity and remove it from the list of controlled substances. This would greatly reduce the uncertainty we face with respect to regulation of hemp products. However, Congress has not yet taken formal action to pass the bill. 
 
Other Medical Products
 
The development of proprietary drugs and medications is subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the United States and any other countries in which our operations are conducted. In the United States, regulation by various federal and state agencies has long been focused primarily on product safety, efficacy, manufacturing, advertising, labeling and safety reporting. The exercise of broad regulatory powers by the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (“FDA”) continues to result in increases in the amounts of testing and documentation required for FDA clearance of new drugs and devices and a corresponding increase in the expense of product introduction. Likewise, the approval process with the FDA is estimated to take approximately seven (7) years from the time it is started. Similar trends are also evident in major markets outside of the United States. 
 
Clinical trials are a set of procedures in medical research conducted to allow safety (or more specifically, information about adverse drug reactions and adverse effects of other treatments) and efficacy data to be collected for health interventions (e.g., drugs, diagnostics, devices, therapy protocols). These trials can take place only after satisfactory information has been gathered on the quality of the non-clinical safety, and Health Authority/Ethics Committee approval is granted in the country where the trial is taking place.
 
Depending on the type of product and the stage of its development, investigators enroll healthy volunteers and/or patients into small pilot studies initially, followed by larger scale studies in patients that often compare the new product with the currently prescribed treatment. As positive safety and efficacy data are gathered, the number of patients is typically increased. Clinical trials can vary in size from a single center in one country to multicenter trials in multiple countries.
 
Due to the sizable cost a full series of clinical trials may incur, the burden of paying for all the necessary people and services is usually borne by the sponsor who may be a governmental organization, a pharmaceutical, or biotechnology company. Since the diversity of roles may exceed resources of the sponsor, often a clinical trial is managed by an outsourced partner such as a contract research organization or a clinical trials unit in the academic sector.
 
The regulatory agencies under whose purview we intend to operate have administrative powers that may subject us to such actions as product withdrawals, recalls, seizure of products and other civil and criminal sanctions.
 
Because we intend to seek a partnership with and/or sale of our product candidates/technologies to large pharmaceutical and/or medical devices firms, we anticipate that a larger pharmaceutical company will undertake to navigate the regulatory pathway, including conducting clinical trials, for a product such as Feldetrex™.
 
Employees
 
As of the date hereof, we do not have any employees other than our officers and directors. Our officers and directors will continue to work for us for the foreseeable future. We anticipate hiring appropriate personnel on an as-needed basis, and utilizing the services of independent contractors as needed.
