General
Based on the number of clubs, we are one of the leading owners and operators of fitness clubs in the Northeast region of the United States. As of December 31, 2017, the Company, through its subsidiaries, owned and operated 165 fitness clubs (“clubs”). Our clubs collectively served approximately 587,000 members as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we owned and operated a total of 119 clubs in the New York metropolitan region (102 of which were under the “New York Sports Clubs” brand name, 16 of which were under the “Lucille Roberts” brand name and one of which was under the “TMPL” brand name), including 39 locations in Manhattan where we are one of the largest fitness club owners and operators. Additionally, we owned and operated 28 clubs in the Boston metropolitan region under our “Boston Sports Clubs” brand name, 10 clubs (one of which is partly-owned) in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region under our “Washington Sports Clubs” brand name and five clubs in the Philadelphia metropolitan region under our “Philadelphia Sports Clubs” brand name, and three clubs in Switzerland. In addition, as of December 31, 2017, we have one partly-owned club that operates under a different brand name in Washington, D.C. We employ localized brand names for our clubs to create an image and atmosphere consistent with the local community and to foster recognition as a local network of quality fitness clubs rather than a national chain.

In 2017, we acquired a total of 18 clubs. We acquired the Lucille Roberts Health Club business (“Lucille Roberts”), which added 16 clubs to our portfolio. These 16 clubs continue to operate as women only clubs under the Lucille Roberts trade name. We also acquired one existing club in Massapequa, NY, currently operating under the New York Sports Clubs brand name, including the land and the building such club occupies, as well as TMPL Gym (“TMPL”), an existing club in Manhattan, which continues to operate under the TMPL brand name. TMPL is the Company’s luxury brand that the Company plans to expand. All 18 acquisitions were additions to our portfolio in the New York metropolitan region. The results of operations of the clubs acquired have been included in our consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of such acquisitions.
We develop clusters of clubs to serve densely populated major metropolitan regions and we service such populations by clustering clubs near the highest concentrations of our target customers’ areas of both employment and residence. Our clubs are located for maximum convenience to our members in urban or suburban areas, close to transportation hubs or office or retail centers. Our members include a wide age demographic covering the student market to the active mature market. In each of our regions, we have developed clusters by initially opening or acquiring clubs located in the more central urban markets of the region and then branching out from these urban centers to suburbs and neighboring communities.
Over our 44-year history, since incorporating in 1973, we have developed and refined our club formats, which allows us to cost-effectively construct and efficiently operate our fitness clubs in the different real estate environments in which we operate. Our fitness-only clubs average approximately 19,000 square feet, while our multi-recreational clubs average approximately 38,000 square feet. The aggregate average size of our clubs is approximately 25,000 square feet. Our clubs typically have an open fitness area to accommodate cardiovascular and strength-training equipment, as well as special purpose rooms for group fitness classes and other exercise programs. We seek to provide a broad array of high-quality exercise programs and equipment that are popular and effective, promoting a quality exercise experience for our members. When developing clubs, we carefully examine the potential membership base and the likely demand for supplemental offerings such as swimming, basketball, children’s programs, tennis or squash and, provided suitable real estate is available, we will add one or more of these offerings to our fitness-only format. For example, a multi-recreational club in a family market may include Sports Clubs for Kids programs, which can include swim lessons and sports camps for children.
Industry Overview
According to the most recent information released by the International Health, Racquet and Sports Club Association (“IHRSA”), the U.S. health club industry posted growth in revenue, memberships, and number of club locations. Revenue grew from 6.9% to $27.6 billion in 2016 from $25.8 billion in 2015, while club count increased 1.1% to 36,540 sites in 2016 from 36,160 in 2015. Roughly 57.3 million Americans belonged to a health club in 2016, up from 55.3 million in 2015. According to the IHRSA, the health club landscape extends beyond traditional, full-service fitness centers that serve local communities and all age groups as well as affordable fitness centers with basic amenities. Studio concepts, including boxing, yoga, Pilates, group cycling, barre, boot camps, and sports-specific training, also shape the club market.
According to the IHRSA, the average age of a health club member in 2016 was 39 years old. One-third of health club members, which is the most represented age group, were between the ages of 35-54 years old. The second most represented age group was 18-34 years old, which represented 28% of health club members. The oldest, the over-55 age group, represented 24% of all health club members, while those under age 18 represented 15% of all health club members. The number of health club members under age 18 has grown from 5.3 million in 2012 to 8.7 million in 2016.
As the numbers showed in 2016, the health club industry reported growth in all three key indicators: revenue, membership, and club count. Still, more than 27% of Americans remain inactive, as reported by the Physical Activity Council. More than two out of five Americans do not participate in any of the 120 activities measured by the Physical Activity Council. We are in a unique position to address physical inactivity as the health club serves as a hub for health, wellness and exercise. As the focus on exercise and overall healthy lifestyles continue to impact the health club industry, we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from these dynamics as a large operator with recognized brand names, leading regional market shares and an established operating history.
Competitive Strengths
We believe the following competitive strengths are instrumental to our success:
Strong market position with leading brands. Based on number of clubs, we are one of the largest owners and operators of fitness clubs in the Northeast region of the U.S. In 2017, we acquired 18 clubs in the New York metropolitan region. Our strong real estate presence in the New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., and Philadelphia metropolitan regions enhances convenience to our members. We attribute our positions in these markets in part to the strength of our localized owner and operator brand names, which foster recognition as a local network of quality fitness clubs.

Regional clustering strategy provides significant benefits to members and corporations. By operating a network of clubs in a concentrated geographic area, the value of our memberships is enhanced by our ability to offer members access to any of our clubs, which provides the convenience of having fitness clubs near a member’s workplace and home. This is also a benefit to our corporate members, as many corporations have employees that will take advantage of multiple gym locations. Approximately 226,000, or 39%, of our members currently have a passport, elite or flagship membership, and because these memberships offer enhanced privileges and greater convenience, they typically generate higher monthly dues than our single club memberships in each respective region. Regional clustering also allows us to provide special facilities to all of our members within a local area, such as swimming pools and squash, tennis and basketball courts, without offering them at every location. In the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 28% of all club usage was by members visiting clubs other than their home clubs.
Regional clustering strategy designed to enhance revenues and achieve economies of scale. We believe our regional clustering strategy allows us to enhance revenue and earnings growth by providing high-quality, conveniently located fitness facilities on a cost-effective basis. We believe that potential new entrants would need to establish or acquire a large number of clubs in a market to compete effectively with us. Our clustering strategy also enables us to achieve economies of scale with regard to sales, marketing, purchasing, general operations and corporate administrative expenses and reduces our capital spending needs. Regional clustering also provides the opportunity for members who relocate within a region to remain members of our clubs, thus aiding in member retention.
Business Strategy
In the long-term, we seek to maximize our net member growth, revenues, earnings and cash flows using the following strategies:
Growth through acquisitions. We plan to expand our club base through selective acquisitions. We believe this is an important element of our corporate strategy as it strengthens our competitive position and expands and enhances the services that we can offer to members. In 2017, we acquired 18 clubs in the New York metropolitan region and constructed and opened two clubs. In January 2018, we acquired two additional clubs. We expect to continue to acquire selective clubs to continue our expansion of club offerings, including clubs outside of our current regions. In the event we build and acquire additional new clubs, the club expansion is expected to be funded with cash on hand or through internally generated cash flows. We may also consider certain acquisitions other than health clubs to diversify the business while enhancing shareholder value.
Grow membership revenues. We seek to grow our membership revenues in existing clubs through driving membership growth and optimizing dues and member retention. We believe our offerings are compelling because we include group exercise classes, top of the line equipment, pools and courts in the price of certain memberships, when available. Our member count increased by 43,000 members for a total member count of 587,000 in 2017 and we will continue to consider and make pricing adjustments in order to increase revenue while also driving membership growth.
 Grow ancillary and other non-membership revenues. We intend to grow our ancillary and other non-membership revenues through a continued focus on increasing the additional value-added services that we provide to our members. We offer a multi-session personal training membership product and fee-based Small Group Training classes to generate additional revenue. In addition, we offer Sports Clubs for Kids programs at select clubs. 
Optimization of our clubs. We remain committed to optimizing our existing club base, including club closures when appropriate. We closed five clubs in 2017. We expect these profit margin initiatives will enable us to improve in club level economics across our portfolio, and to offset the competitive pressure in the geographic regions in which we compete.
Retain members by focusing on the member experience. Our Company’s mission is “Bring the best out of every body.” By building and nurturing a strong consumer centric culture, we are able to provide a clear road map for how we serve our members and deliver a superior experience. We tailor the hours of each club to the needs of the specific member demographic utilizing each club and offer a variety of ancillary services, including personal training, group classes, Small Group Training and Sports Clubs for Kids programs. We offer a variety of different sports facilities in each regional cluster of clubs; modern, varied and well-maintained exercise and fitness equipment; and an assortment of additional amenities including access to babysitting. Through hiring, developing and training a qualified and diverse team that is passionate about fitness and health; maintaining and enhancing our programs and services; continually increasing our attention to individual member needs; and investing in our digital ecosystem, we expect to demonstrate our commitment to increase the quality of the member experience, and thereby increase net membership. To better measure the member experience, we utilize social media to help analyze the areas we can improve upon as well as the areas in which the members are satisfied overall.

Provide fitness experiences and services. We help educate our members to best practices in their pursuit of fitness, wellness and healthy lifestyles and each of our clubs has an array of cardiovascular machines, resistance training equipment, free weights and functional training zones. We have technicians who service and maintain our equipment on a timely basis. In addition, we have personal viewing television screens on most pieces of cardiovascular equipment which accommodate individual preferences and viewing, and many cardio machines now include embedded technology that offers both entertainment and tracking features that record workout results and communicate with many mobile technologies. Most clubs have between one and three studios used for exercise classes, including at least one large studio used for most group exercise classes, a cycling studio and a mind and body studio used for yoga and Pilates classes. We further offer a large variety of group fitness classes at each club and these classes are accessible to all members. The volume and variety of activities at each club allow each member to enjoy the club, whether customizing their own workout or participating in group activities and classes. In addition, we have a functional training zone within our clubs that features an array of innovative equipment designed to maximize the member’s workout. The functional training zones include a variety of functional training equipment, such as Total Body Resistance Exercise (“TRX” brand) suspension training frame, Kettle Bells, Battle Ropes and Power Sleds. Our functional training zones are open to members for free self-guided workouts, personal training sessions and fee-based programs.
Marketing
Our in-house marketing team is responsible for brand positioning, brand strategy, and product innovation for the Company and all of its subsidiaries. The primary objective is to ensure that our brands seize market share and opportunities through well-defined and coordinated go-to-market strategies. We are organized to enable close collaboration between our marketing, sales and operations staff, which helps to align efforts around operational objectives and new product development. We seek to inspire brand experiences and in doing so, drive sustainable and quality growth, while building a strong reputation and loyalty with both existing members and future members. In order to have credible and authentic connections to create such desirability with our audience, we utilize a market segmentation strategy. A marketing segmentation strategy divides our target market into subgroups, whereby consumers in each of these subgroups share one or more characteristics. Using this knowledge, we develop specific plans, including personalized and mass marketing, to reach these targeted customers effectively. We seek to identify and understand consumers’ individual motivations and goals in an effort to create meaningful products, services and experiences that build a lasting impression and brand loyalty. 
Sales 
We sell our memberships primarily through three channels: direct sales at the club level; through corporate and group sales; and through our online website. Through our corporate and group sales approach we concentrate on building long-term relationships with local and regional companies, organizations and other large groups. 
We also sell individual memberships online for our standard membership types and the websites enable us to sell memberships for pre-established corporate and group programs. The websites also allow our members to give us direct feedback about our service levels and enables prospective members to sign up for a free one-day pass or purchase a 30 day guest pass. The online sales channel offers a high degree of convenience for customers who know and trust our brand and do not require up-front interaction with a membership sales consultant to make their decision. In addition, selling online significantly reduces our cost of sale. The websites also provide information about the respective club locations, program offerings, exercise class schedules and sales promotions. Job seekers can also begin the employment application process through the respective websites and investors can access financial information and resources.
Memberships
We believe that clustering clubs allows us to sell memberships based upon the opportunity for members to utilize multiple club locations near their workplace and their home. We offer various types of memberships at our clubs that include either single club or multiple club access and either month-to-month or one-year commitment options. 
Our single club memberships are sold in the range of $19.99 and $64.99 per month. 
We also offer various multiple-club memberships that include access to certain clusters of clubs, including our Passport Membership which provides access to all of the clubs in our four regions with the exception of certain “Elite” clubs and one “flagship” club. The Passport Membership is currently priced at $89.99 for the month-to-month option and $79.99 for the one-year commitment option. Additionally, the Company offers both Elite and Flagship Memberships. The Flagship Membership provides access to all of our clubs, including our Flagship club and all Elite clubs. The Elite Membership includes access to all clubs, including our Elite clubs, with the exception of our Flagship club. Elite and Flagship memberships range in price generally from $89.99 to $120.00 per month.

The membership prices above are dependent on club location and whether the member joins under a “month-to-month” or a “commit” contract. Under the commit contract, new members commit to a one year membership, generally at a lower monthly rate than a month-to-month membership. A member may cancel a commit membership at any time for a fee. When the members’ commit period is over, they retain membership as a month-to-month member until they choose to cancel. As of December 31, 2017, approximately 85% of our total members were on a month-to-month basis. 
In joining a club, a new member signs a membership agreement that typically obligates the member to pay fees (“Joining Fees”) including a one-time initiation fee and the first annual fee. Initiation fees generally range between $0 and $99 while the annual fee generally charged between $59.99 and $69.99 for all memberships. These one-time Joining Fees averaged $60, $61 and $72 per sale for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The annual fee is also charged on each anniversary of the enrollment date, however is no longer considered a joining fee after the first payment. 
Monthly electronic fund transfers (“EFT”) of individual membership dues on a per-member basis, including the effect of promotions, averaged approximately $46, $45 and $50 per month for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Currently, approximately 99% of our members pay their membership dues the first of each month through EFT, with EFT membership revenue constituting approximately 75% of total consolidated revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017. 
Usage
Our total club usage, based on the number of member visits, was 30.2 million and 31.7 million member visits for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In the year ended December 31, 2017, approximately 28% of total usage or club visits was to members’ non-home clubs, indicating that our members take advantage of our network of clubs. Our membership plans allow for club members to elect to pay a per visit fee to use clubs that are not defined in their membership plan.

Club Format and Locations
Our clubs are generally located in middle- or upper-income residential, commercial, urban and suburban neighborhoods within major metropolitan areas that are capable of supporting the development of a cluster of clubs. Our clubs typically have high visibility and are easily accessible. In the New York metropolitan, Boston, Washington, D.C. and Philadelphia regions, we have created clusters of clubs in urban areas and their commuter suburban areas aligned with our operating strategy of offering our target members the convenience of multiple locations close to where they live and work, reciprocal use privileges, and standardized facilities and services.
5

Approximately 68% of our existing clubs are fitness-only clubs and the remaining clubs are multi-recreational. Our fitness-only clubs generally range in size from 15,000 to 25,000 square feet and average approximately 19,000 square feet. Our multi-recreational clubs generally range in size from 20,000 to 65,000 square feet, with one club being approximately 200,000 square feet. The average multi-recreational club size is approximately 38,000 square feet. 
Our existing club base consists of clubs which we have developed and constructed as well as clubs we have acquired. Over the past five years from January 1, 2013 to December 31, 2017, we constructed ten new clubs, acquired 24 clubs and closed or relocated 29 clubs. Currently, 67 of our clubs, or approximately 41% of our existing club base, were from acquisitions of privately owned single and multi-club businesses. In the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired 18 clubs, constructed and opened two clubs and closed five clubs, ending the year with 165 total clubs under operation. This compares to constructing and opening of one club, converting of two studio locations to clubs, and closing of five clubs during the year ended December 31, 2016. In both 2017 and 2016, we also upgraded certain existing clubs and plan to continue to do so in 2018. 
Our facilities include a mix of cardiovascular and strength equipment from some of the best manufacturers including Life Fitness, Technogym, Nautilus, Cybex®, Precor®, Star Trac®, Hammer®, Woodway® and Octane®. At many locations, additional amenities are also offered, including swimming pools, racquet and basketball courts, functional training zones and babysitting services. Personal training services are offered at all locations for an additional charge. Our fee-based programs offered at many of our clubs, include personal training, Small Group Training, children’s programs, and summer camps for kids. 
Our clubs also feature personal entertainment units. The units are typically mounted on or near individual pieces of cardiovascular equipment and are equipped with a flat-panel color screen for television viewing. We believe our members prefer the flexibility to view and listen to the programs of their choice during their cardiovascular workout. Recently most manufacturers are including embedded screens on their newest cardio fitness equipment which offer enhancements to both on-demand entertainment along with workout data tracking and connectivity to most mobile technologies.
Club Services and Operations
Our clubs are structured to provide an enhanced member experience through effective execution of our operating plan. Our club and support team members are the key to delivering a valued member experience and our operations are organized to maximize their overall effectiveness. Our club operations include the following:
Management.    We believe that our success is largely dependent on the selection and development of our team members. Our management structure is designed to strike the right balance between consistent execution of operational excellence and nurturing a leader’s capacity for entrepreneurial decision making. Our learning and development system allows for all club positions to receive training on the key elements of their role as well as development training for growth. We believe a critical component to our growth is our ability to leverage internally-developed management talent.
Functional Support.    Functional teams provide technical expertise and support designed to drive the member experience and revenue growth in specific areas of our clubs’ services, including sales and marketing, fitness and ancillary programming, learning and development, as well as facility management and member service.
Driving excellence in fitness and ancillary programming is critical to our success. Members receive an introductory session with a fitness manager or a personal trainer who helps to develop a customized routine that supports the member’s fitness goals. This initial assessment session includes a workout evaluation, cardio, strength and endurance testing, and movement screening. Members who elect to receive personal training can benefit from one-on-one coaching and guidance, with refreshed programs that evolve as the members achieve their fitness goals. All of our fitness clubs offer our personal training membership products where members can select from a package of four to 12 personal training sessions per month. The personal training membership product provides members with a certified personal trainer who works with the member to create an individualized goal-based program. Our fitness teams are trained to provide superior fitness solutions to address member needs. We believe the qualifications of the personal training staff help to ensure that members receive a consistent level of quality service throughout our clubs and that our personal training programs provide valuable guidance to our members as well as a significant source of incremental revenue for us. We believe that members who participate in personal training programs typically have a longer membership life.
Our commitment to providing a quality exercise experience to our members also includes group exercise programming. Our instructors teach a variety of classes, including dance, cycling, strength conditioning, boxing, yoga, Pilates and step classes. Instructors report through local club management and are further supported by regional managers responsible for ensuring consistency in class content, scheduling, training and instruction. We also provide Small Group Training offerings, which are fee-based programs that have smaller groups, and provide more focused, and typically more advanced classes. 
6

In addition to group exercise, we offer a variety of ancillary programming for children under our Sports Clubs for Kids brand. As of December 31, 2017, Sports Clubs for Kids was being offered in 33 club locations throughout our various regions. Our Sports Clubs for Kids programming positions our multi-recreational clubs as family clubs, which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage. Depending upon the facilities available at a location, Sports Clubs for Kids programming can include traditional youth offerings such as day camps, sports camps, swim lessons, hockey and soccer leagues, gymnastics, dance, and birthday parties. It also can include non-competitive “learn-to-play” sports programs.
Our facilities and equipment management teams are dedicated to ensuring our clubs and fitness equipment are operating at the highest standard of performance for our members. Local teams are deployed to provide on-site support to clubs as needed.
Our club support and member services groups act as a coordinating point for all departments, supporting excellence in program execution and ensuring consistency of policies and procedures across the entire organization that support the member experience.
Centralized Information Systems 
We recognize the value of enhancing and extending the uses of information technology (“IT”) in virtually every area of our business. Our IT strategy is aligned to support our business strategy and operating plans. We maintain an ongoing comprehensive program to monitor, replace or upgrade key technology services and infrastructure. 
All of our clubs use a third-party hosted management system to process memberships, bill members, process point of sales transactions, and track member usage of the clubs. In addition, the management system tracks and analyzes key operating measurements such as membership statistics, cancellations, cross-club utilization, member tenure, and demographics profiles.
We continue to create a more customizable and efficient experience for members through updated digital tools, which included an enhanced website and mobile application. These digital tools enable enable feature membership sign up, club location search, class schedules and booking, training information, custom profiles for group fitness instructors and trainers. In addition, members are able to customize their group fitness experience based on fitness goals and preferences through a personalized search feature. We continue to enhance the digital tools accessibility to increase our online presence and member engagement. 
Our back-office computer systems are comprised of a variety of technologies designed to assist in the management and analysis of our revenues, costs and key operational metrics, as well as support the daily operations of our clubs and corporate offices. These systems include an on premise financial system, a third-party hosted data warehouse, a third-party hosted telephone system and call center software to manage and track member service experiences.
We regularly implement cost effective technology solutions to accommodate growth, provide network redundancy, secure operating practices, better manage telecommunications and data costs, increase efficiencies in operations and improve management of all components of our technical architecture, including business continuity and recovery. Improvements in the IT infrastructure will continue to be made in the future in order to better serve our business needs.
Intellectual Property 
We have registered various trademarks and service marks with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, including, NEW YORK SPORTS CLUBS and NYSC, WASHINGTON SPORTS CLUBS and WSC, BOSTON SPORTS CLUBS and BSC, PHILADELPHIA SPORTS CLUBS and PSC, LUCILLE ROBERTS, TMPL, UXF, SPORTS CLUBS FOR KIDS, COMPANIESGETFIT.COM, BFX STUDIO, RIDE REPUBLIC, and MASTER CLASS. We continue to register other trademarks and service marks. We believe that our rights to these properties are adequately protected.
Competition 
The fitness club industry is highly competitive and continues to become more competitive. The number of health clubs in the U.S. has increased from 30,500 in 2012 to 36,540 in 2016, based on the most recent information available according to the IHRSA. In each of the regions in which we operate, we compete with other fitness clubs, physical fitness and recreational facilities.
7

We consider the following groups to be our primary competitors in the health and fitness industry:

• | commercial, multi-recreational and fitness-only chains;


• | private studios, and other boutique fitness offerings;


• | the YMCA and similar non-profit organizations;


• | physical fitness and recreational facilities established by local governments, hospitals and businesses;


• | exercise and small fitness clubs; racquet, tennis and other athletic clubs;


• | amenity gyms in apartments, condominiums and offices;


• | weight-reducing salons;


• | country clubs;


• | the home-use fitness equipment industry; and


• | online fitness coaching.

The principal methods of competition include pricing and ease of payment, required level of members’ contractual commitment, level and quality of services, age of facility and equipment, training and quality of supervisory staff, size and layout of facility and convenience of location with respect to access to transportation and pedestrian traffic.
We consider our traditional service offerings to be in the mid-tier of the value/service proposition and designed to appeal to a large portion of the population who utilize fitness facilities. The number of competitor clubs that offer lower pricing and a lower level of service have continued to grow in our regions over the last few years. These clubs have attracted, and may continue to attract, members away from both our fitness-only clubs and our multi-recreational clubs. 
We also face competition from club operators offering comparable or higher pricing with higher levels of service. Larger outer-suburban family fitness centers, in areas where suitable real estate is more likely to be available, also compete effectively against our suburban formats. Additionally, we face competition from the rising popularity and demand for private studios offering niche boutique experiences.
We also compete with other entertainment and retail businesses for the discretionary income in our target demographics. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in the future in the regions in which we operate. Competitors, who may include companies that are larger and have greater resources than us, may enter these regions to our detriment. These competitive conditions may result in increased price competition and limit our ability to attract new members and attract and retain qualified personnel. Additionally, consolidation in the fitness club industry could result in increased competition among participants, particularly large multi-facility operators that are able to compete for attractive acquisition candidates and/or newly constructed club locations. This increased competition could increase our costs associated with expansion through both acquisitions and for real estate availability for newly constructed club locations.
We believe that our market leadership, experience and operating efficiencies enable us to provide the consumer with a superior product in terms of convenience, quality service and affordability. We believe that there are barriers to entry in our metropolitan areas, including restrictive zoning laws, lengthy permit processes and a shortage of appropriate real estate, which could discourage any large competitor from attempting to open a chain of clubs in these regions. However, such a competitor could enter these regions more easily through one, or a series of, acquisitions. These barriers of entry are significant in our four metropolitan regions; however, they are less challenging in our surrounding suburban locations.
Seasonality of Business
Seasonal trends have a limited effect on our overall business. Generally, we experience greater membership through increased sales at the beginning of each year and experience an increased rate of membership attrition during the summer months. In addition, during the summer months, we experience a slight increase in operating expenses due to our outdoor pool and summer camp operations, generally matched by seasonal revenue recognition from season pool memberships and camp revenue.

Government Regulation 
Our operations and business practices are subject to federal, state and local government regulation in the various jurisdictions in which our clubs are located, including general rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission, state and local consumer protection agencies and state statutes that prescribe certain forms and provisions of membership contracts and that govern the advertising, sale, financing and collection of such memberships as well as state and local health regulations.
Statutes and regulations affecting the fitness industry have been enacted in jurisdictions in which we conduct business and other states into which we may expand in the future have adopted or may adopt similar legislation. Typically, these statutes and regulations prescribe certain forms and provisions of membership contracts, afford members the right to cancel the contract within a specified time period after signing or in certain circumstances, such as for medical reasons or relocation to a certain distance from the nearest club, require an escrow of funds received from pre-opening sales or the posting of a bond or proof of financial responsibility and may establish maximum prices for membership contracts and limitations on the term of contracts. The specific procedures and reasons for cancellation vary due to differing laws in the respective jurisdictions, but in each instance, the canceling member is entitled to a refund of unused prepaid amounts. We are also subject to numerous other types of federal and state regulations governing the sale of memberships. These laws and regulations are subject to varying interpretations by a number of state and federal enforcement agencies and courts. We maintain internal review procedures to comply with these requirements and believe that our activities are in substantial compliance with all applicable statutes, rules and decisions.
We primarily accept payments for our memberships through EFT from credit cards, and, therefore, we are subject to both federal and state legislation and certification requirements, including the Electronic Funds Transfer Act. Some states, such as New York, have passed or have considered legislation requiring gyms and health clubs to offer non-automatic renewal membership option at all times and/or limit the duration for which gym memberships can auto-renew through EFT payments, if at all. Our business relies heavily on the fact that our memberships continue on a month-to-month basis after the completion of any initial term requirements (if any), and compliance with these laws, regulations, and similar requirements may be onerous and expensive, and variances and inconsistencies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction may further increase the cost of compliance and doing business. States that have such health club statutes provide harsh penalties for violations, including membership contracts being void or voidable. 
Additionally, the collection, maintenance, use, disclosure and disposal of individually identifiable data by our businesses are regulated at the federal, state and provincial levels as well as by certain financial industry groups, such as the Payment Card Industry Organization and the National Automated Clearing House Association. Federal, state and financial industry groups may also consider from time to time new privacy and security requirements that may apply to our businesses and may impose further restrictions on our collection, disclosure and use of individually identifiable information that are housed in one or more of our databases.
The tax treatment of membership dues varies by state. Some states in which we operate require sales tax to be collected on membership dues and personal training sessions. Several others states in which we operate have proposed similar tax legislation. These taxes have the effect of increasing the payments by our members, which could impede our ability to attract new members or induce members to cancel their membership.
Changes in any statutes, rules or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.
Employees
On December 31, 2017, we had approximately 7,500 employees, of whom approximately 1,600 were employed full-time. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement with our employees. We operate with an open door policy and encourage a culture of openness, innovation and inclusiveness that creates a high level of work accountability. We have good relations with our employees and are proud to offer them a great work environment with opportunities for growth and development.
