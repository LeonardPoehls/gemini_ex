ITEM 1. Description of the Business
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated in Nevada as Computron, Inc. on August 22, 2014. Our original business was to engage in computer support services.
 
On October 28, 2016, (i) we changed our name to Ho Wah Genting Group Limited and (ii) we increased our authorized capital stock from 75,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001, to 1,500,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 (the “Common Stock”) by filing an Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Restated Articles”) with the Nevada Secretary of State. The Company’s name change to “Ho Wah Genting Group Limited” became effective on FINRA’s Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board on November 8, 2016 under the new stock ticker symbol “HWGG”.
 
We consummated a transaction evidenced by a Share Exchange Agreement dated November 4, 2016, by and among us, Ho Wah Genting Group Sdn. Bhd, a Malaysian private company limited by shares formed in September 2, 1985 (“HWGG”), and the shareholders of HWGG (“HWGG Shareholders”) pursuant to which we acquired from the HWGG Shareholders all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of HWGG in exchange for 560,000 shares of our Common Stock (“Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, the HWGG shareholders, as the former shareholders of HWGG, became our controlling shareholders and HWGG became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. The Share Exchange was accounted for as a reverse takeover/recapitalization effected by a share exchange, wherein HWGG was considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes.  In accordance with “reverse acquisition” accounting treatment, our historical financial statements as of period ends, and for periods ended, prior to the acquisition, were replaced with the historical financial statements of HWGG prior to the Share Exchange.
 
As a result of the Share Exchange, and pursuant to our Split-Off Agreement dated November 4, 2016 with our former controlling shareholder prior to the Share Exchange, we discontinued our pre-exchange business, acquired the business of HWGG and continued the existing business operations of HWGG as a publicly traded company.
 
As used in this Report, references to the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “our” or “us” refer to Ho Wah Genting Group Limited and its wholly owned subsidiary, HWGG, unless the context otherwise indicates.
 
Our Current Business
 
We are an investment holding company currently engaged in promoting entertainment membership, junket operating and marketing of real estate property through our wholly owned subsidiary HWGG.
 
One of the main products we offer is an exclusive travel membership that focuses on travel and entertainment around the world (“Exclusive Travel Membership”). We strive to serve our member’s every travel need by offering our members discounted vacation packages, hotel and room accommodations, flight arrangements and various on ground transportation means. We are developing our website and mobile application so members can purchase our membership packages online via their computer and mobile device. Currently, a person can purchase a member package at our sales office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Member packages include products and points that carry a value that approximates the package price. Each member package is available in English and Chinese and typically includes booklets describing us, our compensation plan and rules of member conduct, various training and promotional materials, member applications and a product and services catalog. The price of a member package varies by package type and provides a low cost entry for incoming members. On June 19, 2015, we began offering the following four member packages:
 

• | Holiday Card Member
--+--------------------


• | Classic Card Member
--+--------------------


• | Gold Card Member
--+-----------------


• | Black Card Member
--+------------------

 
The Holiday Card Member package was our entry based package, designed for members that wished to try or test our products and services for no annual fee. Holiday Card members had access to our Local and International Membership Subscription, value travel packages and accommodation booking services. This package was terminated in 2017.
 
The Classic Card Member package is our mid-level entry package and is designed for members that wish to earn extra benefits in addition to those available under our former Holiday Card Member package. It requires a yearly subscription payment of US$8,000 for our International Membership Subscription, or RM 20,000 for our Local Membership Subscription. It provides members up to 12% discount rewards per annum and access to our entertainment services, air ticket purchase services, value travel packages and accommodation booking services.
 
The Gold Card Member package is our advanced entry-level package. This package provides members up to 13.2% discount rewards per annum and access to our travel arrangement services, entertainment services, air ticket purchase services, value travel packages and accommodation booking services. It requires a yearly subscription payment of US$16,000 for our International Subscription or RM 50,000 for our Local Membership Subscription.
 
The Black Card Member package is our professional entry-level package. It requires a yearly subscription payment of US$32,000 for our International Membership Subscription or RM 100,000 for our Local Membership Subscription. It provides members up to 14.4% discount rewards per annum and access to our travel arrangement services, entertainment services, air ticket purchase services, value travel packages and accommodation booking services.
 
Members’ subscription amount will be converted into member redemption points (“MRP”) on an equivalent basis. MRPs can be utilized to purchase products and services offered by us and our partnering company Ho Wah Genting Holiday SDH BHD, a Malaysian corporation (“HWGH”), which pursuant to our Travel and Junket Service Contract dated April 1, 2016, provides travel agency services and prepares tour packages, hotel bookings, and transportation arrangements to offer HWGG’s members and customers. We will recognize revenue from our Exclusive Travel Membership once our members utilize their MRPs on such services and facilities. Discount rewards will be calculated based on month end point balance and rewarded based on month end MRP balance. Discount rewards can be exchanged for entertainment vouchers at selected destinations. All of our membership options terminate after twelve (12) months.
 
Since launching our membership program in Malaysia in 2015, with minimal promotion, we have generated 252 active members as of December 31, 2016 with the following breakdown:
 

• | Holiday Card Members Card | : | 22 
--+---------------------------+---+----
• | Classic Card Members | : | 110
• | Gold Card Members | : | 76 
• | Black Card Members | : | 44 

 
With our group’s foresight of the rising competition in the leisure and gaming industry, our main priority is to develop and acquire a unique premium market database via online subscription to our membership program. With the Asian market in sight, we believe a huge database of users will result in better negotiation leverage to secure the best deals for our members, thereby fortifying our unique selling propositions.
 
In connection to our Exclusive Travel Membership, we also provide junket operating services by promoting premium market players to our partner’s resorts and cruise lines. We currently have an agreement to operate as a licensed junket operator for Genting Malaysia Berhad, a Malaysian public company involved in the leisure and hospitality business covering theme parks, gaming, hotels, seaside resorts and entertainment for over fifty years throughout Asia, and Genting Hong Kong Limited, a Hong-Kong based investment holding company principally engaged in cruise businesses. To date, HWGG is an approved junket operator and local group casino rebate programme for Genting Malaysia Berhad’s casino in Peninsular Malaysia and Genting Hong Kong Limited’s entire Star Cruises Fleet and Resorts World Manila. Pursuant to the Travel and Junket Service Contract, we shared 50% of the commission earned through certain junket operations with HWGH. Starting 2017, HWGG takes 100% of the junket commission from its operations with HWGH. Our Exclusive Travel Membership members may exchange their MRPs for junket services at various leisure entities such as resorts and cruises offered by our strategic partners. HWGG earns an average of 1.0% - 1.5% for the rolling activities of our players.

With such an attractive line-up of privileges and benefits exclusively available to our members, we believe our membership program will stand out as a popular product in Asia’s premium entertainment market. Our Exclusive Travel Membership will further add value to the company as we progress into a future that is increasingly dominated by big data technologies.
 
Marketing Plan, Overview and Business Strategy
 
According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, travel and tourism generated $7.6 trillion (USD) and 277 million jobs for the global economy in 2014. In that same year, the World Travel and Tourism Council also noted that international tourist arrivals also surged, reaching nearly 1.14 billion, 46% of which were visitors from emerging economies (up from 38% in 2000).
 
Through our Exclusive Travel Membership, we intend to tap the travel and tourism industry, particularly through Asia’s emerging markets. We currently provide service arrangements to our partners’ exclusive entertainment lounges located in Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, and China. Through the growth of our membership, we believe we will gain better negotiation power for the best travel deals for our members, enhancing our unique selling points, products and services that we offer our customers.
 
As China reigns supreme as Asia’s biggest superpower, it is the biggest market when it comes to membership acquisition due to its large population and huge spending power. We believe China will be one of the biggest contributors to our Company’s revenue due to our strategic partner’s fleet of cruises launched in the China region.
 
We also believe our junket operation business will be a huge contributor to our future revenue. According to the Statistic Portal, in 2012 the global casino gaming market was projected to have a volume of $131.35 billion (USD). Based on Business Wire News, Asia comprises sixty percent of the world population and is home to many of the world’s top ten biggest casinos by gambling revenue, which are located in Macau and Singapore.
 
We believe in our strategic partner’s vision of not only promoting the gaming industry but also marketing family focused entertainment, such as entertainment parks, shopping malls and concerts. This diverse marketing approach of our partners will help attract not only the premium market but also satisfy the mass market as well. Since the Company promotes our strategic partners’ resorts and cruises, any promotion of these entertainment and travel destinations will indirectly benefit the Company. This is a distinct advantage for the Company as it builds our market exposure for our products.
 
To ensure that our Exclusive Travel Membership and junket operation services become known throughout Asia, we plan to release and promote information through word of mouth, promotion and organizing events to further increase our brand recognition.
 
Competition and Competitive Strengths
 
Our competition, which is strong and increasing, includes online and offline travel companies that target leisure and corporate travelers, including travel agencies, tour operators, travel supplier direct websites and their call centers, consolidators and wholesalers of travel products and services, large online portals and search websites, certain travel metasearch websites, mobile travel applications and social media websites, as well as traditional consumer eCommerce and group buying websites. We face these competitors in local, regional, national and/or international markets. Many of our competitors are well established, substantially larger and have substantially greater market recognition, greater resources and broader capabilities than we have. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. The competitive pressures that we face may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.
 
We believe that while we currently may have disadvantages in the travel and entertainment market, the growth of this market will allow us to earn additional market share if we can expand our membership database and maintain reliable, responsive, and quality service to our Exclusive Travel Membership members and partners.
 
We intend to use our expertise in the Asian markets and a user-friendly website to compete with the major competitors in this field. We plan to compete on the basis of ease of use, pricing and customer preference. 
 
Junket operation is a niche market, competition is not high, however, it requires a substantial network of high-roller tourists in order to attract VIP players. By providing discount rewards, high quality services and with the continuously growing network that our senior management has, we believe that we are able to pull the necessary VIP players to be successful.
 
Real Estate Investment Business
 
Prior to entering the entertainment and travel industry, HWGG was primary engaged in residential and commercial property investment and development in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Throughout the years, we have been approached by property developers and investors requesting that we study property projects in Malaysia. Our portfolio currently consists of a condominium in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia which generates rental income for us. We may sell or purchase further properties, if opportunities arise that we believe will maximize our overall asset values.
 
According to local news sources in Malaysia, Malaysia’s property market has softened considerably in 2015 due to cooling measures implemented by its government including stricter and more stringent loan requirements. According to a report published by Malaysia’s Real Estate and Housing Developers Association, loan rejection rates have been reported to be as high as 70%, negatively impacting the country’s property market. A Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) was implemented across the board on April 1, 2015, and property transactions in the first quarter of the year fell by 4.6%, from 92,900 for the same period in 2014. New property prices are estimated to have increased by 3.97% due to higher material costs. While Malaysia’s property market has achieved relative stability compared with the bull run of recent years, it is perceived that this is largely due to the economic situation in the country and not due to the implementation of GST. Domestic buyers are increasingly unable to enter the property market at affordable levels which has resulted in market stagnation in certain regions of Malaysia. The Ringgit Malaysia fell at a 16-year low has caused the property investment market to subdue due to market uncertainties.

Notwithstanding these measures, we expect the housing market to remain resilient and sustainable in the near future. According to an article published by Asean Today, properties in Malaysia will hit a peak by year 2020. Surveys conducted by local reputable firms specializing in analyzing Malaysian investment behavior, noted that Malaysians prefer to invest in property due to higher yields on rental, good appreciation, retirement plan, for better environment and for affordable pricing. Our management believes that foreign investors actually favor Malaysian property due to Malaysia’s modern and sophisticated infrastructure that is being further enhanced by government initiatives to facilitate foreign investment in Malaysia, including tax incentives and easing of laws governing foreign ownership of property. We believe that the property cycle has or will be reaching its bottom line soon and the cycle will turn within these few years. Even with a slowdown in property transaction, our management believes the price of the properties does not drop much (most of the properties either go up in price or remain unchanged) and that real estate investment remains attractive to foreign buyers due to Malaysian’s weaker ringgit (which mean the properties in Malaysia are relatively cheap to foreign investors). All this information provides assurance to us that the property sector in Malaysia remains solid and that now is the best time to invest in this industry. We also believe that by remaining in the property investment industry, we will capture this market by building our brand name.
 
We may not be able to compete with the big companies at our current stage. Our competitors may have larger financial capacities, greater resource availability, and more diversification in terms of their property portfolios and experience.  Our competitive strategies will focus on the following key areas: lease and sales strategy, target local market (mostly mid income earner), target foreign market (partly mid income earner and partly high income earner) and strategize location with a reasonable pricing.
 
We have engaged project managers to look into enhancing this sector of our business and are in the early state of exploring and planning our next property investment project. On November 23, 2016, we acquired rights to purchase 202 units in a condominium development scheduled to be completed no later than December 31, 2017 in Negeri Johor, Malaysia, at 40% below market price. Pursuant to such agreement, we are able to resale the units to customers at market price. We will earn approximately 40% of the gross revenue for each unit that we are able to sell by December 31, 2017 and have no obligations to purchase any units that we are unable to find customers for.
 
Information Technology Business
 
On June 25, 2015, HWGG acquired 65% of the equity interests of Beedo SDN BHD, a Malaysian corporation that specializes in information technology services (“Beedo”). On July 7, 2015, Beedo increased its issued and paid-up shares from 2,500 to 1,000,000. HWGG acquired an additional 508,375 shares on that date, making its balance of shares 510,000 and effectively diluting its ownership in Beedo from 65% to 51%. On August 12, 2016, HWGG completed the disposal of its subsidiary, Beedo, by wholly transferring the shares it owns to a related party, Dato’ Lim Hui Boon, for the consideration of $118,881 (RM 510,000). Since selling its interest of Beedo, we no longer participate in the information technology services industry.
Long Term Plans
 
Our long term plan is to expand our travel and entertainment and junket operation business throughout Asia and to the United States, particularly in Las Vegas, Nevada. To achieve this, we will continue to make improvements on our Exclusive Travel Membership and network of VIP players and receive feedback from our members and strategic partners. We will also need to conduct further research and studies to better understand the travel and tourism business and junket operator requirements in those markets.
 
Additionally, we plan to create an online gaming platform to enhance our membership services. The global online gambling market is expected to grow at a rate of up to 11% from 2016 to 2020, according to Technavio’s report as released in late 2015. The American Gaming Association says the online gambling market is currently valued at approximately US $37 billion annually, and 85 countries have chosen to legalize Internet gambling. With regard to the United States, only a few states have permitted online casino gambling to date, including Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware. A significant share of global online gambling revenue comes from Europe. According to the European Commission, the online gambling market is about $15 billion per year, and it is growing at a rate of approximately 15% on an annual basis. We believe that the online gambling sector is an industry that can contribute significantly to our revenue and further enhance our shareholder value.
 
Another long term plan is to set up an investment fund. Our management team is currently working with a few investment firms to form connections in order to further contribute to our revenue.
 
Our management has experience in the Hong Kong, Malaysia and US markets. Our management has helped raise funds for various companies to be used as working capital and other corporate exercise matters, including mergers and acquisitions. Our management has also conducted due diligence for more than 10 different types of industries (mining, construction, properties, manufacturing, food and beverage, trading, beauty products, furniture products and others) for potential investment purposes. With the experience of our management team, we believe that opening an investment fund will be a viable and profitable option to enhance the value of our Company overtime. We intend to work with reputable partners to invest in securities and other permitted assets to generate an additional revenue stream and increase profit for our shareholders.

Patents and Trademarks
 
At the present we do not have any patents or trademarks.
 
Need for any Government Approval of Services
 
We do not require any government approval for our services.
 
In the event any of our operations or services requires government approval, we will comply with any and all local, state and federal requirements.
 
Government and Industry Regulation
 
We are committed to complying with all federal, state and international laws governing our business operations.
 
We believe that we comply with the requirements in Malaysia for any licenses or approvals to pursue our proposed business plan. In locations where we operate, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licensee and approvals, and to implement regulations. Possible sanctions which may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in a particular business for specific periods of time, revocation of licenses, censures, redress to customers and fines. We may be prevented from operating if our activities are not in compliance with domestic Malaysian regulations.
 
In addition, we may be subject to various laws and regulations globally, particularly with respect to our travel and entertainment segment of our business. Many countries have either implemented new laws or made revisions to existing laws on travel and entertainment, particularly in the gaming industry, in the last decade. We may be prevented from operating if our activities are not in compliance with certain foreign regulations and must take action to comply with such relevant laws and regulations.
 
As a junket operator, we may deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and may be subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted which could adversely affect our operating results.
 
Furthermore, our real estate investments are subject to extensive local, city, county and state rules and regulations regarding permitting, zoning, subdivision, utilities and water quality as well as federal rules and regulations regarding air and water quality and protection of endangered species and their habitats. Such regulation may delay future plans of development of our current and future properties and result in higher than anticipated developmental and administrative costs.
 
Research and Development Activities
 
Other than time spent researching our business and proposed markets and segmentation, the Company has not spent any funds on research and development activities to date. In the event opportunities arise from our operations, the Company may elect to initiate research and development activities, but the Company has no plans for any activities to date.
Environmental Laws
 
Our operations are not subject to any Environmental Laws.
 
Employees
 
We currently have 7 full time employees, all of which are located in Malaysia. None of our employees are members of any labor union, and we have never experienced any business interruption as a result of any labor disputes.
