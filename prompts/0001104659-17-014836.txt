ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Overview
 
Loxo Oncology is a biopharmaceutical company innovating the development of highly selective medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers. Our pipeline focuses on cancers that are uniquely dependent on single gene abnormalities, such that a single drug has the potential to treat the cancer with dramatic effect. We believe that the most selective, purpose-built medicines have the highest probability of maximally inhibiting the intended target, thereby delivering best-in-class disease control and safety. Our management team seeks out experienced industry partners, world-class scientific advisors and innovative clinical-regulatory approaches to deliver new cancer therapies to patients as quickly and efficiently as possible.
 
As genetic testing in cancer becomes more routine, we are learning that cancers arising in diverse sites in the body may share common genetic alterations. Increasingly, tumors may be identified and treated according to their distinguishing genetic alterations, while in the past, the organ of origin was most important. Both research and clinical data suggest that some tumors, while having many identifiable genetic alterations, are primarily dependent on a single activated kinase for their proliferation and survival. This dependency, often referred to as oncogene addiction, renders such tumors highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors targeting the relevant alteration.
 
We identify and prioritize our targets in two ways. First, we use reported clinical trial data to assess the response signals of drugs in development and identify those that show promise but also demonstrate drug-specific limitations such as poor absorption, poor distribution or unwanted side effects. Second, we monitor or sponsor academic research to quickly identify novel targets with emerging validation. Once a target is identified, we employ proven technology solutions to develop product candidates intended to have enhanced target engagement and specificity. We implement a stepwise approach to clinical development designed to reduce risk and identify response signals early in development. In early-stage trials, whenever possible, we seek to evaluate our product candidates in well-defined patient populations in order to maximize the likelihood of demonstrating a clinical benefit. This approach allows for the possibility of rapid clinical development and expedited regulatory strategies. We intend to develop companion diagnostics when appropriate, with the help of technology partners, to identify patients whose tumors harbor relevant genetic alterations.
 
Our drug discovery efforts to date have relied on a collaboration with Array BioPharma Inc., or Array, which leverages Arrays expertise in building highly selective and potent kinase inhibitors. Through this collaboration, we retain worldwide development and commercial rights for all of our product candidates.
 
Our Strategy
 
Our goal is to translate key scientific insights relating to underlying oncogenic drivers into the development of potent and highly selective therapeutics. To execute our strategy, we intend to:
 
·      Rapidly advance our lead product candidate larotrectinib, formerly referred to as LOXO-101, through clinical development.  Larotrectinib, which we believe is the only selective TRK inhibitor currently in clinical development, is being evaluated in three multi-center studies that include patients with solid tumors that harbor TRK gene fusions. This includes an adult Phase 1 trial, a pediatric Phase 1/2 trial, and an adult/adolescent Phase 2 trial. All three trials have the ability to enroll patients with TRK gene fusions and contribute to the New Drug Application (NDA) efficacy database for larotrectinib.

·      Develop a pipeline of potent and highly selective targeted therapeutics.  Our insights into cancer biology and target identification, coupled with our focus on purpose-built medicinal chemistry, have allowed us to build a proprietary pipeline of targeted preclinical product candidates. Our management team and Scientific Advisory Board have a history of success in the identification, translation and development of oncology therapeutics, and together we determine which programs merit advancement and continued development.
 
·      Increase the probability for clinical success by prioritizing targets for development that are believed to be oncogenic drivers. We attempt to select targets for drug development that behave as oncogenic drivers. If we are successful in inhibiting these targets with our product candidates, we may increase the likelihood of achieving tumor responses. This approach has been validated by others in the setting of epidermal growth factor (EGFR) mutated lung cancer, BRAF mutated melanoma, BCR-ABL translocated chronic myelogenous leukemia and ALK translocated lung cancer.
 
·      Work with experienced third parties in the field of diagnostics. In initial clinical development, we will attempt to employ existing diagnostic tools to identify patient subsets with the highest likelihood of clinical benefit. In late-stage clinical development, once the most important screening criteria have been established, we will work with third-party technology partners to develop companion diagnostic assays that could support registration and marketing of our product candidates. Thus, our relationships with established diagnostics partners may help us enroll our clinical trials more successfully, better identify patients in the eventual commercial setting, or both.
 
·      Conduct international clinical and regulatory programs to support our global approval and commercialization strategy.  We retain worldwide commercial rights to our product candidates. Cancer is a global disease and we are pursuing clinical and regulatory programs for approval in the U.S. and internationally. Our plan is to establish a focused oncology commercial organization in the U.S. and strategically evaluate commercial partnership opportunities internationally.
 
Background on Cancer
 
Cancer is the second-leading cause of death in the U.S. The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2017 there will be approximately 1.69 million new cases and approximately 601,000 deaths from cancer in the U.S. Cancer originates from defects in the cells genetic code (DNA), which disrupt the mechanisms that normally prevent uncontrolled cell growth, invasion and programmed cell death. Increasingly, doctors are using diagnostic tests to identify these genetic defects and select better treatment options. As genetic testing in cancer becomes more routine, we are learning that cancers arising in diverse sites in the body may share common genetic alterations.
 
The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination of these modalities. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective in patients in whom the disease is localized. Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations in which the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery. The goal of drug therapy is to damage and kill cancer cells or to interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the development, growth and survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has evolved from non-specific drugs that kill both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular pathways involved in cancer and more recently to therapeutics that target specific oncogenic drivers. These therapies often require genetic testing of a cancer to identify the subsets of patients for whom a drug will most effectively impact tumor growth.
 
Cytotoxic Therapies.  The earliest approach to cancer drug therapy was the development of cytotoxic drugs, commonly referred to as chemotherapy, designed to kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells. Cytotoxic drug therapies act in an indiscriminate manner, killing healthy as well as cancerous cells. Due to their mechanism of action, many cytotoxic drugs have a narrow therapeutic range; doses above this range cause unacceptable or even fatal levels of damage to normal organs, while doses below the range are not effective in eradicating the cancer cells. Examples of cytotoxic drugs include carboplatin (Paraplatin), docetaxel (Taxotere) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin).
Targeted Therapies.  A more recent class of medicines targets specific biological signaling pathways that play a role in rapid cell growth or the spread of cancer. While these drugs have been effective in the treatment of some cancers, most of them do not address the genetic alterations that cause oncogenesis. As normal cells may also rely on these signaling pathways, there are often toxicities associated with inhibition of these pathways. In addition, targeted therapies may hit signaling pathways adjacent and in addition to the intended pathway, thus causing off-target toxicities. Examples of targeted therapies include sunitinib (Sutent), sorafenib (Nexavar), and cabozantinib (Cometriq).
Targeted Therapies and Oncogene Addiction.  The dissemination of approved and experimental targeted therapies into large populations revealed that some patients had particularly robust responses to these therapies. This observation was consistent with lab evidence that some tumors, despite having many measurable genetic alterations, are primarily dependent on a single activated kinase
 
3




for their growth and survival advantage. Such cancers are highly susceptible to small molecule inhibitors. Often described as an oncogenic driver mutation or a dominant activating mutation, oncogene addiction is a term used to describe a tumors particular dependence on a specific pathway. Oncogene addiction has become an important concept in clinical development because patients with tumors governed by this behavior typically show rapid and measurable tumor shrinkage when exposed to drugs targeting the relevant alteration. These responses can be sufficiently dramatic in some cases to support expedited regulatory approval for the associated targeted therapy.
 
Kinase inhibitors against EGFR in stage IV lung cancer provide an informative case study regarding the importance of identifying oncogenic drivers in enabling more efficient drug development and improving clinical care. In 2004, researchers first discovered that a subset of lung cancer was caused by a genetic defect in EGFR. Drugs called erlotinib (Tarceva and gefitinib (Iressa), which target EGFR, were in development for lung cancers of unknown mutation status. Investigators learned that patients with mutations in EGFR receiving Tarceva or Iressa experienced a much higher response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with meaningful tumor shrinkage on their clinical imaging scans, than unselected patients. Patients with EGFR mutations have a response rate in the 65% range, as opposed to the 10% range noted in unselected lung patients. Tarceva is approved in the U.S. as first-line treatment for non-small cell lung cancer patients with EGFR mutations, afatinib (Gilotrif) is approved in the U.S. for patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with specific EGFR mutations, and in November 2015, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted accelerated approval to osimertinib (Tagrisso) for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have a specific genetic marker and have progressed on or after treatment with a prior EGFR inhibitor.
 
Inhibitors of other kinases associated with oncogenic driver events have shown compelling clinical effects in patients whose tumors harbor alterations in genes such as ALK, BRAF, and ABL. Drugs such as crizotinib (Xalkori), vemurafenib (Zelboraf), imatinib (Gleevec) and others have been successfully developed against these oncogenic drivers.
 
Researchers and clinical oncologists now often incorporate genetic assessments into clinical trials and routine care with the hope of directing patients to medicines, which may have a greater chance of treating their cancers effectively. As more driver oncogenes in cancer are identified, clinicians and investigators are more willing to test routinely with an expanded panel genetic test. In turn, it is possible to develop drugs for defined subsets of patients, and to look for patients whose tumor types harbor genetically similar alterations. As such, doctors may begin to identify tumors and select therapies based on the type of mutations they share, rather than the part of the body from which they arise. Such a system should afford more efficient drug development, the opportunity for robust clinical responses and a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of cancer.
 
The Loxo Approach
 
Loxo Oncology is a biopharmaceutical company innovating the development of highly selective medicines for patients with genetically defined cancers. Our pipeline focuses on cancers that are uniquely dependent on single gene abnormalities, such that a single drug has the potential to treat the cancer with dramatic effect. We believe that the most selective, purpose-built medicines have the highest probability of maximally inhibiting the intended target, thereby delivering best-in-class disease control and safety. Our management team seeks out experienced industry partners, world-class scientific advisors and innovative clinical-regulatory approaches to deliver new cancer therapies to patients as quickly and efficiently as possible.
Step 1Target Selection
 
Target selection requires an understanding of which genetic alterations are oncogenic drivers. Some targets have already been clinically validated as oncogenic drivers of cancer and offer increased likelihood of program success; these targets require improved chemistry or innovative development for competitive differentiation. Other targets are still emerging, so the understanding of oncogenic driver behavior requires careful analysis of new biological evidence. We believe we are well-positioned to exploit both types of opportunities.
Learning from Clinical Trial Data.  Response signals for third-party drugs in clinical trials can point to the promise of a target that has been inadequately exploited. One important emerging concept in cancer drug development is that of target coverage, or the extent to which a drug fully engages its intended target. We believe that maximal target inhibition is required for maximal clinical effect. However, drugs often fail to reach sufficient concentrations in the human body because they are poorly absorbed, poorly distributed, rapidly cleared, or cause off-target toxicities at doses lower than those needed for optimal efficacy. Sometimes these limitations can be overcome with better chemistry, which improves drug exposure and reduces unwanted off-target effects.
 
A second concept learned from studying clinical trial data relates to acquired resistance.  Acquired resistance describes the clinical situation where a patients oncogene addicted tumor is at first sensitive to the relevant drug but then mutates again such that it becomes resistant.  It is sometimes possible to understand how a new, acquired mutation has led to drug resistance.  In turn, it is sometimes possible to develop a next-generation drug inhibitor that can re-induce a response in the patient. For example, the drug
 
4




osimertinib (Tagrisso) addresses acquired resistance in patients who have progressed on a prior EGFR inhibitor.  Developing second-generation drugs against validated targets with acquired resistance can be of great clinical value to patients because it extends the time of durable disease control, and the well characterized biology creates compelling opportunities in development.
 
Learning from Academic Research.  Lab research can help identify and qualify emerging targets. Genetic studies across groups of patient tumor samples generate rich data sets, which are often publicly available. Bioinformatic approaches can help identify the alterations most likely to have clinical relevance. Lab experiments involving cell and animal models can be used to explore whether a novel target is an oncogenic driver and whether targeted drugs can be effective. Consistency of results across highly respected labs is especially important. We apply our judgment to synthesize these diverse data streams to identify the most promising targets.
Step 2Drug Profiling
 
We translate target insight into a drug through the application of chemistry to a biologic problem. Whether our target of interest is fully validated or novel, we strive to understand, on a structural level, whether the relevant protein can be inhibited with a compound we can design and synthesize. We assess compounds based on their ability to fully engage their targets, avoid unwanted effects and have favorable pharmacologic properties. Target specificity also affords increased potential for combination therapy with other targeted agents. We have observed that better chemistry can unlock novel biology in the clinic. We rely on extensive experimental data from two domains to justify advancing a program.
Biologic Relevance.  In consultation with our Scientific Advisory Board, we identify experiments with the intent to answer the underlying hypothesis of oncogenic driver potential, target validation, or a differentiated profile relative to competitive programs. These experiments may be conducted at Array, third-party commercial vendors or with academic collaborators. It is often necessary to have a prototype inhibitor to determine that a biologic target justifies designing and synthesizing a product candidate. Working with a partner such as Array, which has an advanced and well-annotated chemistry library including numerous prototype inhibitors, can be particularly helpful in this regard.
 
Chemistry Feasibility.  Our collaboration with Array allows us to employ its chemistry platform to solve problems that have historically plagued many cancer drugs. For each target under evaluation, we develop molecules with the specific pharmacokinetic properties that we have identified and are able to compile a comprehensive data review prior to advancing a molecule to preclinical toxicology studies. This understanding of how a molecule might behave in vivo prevents us from advancing products with undesirable physiochemical properties.
 
Step 3Clinical Trial and Regulatory Execution
 
Our clinical development strategy employs a stepwise approach designed to identify response signals early in development and reduce development risks. In early stage development, we seek to explore one or more doses in well-defined patient populations and believe this gives us a higher likelihood of demonstrating a clinical benefit. This approach is intended to allow for early insight into the therapeutic potential of a product candidate and the possibility for rapid clinical development and expedited regulatory strategies, such as Breakthrough Therapy Designation, Fast Track Designation, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval. We intend to develop companion diagnostics as appropriate, with the help of technology partners, to identify patients whose tumors harbor the relevant genetic alterations.

Product Candidates
 
Larotrectinib
 
Overview. Larotrectinib, formerly referred to as LOXO-101, is an oral, selective inhibitor of the TRK family in development for the treatment of tumors with TRK fusions. TRK fusions have been implicated in diverse tumor types such as lung cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, sarcoma, and breast cancer. We selected larotrectinib from a portfolio of Array TRK inhibitors that had distinct chemical scaffolds and were initially developed to treat pain, a setting in which positive efficacy signals had been seen with therapeutic antibodies targeting the TRK pathway. As a result of the initial focus on a pain indication, the TRK inhibitors were designed for both potency and specificity. In purified enzyme inhibition studies, larotrectinib has demonstrated potent inhibition activity against TRKA, TRKB and TRKC at low nanomolar concentration levels. These studies also demonstrated that larotrectinib was highly selective, as it was not a strong inhibitor of any other tested kinase. Similarly, in cells expressing these TRK receptors, larotrectinib also demonstrated potent inhibition activity at low nanomolar concentrations. We believe that potent and selective inhibition of the TRK pathway may provide clinical benefit in patients whose tumors have relevant TRK alterations. Given larotrectinibs specificity, we do not anticipate clinical activity in patients whose tumors are not driven by TRK.
 
TRK Biology. TRK signaling is important to neuronal development, including the growth and function of neuronal synapses, memory development and maintenance and the protection of neurons after ischemia or other injuries. TRK expression decreases after birth in most tissues and in adults expression is restricted primarily to cells of neural crest with a low level of expression under normal conditions. More recently, the role of TRK in non-neural tissues has also been recognized; these tissues include the kidney, prostate, B-lymphocytes, eosinophils, marrow-derived endothelial precursors (involving heart, muscle and ovary) and embryonic stem cells. Three high-affinity TRK receptors have been identified: TRKA, TRKB and TRKC. These proteins are encoded by the NTRK1, NTRK2 and NTRK3 genes, respectively.
 
The Role of TRK in Cancer. TRK has been widely implicated in multiple cancer types and research suggests that the genes that code TRK are frequently involved in fusion events, or the abnormal connection of two genes. Fusion events can result in pathologic activation of cellular growth and proliferation pathways. Multiple downstream pathways believed to be important in cancer are stimulated by activated TRK receptors, including the PI3-kinase, phospholipase C-gamma, and MAP-kinase pathways. Drugs targeting some of these pathways have demonstrated clinical activity in the treatment of cancer. The first TRK fusion kinases that were discovered in solid tumors involved the NTRK1 gene in colon cancer. In 2002, fusion kinases involving NTRK3 were identified in secretory breast carcinoma, a rare subtype of breast cancer. More recently, research has uncovered multiple other instances of
 
6




fusions involving the genes that code TRK. For example, scientists identified NTRK1 gene fusions as oncogenic in lung adenocarcinomas in 2013. We believe that the growing body of scientific literature suggesting the presence of NTRK fusions suggests a possible dependency for cellular proliferation and survival, or an oncogenic addictive role, across multiple cancers.
 
Larotrectinib Phase 1 Study. We are evaluating larotrectinib in a Phase 1 dose escalation trial in adult patients with advanced solid tumors refractory to standard therapy. The primary endpoints of this open label, multicenter, dose escalation trial include safety assessments, determining the maximum tolerated dose and identifying the appropriate dose for further clinical investigation. Secondary endpoints include pharmacokinetic assessments of orally administered larotrectinib, evaluation of tumor response and duration of response. Adult patients are eligible provided they meet our eligibility criteria, including (1) locally advanced or metastatic adult solid tumor that has progressed or was nonresponsive to available therapies and for which no standard or available curative therapy exists, (2) an ECOG score, which measures disease progression, of 0, 1 or 2, with life expectancy of at least 3 months and (3) adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function. We began enrolling patients in our Phase 1 trial in May 2014. The trial allows for additional expansion cohorts to better characterize safety and efficacy in patients with specific abnormalities in the NTRK genes or proteins. We last reported interim data for this trial at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Asia Congress in Singapore in December 2016. As of November 10, 2016, 59 patients with refractory solid tumors had been enrolled and treated with single agent larotrectinib, including eight patients with cancers harboring NTRK fusions. Because this trial allows enrollment of patients with TRK fusions, it has contributed to our understanding of larotrectinibs efficacy in the intended population for which an NDA is planned.
Larotrectinib Interim Phase 1 Safety Data. As of a data cutoff date of November 10, 2016, larotrectinib had been well tolerated in the 59 patients treated, including 34 patients receiving a dose of 100mg BID, which is the dose we carried forward to Phase 2. The most common adverse events reported, regardless of attribution to the study drug, have been largely mild to moderate (Grade 1 and 2), occurring with the following frequencies: fatigue (37 percent), dizziness (29 percent), anemia (25 percent) and dyspnea (25 percent). More severe (Grade 3 or 4) adverse events occurring in more than two patients have included anemia, fatigue, increased liver enzymes, and dyspnea. No individual Grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurred in more than three patients treated at 100mg BID or more than five patients in the entire study population. Three patients have withdrawn from the study due to adverse events. The frequency of toxicities did not correlate with dose level. The maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, has not yet been defined, and doses up to 200mg BID have been tested and deemed safe by study investigators, meaning that even higher doses could be tested in future clinical trials, if desired.
Larotrectinib Interim Phase 1 Efficacy Data. As of a data cutoff date of November 10, 2016, 59 patients with refractory solid tumors had been enrolled and treated with single agent larotrectinib. This total includes eight patients with cancers harboring TRK fusions, including patients with a primary diagnosis of mammary analogue secretory cancer of the salivary glands (MASC, n=3), gastrointestinal stromal tumor (n=2), soft tissue sarcoma (n=1), thyroid carcinoma (n=1) and non-small cell lung cancer (n=1). Seven of these patients with TRK fusion cancers were on study sufficiently long as of the data cutoff for an efficacy assessment, while an eighth TRK fusion patient had been more recently enrolled and had not yet been evaluated for response. Six of the seven efficacy evaluable patients achieved a confirmed partial response, as defined by standard RECIST v1.1 criteria. A seventh patient demonstrated clear radiographic tumor regressions, including in the central nervous system, and remained on study as of November 10, 2016, but had not met the threshold required for a RECIST v1.1 response. All responders remained in response as of November 10, 2016, with one patient in cycle 22, one patient in cycle 19, one patient in cycle 18, two patients in cycle 15 and one patient in cycle 11. Each cycle is 28 days, or approximately one month. All seven patients remained on study as of November 10, 2016. The eighth patient who had been more recently enrolled and not yet evaluated for efficacy also remained on study as of the data cutoff.
Larotrectinib Phase 2 Basket Study. In October 2015, we treated the first study subject in our NAVIGATE Phase 2 basket trial, a multicenter, international open label study in adult cancer patients whose tumors harbor TRK fusions. A basket trial is a type of clinical study that seeks to enroll cancer patients with a common genetic feature, in this case, a TRK fusion, as opposed to patients with a particular type of cancer. The larotrectinib Phase 2 basket trial is enrolling patients with TRK fusions across all solid tumor types. In order to meet the criteria for enrollment, patients must have received prior standard therapy appropriate for their tumor type and stage of disease, or in the opinion of the investigator, would be unlikely to tolerate or derive clinical benefit from appropriate standard of care therapy. During this trial, larotrectinib is administered orally as a single agent continuously in 28-day cycles. The 100 mg twice-daily dose, which was administered to five of the seven evaluable TRK fusion patients on the Phase 1 study, has been selected for this trial. The primary endpoint of the trial is the overall response rate to larotrectinib, as measured by the proportion of subjects with best overall confirmed response of complete response or partial response by RECIST v1.1, or Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology RANO, criteria, as appropriate. Secondary endpoints include duration of response, the proportion of subjects that have any tumor regression as a best response, progression-free survival, overall survival, safety and tolerability. We collaborate with the clinical, laboratory, and molecular pathology communities in both academia and industry to ensure that that TRK fusion patients and their treating physicians are alerted to the larotrectinib Phase 2 clinical trial, integrating trial recruitment into routine clinical practice.

Larotrectinib Inclusion in NCI-MATCH Study. In October 2015, we also announced that the independent committee of the National Cancer Institute-Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice, or NCI-MATCH, clinical trial chose larotrectinib as the sole, dedicated treatment arm for patients with TRK gene fusions. The primary endpoint for NCI-MATCH is the objective response rate, defined as the percentage of patients whose tumors have a complete or partial response to treatment. The NCI-MATCH trial plans to initially enroll about 6,000 patients with tumor biopsies available for comprehensive genomic profiling and assign these patients to an appropriate targeted therapy arm based on the molecular abnormalities of each tumor. As part of the agreement between Loxo and NCI, Loxo will have access to data generated through this study which may be supportive as part of regulatory interactions. The TRK fusion arm of this study has yet to open and has not enrolled any patients. Results from this trial may, over time, provide supportive data in the context of the overall clinical development program, but are unlikely to constitute a primary or gating dataset that supports regulatory review.
 
Larotrectinib Phase 1/2 Pediatric Study. In December 2015, we announced the initiation of the SCOUT trial, a Phase 1/2 multicenter, open-label trial of larotrectinib in pediatric patients with advanced solid or primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, with the treatment of our first study subject. On April 19, 2016, the journal Pediatric Blood and Cancer published a manuscript co-authored with Nemours Childrens Hospital, Northwestern University and St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, describing a confirmed RECIST v1.1 partial response in the first patient enrolled in the pediatric trial of larotrectinib. The 16-month-old female had infantile fibrosarcoma involving the neck, face, skull, mastoids and cervical vasculature. At the end of cycle 1 (day 28), imaging of the brain and neck showed tumor regression of more than 90 percent from baseline. Repeat scans at the end of cycle 2 showed a continued decrease in tumor volume. During the preparation of the manuscript, the patient was in study cycle 5, with a RECIST v1.1 confirmed partial response. The patient experienced no adverse events related to larotrectinib.
 
In the dose-escalation phase of this trial, larotrectinib is administered orally twice daily, with the initial starting dose level intended to match the pharmacokinetic exposures of the 100 mg twice daily dose that is currently being employed in the larotrectinib Phase 2 basket trial in adult patients. The actual dose for each patient will depend on the patients body size and age. The trial utilizes the capsule dosage form as well as a liquid formulation of larotrectinib designed specifically for pediatric patients unable to swallow capsules. The primary objective of the trial is to explore the safety of larotrectinib. Secondary objectives include the characterization of pharmacokinetics, the identification of the maximum tolerated dose and/or the Phase 2 dose, a description of antitumor activity. We plan to present interim clinical data from the Phase 1/2 trial in pediatric patients in mid-2017. Like the adult Phase 1 study, this trial also allows enrollment of patients with TRK fusions, and therefore provides an opportunity to characterize larotrectinibs efficacy in patients with TRK fusion cancers and to support the NDA dataset.
 
Larotrectinib Pharmacology.  Key findings from preclinical testing of larotrectinib are listed below. Several in vitro analyses, in vivo xenograft studies and safety analyses in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys informed the following:
 
·      Larotrectinib is a highly selective and potent inhibitor of TRKA, TRKB and TRKC.
 
·      In animal studies, larotrectinib demonstrated good oral bioavailability, moderate protein binding and distribution into tissues, which together, provide unbound plasma concentration at the target.
 
·      Larotrectinib was selected in part for its modest brain penetration, because preclinical studies suggested sustained inhibition of TRK signaling in the brain could lead to neurotoxicity.  However, larotrectinibs potency coupled with its pulsatile CNS pharmacology appear to deliver drug exposures in the CNS sufficient for anti-tumor activity.
 
·      Onset of target engagement in animal models within two hours suggesting the potential for rapid inhibition of target.
 
·      Larotrectinib is not a significant inhibitor or inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4 isoenzyme; therefore, there may be reduced risk of drug interactions.
 
From these findings we concluded that larotrectinib has drug-like pharmaceutical properties and that it was appropriate to advance this product candidate into clinical development. We believe that these characteristics of larotrectinib may allow us to achieve greater inhibition of the TRK target in humans, address TRK fusion CNS disease, and improve patient outcomes.
 
Orphan Drug Status. In September 2015, we announced that the FDA granted larotrectinib orphan drug designation for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma.
 
In January 2016, we announced that the European Commission designated larotrectinib as an orphan medicinal product for treatment of patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

Rare Pediatric Disease Designation. The FDA has granted rare pediatric disease designation to larotrectinib for the treatment of infantile fibrosarcoma, a rare pediatric cancer. The designation provides the opportunity for us to apply for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher. Whether FDA grants us a priority review voucher at the time of drug approval will depend on the FDAs interpretation of the statutes, regulations and guidance documents relevant to the program, and whether the population described in larotrectinibs first approved indication sufficiently encompasses the population covered by the rare pediatric disease designation or is broader than permitted to obtain a voucher. We estimate that there may be approximately 100 new cases of infantile fibrosarcoma per year in the United States.
Breakthrough Therapy Designation. In July 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to larotrectinib for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with NTRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments. The larotrectinib Breakthrough Therapy Designation application, submitted approximately 60 days prior to designation receipt, included TRK fusion patient data from the ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation study of larotrectinib in adult patients with advanced solid tumors, the ongoing Phase 1/2 pediatric study of larotrectinib in patients with advanced solid tumors or primary CNS tumors, and the ongoing Phase 2 basket trial of larotrectinib in adult cancer patients whose tumors harbor TRK fusions. We expect the NDA dataset to similarly draw on TRK fusion patient data across the three ongoing larotrectinib clinical studies, as is reflected in the adult and pediatric patient indication for which FDA granted larotrectinib Breakthrough Therapy Designation.
Integrated Program Update. On December 19, 2016, we held a conference call and webcast to provide an overall program update for larotrectinib.  At that time, we referenced written FDA feedback which we believe affirmed a path forward for a tissue-type agnostic NDA filing strategy for adult and pediatric TRK fusion patients and provided specific enrollment advice regarding the primary analysis set that could potentially support an NDA filing. On February 21, 2017, we announced that we had completed clinical trial enrollment consistent with this advice. We believe that the efficacy and safety database sizes required for the approval of larotrectinib are within precedents set by prior targeted therapy drug approvals in oncology in genetically defined cancers. While the NDA and worldwide regulatory filings are in process, all larotrectinib clinical trials will remain open as a means of characterizing long-term follow-up of enrolled patients, while also providing a mechanism for drug access to newly identified patients.  The primary efficacy analysis for larotrectinib will be based on RECIST v1.1 overall response rate (ORR), as determined by independent radiology review, for NTRK fusion patients enrolled across the three ongoing larotrectinib clinical studies. Durability and magnitude of response and safety are also critical elements of the regulatory risk-benefit determination.
 
Independent radiology review refers to a formal process wherein third-party radiologists, not affiliated with the drug development program, are engaged to provide an assessment of the primary radiology images used in support of an NDA, or equivalent health authority filing. In our case, this third-party group would apply the rules of RECIST v1.1 to the interpretation of the images so that an overall response rate could be calculated.  Of note, all of our patient responses disclosed to date have been generated by investigator assessments of response.  In contrast to independent radiology review, investigator assessed response is performed by investigators or their affiliated radiology colleagues who may be aware of the study treatment, patient history or other information that could impact their choices in applying the rules and conventions of RECIST v1.1. Conversely, independent radiology reviewers have limited access to non-radiographic clinical information or other ancillary information, which could have informed their application of RECIST v1.1 response rules.  The published literature demonstrates a consistent decrease in response rate when investigator assessed response rates are verified by independent radiology review. (see Table 2 in Ford et al. European Journal of Cancer 45 (2009) 268  274). We have not yet undertaken the independent radiology review process for larotrectinib.
 
We expect to report top-line data for the NDA dataset, i.e. overall response rate as measured by independent radiology review, in the second half of 2017, as informed by future interactions with regulatory authorities.  We expect to submit an NDA in late 2017 or early 2018, and a European Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) in 2018.
 
We intend to submit for approval for the same indication statement upon which the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for larotrectinib: for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with NTRK-fusion proteins in adult and pediatric patients who require systemic therapy and who have either progressed following prior treatment or who have no acceptable alternative treatments. However, we can make no assurances that the FDA will grant us approval for the indication that we are seeking, or at all.
 
Commercial Opportunity. As we approach an NDA submission, we have learned more about the patient opportunity for larotrectinib. As discussed in the December 19, 2016, program update, in addition to evidence from the literature, we have worked closely with tumor banks, third party labs, and various assay technology partners to better understand TRK fusion frequency and how to improve testing sensitivity. Our work required certain assumptions based on detection assays with known limitations with regard to sensitivity (i.e. ability to detect TRK fusions that truly exist) and specificity (i.e. ability to detect only TRK fusions). In light of these assay limitations, we provided an estimated range of patient numbers for TRK fusion cancers, which in the United States is 1,500 to
 
9




5,000 late-line eligible patients each year. We also believe there are similar numbers of patients in the large European countries and Japan relative to those population sizes, as has been shown for other targeted therapies.
 
The patient opportunity numbers we cite above reflect our best understanding of the peak addressable opportunity for larotrectinib. However, as patients with NTRK fusions must be identified in practice if they are to receive larotrectinib, two factors relating to the diagnostics market must continue to evolve for the full realization of the commercial potential of the drug.  First, the diagnostic tools themselves must continue to demonstrate improving sensitivity for NTRK fusions.  Available assays, especially those depending on next-generation sequencing, are imperfectly sensitive, but improving.  Second, patients need better access to high quality diagnostic tests with the ability to comprehensively characterize the biology of their tumors.  In large part, patient access is a byproduct of lab reimbursementwhen financial incentives exist that encourage or discourage testing, testing volumes change accordingly.  We believe that both assay sensitivity and patient access are improving and will continue to improve. The rate at which these trends evolve is key to finding the 1,500 to 5,000 patients who we believe exist each year in the United States. Our pre-launch preparations are therefore highly focused on the diagnostics and pathology lab communities.
 
Preclinical Product Pipeline
 
LOXO-195
 
LOXO-195 is a drug candidate in preclinical development.  It was designed as a second-generation TRK inhibitor intended to address predicted acquired resistance mechanisms resulting from therapy with a first-generation TRK inhibitor such as larotrectinib, or multikinase inhibitors with significant anti-TRK activity.  In preclinical models, LOXO-195 appears to be particularly active against so-called solvent front mutations, which are a class of structural mutations that have been described in the literature as relevant to TRK acquired resistance, but also ALK and ROS1 acquired resistance.  Given the limited clinical experience with TRK inhibitors, and the preliminary nature of the research describing mechanisms of acquired resistance in TRK fusion cancers, it is reassuring to see that solvent front mutations are predicted, as these are clinically relevant in the setting of ALK and ROS1 inhibition as well.  Solvent front mutations often require novel medicinal chemistry solutions, and LOXO-195 represents a structurally diverse solution to this mechanism of acquired resistance.  With the LOXO-195 program, we hope to offer certain patients who progress on larotrectinib or other agents an opportunity to extend their time of durable disease control.
 
We presented preclinical data at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium in December 2016 in Munich, Germany on our LOXO-195 preclinical program.  In preclinical models, LOXO-195 demonstrated potent and selective inhibition of solvent front mutations, as well as other predicted resistance mutations reported in recent literature to date. LOXO-195 also exhibited favorable preclinical in vivo properties in relevant in vivo models.
 
We expect to submit an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application prior to initiating a LOXO-195 Phase 1 study in mid-2017. Initial clinical data may be available for this program as early as the end of 2017.
 
LOXO-292
 
LOXO-292 is a drug candidate in preclinical development.  It targets a cancer oncogene known as Rearranged during Transfection, or RET. In normal physiology, RET is a tyrosine kinase receptor that binds the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) ligand family, a signaling pathway important to the development of the nervous system and kidneys.  In cancer, activating fusions and mutations in RET have been identified across a range of cancer types, including lung, thyroid, breast and colon cancers. There are multiple peer-reviewed articles of patients with RET gene alterations demonstrating preliminary anti-tumor activity in experimental trials of multikinase inhibitors with anti-RET activity. We are designing a highly specific RET inhibitor that is intended to optimize on-target potency for RET fusions, activating mutations, and anticipated mechanisms of acquired resistance in these settings.
 
RET fusions account for approximately 2% of non-small cell lung cancer. RET fusions also account for 10-20% of papillary thyroid cancer, and may be found in other tumors such as colon cancer, where prevalence is not well understood. RET mutations account for approximately 60% of medullary thyroid cancer.  Based on literature reports, we estimate that in lung and thyroid cancers, there are approximately 5,000 late-line eligible patients per year in the United States who might benefit from a targeted RET inhibitor such as LOXO-292.
 
We presented preclinical data at the EORTC-NCI-AACR Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics Symposium in December 2016 in Munich, Germany on our LOXO-292 preclinical program. LOXO-292 demonstrated RET potency in enzyme and cellular assays with minimal activity against highly related kinases and other off-targets. Preclinically, in vivo, LOXO-292
 
10




demonstrated its ability to drive tumor regressions in relevant RET-driven models, while having minimal effect on body weight, a proxy for toxicity. LOXO-292 also demonstrated potency against many anticipated mechanisms of acquired resistance, both in vitro and in vivo.
 
We expect to submit an IND prior to initiating a LOXO-292 Phase 1 study in early 2017. Initial clinical data may be available for this program as early as the end of 2017.
 
FGFR
 
We are seeking a drug candidate capable of potently inhibiting FGFR isoforms 2 and/ or 3, while sparing isoforms 1 and 4.  There are numerous FGFR1-3 inhibitors that have shown anti-tumor activity in Phase 1-2 human clinical trials, but are associated with significant toxicities that limit dose intensity (see Lewin et al Journal of Clinical Oncology 33 (2015) 3372-3374).  FGFR4 inhibitors are also in clinical development, tend to spare FGFR1-3, target different biologic hypotheses, and are not of interest to Loxo.
 
The FGFR family of receptors consists of four isoforms with tyrosine kinase domains, numbered one through four (1-4), which play important roles in embryonic development and adult angiogenesis, hormone regulation, and renal function. Fusions, point mutations, and gene amplifications in individual isoforms of the FGFR family have been associated with distinct cancer types in patients, and preliminary anti-tumor activity has been demonstrated in genitourinary, lung, and breast cancers in experimental trials of kinase inhibitors with anti-FGFR activity. However, most small molecule FGFR inhibitors are functionally equipotent against isoforms FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3, and are associated with metabolic and systemic toxicities that limit dose, duration of therapy and target engagement.
 
We presented preclinical data at the AACR-NCI-EORTC International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics meeting in November 2015 in Boston, MA on our FGFR preclinical program.  Data for our potent and selective FGFR inhibitor tool compounds show a relative sparing of FGFR1, while exhibiting high oral bioavailability and favorable PK properties in animal models.
 
Array Collaboration
 
Overview.  On July 3, 2013, we entered into a Drug Discovery Collaboration Agreement with Array (Array Agreement) which was subsequently amended on November 26, 2013, April 10, 2014, October 13, 2014, March 31, 2015 and February 18, 2016. Pursuant to the Array Agreement, Array agreed to design, conduct and perform research and preclinical testing for certain compounds that we select, including larotrectinib, targeting TRKA, TRKB and TRKC, identify IND candidates for TRK and other targets, and undertake manufacturing activities sufficient to conduct Phase 1 clinical studies for a subset of these compounds. Array granted us exclusive licenses worldwide for clinical and commercial development of compounds that inhibit a defined number of targets. The Array Agreement also contains mechanisms for the replacement of a discovery program by substituting a new target for a target for which discovery activities were discontinued. As consideration, Array received or receives 1) shares of our capital stock; 2) ongoing cash payments proportionate to Arrays commitment of full-time equivalents to conduct preclinical research for our programs during a discovery research phase through July 2016, which we may extend for up to two additional one-year periods; 3) payments for certain other costs and research requirements related to the targets; 4) milestone payments of up to approximately (i) $223 million with respect to products related to TRK, including larotrectinib and its backup compounds, and (ii) $213 million with respect to product candidates directed to targets other than TRK, if certain clinical and sales milestones are achieved; and 5) single-digit royalties on sales of any resulting drugs.
 
In the October 2014 amendment to the Array Agreement, in addition to larotrectinib, the parties designated 12 discovery targets, of which seven were selected for additional study in January 2015, which was to be reduced to four on or before January 2016. The October 2014 amendment also created mechanisms through which Array and Loxo could evaluate additional targets outside of the named targets to implement the originally contemplated potential substitution of one or more of the named targets. We had the option to maintain the total target number at five for an additional payment, and we exercised this option to maintain five discovery programs in January 2016. In the October 2014 and March 2015 amendments to the Array Agreement, Loxo agreed to provide additional headcount support for Arrays research activities on our agreed-upon targets.
 
In the February 2016 amendment to the Array Agreement, Loxo agreed to continue to support increased headcount for an additional interim period. Additionally, the parties extended the agreement term through September 30, 2017, with Loxo retaining an option to extend the term for up to one additional year. Also in the February 2016 amendment, the parties increased the discovery program list from five to six targets by adding a new target that was not previously worked on by either party, and further refined the original mechanism through which Array and Loxo could evaluate additional targets outside of the named targets for potential substitution with one or more of the named targets. Lastly, the February 2016 amendment allowed Array to be eligible for milestones
 
11




and royalties on any back-up compounds developed through the collaboration. This amendment also included an additional payment from Loxo to Array, satisfying an obligation of the April 2014 amendment.
 
Loxo and Array jointly own the intellectual property developed by the combined efforts of both our employees, and we each retain ownership of intellectual property that we develop independently pursuant to the collaboration. Array has granted us an exclusive license under all of Arrays intellectual property rights, including intellectual property rights developed in the collaboration, to research, develop and commercialize products resulting from the collaboration.
 
In October 2014, Array notified us in writing that it planned to begin substantial negotiations with third parties regarding the development and/or commercialization of compounds that selectively modulate TRKA for oncology indications. That notification triggered a 90-day period whereby we had the right to discuss the terms and conditions under which Array would grant such rights to us. This period has expired and Array is free to negotiate with, and grant such rights to, a third-party.
 
Governance.  Our collaboration with Array is guided by a joint research committee (JRC). Decisions of the JRC are made by majority vote. If the votes required to approve a decision cannot be reached within the JRC, we have the deciding vote except with respect to matters that would cause Array to violate any obligation or agreement it may have with a third-party or unilaterally impose on Array any financial obligation that is beyond the scope of Arrays obligation under the Array Agreement.
Exclusivity Restrictions.  Subject to exceptions specified in the Array Agreement, for so long as we have an active research or development program for a target selected by us or are commercializing a product for such a target, Array may not research, develop, manufacture or commercialize any product comprising a small molecule, whose primary mechanism of action for therapeutic or prophylactic effect, binds to or modulates the activity of such target, or binds or modulates at least two of TRKA, TRKB or TRKC. For any target added to the Array Agreement after the February 2016 amendment, whether by substitution or otherwise, Array may not conduct discovery research with respect to a product comprising a small molecule that, as a primary mechanism of action for therapeutic or prophylactic effect, binds to or modulates the activity of such target.
Term and Termination.  The Array Agreement expires on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis on the date of the expiration of the applicable royalty term with respect to each licensed product in each country and in its entirety upon the expiration of all applicable royalty terms for all licensed products in all countries. The royalty term for each licensed product in each country is the period commencing with first commercial sale of the applicable licensed product in the applicable country and ending on the latest of (i) ten years following the date of the first commercial sale in the country and (ii) expiration of the last to expire of any patent specified by the Array Agreement that includes at least one valid claim covering the manufacture, use or sale of such product in such country. Following expiration of the Array Agreement, we will have a perpetual, fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to conduct research, develop and commercialize the products developed under the Array Agreement.
 
The Array Agreement may be terminated by either party upon the failure of the other party to cure any material breach of its obligations under the Agreement, provided that, so long as we are reasonably able to pay our debts as they are due, in the event of our breach after expiration of the discovery research phase, Array will only be entitled to seek monetary damages and will not have the right to terminate the Array Agreement. We also have the right to terminate the Array Agreement or to terminate discovery research with respect to any compounds under development on six months notice to Array. If we terminate the Array Agreement for convenience, all licenses granted to us will terminate and Array will receive a license under any intellectual property rights generated by Loxo under the collaboration to further develop and commercialize the licensed programs. If we terminate the Array Agreement as a result of Arrays uncured breach, then the licenses granted by Array would continue and we would remain obligated to pay the milestone and royalty payments. For each specific compound for which we terminate research and development activities before the expiration of the research discovery phase, all licenses granted to us directed at that abandoned compound will concurrently terminate and Array will receive a license under any intellectual property rights generated by Loxo under the collaboration to further develop and commercialize such abandoned compound. We and Array have each also agreed to indemnify the other party for breaches of representations and warranties under the Array Agreement, and we have agreed to indemnify Array against any claims relating to personal injury or death resulting from a compound developed, manufactured, used, sold or otherwise distributed under the Array Agreement.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property is critical to our business and we strive to protect it, through the use of trade secrets and by seeking and maintaining patent protection in the U.S. and internationally for our product candidates, back-up compounds, and other inventions that are important to our business. For our product candidates, we generally strive for patent protection covering both composition of matter and methods of use. As more fully described below, we have an exclusive license from Array to issued composition of matter and method of use patents covering larotrectinib that expire in 2029, without taking into account any applicable extensions.
 
12




We work with Array to patent joint and/or exclusively licensed inventions in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, during the development of our product candidates, we may pursue patent protection to potentially enhance commercial success, such as method of use, formulation, treatment regimens, methods of making, synthetic intermediates, polymorphs, or other patent claims. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our discovery programs and product candidates, and seek to protect and maintain the confidentiality of proprietary information to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
 
The patent positions of biotechnology companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Consequently, we may not obtain or maintain adequate patent protection for any of our product candidates. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
 
Our patent portfolio includes patents and patent applications we exclusively licensed from Array, as well as exclusive worldwide licenses for all therapeutic indications for new intellectual property developed in our Loxo/Array discovery programs. This patent portfolio includes issued patents and pending patent applications covering compositions of matter, methods of use, methods of making, and synthetic intermediates.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
 
The patent portfolio for larotrectinib and a next-generation selective TRK inhibitor for activity against acquired anti-TRK resistance, LOXO-195 is summarized below.
 
Larotrectinibs patent portfolio includes patents exclusively licensed to us by Array for our product candidates on a worldwide basis for all therapeutic indications. Composition of matter patents for larotrectinib is/are issued in the U.S., Hong Kong, New Zealand, Australia, Bosnia, Chile, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Indonesia, China, Columbia, Japan, Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine, the Philippines, and Europe (which has been validated in all member and extension states). The issued U.S. and European patents expire in 2029, not taking into account any applicable extensions for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdictions. The larotrectinib patent portfolio also includes pending U.S. and foreign applications related to methods of use for larotrectinib, composition of matter and methods of use for larotrectinib, and composition of matter and methods of use for other compounds. We have licensed three other patent families that cover our next-generation selective TRK inhibitor program, including those that have activity against various mechanisms of acquired resistance to TRK inhibition. We have issued patents in Australia, the EPO (validated in Austria, Switzerland, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Italy, Sweden, and Turkey), Chile, China, Columbia, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine, and the U.S. providing composition of matter and method of use coverage for one back-up with activity against acquired resistance to anti-TRK therapies, LOXO-195, with allowed cases in China and Ukraine. The issued patents expire in 2031, not taking into account any applicable extensions for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdiction.
 
We have pending patent applications directed to compositions of matter, methods of use, methods of making, and synthetic intermediates for both our LOXO-292 and FGFR programs, which, should the patents issue, will have a term to 2036, absent other term extensions that might be available for patent office and/or regulatory delay in the relevant jurisdiction.
 
In the U.S., the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during FDA regulatory review process. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (the Hatch-Waxman Act) permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We plan to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including FDA in the U.S., will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and if granted, the length of such extensions.
 
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, including through contractual means with our employees and consultants, third parties may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or 
 
13




disclose our technology. Thus, we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets. It is our policy to require our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individuals relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees, the agreements provide that all inventions conceived by the individual shall be our exclusive property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
 
Competition
 
Our industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face substantial competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop, license or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.
 
We face competition with respect to our current product candidates, and will face competition with respect to future product candidates, from segments of the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that pursue targeted approaches to addressing activating molecular alterations in cancer. While there are currently no approved drugs targeting TRK, we are aware of a number of TRK RTK inhibitors, including Daiichi Sankyo and its subsidiary Plexxikons PLX-7486 and DS-6051b, Ignytas entrectinib, Novartis AGs dovitinib, Miratis MGCD516 and Ono Pharmaceuticals ONO-4474. We are also aware of preclinical programs from Blueprint Medicines, TP Therapeutics, Chugai Pharmaceutical and Ono Pharmaceutical. In addition, our collaboration partner, Array, has retained rights to development of compounds that target only one of the TRKA, TRKB or TRKC kinases, which if developed by Array or a licensee could be competitively significant. However, if larotrectinib or our future product candidates do not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may otherwise not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.
 
While there are no selective RET inhibitors approved in RET-specific indications, we are aware of the following compounds with ongoing RET-focused programs: Eisai (lenvatinib), Exelixis (cabozantinib), AstraZeneca (vandetanib), Pfizer (sunitinib), Ariad (ponatinib), Novartis (dovitinib), Roche (alectinib), Blueprint Medicines (BLU-667), Ignyta (RXDX-105) and Mirati (MGCD516).
 
While there are no approved selective FGFR inhibitors, we are aware of the following compounds with ongoing FGFR-focused programs: J&J (JNJ-42756493), Novartis (BGJ-398, dovitinib), AstraZeneca (AZD4547), Clovis Oncology (lucitinib), Chugai (CH5183284), Bayer (BAY 1163877, BAY 1179470), Lilly (LY2874455), Eisai (E7090), Taiho (TAS-120), BI (nintedanib), Ariad (ponatinib), FivePrime (FP-1039, FPA144), Incyte (INCB54828), ArQule (ARQ087), BioClinica (MFGR1877S), Principia (PRN1371) and Blueprint Medicines (BLU-554).
 
Our competitors may obtain regulatory approval of their products more rapidly than we may or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop drugs that are more effective, more convenient, more widely used and less costly or have a better safety profile than our products and these competitors may also be more successful than us in manufacturing and marketing their products.
 
In addition, we will need to develop our product candidates in collaboration with diagnostic companies, and we will face competition from other companies in establishing these collaborations. Our competitors will also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, management and commercial personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
 
Furthermore, we also face competition more broadly across the market for cost-effective and reimbursable cancer treatments. The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy, including chemotherapy, hormone therapy and targeted drug therapy or a combination of such methods. There are a variety of available drug therapies marketed for cancer. In many cases, these drugs are administered in combination to enhance efficacy. While our product candidates, if any are approved, may compete with these existing drug and other therapies, to the extent they are ultimately used in combination with or as an adjunct to these therapies, our product candidates may not be competitive with them. Some of these drugs are branded and subject to patent protection, and others are available on a generic basis. Insurers and other third-party payers may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. As a result, obtaining market acceptance of, and a gaining significant share of the market for, any of our product candidates that we successfully introduce to the market will pose challenges. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics, and we cannot predict what the standard of care will be as our product candidates progress through clinical development.
 
14




The acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products is also very competitive. If we seek to acquire or license products, we will face substantial competition from a number of more established companies, some of which have acknowledged strategies to license or acquire products and many of which are bigger than us and have more institutional experience and greater cash flows than we have. These more established companies may have competitive advantages over us, as may other emerging companies taking similar or different approaches to product licenses and/or acquisitions. In addition, a number of established research-based pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may acquire products in late stages of development to augment their internal product lines, which may provide those companies with an even greater competitive advantage.
 
Government Regulation
 
FDA Approval Process
 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
 
Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the U.S. typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease.
 
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted.
 
A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin.
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted: (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practices (GCPs), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; as well as (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to FDA as part of the IND.
 
The FDA may order the temporary, or permanent, discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The study protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions.
 
Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into healthy human subjects or patients, the drug is tested to assess metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence of effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular indication, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information

for the labeling of the drug. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible.
 
Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, which was enacted on December 13, 2016, the manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access.  This requirement applies on the later of 60 days after the date of enactment or the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug.
 
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, currently exceeding $2,038,000 for fiscal year 2017, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved new drug application are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees, currently exceeding $97,000 per product and $512,000 per establishment for fiscal year 2017. While, these fees are typically increased annually, they decreased for fiscal year 2017.
 
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of new drug applications to encourage timeliness. Most applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission.
 
The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an outside advisory committeetypically a panel that includes clinicians and other expertsfor review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPsa quality system regulating manufacturing) is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied.
 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included.
 
An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy(REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for a REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drugs safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
 
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs.

Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval
 
The FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a Fast Track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Fast Track Designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request.
 
Under the Fast Track program and the FDAs Accelerated Approval regulations, the FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments.
 
In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions, or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of post- approval clinical trials, often referred to as Phase 4 trials, to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow the FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to priority review by the FDA.
 
If a submission is granted Fast Track Designation, the sponsor may engage in more frequent interactions with the FDA, and the FDA may review sections of the NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and the FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDAs time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, Fast Track Designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process.
 
Breakthrough Therapy Designation
 
The FDA is also required to expedite the development and review of the application for approval of drugs that are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Under the Breakthrough Therapy program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that the FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a breakthrough therapy concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. The FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for Breakthrough Therapy designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request.
Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or conditiongenerally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. Orphan Drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the generic identity of the drug and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. The first NDA applicant to receive the FDA approval for a particular active ingredient to treat a particular disease with FDA Orphan Drug Designation is entitled to a seven-year exclusive marketing period in the U.S. for that product, for that indication. During the seven-year exclusivity period, the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same disease, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving a different drug for the same disease or condition, or the same drug for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of Orphan Drug Designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the NDA application user fee.

Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 
Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, the FDA may award a priority review voucher to the sponsor of an approved NDA for a product that treats or prevents a rare pediatric disease.  The voucher entitles the sponsor to priority review of one subsequent marketing application.
 
A voucher may be awarded only for an approved rare pediatric disease product application.  A rare pediatric disease product application is an NDA for a product that treats or prevents a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years. In general, the disease must affect fewer than 200,000 such individuals in the U.S. In addition, certain other conditions must be met, including the following: the NDA must be deemed eligible for priority review, the NDA must not seek approval for a different adult indication (i.e., for a different disease/condition), the product must not contain an active ingredient that has been previously approved by the FDA, and the NDA must rely on clinical data derived from studies examining a pediatric population such that the approved product can be adequately labeled for the pediatric population.  Before NDA approval, the FDA may designate a product in development as a product for a rare pediatric disease, but such designation is not required to receive a voucher.
 
To receive a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher, a sponsor must notify the FDA, upon submission of the NDA, of its intent to request a voucher.  If the FDA determines that the NDA is a rare pediatric disease product application, and if the NDA is approved, the FDA will award the sponsor of the NDA a voucher upon approval of the NDA.  The FDA may revoke a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher if the product for which it was awarded is not marketed in the U.S. within 365 days of the products approval.
 
The voucher, which is transferable to another sponsor, may be submitted with a subsequent NDA and entitles the holder to priority review of the accompanying NDA.  The sponsor submitting the priority review voucher must notify the FDA of its intent to submit the voucher with the NDA at least 90 days prior to submission of the NDA and must pay a priority review user fee in addition to any other required user fee ($2,706,000 in fiscal year 2017).  As with all priority reviews, the FDA will generally take action on an NDA for a new molecular entity within six months of filing the NDA or, for an NDA that is not for a new molecular entity, within six months of receipt of the NDA.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling.
 
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports are required following the FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS, and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the Agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered.
 
Pediatric Information
 
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
 
The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivitypatent or non-patentfor a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDAs determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, the FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers.

FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 
Our drug products may rely upon in vitro companion diagnostics for use in selecting the patients that we believe will respond to our cancer therapeutics. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that the FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA may alternatively approve the therapeutic product with the expectation that the diagnostic will subsequently be submitted for clearance or approval, such as when the therapeutic product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition for which no satisfactory alternative treatment exists and the benefits from the use of the therapeutic product are so pronounced as to outweigh the risks from the lack of an approved or cleared diagnostic. Companion diagnostics may have both regulatory and commercial importance for our cancer therapies.
 
Pursuing FDA approval of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require us to obtain a pre-market approval (PMA) for that diagnostic. Based on a final FDA guidance document, and the FDAs past treatment of companion diagnostics, we believe that the FDA will require PMA approval of one or more in vitro companion diagnostics to identify patient populations suitable for our cancer therapies. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics involves coordination of review by the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the devices safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $234,000 for most PMAs for fiscal year 2017. In addition, PMAs for devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR), which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements.
 
PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay or prevent approval. If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicants agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution.
 
After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturers manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the U.S.
 
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of current or future products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, denial of submissions for new products, or withdrawal of PMA approvals.
 
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
 
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs.

Foreign Regulation
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates to the extent we choose to sell any products outside of the U.S. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval of a product by regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. As in the U.S., post-approval regulatory requirements, such as those regarding product manufacture, marketing, or distribution would apply to any product that is approved outside the U.S.
Manufacturing
 
We do not have any manufacturing facilities or personnel. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates undergoing preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. Array has manufactured the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product for larotrectinib for Phase 1 clinical testing. We have identified, qualified and begun manufacturing with other manufacturer(s) to provide the active pharmaceutical ingredient and fill-and-finish services for larotrectinib, which can support the development of larotrectinib as it progresses through clinical development towards a potential regulatory approval, and future commercialization.
 
All of our drug candidates are small molecules and are manufactured in synthetic processes from available starting materials. The chemistry appears amenable to scale up and does not currently require unusual equipment in the manufacturing process. We expect to continue to develop product candidates that can be produced cost-effectively at contract manufacturing facilities.
 
We expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of our companion diagnostics. Depending on the technology solutions we choose, we may rely on multiple third parties to manufacture and sell a single test. For example, we may develop analyte specific reagents with one vendor, rely on another vendor for qualification and assembly in a finished in vitro diagnostic kit and rely on additional third parties for distribution and/or commercialization.
 
Commercialization
 
Subject to receiving marketing approvals, we expect to commence commercialization activities by building a focused sales and marketing organization in the U.S. to sell our products. We believe that such an organization will be able to address the community of oncologists and pathologists who are the key specialists in diagnosing and treating the patient populations for which our product candidates are being developed. Outside the U.S., we plan to strategically evaluate building our own commercial organization, as well as commercial partnership opportunities for any of our product candidates that obtain marketing approval.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of 29 full-time employees, all located in the U.S. None of our employees is represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good. Of the 29 employees, 21 perform research and development activities and 8 serve in general and administrative functions.
