Item 1. Business
General
 
Our principal business is managing investment funds and providing investment management and advisory services to high-net-worth individuals and institutions. Our core strategy is to develop and sustain management expertise across a range of investment disciplines and to offer leading investment products and services through multiple distribution channels. In executing this strategy, we have developed broadly diversified investment management capabilities and a highly functional marketing, distribution and customer service organization. We measure our success as a Company based on investment performance delivered, reputation in the marketplace, progress achieving strategic objectives, employee development and satisfaction, business and financial results, and shareholder value created.
 
We conduct our investment management and advisory business through wholly- and majority-owned investment affiliates, which include: Eaton Vance Management, Parametric Portfolio Associates LLC (Parametric), Atlanta Capital Management Company, LLC (Atlanta Capital) and Calvert Research and Management (Calvert). We also offer investment management advisory services through minority-owned Hexavest Inc. (Hexavest).
 
Through Eaton Vance Management, Atlanta Capital, Calvert and other affiliates, we manage active equity, income and alternative strategies across a range of investment styles and asset classes, including U.S. and global equities, floating-rate bank loans, municipal bonds, global income, high-yield and investment grade bonds. Through Parametric, we manage a range of engineered alpha strategies, including systematic equity, systematic alternatives and managed options strategies. Through Parametric, we also provide portfolio implementation and overlay services, including tax-managed and non-tax-managed Custom Core equity strategies, centralized portfolio management of multi-manager portfolios and customized exposure management services. We also oversee the management of, and distribute, investment funds sub-advised by

unaffiliated third-party managers, including global, emerging market and regional equity and asset allocation strategies.
 
Our breadth of investment management capabilities supports a wide range of products and services offered to fund shareholders, retail managed account investors, institutional investors and high-net-worth clients. Our equity strategies encompass a diversity of investment objectives, risk profiles, income levels and geographic representation. Our income investment strategies cover a broad duration, geographic representation and credit quality range and encompass both taxable and tax-free investments. We also offer a range of alternative investment strategies, including commodity- and currency-based investments and a spectrum of absolute return strategies. Although we manage and distribute a wide range of investment products and services, we operate in one business segment, namely as an investment adviser to funds and separate accounts. As of October 31, 2017, we had $422.3 billion in consolidated assets under management.
 
We distribute our funds and retail managed accounts principally through financial intermediaries. We have broad market reach, with distribution partners including national and regional broker-dealers, independent broker-dealers, registered investment advisors, banks and insurance companies. We support these distribution partners with a team of approximately 120 sales professionals covering U.S. and international markets.
 
We also commit significant resources to serving institutional and high-net-worth clients who access investment management services on a direct basis and through investment consultants. Through our wholly- and majority-owned affiliates and consolidated subsidiaries, we manage investments for a broad range of clients in the institutional and high-net-worth marketplace in the U.S. and internationally, including corporations, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, foundations, family offices and public and private employee retirement plans.
 
Company History
 
We have been in the investment management business for over 90 years, tracing our history to two Boston-based investment managers: Eaton & Howard, formed in 1924, and Vance, Sanders & Company, organized in 1934. Eaton & Howard, Vance Sanders, Inc. (renamed Eaton Vance Management, Inc. in June 1984 and reorganized as Eaton Vance Management in October 1990) was formed upon the acquisition of Eaton & Howard, Incorporated by Vance, Sanders & Company, Inc. on April 30, 1979. Following the 1979 merger of these predecessor organizations to form Eaton Vance, our managed assets consisted primarily of open-end mutual funds marketed to U.S. retail investors under the Eaton Vance brand and investment counsel services offered directly to high-net-worth and institutional investors. Over the ensuing years, we have expanded our product and distribution efforts to include closed-end, private and offshore funds, retail managed accounts, a broad array of investment strategies and services for institutional and high-net-worth investors, and, most recently, NextSharesTM exchange-traded managed funds (NextShares).
 
Our long-term growth strategy focuses on developing and growing market-leading investment franchises and expanding our product distribution reach into new channels and geographic markets. The development of leading investment franchises may be achieved either organically or through acquisitions. Recent strategic acquisitions include the purchase of substantially all of the business assets of Calvert Investment Management, Inc. (Calvert Investments) in December 2016, Parametric’s fiscal 2013 purchase of The Clifton Group Investment Management Company (Clifton), and our fiscal 2012 purchase of a 49 percent interest in Hexavest.
 
On December 30, 2016, Calvert, a newly formed Eaton Vance subsidiary, completed the purchase of substantially all of the business assets of Calvert Investments. Founded in 1976, Calvert Investments became a pioneer in responsible investing in 1982 by launching the first mutual fund to avoid investing in companies

doing business in apartheid-era South Africa. At acquisition, Calvert had $11.9 billion of assets under management. Of this, $2.1 billion was previously included in the Company’s consolidated managed assets because Atlanta Capital is sub-adviser to one of the Calvert-sponsored mutual funds (Calvert Funds). The total managed assets of Calvert, including assets sub-advised by other Eaton Vance affiliates, have grown to $12.9 billion at October 31, 2017.
 
The fiscal 2012 purchase of Clifton, which now operates as Parametric’s Minneapolis investment center, provided Parametric with a market-leading position in futures- and options-based portfolio implementation services and risk-management strategies. Managed assets of Parametric’s Minneapolis investment center have grown from $34.8 billion at purchase in December 2012 to $98.3 billion on October 31, 2017.
 
In fiscal 2012, we expanded our global equity offerings by acquiring a 49 percent interest in Hexavest, a Montreal-based investment adviser, and became Hexavest’s exclusive distribution partner in all markets outside Canada. Hexavest’s assets under management have grown from $11.0 billion at purchase in August 2012 to $16.0 billion on October 31, 2017.

Recent Developments
 
We are pursuing five primary strategic priorities to support our long-term growth. Those priorities are: (1) capitalizing on our investment performance leadership and distribution strengths to grow sales and gain market share in actively managed investment strategies; (2) extending the success we have had with our Custom Beta lineup of rules-based separately managed accounts; (3) becoming a more global company by building our investment and distribution capabilities outside the United States; (4) positioning NextShares to become the vehicle of choice for investors in actively managed funds in the U.S; and (5) leveraging our Calvert acquisition to lead the growth of responsible investing;.
 
As of October 31, 2017, we had 68 U.S. mutual funds rated four or five stars by Morningstar™ for at least one class of shares, including 30 funds rated five stars for at least one class of shares. Although actively managed strategies as a whole are losing share to passive investments, we believe that top-performing active strategies can continue to grow, particularly in asset classes where the competition versus passive alternatives is less acute. In fiscal 2017, net flows into our active strategies totaled $9.3 billion.
 
In fiscal 2017, we continued to experience strong growth in our Custom Beta strategies, which include the Parametric Custom Core equity and Eaton Vance laddered municipal and corporate bond separate account offerings to the retail and high-net-worth markets. Compared to index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, rules-based separately managed accounts can provide clients with greater ability to tailor their market exposures to achieve better tax outcomes and to reflect client-specified responsible investing criteria and desired portfolio tilts and exclusions. In fiscal 2017, net inflows into our Custom Beta strategies offered as retail managed accounts and high-net-worth separate accounts totaled $17.9 billion.
 
Outside the United States, the Company continues to expand investment staff and commit additional client service and distribution resources to support business growth. On February 1, 2017, Eaton Vance Asia Pacific opened a Tokyo-based representative office to provide relationship management and client service support to clients in Japan and other parts of Asia. In fiscal 2017, the Company’s net inflows from clients outside the United States totaled $5.1 billion.
 
Over the past several years, the Company has committed significant resources toward achieving commercial success of its NextShares fund structure. In fiscal 2017, NextShares continued to progress toward broad market availability. As of the end of fiscal 2017, eight NextShares funds from three different fund families were available in the marketplace. On November 20, 2017, together with UBS Financial Services Inc., we announced the availability of NextShares through the UBS brokerage platforms and UBS Strategic Advisor, a non-discretionary advisory program, which the Company believes will stimulate growth in NextShares managed assets beginning in fiscal 2018.
 
On December 30, 2016, we completed the purchase of substantially all of the business assets of Calvert Investments. The Calvert Funds are one of the largest and most diversified families of responsibly invested mutual funds, encompassing actively and passively managed equity, fixed income and asset allocation strategies managed in accordance with the Calvert Principles for Responsible Investment (Calvert Principles) or other responsible investment criteria. Responsible investing is a leading trend in asset management, appealing to the growing universe of investors who seek both financial returns and positive societal impact from their investments. The Calvert Funds are now being offered through EVD, with greatly expanded market reach.
 
In developments related to Hexavest, Eaton Vance has elected to maintain the Company’s ownership interest at 49 percent. On December 11, 2017, we notified the employee-owners of Hexavest that we would not be

exercising our option to purchase an additional 26 percent interest under the terms of the option agreement entered into when we acquired our Hexavest position in 2012. After careful review, we concluded that Hexavest’s current ownership and governance model are most conducive to their business and investment success at this time. We will continue to work with Hexavest as a major shareholder and as Hexavest’s exclusive distribution partner for non-Canadian markets.

Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Hexavest and unaffiliated advisory firms act as sub-adviser to Eaton Vance Management, BMR or Calvert for certain funds.
 
Eaton Vance Management provides administrative services, including personnel and facilities, necessary for the operation of all Eaton Vance- and Parametric-branded funds, and Calvert provides such services for the Calvert Funds, subject to the oversight of each fund’s board of trustees. These services are provided under comprehensive management agreements with certain funds that also include investment advisory services and through separate administrative services agreements with other funds as discussed below. Administrative services include recordkeeping, preparing and filing documents required to comply with federal and state securities laws, legal, fund administration and compliance services, supervising the activities of the funds’ custodians and transfer agents, providing assistance in connection with the funds’ shareholder meetings and other administrative services, including providing office space and office facilities, equipment and personnel that may be necessary for managing and administering the business affairs of the funds. Each agreement remains in effect indefinitely, subject, in the case of Registered Funds, to annual approval by each fund’s board of trustees. The funds generally bear all expenses associated with their operation and the issuance and redemption or repurchase of their securities, except for the compensation of trustees and officers of the fund who are employed by us. Under some circumstances, particularly in connection with the introduction of new funds, Eaton Vance Management, BMR or Calvert may waive a portion of its management fee and/or pay some expenses of the fund.
 
For Registered Funds, a majority of the independent trustees (i.e., those unaffiliated with us or any adviser controlled by us and deemed non-interested under the 1940 Act) must review and approve the investment advisory and administrative agreements annually. The fund trustees generally may terminate these agreements upon 30 to 60 days’ notice without penalty. Shareholders of Registered Funds generally must approve amendments to the investment advisory agreements.
 
Eaton Vance Management has entered into an investment advisory and administrative agreement with The U.S. Charitable Gift Trust. In addition, The U.S. Charitable Gift Trust and its pooled income funds have

distribution agreements with EVD that provide for reimbursement of the costs of fundraising and servicing donor accounts.
 
Either Eaton Vance Management, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert, BMR or EVIC has entered into an investment advisory agreement for each separately managed account and retail managed account program that sets forth the account’s investment objectives and fee schedule, and provides for management of assets in the account in accordance with the stated investment objectives. Our separate account portfolio managers may assist clients in formulating investment strategies.
 
EVTC is the trustee for each collective investment trust and is responsible for designing and implementing each trust’s investment program or overseeing sub-advisers managing each trust’s investment portfolio. As trustee, EVTC also provides certain administrative and accounting services to each trust. For services provided under each trust’s declaration of trust, EVTC receives a monthly fee based on the average daily net assets of the trust.
 
Investment counselors and separate account portfolio managers employed by our subsidiaries make investment decisions for the separate accounts we manage, tailoring portfolios to the needs of particular clients. We generally receive investment advisory fees for separate accounts quarterly, based on the value of the assets managed on a particular date, such as the first or last calendar day of a quarter, or, in some instances, on the average assets for the period. These advisory contracts are generally terminable upon 30 to 60 days’ notice without penalty.

Marketing and Distribution of Investment Products
 
We market and distribute shares of Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded funds domestically through EVD. EVD sells fund shares through a network of financial intermediaries, including national and regional broker-dealers, banks, registered investment advisors, insurance companies and financial planning firms. The Eaton Vance International (Ireland) Funds Plc. are Undertakings for Collective Investments in Transferable Securities (UCITS) funds domiciled in Ireland and sold by EVMI through certain intermediaries, and in some cases directly, to investors who are citizens of the United Kingdom, member nations of the European Union and other countries outside the United States. The Eaton Vance International (Cayman Islands) Funds are Cayman Island-domiciled funds sold by EVD and EVMI through intermediaries to non-U.S. investors.
 
Although the firms in our domestic retail distribution network have each entered into selling agreements with EVD, these agreements (which generally are terminable by either party) do not legally obligate the firms to sell any specific amount of our investment products. EVD currently maintains a sales force of approximately 120 external

and internal wholesalers who work closely with financial advisors in the retail distribution network to assist in placing Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded funds.
 
Certain sponsored mutual funds have adopted distribution plans as permitted by the 1940 Act that provide for the fund to pay EVD distribution fees for the sale and distribution of shares and service fees for personal and/or shareholder account services (12b-1 fees). Each distribution plan and distribution agreement with EVD for the Registered Funds is initially approved and its subsequent continuance must be approved annually by the board of trustees of the respective funds, including a majority of the independent trustees.
 
EVD makes payments to financial intermediaries that provide marketing support, shareholder recordkeeping and transaction processing, and/or administrative services to the Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded mutual funds and, in some cases, include some or all of our funds in preferred or specialized selling programs. Payments are typically based on fund net assets, fund sales and/or number of accounts attributable to that financial intermediary. Registered Funds may pay all or a portion of shareholder recordkeeping and transaction processing and/or administrative services provided to their shareholders. Financial intermediaries also may receive payments from EVD in connection with educational or due diligence meetings that include information concerning our funds.
 
EVD currently sells Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded mutual funds under six primary pricing structures: front-end load commission (Class A); level-load commission (Class C); Calvert Variable Products, Inc. pricing (Class F); institutional no-load (Class I, Class R6, Class Y and Institutional Class, referred to herein as Class I); retail no-load (Investor Class and Advisers Class, referred to herein as Class N); and retirement plan level-load (Class R).
 
For Class A shares, the shareholder may be required to pay a sales charge to the selling broker-dealer of up to five percent and an underwriting commission to EVD of up to 75 basis points of the dollar value of the shares sold. Under certain conditions, we waive the sales load on Class A shares and the shares are sold at net asset value. EVD generally receives (and then pays to authorized firms after one year) a distribution and service fee of up to 30 basis points of average net assets annually on Class A shares. In recent years, a growing percentage of the Company’s sales of Class A shares have been made on a load-waived basis through various fee-based programs. EVD does not receive underwriting commissions on such sales.
 
For Class C shares, the shareholder pays no front-end commissions but may be subject to a contingent deferred sales charge on redemptions made within the first twelve months of purchase. EVD pays a commission and the projected first year service fees to the dealer at the time of sale. The fund makes monthly distribution plan and service fee payments to EVD at an annual rate of up to 75 basis points and 25 basis points, respectively, of average net assets of the Class. EVD retains the distribution and service fees paid to EVD for the first twelve months and pays the distribution and service fees to the dealer after one year.
 
Class I shares are offered at net asset value and are not subject to any sales charges, underwriter commissions, distribution fees or service fees. For designated Class I shares, a minimum investment of $250,000 or higher is normally required. Designated Institutional Class shares are normally subject to a minimum investment of $50,000. Sales of R6 shares are limited to participating retirement plans and certain other investors.
 
Class N shares are offered at net asset value and are not subject to any sales charges or underwriter commissions. EVD receives (and then pays to authorized firms after one year) combined distribution and service fees of 25 basis points of average net assets annually.

Class R shares are offered at net asset value with no front-end sales charge. The Company receives, and then generally pays to dealers, distribution fees of 25 basis points and service fees of 25 basis points of average net assets annually.
 
We also sponsor unregistered equity funds that are privately placed by EVD, as placement agent, and by various sub-agents to whom EVD and the subscribing shareholders make sales commission payments. The privately placed equity funds are managed by Eaton Vance Management and BMR.
 
The marketing and distribution of investment strategies to institutional and high-net-worth clients is subsidiary-specific. Eaton Vance Management has institutional sales, consultant relations and client service teams dedicated to supporting the U.S. marketing and sales of strategies managed by Eaton Vance Management, Calvert and Hexavest. Hexavest maintains its own marketing and distribution team to service institutional clients in Canada. Parametric and Atlanta Capital each maintain subsidiary-specific marketing and distribution teams to sell their respective investment strategies to U.S.-based institutions and high-net-worth investors. Parametric also maintains a dedicated institutional marketing and distribution team focused on the Australian and New Zealand markets. EVMI is otherwise responsible for the institutional marketing and distribution of all Eaton Vance Management-, Parametric-, Atlanta Capital-, Calvert- and Hexavest-advised strategies to institutions outside of North America.
 
During the fiscal year ended October 31, 2017, there were no customers that provided over 10 percent of our total revenue.
 
Regulation
 
Eaton Vance Management, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert, BMR, EVIC, EVMI and EVAIL are each registered with the SEC under the Advisers Act. The Advisers Act imposes numerous obligations on registered investment advisers, including fiduciary duties, recordkeeping requirements, operational requirements and disclosure obligations. Most Eaton Vance-, Parametric- and Calvert-branded funds are registered with the SEC under the 1940 Act. The 1940 Act imposes additional obligations on fund advisers, including governance, compliance, reporting and fiduciary obligations relating to the management of funds. Except for privately offered funds exempt from registration, each U.S. fund is also required to make notice filings with most states and U.S. territories where it is offered for sale. Virtually all aspects of our investment management business in the U.S. are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations are primarily intended to benefit shareholders of the funds and separate account clients and generally grant supervisory agencies and bodies broad administrative powers, including the power to limit or restrict us from carrying on our investment management business in the event we fail to comply with such laws and regulations. In such event, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on Eaton Vance Management, Parametric, Atlanta Capital, Calvert, BMR, EVIC, EVMI and EVAIL engaging in the investment management business for specified periods of time, the revocation of any such company’s registration as an investment adviser, and other censures or fines.
 
Under a final rule and interpretive guidance issued by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) in April 2012, certain non-bank financial companies have been designated for the Federal Reserve’s supervision as systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). Additional non-bank financial companies, which may include large asset management companies such as us, may be designated as SIFIs in the future. If the Company were designated a SIFI, it would be subject to enhanced prudential measures, which could include capital and liquidity requirements, leverage limits, enhanced public disclosures and risk management requirements, annual stress testing by the Federal Reserve, credit exposure and concentration limits, supervisory and other requirements. These heightened

regulatory obligations could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely impact the Company’s business and operations.
 
Eaton Vance Management, Parametric and BMR are registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) as Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors; other subsidiaries of the Company claim exemptions from registration. In August 2013, the CFTC adopted rules for operators of registered mutual funds that are subject to registration as Commodity Pool Operators generally allowing such commodity pools to comply with SEC disclosure, reporting and recordkeeping rules as the means of complying with CFTC’s similar requirements. These CFTC rules do not, however, relieve registered Commodity Pool Operators from compliance with applicable anti-fraud provisions as well as certain performance reporting and recordkeeping requirements. The Company may incur ongoing costs associated with monitoring compliance with these requirements, including, but not limited to, CFTC and NFA registration and exemption obligations and the periodic reporting requirements of Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors.
 
Our mutual funds, privately offered funds and separate accounts that trade CFTC-regulated instruments are also regulated by the CFTC. In the event that Eaton Vance Management, Parametric or BMR fails to comply with applicable requirements, the CFTC may suspend or revoke its registration, prohibit it from trading or doing business with registered entities, impose civil penalties, require restitution and seek fines or imprisonment for criminal violations. In the event that the Eaton Vance clients that trade CFTC-regulated instruments fail to comply with requirements applicable to their trading, they would be subject to the foregoing remedies excluding suspension of license (provided they are not registered). In addition, to the extent any of the entities trade on a futures exchange or Swap Execution Facility, they would be subject to possible sanction for any violation of the facility’s rules.
 
EVTC is registered as a non-depository Maine Trust Company and is subject to regulation by the State of Maine Bureau of Financial Institutions (Bureau of Financial Institutions). EVTC is subject to certain capital requirements, as determined by the Examination Division of the Bureau of Financial Institutions. At periodic intervals, regulators from the Bureau of Financial Institutions examine the Company’s and EVTC’s financial condition as part of their legally prescribed oversight function. There were no violations by EVTC of these capital requirements in fiscal 2017 or prior years.
 
EVD is registered as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act and is subject to regulation by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), the SEC and other federal and state agencies. EVD is subject to the SEC’s net capital rule designed to enforce minimum standards regarding the general financial condition and liquidity of broker-dealers. Under certain circumstances, this rule may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital and receive dividends from EVD. EVD’s regulatory net capital consistently exceeded minimum net capital requirements during fiscal 2017. The securities industry is one of the most highly regulated in the United States, and failure to comply with related laws and regulations can result in the revocation of broker-dealer licenses, the imposition of censures or fines, and the suspension or expulsion from the securities business of a firm, its officers or employees.
 
EVMI has the permission of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to conduct a regulated business in the United Kingdom. EVMI’s primary business purpose is to distribute our investment products in Europe and certain other international markets. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act of the United Kingdom, EVMI is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements. Such requirements may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVMI. In addition, failure to comply with such requirements could jeopardize EVMI’s approval to conduct business in the United Kingdom. There were no violations by EVMI of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2017 or prior years.

EVAI has the permission of the Central Bank of Ireland to conduct its business of providing management services to the Eaton Vance International (Ireland) Funds Plc. EVAI is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements. Such requirements may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVAI. There were no violations by EVAI of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2017 or prior years.
 
EVMIA has the permission of the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) to conduct a regulated business in Singapore. Under the Monetary Authority of Singapore, EVMIA is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements. Such requirements may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVMIA. There were no violations by EVMIA of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2017 or prior years.
 
EVAIL obtained authorization from the FCA on August 22, 2017 to become a Full Scope Alternative Investment Fund Manager (AIFM). Effective November 1, 2017, EVAIL acts as a sub-investment manager to Alternative Investment Funds (AIFs), Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS), funds registered under the 1940 Act and separately managed accounts. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act of the United Kingdom, EVAIL is subject to certain liquidity and capital requirements. Such requirements may limit our ability to make withdrawals of capital from EVAIL. In addition, failure to comply with such requirements could jeopardize EVAIL’s approval to conduct business in the United Kingdom. There were no violations by EVAIL of the liquidity and capital requirements in fiscal 2017.
 
Our officers, directors and employees may from time to time own securities that are held by one or more of the funds and separate accounts we manage. Our internal policies with respect to individual investments by investment professionals and other employees with access to investment information require prior clearance of most types of transactions and reporting of all securities transactions, and restrict certain transactions to help avoid the possibility of conflicts of interest. All employees are required to comply with all prospectus restrictions and limitations on purchases, sales or exchanges of our mutual fund shares and to pre-clear purchases and sales of shares of our closed-end funds.
 
Geographic Information
 
Certain financial information about the Company’s geographic areas is contained in Note 24 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Competition
 
The investment management business is a highly competitive global industry and we are subject to substantial competition in each of our principal product categories and distribution channels. There are few barriers to entry for new firms and consolidation within the industry continues to alter the competitive landscape. According to the Investment Company Institute, there were approximately 850 investment managers at the end of calendar 2016 that competed in the U.S. mutual fund market. We compete with these firms, many of which have substantially greater resources, on the basis of investment performance, diversity of products, distribution capability, scope and quality of service, fees charged, reputation and the ability to develop new investment strategies and products to meet the changing needs of investors.
 
In recent years, investor demand for passive investment strategies employed by index mutual funds and index exchange-traded funds (ETFs) has outpaced the demand for higher-fee actively-managed investment strategies. Across many asset classes, actively-managed strategies as a whole are experiencing net outflows. While our Custom Beta lineup of rules-based separate managed accounts, Calvert index funds and other passive strategies are positioned to benefit from market demand for passive investment strategies, a large majority of our management fee revenue is derived from active strategies. The continuing shift in market

demand toward index funds and other passive strategies reduces opportunities for active managers and may accelerate fee compression.
 
In the retail fund channel, we compete with other mutual fund management, distribution and service companies that distribute through affiliated and unaffiliated sales forces, broker-dealers and direct sales to the public. According to the Investment Company Institute, at the end of calendar 2016 there were over 9,500 open-end registered funds of varying sizes and investment objectives whose shares were being offered to the public in the United States. We rely primarily on intermediaries to distribute our products and pursue sales relationships with all types of intermediaries to broaden our distribution network. A failure to maintain strong relationships with intermediaries that distribute our products in the retail fund channel could adversely affect our gross and net sales, assets under management, revenue and financial condition.
 
We are also subject to substantial competition in the retail managed account channel from other investment management firms. Sponsors of retail managed account programs limit the number of approved managers within their programs and firms compete based on investment performance and other considerations to win and maintain positions in these programs.
 
In the high-net-worth and institutional separate account channels, we compete with other investment management firms based on the breadth of product offerings, investment performance, strength of reputation, price and the scope and quality of client service.
 
Employees
 
On October 31, 2017, we and our controlled subsidiaries had 1,638 full-time and part-time employees. On October 31, 2016, the comparable number was 1,510.
