 Item 1. Business.
 ﻿
 General
 Peak Resorts, Inc. was incorporated in Missouri on September 24, 1997 as a holding company to own or lease and operate day ski and overnight drive ski resorts through its wholly owned subsidiaries. Throughout the history of the Company, including the development of the Hidden Valley and Snow Creek ski resorts before the incorporation of Peak Resorts, Inc., the Company has acquired or developed a total of 14 ski resorts. In this annual report, Peak Resorts, Inc., together with its subsidiaries, is referred to as “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company.”
 On November 20, 2014, we completed our initial public offering of our common stock, selling 10 million shares at $9.00 per share. After deducting $6.3 million of underwriting discounts and commissions and $1.4 million of offering expenses payable by us, we received net proceeds of $82.3 million. Our common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “SKIS”.
 We are a leading owner and operator of high-quality, individually branded ski resorts in the U.S.  We currently operate 14 ski resorts primarily located in the Northeast and Midwest, 13 of which we own. The majority of our resorts are located within 100 miles of major metropolitan markets, including New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and St. Louis, enabling day and overnight drive accessibility. Our resorts are comprised of nearly 1,860 acres of skiable terrain that appeal to a wide range of ages and abilities. We offer a breadth of activities, services and amenities, including skiing, snowboarding, terrain parks, tubing, dining, lodging, equipment rentals and sales, ski and snowboard instruction and mountain biking, zip tours and other summer activities. We believe that both the day and overnight drive segments of the ski industry are appealing given their stable revenue base, high margins and attractive risk-adjusted returns. We have successfully acquired and integrated 11 ski resorts since our incorporation in 1997, and we expect to continue executing this strategy.
 ﻿
 We have built an award-winning portfolio of individually branded entertainment properties, most of which are recognized as leading ski resorts in their respective markets. Our devotion to maintaining high quality standards across our portfolio through strategic investments and upgrades has created a loyal customer base that contributes to a significant number of repeat visits at each of our resorts. In particular, our investment over the last decade in the latest high-efficiency snowmaking equipment has earned us the reputation as an industry leader in snowmaking efficiency, capacity and quality. Our strong branding reinforces customer loyalty and serves to attract new visitors through focused marketing campaigns and word of mouth.
 ﻿
 Combined, our ski resorts generated approximately 1.7 million visits in the 2016/2017 ski season.  Despite unfavorable weather during the 2016/2017 ski season, we recorded record revenue of $123.2 million for fiscal 2017, an increase of 28.7% over fiscal 2016.  Revenue for fiscal 2017 was up from the prior year due to growth in visits and season pass sales, as well as the contribution of a full year of revenues from Hunter Mountain, which we acquired in January 2016. As the U.S. economy continues to improve, our resorts are well-positioned to benefit from increased consumer spending on leisure activities, and we expect to continue to increase our lift ticket prices and drive more skier visits to our resorts.
 The U.S. ski industry is highly fragmented, with less than 15% of the 479 ski resorts being owned by companies with four or more ski resorts. We believe that our proven ability to efficiently operate multiple resorts as well as our track record of successful acquisitions has created our reputation in the marketplace as a preferred buyer. We believe that our extensive experience in acquiring ski resorts and investing in snowmaking, lifts and other skier services, as well as the synergies we create by operating multiple resorts, drives increased revenues and profitability. Our capabilities serve as a competitive advantage in sourcing and executing investment opportunities as sellers will often provide us a "first look" at opportunities outside of a broader marketing process, allowing us to expand both within our existing markets and into new markets.
 We operate in a single business segment—resort operations. We are not dependent on any single customer, the loss of which would have a material impact on our financial statements, and we derive no revenue from foreign sources.
 ﻿
 Our Resorts 
 Our 14 ski resorts consist of six overnight drive ski resorts and eight day ski resorts located across seven states, ranging from Missouri to New Hampshire, and appeal to a wide range of visitors. All of our ski resorts employ high-capacity

snowmaking capabilities on over 90% of their terrain as well as food and beverage, equipment rental and retail outlets. All of our properties offer alternative snow activities, such as terrain parks and tubing, in addition to skiing and snowboarding. The diversity of our services and amenities allows us to capture a larger proportion of customer spending as well as ensure product and service quality at our resorts. 
 New for the 2016/2017 ski season, the Company introduced the Peak Pass, a new season pass which features a total of six pass options valid at seven different mountain locations across four states in the Northeast. Participating resorts include Mount Snow in Vermont; Attitash, Wildcat and Crotched Mountains in New Hampshire; Hunter Mountain in New York; and Jack Frost and Big Boulder in Pennsylvania. The Company believes the variety of each resort's on-mountain experience, as well as the proximity of these resorts, makes the Peak Pass a unique and affordable product for the vast majority of skiers and riders in the Northeastern U.S.
 The following table summarizes key statistics relating to each of our resorts as of April 30, 2017:

We operate portions or all of certain of our resorts pursuant to lease agreements with third parties or pursuant to Forest Service Special Use Permits with the federal government.  We own the remaining land underlying our resorts. For a description of our ownership and use of the land underlying our resorts, see Item 2, “Properties” of this annual report. 

In December 2011, we acquired the Jack Frost ski resort through the purchase of the assets of Blue Ridge Real Estate Company for $5.65 million. Also in December 2011, we purchased the assets of Big Boulder Corporation to acquire the Big Boulder ski resort, for total consideration of $3.35 million. Prior to that time, we had operated these resorts pursuant to leases since 2005.
 In October 2012, we purchased the outstanding common stock of Sycamore Lake, Inc. (doing business as Alpine Valley Ski Area in Cleveland, Ohio) for $2.6 million. This acquisition enables us to employ pricing strategies and cost synergies with Boston Mills and Brandywine, our other two Cleveland resorts.
 On January 6, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the Hunter Mountain ski resort located in Hunter, New York, through the purchase of all of the outstanding stock of each of Hunter Mountain Ski Bowl, Inc., Hunter Mountain Festivals, Ltd., Hunter Mountain Rentals, Inc., Hunter Resort Vacations, Inc., Hunter Mountain Base Lodge, Inc., and Frosty Land, Inc. (collectively, “Hunter Mountain”) pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Hunter Mountain Purchase Agreement”) with Paul Slutzky, Charles B. Slutzky, David Slutzky, Gary Slutzky and Carol Slutzky-Tenerowicz entered into on November 30, 2015.  The Company acquired Hunter Mountain for total cash consideration of $35.0 million plus the assumption of two capital leases estimated at approximately $1.7 million.
 A portion of the Hunter Mountain acquisition price was financed pursuant to the Master Credit and Security Agreement (the “Hunter Mountain Credit Agreement”) entered into between the Company and EPR Properties, the Company’s primary lender (“EPR”), on January 6, 2016. The remainder was financed with funds drawn on the Company’s line of credit with Royal Banks of Missouri pursuant to the Credit Facility, Loan and Security Agreement (the “Line of Credit Agreement”) between the Company and Royal Banks of Missouri, effective as of December 22, 2015. See Part II, Item

7A,“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Significant Sources of Cash” for additional information.
 Private Placement and Financings
 At the beginning of fiscal 2017, the Company experienced lower than normal liquidity levels. The unfavorably warm weather during the 2015/2016 ski season resulted in fewer ski days and lower profitability for the Company. Furthermore, the Company experienced unexpected delays in the release of funds raised pursuant to the U.S. government’s Immigrant Investor Program (the “EB-5 Program”), as more fully discussed in Part II, Item 7A, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources – Significant Uses of Cash,” to finance the development of two capital projects at our Mount Snow resort—the West Lake Water Project and the Carinthia Ski Lodge Project. We raised $52.0 million for the Mount Snow development projects, which was sitting in escrow pending the approval of the first program investor’s I-526 Petition, as defined herein, at the beginning of fiscal 2017.
 Based on the timeline originally anticipated for approval of the first investor’s I-526 Petition and corresponding release of EB-5 Program funds from escrow, we commenced construction of the West Lake Water Project in the second half of calendar year 2015. Through the second quarter of fiscal 2017, we had funded approximately $15.0 million of the West Lake Water Project costs, for which we were reimbursed in full once the EB-5 Program funds were released from escrow in December 2016. 
 Due to our constrained liquidity position and delay in the release of EB-5 Program funds, the Company took a number of steps in fiscal 2017 to manage cash flow and improve the Company’s liquidity position. The Company borrowed additional funds for working capital and received significant capital in connection with a private placement, as discussed in more detail below. See Part II, Item 7A, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Significant Sources of Cash” for additional information regarding the Company’s additional borrowings during fiscal 2017. 
 On August 22, 2016, the Company entered into the securities purchase agreement (the “Securities Purchase Agreement”) with CAP 1 LLC (the “Investor”) in connection with the sale and issuance (the “Private Placement”) of $20 million in Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”), and three warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock, as follows: (i) 1,538,462 shares of common stock at $6.50 per share; (ii) 625,000 shares of common stock at $8.00 per share; and (iii) 555,556 shares of common stock at $9.00 per share. In order to close the Private Placement, the Company’s stockholders were required to approve amendments to the Company’s amended and restated articles of incorporation to provide for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock and authorize the creation of preferred stock. Pursuant to applicable rules of The Nasdaq Stock Market, the Company’s stockholders were also required to approve the issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Warrants, as well as the issuance of shares of common stock upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants pursuant to the terms of the Private Placement. The Company’s stockholders approved these matters on October 24, 2016 at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. On November 2, 2016, the Company completed the sale and issuance of the Series A Preferred Stock and the Warrants to the Investor in the Private Placement. ﻿ 
 The Securities Purchase Agreement grants to the Company the right to require the Investor to purchase an additional 20,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock for $1,000 per share, along with additional warrants, all on the same terms and conditions as the Private Placement, as long as (i) there is no material adverse effect; (ii) the average closing price of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the execution of the documents for such additional shares is not less than the average closing price of the common stock for the ten trading days prior to the execution of the Securities Purchase Agreement; (iii) the Investor is reasonably satisfied with the manner in which the Company intends to use the net cash proceeds of such issuance; and (iv) the Company has successfully implemented an EB-5 Program with respect to Mount Snow and one investor’s application has been approved.  The Company’s right to require the additional purchase expires two years from the closing of the Private Placement.
 The terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are set forth in the Certificate of Designation filed by the Company with the Missouri Secretary of State on October 26, 2016. The key terms of the Series A Preferred Stock are as follows:

· | $1,000 per share liquidation value (the “Liquidation Value”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Convertible upon a change of control, or after nine months, into a number of shares of common stock equal to the number of shares to be converted times the Liquidation Value, divided by $6.29 (the “Conversion Price”);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Initial nine-month, dividend-free period with a subsequent cumulative dividend of 8.0% per annum on the Liquidation Value;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 
7



· | Redeemable by the Company after three years at 125% of the Liquidation Value, plus accrued and unpaid dividends if the common stock trades at more than 130% of the Conversion Price for a 30-day period;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Senior as to dividends, liquidation and redemption, with limitations on the Company’s ability to issue convertible debt and senior securities; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Voting rights on an as-converted basis with holders of outstanding shares of common stock, voting together as a single class, with respect to any and all matters presented to the stockholders of the Company.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  The terms of the Warrants issued in the Private Placement are all identical except for the number of shares for which the Warrants are exercisable and the exercise prices of each of the Warrants. Each of the Warrants may be exercised in whole or in part at any time for a period of 12 years from the date of issuance. The exercise price must be paid in cash. The exercise price of the Warrants and the number of shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrants are subject to adjustment in the event of a stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale and similar transaction.
 Concurrently with the closing of the Private Placement, the Company entered into the Registration Rights Agreement with the Investor providing the Investor with certain on-demand and piggy-back registration rights with respect to the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock and exercise of the Warrants. In addition, the Company, management stockholders and the Investor executed the Stockholders’ Agreement upon the Private Placement closing, generally granting the Investor pre-emptive rights, rights of first offer, director nomination rights and approval rights over certain changes in the Company’s business and certain acquisitions and divestitures.
 The Company used approximately $5.5 million of the proceeds from the offering to pay down a portion of its outstanding debt. The remainder is intended to be used for working capital purposes. 
 On November 2, 2016, the board of directors appointed Rory A. Held to serve as a director of the Company upon the nomination of the Investor pursuant to the terms of the Stockholders’ Agreement and the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.
 Capital Improvement Projects
 As part of our mission to build value by investing in our current properties through expansions, new products, and amenities that will elevate our customers’ skiing and off-season experiences, we recently announced our intent to undertake two new capital improvement projects. We intend to apply for construction permits at Hunter Mountain to increase the resort’s skiable acreage by approximately 25-30%. The new area will feature a parking area and a detachable high speed chair lift and will consist of predominantly intermediate terrain. We are working to complete the project in time for the 2018/2019 ski season. 
 We also intend to apply for a permit to construct a zip tour at Hidden Valley in an effort to leverage underutilized capacity in the spring, summer and fall to generate additional sales and diversify Hidden Valley’s revenue base.  Our goal is to complete the project for use beginning in the fall of 2018. 
 Upon release of the EB-5 Program funds from escrow, as described above, we continued construction on the West Lake Water Project and Carinthia Ski Lodge Project at Mount Snow. The West Lake Water Project, expected to be completed prior to the 2017/2018 ski season, includes the construction of a new water storage reservoir for snowmaking with capacity of up to 120 million gallons, three new pump houses and the installation of snowmaking pipelines, trail upgrades and expansion, new ski lift and ancillary equipment. The Carinthia Ski Lodge Project, expected to be completed prior to the 2018/2019 ski season, includes the construction of Carinthia Ski Lodge, a new three-story, approximately 36,000-square foot skier service building located at the base of the Carinthia slopes. Carinthia Ski Lodge will include a restaurant, cafeteria and bars with seating for over 600 people, a retail store, convenience store and sales center for lift tickets and rentals.
 ﻿
 Debt Restructure
 On November 10, 2014, in connection with our initial public offering, we entered into a Restructure Agreement (the “Restructure Agreement”) with certain affiliates of EPR, providing for the (i) prepayment of approximately $75.8 million of formerly non-prepayable debt secured by the Crotched Mountain, Attitash, Paoli Peaks, Hidden Valley and Snow Creek resorts and (ii) retirement of one of the notes associated with the future development of Mount Snow (the “Debt Restructure”). On December 1, 2014, we entered into various agreements in order to effectuate the Debt Restructure, as more fully described in the Company’s Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on December 5, 2014.  Pursuant to the Debt Restructure, we paid a defeasance fee of $5 million to EPR in addition to the consideration described below.


 
8


In exchange for the prepayment right, we granted EPR a purchase option on the Boston Mills, Brandywine, Jack Frost, Big Boulder and Alpine Valley properties, subject to certain conditions.  If EPR exercises a purchase option, EPR will enter into an agreement with the Company for the lease of each such acquired property for an initial term of 20 years, plus options to extend the lease for two additional periods of ten years each. All previously existing option agreements between the Company and EPR were terminated.
 Additionally, we agreed to extend the maturity dates on all non-prepayable notes and mortgages secured by the Mount Snow, Boston Mills, Brandywine, Jack Frost, Big Boulder and Alpine Valley properties remaining after the Debt Restructure by seven years to December 1, 2034, and to extend the lease for the Mad River property, previously terminating in 2026, until December 31, 2034.
 We also granted EPR a right of first refusal to provide all or a portion of the financing associated with any purchase, ground lease, sale/leaseback, management or financing transaction contemplated by the Company with respect to any new or existing ski resort property for a period of seven years or until financing provided by EPR for such transactions equals or exceeds $250 million in the aggregate. Proposed financings from certain types of institutional lenders providing a loan to value ratio of less than 60% (as relates to the applicable property being financed) are excluded from the right of first refusal. We granted EPR a separate right of first refusal in the event that the Company wishes to sell, transfer, convey or otherwise dispose of any or all of the Attitash ski resort for seven years.  The Attitash right excludes the financing or mortgaging of Attitash.
 In connection with the Debt Restructure, we entered into a Master Credit and Security Agreement with EPR containing additional terms and conditions governing our restructure debt with EPR, including restrictions on certain transactions and the payment of dividends and required financial covenants. See Part II, Item 7A, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Significant Sources of Cash” for additional information regarding the Company’s debt agreements in general and modifications to the Master Credit and Security Agreement.
 ﻿
 Ski Industry
         The National Ski Areas Association (“NSAA”) Kottke National End of Season Survey (Preliminary Report) estimated the U.S. ski industry had approximately 54.7 million skier visits in the 2016/2017 ski season. The U.S. ski industry reported total skier visits of 52.8 million in the 2015/2016 ski season.  The NSAA Kottke National End of Season Survey (Preliminary Report) also reported that there were 479 ski resorts operating during the 2016/2017 ski season in the U.S. Given the consistency and strength of annual skier visits over the last 30 years as well as the state of the recovering economy, we believe that skier participation will remain strong in the coming years. 
         The ski industry divides ski resorts into three distinct categories: overnight fly, overnight drive and day ski resorts. Overnight fly ski resorts are defined as ski resorts which primarily serve skiers who fly or drive considerable distances and stay for multiple nights. These resorts depend, in large part, on long-distance travel by their visitors and on the development of adjacent real estate for housing, hospitality and retail uses. Overnight drive ski resorts are ski resorts which primarily serve skiers from the regional drive market who stay overnight. Day ski resorts are typically located within 50 miles of a major metropolitan statistical area (“MSA”) and do not generally offer dedicated lodging. 
         Day and overnight drive ski resorts tend to be smaller in size and are usually located near metropolitan areas. As an owner and operator of primarily day and overnight drive ski resorts, we focus on selling lift tickets, renting ski equipment, selling ski lessons, offering food and beverage services and catering to the targeted local market. We target skiers of all levels from beginners who are skiing for the first time to intermediate and advanced skiers who are honing their skills. 
         An important statistic used to gauge the performance of companies operating within the ski industry is revenue per skier visit. The revenue per skier visit of our resorts for the 2007/2008 ski season (the first season subsequent to the Mount Snow and Attitash acquisitions) to the 2015/2016 ski season (the most current ski season for which data is available) increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.6% compared to an increase of 4.0% for the U.S. ski industry for the same period. Revenue per skier visit is calculated as total resort revenue divided by skier visits.            The ski industry statistics stated in the foregoing sections have been derived from data published by the Kottke National End of Season Survey 2015/2016 and other industry publications, including those of the NSAA.

﻿
 Revenue Components 
 We, like other day ski resorts and overnight drive ski resorts operators, earn our revenues in seven principal categories. In order of their contribution, they are: (i) lift and tubing tickets; (ii) food and beverage sales; (iii) equipment rentals; (iv) ski instruction; (v) hotel/lodging; (vi) retail; and (vii) summer activities. Each revenue center is discussed in more detail below:

  ﻿
 ﻿
 ﻿

· | Lift and Tubing Tickets— Lift tickets are our most important source of operating revenues. We place heavy emphasis on sales of season passes and advance group ticket sales to schools, religious organizations and other social groups at a discount. We market our season passes and advance group ticket sales to our ski visitors and the communities we serve. The cost of lift tickets at each of our resorts varies according to geographic region, session time and day of the week.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Food and Beverage—Our facilities generally employ cafeteria-style and self-service options to provide a limited menu of simple foods, liquor, beer and wine. We try to maximize revenues and simplify operations by focusing on a limited menu that requires minimal special preparation and related personnel costs.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Equipment Rentals— Day ski resorts generally attain a higher percentage of rental revenue than overnight fly destination ski resorts and overnight drive ski resorts because a large majority of day ski resort skiers are novices, who typically do not own ski equipment. Equipment rental rates generally range between $30 and $41 per person per session. We have focused on improving our equipment rental facilities to provide quick access to new and high quality equipment, self-service options with expert advice and fitting available, and immediate access to the lifts and ski instruction areas from the rental facility. By eliminating the equipment rental bottleneck, we believe that we have significantly enhanced the skiers' resort experience, which corresponds to increased rental revenues.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ski Instruction— Ski instruction is considered important to operations because of the large numbers of novice or early intermediate skiers who typically visit day ski resorts. We offer low group lesson prices to encourage participation, which range from $15 and $49 per person per lesson. Individual instructions and private lessons may range from $45 to $105 or more per lesson.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Hotel/Lodging— Because we primarily operate day ski resorts, not all of our resorts offer hotel or other lodging services. Our hotel/lodging revenue is comprised of the revenue generated by the lodging facilities at our Attitash, Hunter Mountain and Mount Snow ski resorts. Each has a hotel on their properties, in which individuals have purchased 100% of all available quartershare interval interests, while we retain ownership of common areas of the hotel and commercial properties. We derive a revenue stream from operating the hotels' retail, restaurant and conference facilities, fees for spa and health club services at the hotels and fees for housekeeping and other related services, and from renting quartershare interval interests when not in use by their owners. We also manage certain condominiums located near the Mount Snow ski resort and receive a portion of the rental fees and property management fees relating to these condominiums. Finally, we own 100% of the Snow Lake Lodge at Mount Snow, which we operate as a traditional hotel. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | Retail— Like ski instruction services, retail also represents a relatively small percentage of our total revenues. Some of our resorts offer a selection of more substantial ski-related equipment, such as boots, skis and snowsuits, while others maintain only a minimal selection of smaller items, such as gloves and goggles. Merchandise selection and pricing decisions must be made in light of the local demographic conditions. To facilitate this level of detailed management, local ski resort employees oversee their merchandise operations as they see fit for their markets. We also lease merchandise operations to third-party merchants at Boston Mills, Brandywine and Paoli Peaks.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Summer Activities— Although the majority of our resorts do not have material operations during the summer months, we do operate several resorts during the summer. Activities include zip tours, water parks, mountain coasters, horseback riding, conferences, camps, and festivals. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Seasonality
 ﻿
 The Company's revenues are highly seasonal in nature. The vast majority of reported revenues are generated during the ski season, which occurs during the third and fourth fiscal quarters.  In an effort to partially counterbalance the concentration of revenue during the winter months, some of our properties offer non-ski attractions, such as golf, roller coasters, swimming, summer concerts and zip rides, but these activities do not comprise a substantial portion of our annual revenues.   Our resorts typically experience operating losses and negative cash flows during the first and second quarters of each fiscal year, as a result of the seasonality of our business.
  Additionally, operations on certain holidays contribute significantly to the Company's revenues, most notably Christmas, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day and Presidents Day. The seasonality of the Company's revenues amplifies the effect on the Company's revenues, operating earnings and cash flows of events that are outside the Company's control. While the Company's geographically diverse operating locations help mitigate its effects, adverse weather conditions could limit customer access to the Company's resorts, render snowmaking wholly or partially ineffective in maintaining ski conditions, cause increased energy use and other operating costs related to snowmaking efforts and, in general, can result in decreased skier visits regardless of ski conditions.
 The opening and closing dates of our ski resorts are dependent upon weather conditions, but our peak ski season generally runs from early December to mid-April.  The weather impact during the current ski season resulted in every resort except one having an earlier opening date compared to the prior ski season.

Marketing
 We promote our resorts through both on-site marketing and external marketing. We encourage visitors to return to our resorts by offering complimentary skier orientations at our resorts. We also have marketing programs in place directed at attracting groups, such as religious organizations, social clubs, corporate entities, schools and civic organizations, and we offer discounts to active military personnel. We believe that these group discounts encourage new participants to try snow sports. Student passes are also sold through schools, and season passes are promoted through targeted direct mail marketing, the internet and local sporting goods stores.
 Each of our resorts also maximizes community awareness through radio, special events and promotions and “free media” advertising, when possible. We host charity events and tournaments, issue media passes and encourage live radio and television broadcasts for segments such as weather or sports. For example, events we have hosted include the following: Dew Tour, X-Games, Tough Mudder, SAM Cutters Camp, Transworld Trans-am Snowboard Event, Mountain Dew Vertical Challenge, NCAA National Downhill Championships, Special Olympics Games, Military Salutes, Taste of Country Music Festival, and U.S. National Mountain Biking Championships.
 Competition            We believe that there are high barriers to entry for new ski resorts due to the limited private lands on which ski resorts can be developed, the difficulty in getting the necessary government approvals and permits to build on public land and the substantial capital resources needed to construct the required ski infrastructure. As such, we believe that the risk that our market will become saturated with new industry participants is relatively low. We believe that our resorts do not directly compete with overnight fly destination ski resorts, such as the larger ski resorts in Colorado, California, Nevada, Utah and other destination ski resorts worldwide. Rather, we believe that we compete primarily with other existing day ski resorts, overnight drive ski resorts and non-ski related day vacations.            Our competition varies by geographical area. While we believe that our Midwestern ski resorts face only limited competition within their relative metropolitan markets, we are not the only day ski resorts or overnight drive ski resorts in our Northeastern and Southeastern markets (as defined by the NSAA). We compete with approximately 146 resorts in the Northeastern market and 46 resorts in the Southeastern market. 
 Competitive Strengths 
         We believe our strengths are as follows: 
 •We own a high-quality branded portfolio.  We own 13 and operate 14 high-quality ski resorts, each of which is individually branded and recognized to be a leading ski resort in its respective regional market. Our devotion to maintaining high quality standards through strategic investments and upgrades has created a loyal customer base at each of our resorts. Our strong branding reinforces customer loyalty and serves to attract new guests through focused marketing campaigns and word of mouth. 
 ﻿
 •We have a history of investing in targeted capital projects to increase profitability.  We are continuously evaluating our property-level performance and are committed to increasing our profitability. Many ski resort operators are unwilling to invest in improvements due to capital constraints and the perceived risk of such investments. Since 2008, we have invested $68.9 million throughout our portfolio in an effort to improve the profitability of our ski resorts through energy-efficient snowmaking machinery, high-speed/high-capacity lifts and additional features such as terrain parks and various other infrastructure investments. The costs of these improvements are significantly outweighed by the benefits realized, which include higher quality and less costly snow, shorter lift lines, terrain expansion and customer appreciation. We have found that the ability to transport customers up the mountain on high-speed chairlifts and to reduce lift lines not only attracts skiers and promotes a better skiing experience but also leads to higher restaurant and retail sales and increased customer satisfaction. 
 ﻿
 •We are an experienced and successful acquirer and integrator.  We have grown our Company significantly since inception by acquiring strategically located ski resorts with the potential for increased revenue growth and margin expansion. We have successfully acquired and integrated 11 ski resorts since 1997. We adhere to a disciplined acquisition strategy by pursuing opportunities at attractive acquisition prices that can create additional value through operational improvements and efficiencies. After acquiring a ski resort, we implement a strategic repositioning program designed during the underwriting process and integrate the resort into our portfolio. We believe that our 

 
12


track record for acquiring and integrating ski resorts makes us an industry leader and gives us a competitive advantage over other buyers.
 ﻿
 •Our experienced senior management team is dedicated to providing a reliable and enjoyable ski experience.    Three of our senior executives have almost 60 years of combined experience owning, operating and acquiring ski resorts in the U.S. Since 1982, it has been our vision to offer a reliable and enjoyable skiing experience to our customers. As a result of this vision, our management team constantly strives to enhance and improve our snowmaking capabilities to ensure our ski resorts maintain high-quality snow throughout the season. In addition, our management team strives to provide our ski resorts with a full range of amenities to augment our customers' overall skiing experience. 
 ﻿
 •Overnight drive and day ski resorts experience lower sensitivity to the economy.  We believe our portfolio provides more attractive risk-adjusted returns than overnight fly resorts due to the stability in our visits. Furthermore, we believe that customers are more likely to visit overnight drive and day ski resorts during an economic downturn as compared to other higher cost overnight fly ski resorts, resulting in less sensitivity to downturns in the economy. The revenue per skier visit of our resorts from the 2007/2008 ski season (the first season subsequent to the Mount Snow and Attitash acquisitions) to the 2015/2016 ski season (the most current ski season for which data is available) increased at a compounded annual growth rate of 5.6% compared to an increase of 4.0% for the U.S. ski industry for the same period.        •The ski industry possesses high barriers to entry.  A limited number of ski resorts have been developed in the past 30 years. Skiable land is scarce and demanding to develop due to the difficulty in aggregating suitable terrain, obtaining government permitting, resolving accessibility issues and addressing heightened environmental concerns. Operating a ski resort requires a high level of expertise and strict regulatory and environmental compliance. Additionally, many resorts have built significant customer loyalty and brand awareness over multiple generations, which can be difficult for a new entrant to overcome. These factors have contributed to the number of ski resorts decreasing 35%, from 735 in 1984 to 479 in 2017 as smaller, poorly capitalized resorts have been unable to compete effectively. With our large existing portfolio, proven capital investment strategy and strong customer loyalty, we believe our Company is competitively well-positioned. 
 ﻿
 •Our ski resort portfolio is diverse.  Our portfolio of 14 ski resorts consists of six overnight drive ski resorts and eight day ski resorts located across seven states ranging from Missouri to New Hampshire. We believe that our portfolio mix enables us to reach a large customer base seeking high-quality ski resorts within driving distance of major metropolitan areas. Each of our ski resorts is located within reasonable drive times from major metropolitan areas such as New York City, Boston, Philadelphia, Cleveland and St. Louis, which we believe provides us with a consistent repeat customer base and increases our new customer outreach potential. We believe that the size and geographic diversity of our portfolio helps insulate the Company's financial performance against adverse economic and weather conditions.
     •We are a proven operator of ski resorts.  We have operated numerous ski resorts since our incorporation in 1997. Due to our extensive operating expertise, we believe we have a profitable and efficient platform that positions us to take advantage of growth initiatives and cost controls. 
 ﻿
 •Management’s and stockholders’ interests are aligned.  Our management team owns approximately 16% of our outstanding shares. We believe that this substantial ownership position aligns the interest of our operating team with that of our new stockholders. 
 Intellectual Property
         We understand the importance to the sales and marketing of our resorts that a strong brand can maintain. Wildcat Mountain Ski AreaSM, Mount Snow®, Boston Mills Ski ResortSM, Hidden ValleySM, Crotched Mountain Ski AreaSM ,  Alpine Valley and Hunter MountainSM are trademarks, service marks and trade names owned by certain subsidiaries of Peak Resorts, Inc.      Regulation and Legislation   The 1986 Ski Area Permit Act and Master Development Plans 


 
13


        The 1986 Ski Area Permit Act (the "1986 Act") allows the Forest Service to grant Term Special Use Permits for the operation of ski resorts and construction of related facilities on National Forest lands. In addition, the permits granted to our ski resorts under the 1986 Act require a Master Development Plan for each ski resort that is granted a Special Use Permit. Of our 14 resorts, only portions of Attitash and Mount Snow and all of Wildcat Mountain operate under Special Use Permits. The ski-able terrain at our other resorts is located on land that we own or lease from non-government third parties. 
         Each area of National Forest land is required by the National Forest Management Plan to develop and maintain a Land and Resource Management Plan, which establishes standards and guidelines for the Forest Service to follow and consider in reviewing and approving our proposed actions. Under the 1986 Act, the Forest Service has the right to review and approve the locations, design and construction of improvements in the permit area and many operational matters. 
         The Special Use Permits expire as follows: Attitash ski resort—April 4, 2047; Mount Snow ski resort—April 4, 2047; and Wildcat Mountain ski resort—November 18, 2050. We intend to request a new Special Use Permit for each resort as provided by the Forest Service regulations and terms of each existing Special Use Permit. To our knowledge, the Forest Service has never refused to issue a new Special Use Permit to replace an existing Special Use Permit for a ski resort in operation at the time of expiration. 
         Each Special Use Permit contains requirements and obligations on our part, including that we indemnify the Forest Service from third-party claims arising out of our operation under the Special Use Permit and that we comply with all applicable laws. We pay a fee to the Forest Service for the Special Use Permit which, pursuant to the terms of each Special Use Permit, could range from 1.5% to 4.0% of sales for services on Forest Service land. Historically we have paid fees ranging from 1.5% to 2.5% of sales for services on Forest Service land and do not expect that this will change in the near future. Included in the calculation are sales from lift tickets, season passes, ski instructions, food and beverages, equipment rental, merchandise, and other ancillary services. 
         The Special Use Permits may be amended by mutual agreement between us and the Forest Service to change the applicable ski resort or permitted uses. The Forest Service may also modify the Special Use Permit to accommodate changes in plans or operations. Permit amendments must be consistent with the Forest Plan and are subject to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act ("NEPA"). 
         The Forest Service may also terminate a Special Use Permit if it determines that termination is required for specific compelling reasons. However, to our knowledge, no Special Use Permit has ever been terminated by the Forest Service without the consent of the operator. 
         We must propose a Master Development Plan for all improvements that we intend to make on National Forest lands and submit such plans to the Forest Service for review and acceptance. Once the Forest Service accepts a Master Development Plan, individual projects contemplated by the Master Development Plan will only be approved by the Forest Service upon separate applications that meet the requirements set forth by the Forest Service, including the requirements contained in the Special Use Permit. 
  National Environmental Policy Act 
         Under NEPA, our major proposed actions on all National Forest land, such as the expansion of a ski resort or installation of new snowmaking equipment, must be assessed to determine the environmental impacts of such actions. Upon our application to the Forest Service to undertake major projects, the Forest Service must conduct an environmental study, which can impact the time it takes to complete a project. During these studies, the Forest Service is required to consider alternatives to proposed actions and the impacts that may be unavoidable. We may not get the Forest Service's approval to undertake a project or may be required to take alternative action, depending on the results of the environmental studies.   Underground Storage Tank Regulations 
         We have underground storage tanks ("USTs") on our ski resort properties in Ohio, New Hampshire, New York Pennsylvania and Vermont for the purpose of storing gasoline, fuel oil and propane that we use in the operation of our resorts, lodges and skier service buildings. The federal Solid Waste Disposal Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA") the authority to regulate USTs. State UST programs that are at least as strict as the federal regulations and that have 

 
14


been approved by the EPA govern the USTs in lieu of the federal regulations. The objectives of the state UST programs are to ensure that:
 •USTs are properly constructed and designed in accordance with recognized industry standards; 
 •installations, repairs and removals are conducted and inspected by qualified and trained individuals; 
 •active USTs are properly operated and monitored for the release of substances; and 
 •upon closure, USTs are properly decommissioned and sites are assessed for contamination. 
         We believe that the USTs at our facilities meet all state and federal construction and operation standards. Compliance with these UST regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, and we do not expect it to have a material impact in the future. 
 Employees            We, together with our operating subsidiaries, currently employ approximately 600 year-round employees. During the height of our ski season, we employ approximately 6,200 seasonal employees.    Availability of Information
