------------+----------

Overview
 
We are a holding company operating through our wholly-owned subsidiary, LIBB. We are engaged in the production and distribution of premium Non-Alcoholic Ready-to-Drink (“NARTD”) beverages. We are currently organized around our flagship iced tea product, under the brand Long Island Iced Tea®. The Long Island Iced Tea name for a cocktail originated in Long Island in the 1970’s, and its national recognition is such that it is ranked as the fourth most popular cocktail in restaurants and bars in the U.S. (Source: Nielsen CGA, On-Premise Consumer Survey, 2016). Our premium NARTD tea is made from a proprietary recipe and with quality components. Long Island Iced Tea ® is sold in 27 states across the U.S., primarily on the East Coast, through a network of national and regional retail chains and distributors.
 
Since February 2016, we have been engaged in the aloe juice business, under the brand ALO Juice. ALO Juice is a NARTD functional beverage made from juice derived from the aloe plant known as aloe vera. ALO Juice sources its aloe plants from harvests in Thailand. The plants are exported from there to South Korea where they are processed in a unique whole leaf manner to ensure the nutritional and health benefits are maintained from the plant all the way through to the bottling process.
 
On March 14, 2017, we announced the expansion of our brand with the launch of The Original Long Island Brand™ Lemonade. This lemonade is a NARTD functional beverage made from a proprietary recipe with quality components.
 
Our mission is to provide consumers with “better-for-you” premium beverages offered at an affordable price.
 
We aspire to be a market leader in the development of beverages that are convenient and appealing to consumers. There are two major target markets for our beverages: consumers on the go and health conscious consumers. Consumers on the go are families, employees, students and other consumers who lead a busy lifestyle. With increasingly hectic and demanding schedules, there is a need for products that are accessible and readily available. Health conscious consumers are individuals who are becoming more interested and better educated on what is included in their diets, causing them to shift away from options perceived as less healthy such as carbonated soft drinks (“CSDs”) towards alternative beverages such as iced tea.
 
We continually seek to expand our product line. We are exploring entry into the $222 billion U.S. alcohol industry, with the hope to establish ourselves as a multi-product alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverage company.

We also continually seek to better develop emerging markets, as well as expand our overall geographic footprint. We entered into new business arrangements involving international specialists contracted to (i) identify new market opportunities and (ii) assist in the overall management of our international expansion efforts. During 2016, the Company announced new distributorships in Columbia, Honduras, Dominican Republic, St Martin and Bermuda. We also worked alongside new distributor partnerships in Puerto Rico, Canada and South Korea to further expand distribution points throughout their respective markets. New developments included (i) new retail partnerships opened with supermarket chains such as Pueblos and Supermax in Puerto Rico, (ii) our first shipment to Canada in November 2016, and (iii) multiple reorders received from the South Korean distributor.
 
Corporate History
 
We were incorporated on December 23, 2014 in the State of Delaware as a wholly owned subsidiary of Cullen.
 
On May 27, 2015, we closed the business combination (the “Business Combination”) contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Merger Agreement”), dated as of December 31, 2014 and amended as of April 23, 2015, by and among Cullen, us, Cullen Merger Sub, Inc., LIBB Acquisition Sub, LLC, LIBB, Philip Thomas and Thomas Panza, who formerly owned a majority of the outstanding membership units of LIBB, and the other former members of LIBB executing a joinder thereto. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) Cullen Merger Sub, Inc. merged with and into Cullen, with Cullen surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and the stockholders of Cullen receiving one share of our common stock for every 15 shares of Cullen common stock held by them and (ii) LIBB Acquisition Sub, LLC merged with and into LIBB, with LIBB surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and the members of LIBB receiving an aggregate of 2,633,334 shares of our common stock.
 
Upon the closing of the Business Combination, we became the new public company, Cullen and LIBB became wholly-owned subsidiaries of ours and the stockholders of Cullen and the members of LIBB became our stockholders. In addition, the historical financial statements of LIBB became our financial statements. As a result of the Business Combination, the business of LIBB became our business. Cullen is currently inactive and no significant operations are being undertaken by it. LIBB was formed as a limited liability company under the laws of New York on February 18, 2011.
 
Our principal executive offices are located at 116 Charlotte Avenue, Hicksville, NY 11801. Our telephone number is (855) 542-2832. Our website address is www.longislandicedtea.com .

Recent Developments
 
ALO Juice
 
During 2016, we began selling ALO Juice. The aloe juice product is purchased in its finished form from a third party supplier. On December 8, 2016, in order to bolster our aloe juice business and further meet growing consumer demand for “better-for-you” beverages, the Company entered into an agreement to purchase the intellectual property related to this product, including trade names, formulas and recipes, from the owners of the ALO Juice® brand. Consideration upon the closing of the transaction will consist of 5,000 shares of our common stock. We expect to close this transaction by early Spring 2017.
 
Separately, we entered into an employment agreement with Julio X Ponce, majority interest member of the ALO Juice® brand owner. Mr. Ponce was hired at an annual salary of $90,000 to advance the sales of ALO Juice to the Southeast and Latin American regions effective January 1, 2017.
 
Lemonade
 
On March 14, 2017, we announced that we are expanding our brand to include lemonade. The Original Long Island Brand™ Lemonade range consists of 9 real-fruit flavors, and is available in both single 18oz bottles and 12-packs. This premium lemonade is intended to be differentiated from other lemonade beverages in the US market. It is made with 100% raw cane sugar and non-GMO ingredients that incorporate the “better-for-you” attributes that are prominent within our iced tea brand, and will complement Long Island Iced Tea®. We expect that this product will be available in select markets in early Spring 2017. It’s our objective to grow market share and offer this product alongside our iced tea products.

In connection with sale of the shares, our common stock was approved for listing on the Capital Market of The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).

Industry Opportunity
 
Non-Alcoholic Beverage Market
 
Iced Tea
 
Globally, NARTD tea products are ranked as the 4th largest beverage category, behind carbonated soft drinks, water and dairy. The non-alcohol iced tea global category size is estimated at $55 billion and growing at a 6.6% compound annual growth rate (“CAGR”). (Source: Euromonitor International, “Versatility of RTD Tea Generates Bright Spot in Global Soft Drinks”, May 2014.
 
The U.S. non-alcoholic liquid refreshment beverage market consists of a number of different products, and CSDs are the top selling beverage category. However, consumers are increasingly coming to view CSDs (typically caffeinated as well as high in sugar and preservatives) with disfavor. In volume, the CSD category declined 0.6% in 2016, 1.5% in 2015, 1.6% in 2014, 2.3% in 2013 and 1.5% in 2012. (Sources: Euromonitor International, “Carbonates in the US”, February 2017).
 
CSDs have historically dominated the non-alcoholic liquid refreshment beverage market and been primarily controlled by two industry giants, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo. However, a number of beverages began to emerge in the 1990s as alternatives to CSDs as part of a societal shift towards beverages that are perceived to be healthier. The alternative beverage category of the market has resulted in the birth of multiple new product segments that include sports drinks, energy drinks and NARTD teas.
 
According to a 2017 Euromonitor International industry report, the U.S. NARTD tea segment was expected to have $7.1 billion of revenue in 2016, a 7.9% increase from the prior year and an 8.3% annualized growth rate over the last 5 years (2011 – 2016) (Source: Euromonitor International , “RTD Tea in the US”, February 2017). The industry report also forecasted an annual revenue growth rate of 5.3% over the coming five years, with revenues reaching $9.2 billion in 2021.

In 2014, consumers showed special interest in healthier versions of NARTD teas, preferring unsweetened teas.

The Americas is expected to grow at an 11.24% CAGR over the same period. (Source: Technavio Market Research Report, “Aloe Vera-Based Drinks Market”, November 2016)
Potential Expansion into Alcoholic Beverage Market
 
We have begun exploring the development, production, marketing and distribution of alcoholic beverages, to augment our current NARTD tea business. In June 2015, we engaged Julian Davidson, who has many years of experience in the alcohol industry, as a consultant to help evaluate the opportunity, as well as to assist in our core NARTD tea business. In June 2016, Mr. Davidson became our Executive Chairman.
 
The alcohol beverage market consists of beer, cider/perry, ready-to-drink/high-strength premixes, spirits and wine. The total sales of U.S. alcohol beverage market reached $222 billion in 2015, growing at a 1.1% CAGR from 2010 to 2015. Of that $222 billion, 47.1% was from beer, 0.8% from cider/perry, 2.1% from Alcoholic Ready-to-Drink (“ARTD”) beverages/high-strength premixes, 30.9% from spirits and 19.1% from wine. (Source: Euromonitor, “Alcoholic Drinks in the US”, June 2016).
 
Our Products and Services
 
Long Island Iced Tea® was first launched in the New York metro market by LIBB in July 2011, positioning itself as a premium iced tea beverage offered at an affordable price. We help differentiate ourselves from competitors with a proprietary recipe and quality components. Long Island Iced Tea® is a 100% brewed tea, using black tea leaves and purified water via reverse osmosis. It is gluten-free, free of genetically modified organisms, or “GMOs,” and certified Kosher with no artificial colors or preservatives.
 
Long Island Iced Tea® is primarily produced and bottled in the U.S. Northeast. This production in the Northeast, combined with its “Made in America” tag-line and brand name, all improve its credentials as a part of the local community from which we take our name.
 
We have developed ten flavors of Long Island Iced Tea® in an effort to ensure that our products meet the desired taste preferences of consumers. Regular flavors, which use natural cane sugar as a sweetener, include lemon, peach, raspberry, green tea & honey, half tea & half lemonade, guava, mango, and sweet tea. Diet flavors, which use sucralose (generic Splenda) instead of natural cane sugar as a sweetener, include diet lemon and diet peach. These flavors are currently available in twelve packs of 20oz polyethylene terephthalate bottles.

We have unveiled a new 18oz bottle and label design for our flagship Long Island Iced Tea® Brand, which will replace our 20oz size. The sleeker and slimmer 18oz design accentuates an authentic and fresh spirit of Long Island Iced Tea® products, which we believe will have a positive impact on our product gross margins. The bold and cleanly designed label aligns with our core brand image, clearly emphasizing the brand’s premium ingredients and better-for-you positioning. Both the label and customized bottle cap include informative health cues that include “non-GMO,” “100% raw cane sugar,” “no additives,” and “low calories” for diet flavors. The new bottles are expected to reach retail stores in early 2017. Any reference to 20oz size is intended to include both 18oz and 20oz packaging within this annual report.
 
We have also recently developed three twenty-four pack of sixty calorie flavors that are served in 12oz bottles. The sixty calorie flavors have reduced sugar content, are caffeine free and include mango, peach, and raspberry. This package was designed to meet certain nutritional guidelines for sales in schools. During May 2015, we launched four flavors, lemon, peach, mango, and green tea and honey, in gallon containers. During February 2016, we also launched sweet tea, which is also served in a gallon container. In addition, during April 2016, we launched a private label line, consisting of four flavors, for one of our existing customers.
 
We have also recently developed The Original Long Island Brand™ Lemonade, which comes in nine real-fruit flavors, and is available in both single 18oz bottles and 12-packs that will be sold in the same locations that our iced tea is offered in early 2017.
 
ALO Juice has been distributed in New York City since 2008, and in Florida since 2012. We commenced distribution of ALO Juice in February 2016. It is packed in 0.5 liter and 1.5 liter bottles, with a wide variety of flavors including Original, Mango, Pomegranate, Pineapple and Raspberry. Aloe vera juice contains nutrients which include vitamins A, C, E, and B12, as well as minerals like potassium, zinc, and magnesium. It also provides antioxidants, helps to balance metabolism, and supports normal circulation and blood pressure.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that a differentiated brand will be a key competitive strength in the NARTD tea segment. Key points of differentiation for Long Island Iced Tea® and Long Island Brand™ Lemonade include:

● | A better and bolder tasting bottled iced tea as a result of premium ingredients that include natural cane sugar (sucralose for diet flavors), hot-filled using black and green tea leaves, that is offered at an affordable price; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Immediate global recognition of the “Long Island Iced Tea” phrase associated with the cocktail; 
● | Made in America; 
● | Strong Northeast roots where it is locally produced; 
● | The use of non-GMO ingredients; and 
● | Our product being corn free, hormone/antibiotic free, gluten free, natural and having no artificial color/flavor. 

 
The NARTD tea market is a crowded space and, as a result, we believe in pricing our products competitively. We highlight to consumers our use of premium ingredients and our affordable price. The suggested retail price for a 20oz. bottle of Long Island Iced Tea® is $1.00 to $1.50, and the suggested retail price for a 12oz. bottle is $1.00 to $1.25. The suggested retail price for our gallon containers is $2.99 to $3.49. The suggested retail price of The Original Long Island Brand™ Lemonade is $1.25 to $1.79 per 18oz bottle. ALO Juice® has a suggested retail price of $1.49 to $1.79 for the 500 ml bottle and $2.39 to $2.79 for the 1.5 liter bottle. Management has set pricing levels to reflect current pricing dynamics in the industry. There has been downward pressure on prices, which management believes is caused by the entrance of major multinational beverage corporations into the alternative beverage category. This is starting to lead towards industry consolidation, in what is currently considered a somewhat fragmented marketplace.

Our Business Strategies 
 
In addition to a potential expansion into alcoholic beverages, we are seeking to organically grow our NARTD tea and related product sales, capitalizing on an iconic name with unique brand awareness to create familiar and easily recognizable beverages.
 
We intend to increase our market share in our existing geographic markets and expand into additional geographic markets in the U.S. We also are exploring international markets on a highly selective and limited basis, which may include royalty and licensing agreements. As discussed below in ” Our Customers ,” we generally focus our sales efforts on approaching beverage distributors and taking advantage of their unique positioning in the retail industry. However, a portion of our sales efforts are also dedicated to direct sales to retailers, because some wholesale chains such as Sam’s Club and Costco request direct shipments from the product supplier. In addition, we are exploring several new sales channels. We currently are conducting a small scale business trial in which we sell our beverage product alongside other snacks in vending machines. We also commenced selling our twelve ounce lower calorie products in schools, in some cases through sales to purchasing cooperatives that represent multiple school districts, but also via the vending machine business trial.
 
During the quarter ended December 31, 2015, we determined the brand had sufficient scale, distribution and volume per point of distribution to test market expansion into (i) additional U.S. states, (ii) significant new regional chains, and (iii) national chains. To facilitate this expansion, we recruited Joseph Caramele, our Vice President of National Sales & Marketing. Mr. Caramele had spent the previous nine years working in national and chain account sales for Arizona Beverages USA, at which time he oversaw the regional and national chain account expansion. In 2016, Mr. Caramele’s responsibilities included building sales and distribution footprint throughout the Southeast, Midwest and eventually across the entire country. Additionally, Mr. Caramele is responsible for extending our sales outreach by developing broker relationships with companies such as SellEthics Marketing Inc. and JOH. These brokers were contracted to assist in the execution of company marketing plans (primarily at store level) and utilize networks to accelerate national expansion efforts.
 
As part of our marketing efforts, we commonly use store demos, as we have found a positive correlation between demos and sales especially at the introduction phase in new stores. We expect to continue using store demos in order to increase brand awareness and sales as we continue to expand into new markets. We also use co-op advertising (advertisements by retailers that include the specific mention of manufacturers, who, in turn, repay the retailers for all or part of the cost of the advertisement) and special promotions, together with its retail partners, so as to complement other marketing efforts towards brand awareness.
 
We also seek to expand our product line. From time to time, we explore and test market potential of new NARTD products that may, in the future, contribute to our operating performance. We expect that the introduction of The Original Long Island Brand™ Lemonade, with nine different flavors, will be able to attract a new market segment of beverage drinkers. We expect that our ALO Juice brand product will sit alongside our flagship Long Island Brand tea. We are committed to building the ALO Juice brand and expanding its distribution. To accomplish our long-term growth strategy for this brand, we entered into an agreement to acquire the intellectual property related to this product. We expect to close this agreement by April 2017. We also may consider exploring our strategic acquisitions from time to time, although this is not a primary business focus.
 
Manufacturing and Raw Materials
 
Long Island Iced Tea® and Long Island Brand™ Lemonade are currently produced by Brooklyn Bottling Group, Wayne County Foods, Inc., Polar Corp., and LiDestri Spirits, all of which are established co-packing companies with reputable quality control. We intend to identify additional co-packers in the U.S. and other countries to support the continued growth of the brand. ALO Juice is purchased as a finished product from a third party supplier in South Korea.
 
The principal raw materials we use in our iced tea and lemonade business are bottles, caps, labels, packaging materials, tea essence and tea base, lemonade base, sugar, natural flavors and other sweeteners, juice, electricity, fuel and water. Our principal suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2016, were Zuckerman-Honickman, Inc. (bottles) and Allen Flavors, Inc. (natural flavors) who, together with Lidestri Spirits (copacker), accounted for 46% of our purchases of inventory and copacking fees. In addition, 23% of our purchases were related to the purchase of finished bottled ALO Juice, which is purchased from suppliers located in South Korea. Our principal iced tea suppliers for the year ended December 31, 2015 were Zuckerman-Honickman, Inc. (bottles), Dominos Food, Inc. (sugar) and Allen Flavors, Inc. (natural flavors) who, together with Union Beverage Packers LLC (copacker), accounted for 80% of our purchases of raw materials inventory and copacking fees.

-


Our relationships with our suppliers and co-packers are typically governed by short-term purchase orders or similar arrangements. We do not have any material contracts or other material arrangements with these parties and presently do not mitigate our exposure to volatility in the prices of raw materials or co-packing services through the use of forward contracts, pricing agreements or other hedging arrangements. Accordingly, we are subject to fluctuations in the costs of our raw materials and co-packing services.
 
Furthermore, some of our raw materials, such as bottles, caps, labels, tea essence and tea base, sugar, natural flavors and other sweeteners, and juice, are available from only a few suppliers. As a result, we may be subject to substantial increases in prices or shortages of raw materials, if the suppliers are unable or unwilling to meet our requirements.
 
Our Customers
 
We sell our products to a mix of independent mid-to-large size beverage distributors who in turn sell to retail outlets, such as big chain supermarkets, mass merchants, convenience stores, restaurants and hotels principally in the New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania markets. We have also begun expansion into other geographic markets, such as Florida, Virginia, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Nevada, Rhode Island, North Carolina, South Carolina and parts of the Midwest. Our products are currently available in twenty three states that have a cumulative population of 100 million. While we primarily sell our products indirectly through distributors, at times we sell directly to the retail outlets and we may sell to certain retail outlets both directly and indirectly through distributors. We also sell our products directly to the distribution facilities of some of our retailers and through “road shows,” which are temporary installations at retail outlets staffed by our employees or contractors.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, our top customers, Seba Distribution LLC and Garden Foods, accounted for 20% and 11% of the Company’s net sales, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2015, one customer, Wakefern Food Corp., accounted for 10% of net sales.
 
Our sales are typically governed by short-term purchase orders. We do not have any material contracts or other material arrangements with our customers or distributors and do not obtain commitments from them to purchase or sell a minimum amount of our products or to purchase or sell such products at a minimum price. Because our sales may be concentrated with a few customers, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected if one of these customers significantly reduces the volume of its purchases or demands a reduction in price, which may occur at any time due to the absence of such purchase commitments.
 
Management
 
Our management team consists of persons with substantial experience in the beverage industry. Philip Thomas, our Chief Executive Officer and LIBB’s co-founder, has over 16 years of beverage experience. Julian Davidson, our Executive Chairman, has over 25 years of experience in the beverage industry, including most recently serving as Chief Executive Officer of Independent Liquor NZ’s businesses in New Zealand, the U.S. and Canada. Independent Liquor NZ is a manufacturer and distributor of pre-mixed ARTD beverages, as well as having beer, spirit and cider portfolios. Richard Allen, our Chief Financial Officer, has over 30 years of experience in the beverage and food industries, including roles at Beverage Innovations, Cadbury Schweppes and Snapple. Joseph Caramele, our Vice President of National Sales & Marketing, has substantial experience in the beverage industry, having spent the past nine years at Arizona Beverages USA, most recently as Executive National Sales Director for the past five years. As Executive National Sales Director, he managed a team of 85 individuals and portfolio of over 100 accounts with annual retail sales estimated to be over $850 million. We intend to expand our current management and recruit other skilled officers and employees with experience relevant to our business focus as needed.

We purchase our aloe juice product through a third party supplier in its finished form. There are no current operations or assets; however, after the close of the asset purchase agreement we will acquire only the intellectual property to produce ALO Juice including tradenames, formulas, and recipes.
 
Seasonality
 
The beverage market is subject to some seasonal variations. As the iced tea beverage segment, including Long Island Iced Tea®, experiences its highest levels of demand during the warm spring and summer months, cold or rainy weather during this time may have a short-term impact on customer demand and therefore result in lower sales.
Competition
 
The beverage industry is extremely competitive. Long Island Iced Tea is competing with a wide range of beverages that are produced by a large number of manufacturers. Most of these brands have enjoyed broad public recognition for many years, accomplished through continuous and well-funded marketing campaigns. We will compete with all types of beverages, both CSDs and non-CSDs, facing higher competition from direct product competitors in the NARTD tea market. Key direct competitors are Arizona Beverage Company, Unilever, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. and Nestle SA. In order to be able to compete successfully in the industry, we have to distinguish our products in price and in taste and flavor, and offer attractive promotions to customers and appealing packaging. Moreover, we will have to well position the brand with targeted sales and marketing campaigns.
 
The aloe juice business is a fast growing industry as consumer demand grows for a “better-for-you” beverage that has healthy benefits and is great tasting. The aloe juice segment is projected to experience high growth worldwide for the foreseeable future and there will be opportunities for new entrances in the market. The presence of small and large vendors makes the global aloe vera-based drinks market extremely fragmented. Intense competition prevails in the market in terms of price, quality, innovation, reputation, and distribution. Key direct competitors that provide a high quality aloe juice product are OKF Aloe King, Alo Farms, Forever Living Products, and Houssy Global.
 
Intellectual Property
 
“Long Island Iced Tea” is a trademark of ours. We currently have federal registration of the trademark “Long Island Iced Tea” and are pursuing such registration of the trademark “The Original Long Island Brand.” We intend to seek registration of such trademarks in other countries as well. In addition, we are seeking or plan to seek a number of other trademarks for tag lines and product designs.
 
We filed applications with the USPTO for the registration of the trademark “Long Island Brand Iced Tea” on August 28, 2012 and subsequently for the registration of the trademark “Long Island Iced Tea” on July 23, 2013. Both applications encountered resistance to registration as a result of the existence of the mark “Long Island” for “iced tea.” We determined that the mark “Long Island” for “iced tea” was abandoned. As a result we filed a petition to cancel the registration on this ground. In January 2015, the petition was granted and the mark was cancelled. Accordingly, we petitioned for the mark “Long Island Iced Tea” to be placed on the supplemental register. On April 19, 2016, the USPTO registered the mark “Long Island Iced Tea” (Registration No. 4,943,056) on the supplemental register. Registration on the supplemental register allows the use of the “®” symbol, blocks later filed applications for confusingly similar marks, and allows us to sue infringers in federal court which has well-settled case law and standards. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the supplemental register does not provide all the protection of a registration on the principal register. At this time, the mark is not “incontestable” and we may be open to claims of others contesting the trademark.

In addition, we have filed trademark applications for “The Original Long Island Brand” as a standard character mark and as a stylized mark, which are pending before the USPTO. In each case, the application is for use of the trademark with iced tea, tea based products, juices, water, beverages and other similar products. “The Original Long Island Brand” standard character trademark has been in use in commerce by us since at least as early as February 29, 2012. We also plan to file for stylized marks protecting certain other tag lines and product designs. With respect to the pending trademark applications for “The Original Long Island Brand” (standard character mark and stylized mark), the USPTO has made an initial determination that both marks are geographically descriptive. This determination is refutable and the USPTO has afforded the company the opportunity to produce evidence to establish that the marks have become distinctive of the goods in commerce. Similar issues, or other issues, also may arise in connection with the other marks for which we are seeking registration or intend to seek registration. Registration of these marks will allow us to utilize the “®” symbol to notify others that our marks are federally registered and allow us to enforce these marks in federal court, among other benefits. There can be no assurance, however, that the USPTO will approve these applications.
 
Our intellectual property is protected through the acquisition of registered and unregistered trademarks as described above, the acquisition of patents, the maintenance of trade secrets, the development of trade dress, and, where appropriate, litigation against those who are, in our opinion, infringing our intellectual property rights. We intend to aggressively assert our rights under trade secret, unfair competition, trademark, copyright and other similar laws to protect our intellectual property, including product design, product research and concepts and trademarks, against any infringer. Although any assertion of our rights could result in a substantial cost to us, and diversion of our efforts, management believes that the protection of our intellectual property will be a key component of our operating strategy. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there can be no assurance that the trademarks described above or our other intellectual property rights will adequately protect information that we deem to be proprietary.
 
In an effort to further develop our branding strategy, we acquired the uniform resource locator (URL) www.longislandicedtea.com.
 
Environmental and Other Regulations
 
The conduct of our businesses, and the production, distribution, sale, advertising, labeling, safety, transportation and use of our products, are and will be subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the U.S., as well as to foreign laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in markets where we may operate and sell products.
 
In the U.S., we are or may be required to comply with federal laws, such as the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, laws governing equal employment opportunity, customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, laws regulating the sales of products in schools, and various other federal statutes and regulations. We will rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as local counsel, to guide our businesses in complying with applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our third-party co-manufacturer is also required to comply with Food and Drug Administration requirements for manufacturing of our product.
 
We also may in the future be affected by other existing, proposed and potential future regulations or regulatory actions, including those described below, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in government regulation, or failure to comply with existing regulations, could adversely affect our business. Public health officials and health advocates are increasingly focused on the public health consequences associated with obesity, especially as the disease affects children, and are seeking legislative change to reduce the consumption of sweetened beverages. There also has been an increased focus on caffeine content in beverages.
 
Legislation has been enacted in certain U.S. states in which our products may be sold that requires collection and recycling of containers or that prohibits the sale of our beverages in certain non-refillable containers unless a deposit or other fee is charged. It is possible that similar or more restrictive legal requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future.
