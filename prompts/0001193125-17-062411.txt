Overview 
 We are a commercial stage drug-device company committed to improving the quality of life for patients with ear, nose and throat conditions. We have developed a drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology that enables targeted and sustained release of therapeutic agents. This targeted drug delivery technology is designed to allow ear, nose and throat, or ENT, physicians to improve patient care. Our approved and in-development products are designed to treat the spectrum of needs among patients who are managed by ENT physicians for chronic sinusitis, one of the most prevalent chronic diseases in the United States and one of the most costly conditions for U.S. employers. For patients with chronic sinusitis, we are: 

 | Marketing PROPEL® and PROPEL® Mini, the first and only steroid releasing implants approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for use in patients undergoing surgery for chronic sinusitis. PROPEL has been proven in a meta-analysis of prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies to improve surgical outcomes, demonstrating a 35% reduction in the need for postoperative oral steroid and surgical intervention. Inserted by a physician into the ethmoid sinuses following sinus surgery, the self-expanding implants are designed to conform to and hold open the surgically enlarged sinus, while gradually releasing an anti-inflammatory steroid over a period of approximately 30 days, before being fully absorbed into the body.

 | Marketing PROPEL Mini for chronic sinusitis patients undergoing frontal sinus surgery. Based on results from the PROGRESS clinical study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROPEL Mini when placed in the frontal sinuses following surgery, PROPEL Mini demonstrated a statistically significant 38% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions compared to surgery alone.

to be performed in operating rooms or in the office setting of care. PROPEL Contour has the potential to expand adoption of steroid releasing implants overall by providing physicians with a range of products needed to customize treatment based on their patients disease and anatomy. In particular, we believe PROPEL Contours lower profile, malleable delivery system will increase usage particularly in those patients whose frontal sinuses are more challenging to access. We announced results of the second cohort of patients in the PROGRESS study in May 2016. This phase of the PROGRESS study was an 80-patient prospective randomized blinded multicenter trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PROPEL Contour when placed in the frontal sinuses following opening of the sinus. The PROPEL Contour cohort demonstrated a statistically significant 65% relative reduction in the need for post-operative interventions, such as the need for additional surgical procedures or need for oral steroid prescription, compared to surgery alone with standard post-operative care.

 | Pursuing approval of RESOLVE, a steroid releasing implant designed to provide a cost-effective, less invasive solution for patients that have had ethmoid sinus surgery yet suffer from recurrent sinus obstruction due to polyps. The RESOLVE implant is designed to be placed in the ethmoid sinus in a procedure conducted in the physicians office as an alternative to other treatment options such as further medical therapy or revision surgery. We have completed four studies of RESOLVE in a total of 417 patients. In October 2016, we announced the results of RESOLVE II, a phase III trial of 300 patients to assess the safety and efficacy of the product. The RESOLVE II clinical study met both primary efficacy endpoints, reduction in nasal congestion and polyp burden. We plan to submit a New Drug Application in the first quarter of 2017 to seek regulatory approval from the FDA to market the RESOLVE product.

 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, approximately 12% of the U.S. adult population, or 29 million people, are affected by chronic sinusitis, making it more prevalent than heart disease and asthma. Chronic sinusitis is an inflammatory condition in which the sinus lining becomes swollen and inflamed, leading to significant patient morbidity. Chronic sinusitis significantly impacts the quality of life of patients, including difficulty breathing, chronic headaches, recurrent infections, bodily pain and loss of sense of smell and taste. These persistent symptoms can severely impact a patients day-to-day well-being, resulting in frequent doctor visits and lost work productivity and can lead to chronic fatigue and depression. Chronic sinusitis is managed by a combination of medical management and surgical intervention. The first line of therapy is medical management involving antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids and decongestants. Sinusitis is the most common reason for adult outpatient antibiotic use in the United States, comprising 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions. Patients whose symptoms persist despite medical management are recommended to undergo functional endoscopic sinus surgery, or FESS. FESS is performed in the operating room to open the blocked sinus pathways by removing and/or displacing inflamed tissue and bone using surgical tools. Although sinus surgery can be effective, a majority of patients experience recurrent symptoms which commonly necessitate additional treatment with medications and surgery. 
 We estimate that there are more than 3.5 million people with chronic sinusitis who are managed by ENT physicians in the United States each year, many of whom we believe could benefit from products that incorporate our drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology. For PROPEL, PROPEL Mini and PROPEL Contour, our target market includes approximately 540,000 patients who undergo FESS for chronic sinusitis each year in the United States, with about 85% of those patients receiving treatment of the ethmoid sinus, approximately 30% receiving treatment of the frontal sinus and approximately 85% receiving treatment of the maxillary sinus, and with most patients receiving treatment for multiple sinuses. PROPEL Contour also positions us well to expand the availability of local steroid delivery in the office setting such as with sinus balloon dilation procedures, of which there are approximately 50,000 performed per year today. Long term, we believe that PROPEL Contour will provide a treatment option for the approximately 800,000 patients that are seen by an otolaryngologist each year for chronic sinusitis symptoms but choose not to undergo a surgical procedure. Our target market for RESOLVE, if approved, would include approximately 635,000 patients who have previously undergone FESS but continue to suffer symptoms of chronic sinusitis primarily due to polyp recurrence.

While our primary commercial focus is the U.S. market, both PROPEL and PROPEL Mini have received CE Markings, permitting them to be marketed in Europe. We have initiated efforts intended to support future expansion into international geographies. Approximately 450,000 and 250,000 FESS procedures are performed annually in the Asia Pacific and European regions, respectively. Our commercialization strategy will consider several factors including regulatory requirements, reimbursement coverage for our products, and key opinion leader support. Our initial focus is on Germany, where we are working to build broad reimbursement, and Japan, where we are working through the regulatory process. 
 As of December 31, 2016, we estimate that approximately 2,400 accounts have stocked our PROPEL implants for use by ENT physicians. Based on the number of units shipped as of December 31, 2016, we estimate that physicians have treated over 150,000 patients with our PROPEL implants. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we generated revenue of $78.7 million, $61.6 million and $38.6 million, respectively, and had a net loss of $25.2 million, $26.6 million and $18.4 million, for each respective year. As of December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $148.5 million. 
 We have expanded our sales organization and we intend to continue to grow our sales force in order to expand our communication of the benefits of our steroid releasing implants to our physician customers. We seek to grow our revenue by increasing the frequency of use of our products as well as by adding new physician users. 
 Overview of Sinusitis 
 The sinuses are a system of connected air-filled cavities located within the bones around the nose and eyes that allow for natural ventilation and drainage of mucus. There are four sinus cavities: ethmoid, frontal, maxillary and sphenoid. One of each type of sinus lies on either side of the face. The sinuses are lined with soft, pink tissue called mucosa, which serves to constantly cleanse the sinuses of impurities such as dust, dirt, allergens, pollutants and bacteria. To clear these inhaled pathogens, the sinus lining secretes mucus which is then cleared away by small, hair-like structures called cilia, which act in coordination to sweep the mucus through the sinus pathways and out through the back of the throat. 
 

The ethmoid sinuses, which lie between the eyes, are a series of small cells with multiple, often interconnected openings in a honeycomb-like formation. These sinuses serve as the central aeration and drainage pathway for all other sinuses. The frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses are known as dependent sinuses, as they each consist of one large cell that drains through an opening, or ostium, into the ethmoid sinus.

Chronic sinusitis is an inflammatory condition in which the sinus lining becomes swollen and inflamed, leading to significant patient morbidity including difficulty breathing, chronic headaches, recurrent infections, bodily pain and loss of sense of smell and taste. These persistent symptoms can severely impact a patients day-to-day well-being, resulting in frequent doctor visits and can lead to chronic fatigue and depression. The condition significantly reduces work productivity from absenteeism and reduced on-the-job effectiveness, especially meaningful given the average chronic sinusitis patient age of approximately 37 years. 
 

The debilitating patient symptoms and quality of life impairments attributed to chronic sinusitis create a significant healthcare burden to patients, insurers and employers. 
 Current Treatments for Chronic Sinusitis and Their Limitations 
 The treatment of chronic sinusitis often entails a combination of medical management and surgical intervention to treat the underlying inflammation of the sinus lining, while addressing the secondary symptoms caused by obstruction of the natural drainage pathways. 
Medical Management 
 The first line of therapy for chronic sinusitis is medical management, which typically includes prescribed antibiotics, anti-inflammatory steroids and decongestants. Despite limited efficacy of use of antibiotics in this patient population and the consequence of increasing bacterial resistance, we believe there is pervasive overuse of these drugs, which could lead to patient resistance and has resulted in sinusitis being identified as a major target in national efforts to reduce unnecessary medical intervention. Sinusitis is the most common reason for adult outpatient antibiotic use in the United States, comprising 11% of all antibiotic prescriptions. In addition, physicians often prescribe decongestants and other drugs to target mucus accumulation. 
 Steroids are prescribed in two forms, oral steroid pills and nasal steroid sprays, both of which have serious limitations. Oral steroid therapy is effective at reaching the sinus lining, but it does so by means of systemic exposure and therefore carries the risk of serious side effects, including glaucoma, bone loss, weight gain, psychosis and difficulty in controlling blood glucose levels in patients with diabetes. Nasal steroid sprays, commonly indicated for rhinitis, or inflammation of the nasal passage, are routinely prescribed for chronic

 sinusitis patients. While nasal steroid sprays avoid systemic exposure and thus lack such serious side effects, an estimated 70% of the drug is swallowed and the remainder is directed to the nasal passages, instead of the sinuses, which limits efficacy. In a published study, the fraction of drug deposited in the sinuses from a nasal steroid spray was measured to be less than 2%. Poor patient compliance further limits the effectiveness of nasal steroid sprays. Although medical management can reduce symptoms, an estimated 20% or more of chronic sinusitis patients who receive medical therapy are unresponsive. 
 Of note, medical management is not only used as a first line of therapy for patients afflicted with primary chronic sinusitis, situations in which patients have not had sinus surgery, but also for patients who have recurrent symptoms despite having had sinus surgery. Patients in both stages of the condition are managed medically and hence are subject to the limitations described above. 
 Sinus Surgery 
 In cases where patients are symptomatic despite medical management, a physician may recommend FESS. In the FESS procedure, the physician enlarges the inflamed and obstructed sinus pathways by displacing and/or removing inflamed tissue and bone in order to facilitate normal sinus drainage and aeration. First introduced in the United States in the 1980s, FESS is considered the standard of care for surgical intervention to treat chronic sinusitis. During most procedures, the honeycomb-like cells of the ethmoid sinuses are removed, resulting in one large open cavity. ENTs may also enlarge the frontal sinus by either surgically removing tissue or via balloon dilation. 
 FESS is typically performed under general anesthesia in an operating room. During the procedure, a physician inserts an endoscope into the nasal cavity to provide visualization of the patients anatomy. Surgical instruments, powered cutting tools and balloon dilation devices are used to remove or dilate obstructive tissue and bone. Following the surgical intervention, physicians often pack the newly opened ethmoid sinuses with gauze or other obstructive sinus packing materials to hold the sinus cavities open. A follow-up office visit is required several days after the procedure to remove the sinus packing materials and an additional one to two follow-up visits typically occur over the first four to six weeks following surgery to monitor for and treat complications. 
 While FESS is the standard of care for treating chronic sinusitis, it has several limitations: 
 

 | Limited effectiveness. Inflammation and scarring in the postoperative period are common and can compromise the surgical result by negatively impacting the ability of the sinuses to heal. This increases the need for continued medical management and additional surgical procedures. Within the first year after surgery, approximately 64% of patients experience recurrent symptoms.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Limited ability to address postoperative inflammation. While oral steroids prescribed postoperatively can be effective at addressing inflammation and scarring, the required doses are significant and can result in serious systemic side effects, including glaucoma, bone loss, weight gain, and psychosis. Further, oral steroids have restricted use in diabetic individuals, patients with glaucoma and certain psychological disorders. We believe, as a result, only 20% of physicians prescribe them routinely after surgery. The absence of anti-inflammatory steroid therapy leaves the surgical wound susceptible to postoperative complications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Pain and discomfort during postoperative period. During surgery, an ENT physician typically places sinus packing materials into the ethmoid sinuses to physically separate tissues in an attempt to prevent scarring and adhesions. Following surgery, physicians see patients two to three times in order to monitor for and, if necessary, to treat complications as well as remove these sinus packing materials. The sinus packing materials are removed by pulling or suctioning them from the newly opened cavity, a painful and time-consuming process, often necessitating pain medication. Moreover, the use of sinus packing materials obstructs the newly opened sinuses, leading to patient symptoms of congestion and discomfort. Despite the use of packing materials, scarring and adhesions are common, necessitating painful removal of additional tissue during postoperative treatments.

 | Potential for revision surgery. Within the first year after FESS, approximately 10% of patients will return to the operating room to undergo a revision procedure, while additional patients will return for a revision procedure after one year. We believe the risk of potential revision surgery is a significant deterrent to some patients that would otherwise undergo FESS for chronic sinusitis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Trend for treatment in the physicians office 
 Balloon sinus dilation devices along with other technological advances have expanded the treatable chronic sinusitis patient population. Sinus dilation is now being utilized by physicians in their offices to treat patients with mild chronic sinusitis who may not be willing to undergo or are not candidates for sinus surgery performed under general anesthesia in the operating room setting. The ability to treat patients in the office with sinus dilation has spurred interest amongst the ENT physician community for additional products that facilitate treatment of additional patients in the office setting. 
 We believe that because of the limitations of medical management and lack of disease resolution after FESS, many chronic sinusitis patients remain undertreated. We estimate that only a third of patients recommended for sinus surgery proceed with the potentially beneficial procedure, which we believe is due to its limitations and high risk for additional medical management and surgical revision. While balloon dilation has been introduced to open frontal, maxillary and sphenoid sinuses, or dependent sinuses, in a less invasive manner, balloons are not designed to treat disease in the most commonly involved sinuses, the ethmoids, and they do not address the underlying inflammation associated with chronic sinusitis. We believe that an opportunity exists to reach these undertreated patients by providing a more effective option to address their inflammatory disease, while improving the overall outcomes of FESS. 
 Our Solution 
 We are building a portfolio of products based on our drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology that are designed to provide localized drug delivery to treat patients across the continuum of care in chronic sinusitis, including products that may be used in the operating room or office setting of care. To-date, we have developed and commercialized PROPEL and PROPEL Mini, and are working to launch the recently approved PROPEL Contour. We also are working on development of RESOLVE, a bioabsorbable implant designed to treat patients who have had FESS but continue to suffer recurring symptoms of chronic sinusitis. 
Our Technology Platform 
 Our drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology consists of a polymer-based implant that is coated with a drug and polymer matrix. In fabricating the implant, we use polymers that are bioabsorbable and, over time, gradually and fully absorb into the body. The polymers chosen are materials with established safety profiles and have been used in medical devices for over 30 years. 
 Our innovative design process enables us to develop the mechanical and drug delivery features independently, lending to our customization capability. Our highly specialized bioabsorbable polymer engineering capability, allows us to design the implant with various physical characteristics depending on the size, radial strength and other attributes that are appropriate to enable treatment of the underlying disease in its location. Our implants are designed to be self-expanding, which facilitates insertion when compressed, and expand to conform to the surrounding anatomy after insertion. The ability to control radial strength is important in enabling us to address different diseases at different states. For example, in some instances an implant may be used to maintain an already open passageway. In other situations, an implant with significantly greater strength may mechanically dilate a diseased passageway. 
 
6 
 
Our expertise in drug delivery allows us to effectively pair appropriate polymer delivery matrices with desired therapeutic agents. This allows us to select the therapeutic agent based on its clinical effectiveness and tailor the platform accordingly. In the case of PROPEL, we considered the wide range of off-patent corticosteroids, chose the one best suited for treatment of sinus inflammation, then customized the polymer delivery. Once a drug is selected, our specialized capability in drug formulation allow us to control the speed at which the drug elutes, allowing us to design implants from which the drug is released over a matter of weeks to even longer durations. As a result, we have the flexibility to select the type of drug to be used on the implant and then engineer the implant to control the amount, timing and delivery of the drug. 
 Our Commercial and Clinical Stage Products 
 We currently market PROPEL, which is indicated for use following ethmoid sinus surgery, and PROPEL Mini, which is indicated for use following ethmoid and/or frontal sinus surgery. We also just received approval of PROPEL Contour and are about to initiate commercial launch. PROPEL Contour is approved for use in the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia, or openings. In addition, we completed clinical evaluations in 2016 of RESOLVE, our pipeline products.

 PROPEL and PROPEL Mini 
 Our steroid releasing implants are the first and only FDA-approved drug releasing implants for chronic sinusitis sufferers 18 years or older. PROPEL is indicated for use following ethmoid sinus surgery and PROPEL Mini is indicated for use following ethmoid or frontal sinus surgery. Our PROPEL implants are designed to improve the outcomes of sinus surgery by holding open the sinus passageways, thereby reducing postoperative inflammation and scarring. These implants are inserted by a physician under endoscopic visualization following sinus surgery. Once inserted, the self-expanding implants conform to and hold open the surgically enlarged sinus, while gradually releasing an anti-inflammatory steroid, mometasone furoate, which is available generically, directly to the sinus lining over a period of approximately 30 days. The implants fully absorb into the body over a period of four to six weeks or are removed at the discretion of a physician during a routine office visit. Once absorbed or removed, the implant no longer provides structural support.

The graphic below illustrates the operation of PROPEL and PROPEL Mini in the ethmoid sinuses: 
 

We designed the steroid drug release of PROPEL and PROPEL Mini for a duration of approximately 30 days to match the postoperative healing cycle characterized in published medical literature. We selected mometasone furoate as the anti-inflammatory agent among numerous evaluated compounds based on three important characteristics: absorbability, binding affinity and low systemic bioavailability. The compound preferentially absorbs into the sinus lining instead of the surrounding mucous fluid. The drug has the highest glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity, making it highly potent in preventing inflammation once within tissue. Glucocorticoid receptors are the molecules in the surface membranes of cells throughout the body to which corticosteroids chemically bind. Additionally, the compound has low systemic bioavailability, meaning that it has negligible systemic safety side effects. 
 

PROPEL and PROPEL Mini steroid releasing implants | PROPEL and PROPEL Mini implant delivery systems

 We believe the principal benefits of our PROPEL steroid releasing implants include: 
 

 | Improved surgical outcomes. Our implants have been clinically proven to improve FESS results by reducing postoperative inflammation and scarring. In a meta-analysis of prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies, our implants provided a 46% relative reduction in inflammation and a 70% relative reduction in scarring compared to the control implant. Postoperative complications, such as inflammation and polyps as well as scarring or adhesions, are common reasons for FESS failure.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Targeted steroid therapy to address postoperative inflammation. Our implants are the first and only FDA approved drug releasing bioabsorbable sinus implants. They deliver an anti-inflammatory steroid postoperatively directly to the sinus lining in a controlled fashion over a period of approximately 30 days, which helps in the wound healing process. In a meta-analysis of prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies, our implants reduced the need for oral steroids by 40% compared to the control implant.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Improved healing without obstruction. Our implants improve postoperative care. Once inserted, the self-expanding implants are designed to conform to and hold open the surgically enlarged ethmoid sinuses until fully absorbed into the body, which improves wound healing without obstructing the sinuses and causing congestion. Our steroid releasing implants are designed to obviate the need for sinus packing materials, which can be a significant source of postoperative pain and discomfort. Our implants significantly reduce scarring and adhesions, which reduces the potential for pain in postoperative treatments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Reduced need for postoperative surgical interventions. In clinical studies, our implants demonstrated a significant reduction in the need for postoperative surgical intervention. In a meta-analysis of prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies, our implants provided a 35% relative reduction in the need for postoperative oral steroids and surgical intervention compared to the control implant when placed in the ethmoid sinus. In addition, the PROGRESS study, a prospective, randomized, blinded, multicenter trial, demonstrated a statistically significant 38% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions compared to surgery alone when PROPEL Mini was placed in the frontal sinus. We believe that patients who have been deterred by the high revision rates associated with FESS may now consider surgical intervention to treat their chronic sinusitis condition.

 PROPEL Contour 
 In February 2017, we received FDA approval for PROPEL Contour, a steroid releasing implant designed to facilitate treatment of the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia, or openings, of the dependent sinuses, which we believe represents an opportunity for adoption in a variety of settings for chronic sinusitis sufferers 18 years or older. In the operating room, PROPEL Contour has the potential to lead to expanded adoption of steroid releasing implants overall by providing physicians with a range of products needed to customize treatment based on their patients disease and anatomy. In particular, we believe PROPEL Contour will be seen as the right fit for many of the 30% of sinus surgeries that involve the frontal sinuses today and the lower profile, malleable delivery system will increase usage particularly in those patients whose frontal sinuses are more challenging to access. 
 
RESOLVE 
 The underlying chronic inflammation associated with chronic sinusitis can lead to recurrent obstruction of the sinus cavity over time following sinus surgery, especially in patients afflicted with polyps, a sign of severe inflammation. Improving care of such chronic patients holds meaningful opportunity to significantly reduce healthcare costs by preventing revision surgery. We have designed the RESOLVE steroid releasing implant to be placed in the physician office setting during a routine visit as an alternative treatment option for patients who are candidates for revision surgery. The implant is based on the same drug releasing bioabsorbable implant technology as PROPEL, but is designed to have greater radial strength in order to dilate an obstructed, polyp-filled sinus cavity, and deliver drug for an extended period of time. RESOLVE is subject to regulation as a drug 
 
9 
 
 product and we intend to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, to seek approval from the FDA to commercialize RESOLVE in the U.S. We intend to pursue the NDA for this implant under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. Section 505(b)(2) would enable us to rely, in part, on the FDAs findings of safety and efficacy for an existing product, or published literature, in support of our NDA. 
 
Our family of drug releasing implants consists of polymers that control local drug release and provide structural support to adjacent tissues during the healing process. We believe the development, manufacturing and regulatory approval for products incorporating this technology requires capabilities in polymer science, drug delivery, analytical testing and combination products. These competencies allow our technical team to tailor drug formulation, polymer design, drug release duration, implant radial strength and degradation period to meet different clinical needs. We may apply these competencies to the development of new products over time. Such new products, or changes that we make in the therapeutic agent used in our products will require FDA approval prior to commercialization in the United States. 
 Clinical Trial Findings and In-Process Studies 
 PROPEL and PROPEL Mini 
 PROPEL Ethmoid Sinus Studies. The safety and efficacy of PROPEL in the ethmoid sinuses has been studied in three prospective, multicenter clinical trials conducted in the United States enrolling a total of 205 patients. The principal safety and efficacy information is derived from the ADVANCE II randomized clinical trial and is supported by the ADVANCE clinical trial and an initial pilot study. A meta-analysis that pooled data from the ADVANCE II study and the initial pilot study provides further evidence of efficacy. In all three studies, implants were placed following ethmoid sinus surgery, or ethmoidectomy, which entails removal of the honeycomb-like partitions between the ethmoid sinuses in order to create larger sinus cavities. 
 All three studies were designed to measure PROPELs ability to improve the outcomes of sinus surgery. This included measuring the need for postoperative interventions such as adhesion lysis, which is a procedure to separate scar tissue and adhesions within the sinus cavity, and the need to prescribe oral steroids to treat inflammation. The studies also measured the impact of PROPEL on other postoperative complications, such as occurrence of polyposis and middle turbinate lateralization. Prevention of these complications contributes to the long-term success of sinus surgery. Polyposis represents a higher level inflammatory disease. The middle turbinate is a bony structure in the middle of the sinus, responsible for filtration, heating, and humidification of nasal air flow. Middle turbinate lateralization is an undesired complication where this structure curves towards the outer, or lateral, wall of the nose resulting in blockage of the ethmoid sinus passage. 
 In a meta-analysis, the two prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-blind studies enrolled a total of 143 patients utilizing an intra-patient control design. The results of these two trials, the ADVANCE II study and the initial Pilot study, were then pooled which represents the first and only Level 1a evidence for any devices used in sinus surgery today. Level 1a evidence is the highest level of evidence according to the criteria of the Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford. For evidence Level 1a, a meta-analysis of multiple randomized controlled trials is required. 
 
10 
 
Compared to the control implant, the drug releasing implant provided a 35% relative reduction in postoperative interventions, a 51% relative reduction in adhesion lysis and a 40% relative reduction in oral steroid intervention. The relative reduction in frank polyposis was 46%. Additional efficacy endpoints of significant, or severe, adhesions and middle turbinate lateralization, determined by clinical investigators at the study centers, were reduced by 70% (p=0.0013) and 75% (p=0.0225), respectively.

 PROPEL Mini Frontal Sinus Study. We have completed a prospective, randomized blinded multicenter clinical trial to support an expanded indication for placement of PROPEL Mini in the frontal sinuses called PROGRESS. Approximately 30% of patients undergoing sinus surgery for chronic sinusitis suffers from frontal sinus disease. We enrolled 80 patients in the study using an intra-patient control design to assess both safety and efficacy of PROPEL Mini when placed following surgery of the frontal sinus, compared to surgery alone. The primary efficacy endpoint is the reduction in need for postoperative interventions such as the need for surgical intervention or oral steroids. In August 2015, we announced preliminary topline data from the PROGRESS trial, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PROPEL Mini when placed in the frontal sinuses following surgery, showing that the study met its primary efficacy endpoint and demonstrating a statistically significant 38% relative reduction in the need for postoperative interventions compared to surgery alone. In March 2016, we received approval to expand the indication of PROPEL Mini to treat patients undergoing frontal sinus surgery. 
 PROPEL Contour 
 In February 2017, we received FDA approval for PROPEL Contour, a steroid releasing implant designed to facilitate treatment of the frontal and maxillary sinus ostia, or openings, of the dependent sinuses, which we believe represents opportunity for adoption in a variety of settings. In the operating room, PROPEL Contour has the potential to lead to expanded adoption of steroid releasing implants overall by providing physicians with a range of products needed to customize treatment based on their patients disease and anatomy. In particular, we believe PROPEL Contours lower profile, malleable delivery system will increase usage particularly in those patients whose frontal sinuses are more challenging to access. Since sinus surgeries typically involve treatment of one or more of the ethmoid, maxillary or frontal sinuses, we believe the PROPEL Contour greatly increases the chance that a PROPEL product will be used. We announced results of the second cohort of patients in the PROGRESS study in May 2016. This phase of the PROGRESS study was an 80-patient prospective randomized blinded multicenter trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of PROPEL Contour when placed in the frontal sinuses following sinus surgery. This study demonstrated a statistically significant 65% relative reduction in the need for post-operative interventions, such as the need for additional surgical procedures or need for oral steroid prescription, compared to surgery alone with standard post-operative care. 
 RESOLVE 
 We are pursuing FDA approval of RESOLVE, a steroid releasing implant for refractory disease for the treatment of patients in the physician office setting. This products primary mode of action is as a drug, and for this reason will require NDA approval from the FDA, rather than PMA approval. In order to support an NDA application with the FDA, we have completed four studies of this product candidate including clinical evaluation of safety and efficacy: a pilot study, a pharmacokinetic study, RESOLVE and RESOLVE II. We completed enrollment in July 2016 of the RESOLVE II pivotal trial, a prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled, blinded study of 300 patients. Both co-primary endpoints were met, including improvement in nasal obstruction/
 
11 
 
 congestion (p=0.0074) and reduction in bilateral polyp grade as evaluated by a panel of three ENT experts (p=0.0073). In addition, key secondary endpoints were also met, including the reduction in the need for repeat sinus surgery, reduction in ethmoid obstruction and improvement in sense of smell. We also performed a longer-term study to assess the RESOLVE efficacy, including a six-month impact of patients enrolled in the RESOLVE study. The results of this 100 patient study showed that control patients were at 3.6x higher risk of remaining indicated for revision surgery than treated patients. 
 Seasonality 
 In the first quarter, demand for our products may be impacted by adverse weather and by resetting of annual patient healthcare insurance plan deductibles, both of which may cause patients to delay or decline elective procedures such as FESS. In the second quarter, demand may be impacted by the seasonal nature of allergies, the resultant onset of sinus-related symptoms and the growth of high deductible insurance plans which may cause patients to delay or decline elective surgery until their deductible is met later in the year. In the third quarter, the number of FESS procedures nationwide is historically lower than other quarters throughout the year, which we believe is attributable to the summer vacations of ENT physicians and their patients. In the fourth quarter, demand may be higher due to the onset of the cold and flu season and related symptoms, as well as the desire of patients to spend their remaining balances in flexible-spending accounts or because they have met their annual deductibles under their health insurance plans. 
Competition 
 Our industry is highly competitive, subject to change and significantly affected by new product introductions and other activities of industry participants. Many of the companies developing or marketing ENT products are publicly traded or are divisions of publicly-traded companies and may enjoy competitive advantages including: 

 | greater financial and human capital resources;
--+-----------------------------------------------


 | significantly greater name recognition;
--+----------------------------------------


 | established relationships with ENT physicians, referring physicians, customers and third-party payors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | additional lines of products, and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer greater discounts or incentives to gain a competitive advantage; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | established sales, marketing and worldwide distribution networks.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

 Because of the size of the market opportunity for the treatment of chronic sinusitis, potential competitors have historically dedicated and will continue to dedicate significant resources to aggressively promote their products or develop new products. New product developments that could compete with us more effectively are possible because of the prevalence of chronic sinusitis and the extensive research efforts and technological progress that exist within the market. Large medical device companies with ENT divisions, such as Medtronic, also have capability in drug releasing stents. 
 Our commercially available products are designed to be used following sinus surgery. If another company successfully develops a surgical approach to the treatment of sinusitis that would not benefit from the use of our steroid releasing implants, if another company develops a device to treat the inflammation and scarring associated with sinus surgery that is more efficacious than our steroid releasing implants or if a pharmaceutical company successfully develops a drug that addresses chronic sinusitis without the need for surgical intervention, sales of our products would be significantly and adversely affected. 
 The alternative to delivering steroids to the sinuses postoperatively with PROPEL is the prescription of oral steroids. While oral steroids prescribed postoperatively can be effective at addressing inflammation and scarring, the required doses are significant and can result in serious systemic side effects, including glaucoma, bone loss, weight gain and psychosis. Further, oral steroids have restricted use in diabetic individuals, patients with 
 
12 
 
 glaucoma and some psychological disorders. We believe, as a result, only 20% of physicians prescribe them routinely after surgery. Additionally, there are commercially available packing materials on the market that provide a spacing function and are less expensive than PROPEL. During surgery, approximately 60% of ENT physicians place sinus packing materials, either absorbable or non-absorbable, into the ethmoid sinuses to physically separate tissues in an attempt to prevent scarring and adhesions. Sinus packing materials are not placed in the frontal sinuses. Following surgery, the sinus packing materials are removed by pulling or suctioning them from the newly opened cavity, a painful and time-consuming process, often necessitating pain medication. Despite the use of packing materials, scarring and adhesions are common, necessitating painful removal of additional tissue during postoperative treatments. Some physicians choose to soak these packing materials with steroid in liquid form in an effort to deliver steroid to the sinus. This practice is off-label and is not supported by clinical data. However, although we believe PROPEL, PROPEL Mini and PROPEL Contour have significant advantages over sinus packing materials and other treatment options, they are expensive relative to packing materials and may not be reimbursed by third-party payors. As a result, ENT physicians may choose to use oral steroid delivery or packing materials or a combination of the two, which are less expensive, in lieu of PROPEL, PROPEL Mini or PROPEL Contour. 
 We believe that our continued ability to compete favorably depends on: 
 

 | successfully expanding our commercial operations;
--+--------------------------------------------------


 | continuing to innovate and maintain scientifically-advanced technology;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | having reimbursement in place to support broad adoption of our products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | developing technologies for applications in the sinuses and other areas of ENT;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | attracting and retaining skilled personnel;
--+--------------------------------------------


 | obtaining patents or other intellectual property protection for our products; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | conducting clinical studies and obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property 
 As of December 31, 2016, we owned 77 issued patents globally, of which 30 were issued U.S. patents, and we owned 37 pending patent applications globally, of which 13 were pending patent applications in the United States. Subject to payments of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges, our issued U.S. patents have expiration dates between 2017 and 2032, of which two will expire by 2020, 19 will expire between 2021 and 2025, and the remaining 56 will expire after 2025. 
 As of December 31, 2016, our trademark portfolio contains 29 trademark registrations, four of which are U.S. trademark registrations, as well as 29 foreign and six U.S. pending trademark applications. 
 We also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and may rely upon licensing opportunities in the future, to develop and maintain our competitive position. We protect our proprietary rights through a variety of methods, including confidentiality agreements and proprietary information agreements with suppliers, employees, consultants and others who may have access to proprietary information. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We manufacture our steroid releasing implants at our facility in Menlo Park, California with components supplied by external suppliers. We perform inspections of these components before use in our manufacturing operations. Using these components, we assemble, inspect, test and package our implants, and send them to a third-party sterilization vendor. After sterilization, we perform inspections of the finished implants internally and via third-party laboratories to determine compliance with our specifications, after which we place the implants into our inventory and ultimately ship the finished products to customers. 
 
13 
 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, and a number of our critical components used in our implants are supplied to us from single source suppliers. We rely on single source suppliers for some of our polymer materials, some extrusions and molded components and some off-the-shelf components. Our ability to commercially supply our products and to develop our product candidates depends, in part, on our ability to successfully obtain the API and polymer materials used in these products in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for commercialization and clinical testing. We have entered into manufacturing, supply or quality agreements with a number of our single source suppliers pursuant to which they supply the API and components we need. We generally acquire our single source components pursuant to purchase orders placed in the ordinary course of business. However, we are not certain that our single source suppliers will be able to meet our demand for their products, whether because of the nature of our agreements with those suppliers, our limited experience with those suppliers or our relative importance as a customer to those suppliers. It may be difficult for us to assess their ability to timely meet our demand in the future. To date, we have not experienced any significant supply constraints or delays in procuring components and materials and while our suppliers have generally met our demand for their products on a timely basis in the past, they may subordinate our needs in the future to the needs of their other customers. 
 We continue to improve our manufacturing capabilities and increasing capacity as we increase the extent of our commercialization efforts. We believe our manufacturing operations are in compliance with regulations mandated by the FDA. We are an FDA-registered medical device and drug manufacturer and we were granted PMA approval for PROPEL in August 2011. Our manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to periodic inspections and audits by various federal, state and foreign regulatory agencies. For example, our facilities were inspected by the FDA in April and May 2011, December 2012, March 2013 and June 2014. The State of California regulatory authority audited our manufacturing facility in connection with granting a California Device Manufacturing License to us in August 2009. We maintain ISO 13485 certification. Our facility was last inspected in November 2016 by the European Notified Body in Ireland, National Standards Authority of Ireland, or NSAI, and no major nonconformance reports were issued as a result of that inspection. 
 We have manufacturing, supply or quality agreements with a number of our single source suppliers: 
 

 | In April 2014, we entered into an agreement with Hovione Inter Ltd., or Hovione, pursuant to which we are required to purchase 80% of our API from Hovione, in quantities to be specified in 12-month forecasts provided by us and updated on a quarterly basis. This agreement extends until April 2019. Either we or Hovione may terminate the agreement prior to that date for uncured material breach by or insolvency of the other party. We may also terminate the agreement in the event Hovione loses any required FDA approval rendering it unable to fulfill its contractual obligations, or if Hovione is engaged in felonious or fraudulent activities. Either we or Hovione may terminate the Agreement in the event regulatory agencies require changes to the product specifications that materially affect Hoviones cost of production and we are unable to reach an agreement with Hovione regarding an equitable pricing adjustment.

 | In April 2014, we entered into an agreement with Polymer Solutions Incorporated, or PSI, pursuant to which PSI supplies us with analytical testing services for our polymer materials. The agreement has an indefinite term, but may be terminated by us at any time upon 30 days notice to PSI or immediately upon written notice in the event of an uncured material breach by PSI. In April 2016, this agreement was amended with testing services pricing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In January 2014, we entered into an agreement with AIM Plastics, Inc., or AIM, pursuant to which AIM provides us with injection molded components in quantities to be specified in rolling quarterly forecasts provided by us. The agreement extends for an initial period of one year from its effective date, with automatic one-year renewal periods applying thereafter unless we or AIM provide written notice of non-renewal at least 30 days prior to the end of the then-current term. Either we or AIM may terminate the agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party. We may also terminate the agreement upon twelve months written notice in the event of a change in control of AIM. In February 2016, this agreement was amended with updated forecasts and component pricing.

 | In October 2015, we entered into an agreement with Exova Group Limited, or Exova, pursuant to which Exova supplies us with analytical testing services for our finished product. This agreement extends until December 2017.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | In November 2013, we entered into an agreement with Stephen Gould Corporation, or SGC, pursuant to which SGC supplies us with packaging components in accordance with a rolling quarterly forecast provided by us. The agreement extends for an initial period of two years from the effective date, with automatic one-year renewal periods applying thereafter unless we or SGC provide written notice of intent not to renew at least 30 days prior to the end of the then current term. Either we or SGC may terminate the agreement for uncured material breach by the other party. We may also terminate the agreement at will upon 90 days prior written notice to SGC, or upon twelve months prior written notice in the event of a change in control of SGC. In October 2015, this agreement was amended with updated rolling forecasts and component pricing, and in August 2016, this agreement was amended with component pricing.

 Each of these suppliers manufactures the components they produce for us or tests our components and devices to our specifications. We expect to be able to negotiate new agreements with these vendors in advance of the expiration of the current agreements. We intend to maintain sufficient supplies of the API and components from these single source suppliers in the event that our agreements with one or more of these suppliers were to terminate to enable us to continue to manufacture our implants for a sufficient amount of time necessary to obtain another source of API or components. 
 Government Regulation 
 United States Regulation of Medical Devices and Drugs 
 Our products and product candidates are drug releasing bioabsorbable implants that are regulated as combination products by the FDA. FDAs Office of Combination Products designates a primary mode of action for such drug-device combination products, with the respective primary Center within the FDA leading the regulatory review for the product, in consultation with the secondary designated Center. FDA determined that the primary mode of action for PROPEL, PROPEL Mini and PROPEL Contour was that of a medical device, so these products have been approved and are regulated in the United States as medical devices. Our product candidate RESOLVE, for the physician office setting, however, was designated as having a drug primary mode of action, and thus our RESOLVE trials were conducted under an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application, and this product candidate will need to be approved under the NDA pathway. 
Medical Devices 
 Our PROPEL implants are regulated in the United States as Class III medical devices by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA. The FDA classifies medical devices into one of three classes based upon controls the FDA considers necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class I devices are subject to general controls such as labeling, adherence to good manufacturing practices and maintenance of product complaint records, but are usually exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls and also are subject to special controls such as performance standards, and FDA guidelines, and may also require clinical testing prior to approval. Class III devices are subject to the highest level of controls and require rigorous clinical testing prior to their approval and generally require a PMA, or a PMA supplement approval prior to their sale. 
 Manufacturers must file an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, application if human clinical studies of a device are required and if the investigational use of the device represents a potential for significant risk to the patient. The IDE application must be supported by data, typically including the results of animal and engineering testing of the device. If the IDE application is approved by the FDA, human clinical studies may begin at a 
 
15 
 
 specific number of investigational sites with a maximum number of patients, as approved by the FDA. The clinical studies must be conducted under the review of an independent institutional review board to ensure the protection of the patients rights. 
 Generally, upon completion of these human clinical studies, a manufacturer seeks approval of a Class III medical device from the FDA by submitting a PMA application. A PMA application must be supported by extensive data, including the results of the clinical studies, as well as testing and literature to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device. PMA approval may be conditioned upon the conduct of certain post-approval studies, such as long term follow-up studies. 
 FDA regulations require us to register as a medical device manufacturer with the FDA. Additionally, the California Department of Health Services, or CDHS, requires us to register as a medical device manufacturer within the state. In order to maintain CE Markings, we must maintain compliance with ISO 13485. Because of this, the FDA and the NSAI inspect us on a routine basis for compliance with current good manufacturing practices. These regulations require that we manufacture our products and maintain related documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to manufacturing, testing and control activities, and product release for distribution. We have undergone and expect to continue to undergo regular current good manufacturing practice inspections in connection with the manufacture of our products at our facility. 
 Drugs 
 The clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, distribution, record keeping, advertising, promotion, import, export and marketing, among other things, of our product candidate RESOLVE, that is subject to the FDAs drug authority, are governed by extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The FDA, under the FDCA, regulates pharmaceutical products in the United States. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the United States generally include: 

 | preclinical laboratory tests and animal tests conducted under Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials commence;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product and conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | the submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+-------------------------------------


 | FDA acceptance, review and approval of the NDA; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is made to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Reimbursement 
When our products are used in the operating room of a hospital or ambulatory surgery center, which accounts for the majority of product use, the products are commonly treated as general supplies utilized in sinus surgery and the cost is included in payment to the facility for the FESS procedure. When our products are used in the office setting of care, the provider may submit claims using our current product and procedure codes. Payment for these claims is subject to the payors medical policy and dependent on the providers efforts to fight for coverage on the basis of medical necessity. We are working to assist providers with appealing for coverage for patients, convert our current product and procedure codes to permanent codes, and to expand the number of payors with policies deeming the use of steroid releasing implants to be medically necessary in order to help establish and expand in-office use of PROPEL Contour and, if approved, RESOLVE.
