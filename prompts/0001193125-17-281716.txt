Business Introduction 
 Xcerra Corporation (Xcerra, the Company, we or us), formerly known as LTX-Credence Corporation, is a global provider of test and handling capital equipment, interface products, test fixtures and related services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries. We design, manufacture and market products and services that address the broad, divergent requirements of the mobility, industrial, medical, automotive and consumer end markets, offering a comprehensive portfolio of solutions and technologies, and a global network of strategically deployed applications and support resources. We operate in the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing test markets through our atg-Luther & Maelzer, Everett Charles Technologies (ECT), LTX-Credence and Multitest businesses. We have a broad spectrum of semiconductor and printed circuit board (PCB) test expertise that drives innovative new products and services and our ability to deliver fully integrated semiconductor test solutions. 
 On November 30, 2015, we completed the sale of our semiconductor test interface board business based in Santa Clara, CA (the Interface Board Business) to Fastprint Hong Kong Co., Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of Shenzhen Fastprint Circuit Tech Co., Ltd, and its affiliates (collectively, Fastprint), pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement, entered into between us and Fastprint on September 8, 2015 (the Purchase Agreement). The Interface Board Business produces printed circuit boards that are specifically designed to serve as an interface between the tester and the semiconductor device, or the semiconductor wafer, being tested. 
 We sold and transferred to Fastprint certain assets used in or primarily related to the Interface Board Business (the Assets), and assigned, and Fastprint assumed, certain specified liabilities associated with the Interface Board Business (the Assumed Liabilities), along with the transfer of the employees associated with that business, all pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. The purchase price for the Assets and the Assumed Liabilities was $23.0 million (the Purchase Price). Fastprint also agreed to pay for the accrued and unpaid vacation of certain U.S. employees transferring to Fastprint (the Accrued U.S. Compensation Amount). At the Closing, Fastprint paid Everett Charles, as designated by us, the aggregate cash sum of $21.4 million consisting of $20.7 million of the Purchase Price and the Accrued U.S. Compensation Amount, plus certain prepaid amounts. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, $2.3 million of the purchase price was payable on the first anniversary of the Closing subject to claims for indemnification by Fastprint, if any, prior to that time. As of the first anniversary date of the Closing, there were no claims for indemnification made by Fastprint, and the holdback was paid to ECT on December 1, 2016. 
 Semiconductor designers and manufacturers worldwide use our test and handling equipment and interface products (test contactors and probe pins) to test their devices during the manufacturing process. The devices our products test are incorporated into a wide range of products, including personal computers; mobile internet equipment such as wireless access points and interfaces; broadband access products such as cable modems and set top boxes; personal communication and entertainment products such as mobile phones and tablets; consumer products such as televisions, videogame systems and digital cameras; automobile electronics; and power management devices used in portable and automotive electronics. 
 Our PCB test systems are used to verify the quality of the pre-assembled PCB before individual components, including integrated circuits, are installed onto the PCB. Our test fixture products are consumable components used by PCB test systems to test assembled PCBs. The types of PCBs that are tested using our systems are incorporated into a diverse set of electronic products including network servers, personal computers, tablets and mobile phones.

 For our semiconductor test-related businesses we focus our marketing and sales efforts on integrated device manufacturers (IDMs); outsourced semiconductor assembly and test providers (OSATs), which perform assembly and testing services for the semiconductor industry; and fabless semiconductor companies, which design integrated circuits but have no manufacturing capability. We offer our customers a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor test systems, test handlers and interface products and provide a global network of strategically deployed applications and support resources. For our PCB test systems and PCB assembly test fixtures and design services, we focus our marketing and sales efforts on the manufacturers of PCBs, as well as the companies into whose products the PCBs are incorporated. 
 Our objective is to be the leading supplier of market-focused, cost-optimized test solutions for the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing test markets. Key elements of our growth strategy include: 
 

 | Continue to introduce new, innovative products. We intend to continue to invest in the development of new test solutions designed to meet evolving customer demands such as achieving the lowest cost of test and reducing the time to high volume production on new products. We intend to leverage our existing technical expertise and continue to invest significant resources both in our current solutions and in developing solutions that address new markets as well as new segments of existing markets.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Leverage total test cell capabilities. We believe we are the only supplier capable of providing a total test cell solution and will continue to leverage this unique capability with our customers. Our customers historically have had to source disparate test products from multiple third-party providers to create their own solutions, which can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs. By offering a total test cell solution, we are able to help customers better fulfill their testing requirements and improve their overall manufacturing and testing process.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Generate cross-selling opportunities between our leading brands. Our Multitest and ECT businesses offer significant cross-selling opportunities across our brands and product portfolio. We will continue

to build and strengthen our relationships with existing customers, as we believe there are significant opportunities to cross-sell load boards, test contactors and test handlers to our existing semiconductor ATE customers.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Increase additional sales of test handlers and consumables through our existing distribution relationships. We have expanded our relationship with our largest distributor to include test handlers and consumables, which will enable us to better serve customers in fast-growing geographies, including China and Taiwan.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions. We may pursue acquisitions that complement our strengths and help us execute our strategies. Our acquisition strategy is designed to accelerate our revenue growth, expand our technology portfolio and grow our addressable market.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Continue to improve operational efficiency. In order to focus our resources, improve our responsiveness to customer needs, reduce fixed costs and working capital requirements and manage the cyclicality of our industry more effectively, we have implemented a lean, flexible business model. We intend to continue to identify and implement programs which enhance our ability to meet customers needs while reducing fixed costs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are headquartered and have a development facility in Norwood, Massachusetts. We also have manufacturing and other development facilities located in Milpitas, and Fontana, California; Rosenheim, Germany; Wertheim, Germany; Shenzhen, China; Singapore; Penang, Malaysia and Hsinchu City, Taiwan and sales and service facilities located across the world to support our customer base. As a result of the sale of our Interface Board Business to Fastprint, we no longer operate a facility in Santa Clara, California. 
 We were incorporated in Massachusetts in 1976 as LTX Corporation. In connection with our August 2008 merger with Credence Systems Corporation, we changed our name to LTX-Credence Corporation and, following the acquisition of our Multitest and ECT businesses, we changed our name to Xcerra Corporation in May 2014.

 Industry Overview 
 We provide test solutions to the large and growing electronics manufacturing industry, of which semiconductors and PCBs are key components. 
 Sales of capital equipment products are driven by the expansion of manufacturing and test capacity, or when customers replace existing equipment with new equipment. Sales of consumable products, which include service, are driven by the level of manufacturing and test activity, and need to be replaced based on usage levels or to accommodate new designs or test techniques. Therefore, overall demand for our capital equipment and consumable products and services is generally dependent on growth in the semiconductor and electronics industry. 
 In particular, three primary characteristics of the industry in which we operate drive the demand for our products and services: 
 

i) | Increases in unit production of semiconductor devices and PCBs. The proliferation of sophisticated electronic devices including tablets, consumer electronics, the growth of the telecommunications industry and mobile devices capable of accessing the internet, the increased use of digital signal processing (DSP) devices, and the expansion of semiconductor devices in automotive and power management applications are driving a corresponding need for semiconductor and PCB test solutions.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


ii) | Increases in the complexity of semiconductor devices and PCBs used in electronic products. Increasing demand continues worldwide for smaller, more highly integrated electronic products. This has led to higher performance and increasing complexity of the semiconductor devices that operate and power these electronic products. To the extent a customers existing test equipment is not able to meet the requirements of these new devices, there is a corresponding increase in demand for equally sophisticated semiconductor and PCB test solutions.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


iii) | Emergence of next generation electronic products requiring new semiconductor and PCB technologies. The introduction of new generations of end-user electronics products requires the development of new semiconductor device and PCB technologies. The increase in complexity of leading edge end-user devices, and, ultimately, the emergence of new semiconductor device and PCB technologies have mandated changes in the design, architecture and complexity of semiconductor and PCB test solutions. Semiconductor and PCB manufacturers must be able to test the increasing volume and complexity of their devices in a reliable, cost-effective, efficient and flexible manner.

Products and Services 
 We offer a wide range of products and services to the semiconductor and electronics manufacturing industries, including semiconductor automated test equipment (ATE), test handlers, bare board PCB test equipment, test contactors, probe pins and loaded PCB test fixtures. In accordance with the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Topic 280, Segment Reporting to the FASB ASC (ASC 280), for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 (fiscal 2017), we determined that we have six operating segments 
 
4 
 
 (Semiconductor Test, Semiconductor Handlers, Contactors, PCB Test, Probes / Pins, and Fixtures). Based on the aggregation criteria of ASC 280, we determined that several of the operating segments can be aggregated due to these segments having similar economic characteristics and meeting all of the other aggregation criteria in ASC 280. Consequently, we have two reportable segments: the Semiconductor Test Solutions (STS) reportable segment, which is comprised of the Semiconductor Test, Semiconductor Handlers, and Contactors operating segments, and the Electronic Manufacturing Solutions (EMS) reportable segment, which is comprised of the PCB Test, Probes / Pins, and Fixtures operating segments. This financial reporting structure was implemented effective as of December 1, 2013, the acquisition date of Multitest and ECT. Refer to Note 10, Segment, Industry and Geographic and Significant Customer Segment Information, contained in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on our reportable segments. 
 Our revenue from our capital equipment products is driven by the capital expenditure budgets and spending patterns of our customers, who often delay or accelerate purchases in reaction to variations in their business. The level of capital expenditures by these companies depends on the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductor devices and PCBs and the products that incorporate them. 
 Our consumable products are driven by an increase in the number of printed circuit boards and semiconductor devices that are tested. As a result, our consumable products provide a more stable recurring source of revenue and do not have the same degree of cyclicality as our capital equipment products. 
 Listed below is a summary of our various product offerings: 
 Semiconductor ATE Solutions. Semiconductor automated test equipment is used to test a device at two different points in the manufacturing process; first after it has been fabricated but before it has been packaged and then again after it has been packaged, in both cases to eliminate non-functioning parts. Our semiconductor ATE solutions consist of three scalable platforms focused primarily on the system on a chip (SoC) market. Our Diamond series platform, which includes the flagship Diamondx test system, offers high-density packaging for low-cost testing of microcontrollers and cost sensitive consumer and digital-based ASSP and ASIC devices. Our X-Series platform offers configurations for optimal testing of analog-based ASSP and ASIC, power, automotive, mixed signal and RF applications. Our ASL platform is targeted at testing linear, low-end mixed signal, precision analog and power management devices. 
 Test Handlers. Test handlers are used in conjunction with automated test equipment and are used to automate the testing of packaged semiconductor devices. Our test handlers support a variety of package sizes and device types, including automotive, mobile, power, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) and microcontrollers, among others. We offer a broad range of test handlers, including pick-and-place, gravity, strip and MEMS. 
 Bare Board PCB Test Systems. Bare board PCB test systems are used to test pre-assembled printed circuit boards. Our PCB test systems include flying probe testers, which are used to test low-volume, highly complex circuit boards and do not require the use of a separate test fixture, as well as universal grid testers, which require the use of a separate test fixture and are well-suited to test circuit boards that are produced in high volumes. 
 Test Contactors. Test contactors are used in the final test of semiconductor devices and serve as the interface between the test handler and the semiconductor device under test. Test contactors are specific to individual semiconductor device designs, need to be replaced frequently and grow with the number of devices tested in parallel. We offer a wide range of test contactors for standard, power and RF markets. 
 Probe Pins. Probe pins are physical devices that are used to connect electronic test equipment to the device under test. We offer probes that are incorporated into bare board test systems, loaded PCB test fixtures and semiconductor test contactors. We address a wide range of applications with our spring probes, voltage probes, current probes, near-field probes, temperature probes, demodulator probes and logic probes. 
 
5 
 
Loaded PCB Test Fixtures. Test fixtures enable the transmission of test signals from the loaded PCB to the tester. We offer a wide range of in-circuit and functional test fixtures that can be optimized based on the complexity of the loaded PCB and production volume requirements. Our solutions address highly complex and low-to-medium technology applications. 
 Services. Our worldwide service organization is capable of performing installations and necessary maintenance of test and handling systems sold by us, including routine servicing of spare parts manufactured by third parties. We provide various parts and labor warranties on test and handling systems and instruments designed and manufactured by us and warranties on certain components that have been purchased from other manufacturers and incorporated into our test and handling systems. We also provide training on the maintenance and operation of test and handling systems we sell. Service revenues from our Semiconductor Test segment maintenance and service contracts were $22.1 million or 6 % of net sales for fiscal 2017, $24.1 million, or 7% of net sales in fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 (fiscal 2016); and $28.6 million, or 8% of net sales, in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 (fiscal 2015). 
 Engineering and Product Development 
 The markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological change and new product introductions, as well as advancing industry standards. Our competitive position depends upon our ability to successfully enhance our products, develop new instrumentation, and introduce these new products on a timely and cost-effective basis. We seek to maintain close relationships with our customers to better enable us to be responsive to their product development and production needs. 
 Our engineering strategy is to continue to develop new and innovative products in the markets in which we compete, as well as leveraging those technologies into providing an efficient and effective total test cell solution. 
 Our engineering strategy for our test products includes continued development of our Diamond, X-Series and ASL platforms. Leveraging both hardware and software technologies across platforms is a key objective moving forward as we convert our knowledge and expertise into cost-effective solutions. The development and release of the Diamondx, ASLx and PAx products are examples of our technology leveraged focus. For our handler products, we are focused on continued development of our diverse product portfolio such as Pick and Place, Gravity, InStrip and InCarrier solutions. For our printed circuit board test equipment we are focused on continued development of flying probe grid array test products. 
 Sales and Distribution 
 We sell our products through a combination of a worldwide internal direct sales organization and external distributors for each of our reportable segments. Our direct sales organization is structured around key accounts, with a sales force of 150 people as of July 31, 2017. We also use third party distributors to sell our products in certain markets such as in Taiwan, China, Japan, South Korea, and other countries in Southeast Asia. 
 Our sales to customers outside the United States are primarily denominated in United States dollars, Euro and Malaysian Ringgit. Our sales outside the United States composed 82%, 82%, and 79%, of total net sales in fiscal 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. See Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information relating to revenues derived from sales to customers outside the United States.

 We have concentrated our sales and support efforts on those semiconductor companies from which we believe we will receive the most return for our efforts. We believe that sales to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future. 
 Manufacturing and Supply 
 We manufacture our products using a combination of internal and outsourced manufacturing solutions. We use Jabil Circuit as our outsourced partner for the manufacturing of our Semiconductor ATE products, and some of our Loaded PCB Test Fixture products. 
 We outsource certain components and subassemblies for our test equipment to contract manufacturers other than Jabil Circuit. Our products incorporate standard components and prefabricated parts manufactured to our specifications. These components and subassemblies are used to produce testers in configurations specified by our customers. Some of the standard components for our products are available from a number of different suppliers; however, many such standard components are purchased from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Although we believe that all single sourced components currently are available in adequate amounts, shortages or delivery delays may develop in the future. We are dependent on certain semiconductor device manufacturers, who are sole source suppliers of custom components for our products. We have no written supply agreements with these sole source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders. We continuously evaluate alternative sources for the manufacture of our custom components and the supply of our standard components; however, such alternative sources may not meet our required qualifications or have capacity that is available to us. 
 Competition 
 There are other domestic and foreign companies that participate in the markets for each of our products and the industry for each of our reportable segments is highly competitive. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, cost of test, reliability, customer service, applications support, price and ability to deliver products and service on a timely basis. In addition, to increase our market share, we will also need to demonstrate an ability to overcome customer risks and costs associated with switching vendors, including training on unfamiliar hardware and software. 
 
7 
 
The semiconductor equipment and electronics manufacturing industries are highly competitive in all areas of the world. There are other domestic and foreign companies that participate in the markets for each of our products. Our main competitors include Advantest Corporation, Teradyne Inc., Johnstech, MicroCraft, Cohu, Inc., SPEA, Shenzhen Mason Electronics Co., Ltd., Bojay, OXO, Sanmina, Interconnect Devices, Inc., QA Technology, and Ingun. Some of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering, manufacturing, marketing, and customer support capabilities than we have. 
 We expect our competitors to enhance their current products, introduce new products which may have comparable or better price and performance than ours, diligently defend their existing customer accounts, and attempt to grow their market share. In addition, new competitors, including semiconductor manufacturers themselves, may offer new testing technologies, which may compete with or otherwise reduce the value of our product lines. 
 We believe our key competitive strengths include: 
 

 | Technologically advanced products well suited for industrys high volume applications. Our breadth of capital equipment, including semiconductor ATE, test handlers and PCB testers, and consumables, including electronic interconnect and interface products, enable us to design solutions that lower the cost of testing, improve operating effectiveness of the test cell and reduce time to high volume production for our customers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Uniquely positioned as total test cell solutions provider. The combination of our semiconductor ATE, test handlers, load boards and test contactors products enables us to provide customers with a complete solution that optimizes performance for selected test cell configurations.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Focused on fast growing segments within the semiconductor and PCB markets. We believe, based on management estimates, that we increased our addressable market to over $4 billion (including the since divested Interface Board Business) through the acquisition of Multitest and ECT businesses in 2013 and through strategic internal product development. We believe that our core end-markets, which include analog/mixed-signal, microcontroller, RF, power management and automotive, should grow in excess of broader semiconductor and electronics test markets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Long-standing customer relationships with limited concentration. Our acquisition of Multitest and ECT further diversified our blue chip customer base beyond semiconductor device suppliers to leading mobile, industrial, medical, automotive and printed circuit board companies. Our close customer relationships with leading innovators in the electronics industry have been built based on years of collaborative product development, which provides us with deep system-level knowledge and key insights into our customers needs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Highly leveraged operating model drives significant earnings growth in up cycle. We have a history of reducing costs and driving increased profitability. Our capital equipment products and fixed cost structure enable us to generate significant profitability during cycle upturns.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Strong recurring revenue model enables through-cycle profitability. Our acquisition of Multitest and ECT more than doubled our recurring revenue base, which now comprises approximately 60% of our total revenue. Our consumables products are unit driven, recurring in nature, and less volatile during cycle downturns compared with our capital equipment products.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Experienced management and engineering team with demonstrated ability to integrate accretive acquisitions. Our chief executive officer and chief financial officer/chief operating officer have over 35 years of combined experience with us and have successfully identified, executed, and integrated multiple accretive acquisitions. The acquisition of Credence Systems Corporation in 2008 broadened our semiconductor test capabilities and offered substantial cost savings opportunities. The acquisition of Multitest and ECT in 2013 has enabled us to become a diversified electronics test solutions provider with a larger base of recurring revenue.

Backlog 
 At July 31, 2017, our backlog of unfilled orders for all products and services was $84.7 million, compared with $54.3 million at July 31, 2016. The $30.4 million, or 56%, increase was primarily due to stronger bookings during fiscal 2017 driven by strength in the mobility, automotive, and MEMS and sensors markets, primarily in the Semiconductor Test segment. Historically, our test systems generally ship within twelve weeks of receipt of a customers purchase order. Our probes and contactors generally ship within one to three weeks of a customers purchase order. While backlog is calculated on the basis of firm orders, orders may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer with limited or no penalty. Our backlog at any particular date, therefore, is not necessarily indicative of actual sales which may be generated for any succeeding period. 
 The backlog as of July 31, 2017 for our reportable segments was as follows (in millions): 
 

Semiconductor Test Solutions | $ | 72.7
Electronic Manufacturing Solutions | | 12.0
Total | $ | 84.7

Proprietary Rights 
 The development of our products is largely based on proprietary information. We rely upon a combination of contract provisions, intellectual property registration and copyright, trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in products. We also have a policy of seeking patents on technology considered to be of particular strategic importance. Our patents cover various technologies, including technology relating to proprietary instrumentation and pin electronics. Although we believe that the copyrights, trademarks and patents we own are of value, we also believe that they alone have not and will not determine our success. We believe that our overall success depends principally upon our management, engineering, applications, manufacturing, marketing and service skills. Regardless, we intend to protect our rights when, in our view, these rights are infringed upon. 
 We have at times been notified of claims that we may be infringing patents issued to others. Although there are no pending actions against us regarding any patents, claims of infringement by third parties could negatively impact our business and results of operations. As to any claims asserted against us, we may seek or be required to obtain a license under the third partys intellectual property rights. However, a license may not be available under reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we could decide to engage in litigation to challenge such claims or a third party could engage in litigation to enforce such claims. Such litigation could be expensive and time consuming and could negatively impact our business and results of operations. 
 Employees 
 At July 31, 2017, we had 1,640 employees and temporary workers. None of our employees is represented by a labor union, and we have experienced no work stoppages during our history. Many of our employees are highly skilled, and we believe our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain these employees and attract new, highly-skilled employees. We consider relations with our employees to be good. 
Environmental Affairs 
 Our facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment. We do not anticipate that compliance with these laws and regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, or financial condition.
