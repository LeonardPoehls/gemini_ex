ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 ﻿
 References to the “Company”, “we,” “our,” and “us,” refer to Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc., including, as the context requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries.
 ﻿
 Overview
 ﻿
 Condor Hospitality Trust, Inc. was incorporated in Virginia on August 23, 1994 and was reincorporated in Maryland on November 19, 2014. Our common stock began trading on October 30, 1996 and today trades under the symbol “CDOR” on the NYSE American stock exchange.
 ﻿
 The Company is a self-administered real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes that specializes in the investment and ownership of high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels.  As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned 18 hotels, representing 2,176 rooms, in nine states, including one hotel owned through an 80% interest in an unconsolidated joint venture (the “Atlanta JV”).
 ﻿
 We conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership REIT, or UPREIT, in which our hotel properties are owned by our operating partnership, Condor Hospitality Limited Partnership and its subsidiaries (the “operating partnership”), for which we serve as general partner. As of December 31, 2017, we owned an approximate 99.3% ownership interest in the operating partnership.  In the future, the operating partnership may issue limited partnership interests to third parties from time to time in connection with our acquisition of hotel properties or the raising of capital.  The Company’s 100% owned E&P Financing Limited Partnership no longer owns any assets or conducts any operations following the sale of its last remaining property in January 2016.
 ﻿
 In order for the income from our hotel property investments to constitute “rents from real properties” for purposes of the gross income tests required by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for REIT qualification, the income we earn cannot be derived from the operation of any of our hotels.  Therefore, the operating partnership and its subsidiaries lease our

hotel properties to the Company’s wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary, TRS Leasing, Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries (“the TRS”). The TRS in turn engages third-party eligible independent contractors to manage the hotels. Our independent management companies are not affiliated with us or our management team. The operating partnership, the TRS, and their respective subsidiaries are consolidated into the Company’s financial statements.  
 ﻿
 Our significant events for 2017 include:
 ﻿

· | On February 28, 2017, all of the outstanding shares of the Company’s 6.25% Series D Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series D Preferred Stock”) were voluntarily converted by the holders into 6,004,957 shares (subject to the reverse split as described below) of common stock and the holders received 925,000 shares of 6.25% Series E Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series E Preferred Stock”) in the transaction.

 ﻿
 Mission Statement 
 ﻿
 Our mission is to provide to our shareholders attractive total returns for the lodging sector through (1) disciplined investment in high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels, and (2) intensive asset management to achieve enhanced results.
 ﻿
 We strive to achieve this mission through the disciplined and efficient execution of the following Core Strategies:

· | Acquisition Strategy
--+---------------------


· | Disposition Strategy
--+---------------------


· | Asset Management Strategy
--+--------------------------


· | Financing Strategy
--+-------------------

  ﻿
 We understand that we cannot achieve our mission alone and therefore work with the following independent businesses, who we collectively refer to as Business Partners, in the execution of our mission:

· | Franchise Partners
--+-------------------


· | Hotel Management Company Partners
--+----------------------------------

  ﻿
 Core Strategies
 ﻿
 Acquisition Strategy
 ﻿
 The objective of our acquisition strategy is to enable us to acquire assets that meet our target property characteristics and investment criteria at attractive valuations. We believe that our existing relationships with owners, operators, and developers of select-service hotels will provide us with access to certain off-market acquisition opportunities ahead of other real estate investors.  Typically, off-market transactions lead to more attractive valuation outcomes.  Our organizational documents do not limit the types of investments we can make; however, our intent is to execute the acquisition strategy as detailed herein. 
     We believe our target property characteristics and investment criteria, coupled with our ability to source off-market transactions, differentiates us from our peers and will enable us to achieve our mission to obtain attractive returns to our shareholders.
 ﻿
 Hotels purchased in and since 2012 are referred to throughout as “new investment platform” properties while properties owned prior to 2012 are referred to as “legacy” properties.
 ﻿
 Target Property Characteristics
 ﻿
 Our target properties are high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels located primarily in the top 100 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (“MSAs”), with a focus on the top 21 – 60 MSAs.  From time to time, we may acquire assets outside these target MSAs if we are able to acquire the asset at an 

 
4


 
attractive valuation and have confidence in the value proposition of the property.  If within a top 25 MSA, the asset will typically be located within an attractive sub- market of the larger MSA.  The hotels we will look to acquire will be franchised under premium flags by brands such as Hilton, Marriott/Starwood, IHG, and Hyatt and operated by third-party management companies. 
     In 2017, we acquired seven assets that meet our investment criteria: Home2 Suites Lexington, KY, Home2 Suites Austin-Rock Rock, TX, Home2 Suites Tallahassee, FL, Home2 Suites Memphis-Southaven, MS, Hampton Inn & Suites Orlando-Lake Mary, FL, Fairfield Inn & Suites El Paso, TX, and Residence Inn Austin, TX.  Subsequent to the end of 2017, we completed the acquisition of two additional properties: TownePlace Suites Austin and Home2 Suites Charleston-Summerville.
 ﻿
 Investment Criteria
 ﻿
 We perform thorough due diligence and utilize extensive research to evaluate any target market or property.  This due diligence and research may include, but is not limited to, analyzing the long-term economic outlook of an MSA, reviewing trends in local lodging demand and supply, assessing property condition and required capital investment, and understanding historical property financial performance.  Specific investment criteria for hotels we are looking to acquire may include but are not limited to hotels that: 
· | operate under leading premium franchise brands and possess key attributes such as building design and décor that is consistent with current generation brand standards;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | are located within the top 100 MSAs, in close proximity to multiple demand drivers, including large corporations, regional hospitals, regional business hubs, recreational travel destinations, significant retail centers, and military installations, among others;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | are located within markets that have favorable economic, job growth, and demographic factors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have illustrated an ability to generate stabilized and dependable revenue and net operating income;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | were constructed less than ten years prior to our acquisition or have been recently significantly renovated to current brand standards, and have significant time (generally ten or more years) remaining on the existing franchise license; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | have some value-added growth potential through operating efficiencies, institutional asset management, repositioning, renovations, or rebranding;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | can be acquired at a discount to replacement cost; and/or
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | can be acquired in off-market transactions.
--+--------------------------------------------

  ﻿
 Select-service hotels typically generate most of their revenue from room rentals, have limited food and beverage outlets, contain less meeting space, and require fewer employees than traditional full-service hotels. We believe premium-branded upper-midscale and upscale select-service hotels have the potential to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns relative to other types of hotels due to their ability to achieve Revenue per Available Room (“RevPAR”) levels at or close to those achieved by traditional full-service hotels while achieving higher profit margins due to their more efficient operating model and less volatile cash flows.
 ﻿
 Disposition Strategy
 ﻿
 Currently we are nearing completion of a nine year process of transitioning our portfolio from economy hotels to high-quality select-service, limited-service, extended stay, and compact full service hotels.  In order to achieve this objective, we have focused on disposing of legacy assets that do not meet the property characteristics and investment criteria discussed above.  Since January 1, 2009 through the date of this document, we have sold 120 hotels, of which 52 have been sold since January 1, 2015.  The value unlocked from asset sales has been and will continue to be redeployed into newer, higher-quality assets meeting the acquisition strategy discussed above.  Just as we carefully evaluate the hotels we plan to acquire, our asset management team has evaluated the timing and composition of the legacy hotels to be disposed of in a manner we believe will maximize returns for our shareholders.  We are committed to a disciplined but timely monetization of the legacy assets in order to achieve the strategic repositioning of the portfolio.  In 2018, we will continue to dispose of assets that do not fit the new strategic vision of our portfolio and have three additional legacy hotels that we consider held for sale at December 

 
5


 
31, 2017, two of which have been sold subsequent to December 31, 2017 and the remaining one of which is currently under contract to sell.
     Additionally, from time to time, we may undertake the sale of one or more hotels that meet the property characteristics and investment criteria discussed above.  These disposition decisions are the result of a thorough analysis and typically in response to changes in market conditions, our current or projected return on our investment in the hotel, or other factors which we deem relevant to the disposition decision.
 ﻿
 Asset Management Strategy
 ﻿
 Through collaboration with our third-party operators, we seek to maximize value to our shareholders through improvements to our existing hotels’ operating results.  We work toward this goal by constantly monitoring the performance of each individual hotel and identifying opportunities for value-enhancement through intensive asset management strategies.  We will make recommendations to our third-party operators in all aspects of our hotels operations, including revenue management, physical design, guest experience, market positioning, and overall property strategy.  Fundamentally, all strategies are focused on growing the revenue of a hotel, controlling expenses, and/or maximizing the guest experience to drive returns. 
      We work with our third-party operators to develop short- and long-term capital investment plans that are focused on generating positive returns for our shareholders.  The capital improvements may involve investments in expansions, additions, renovations, technology upgrades, and/or energy efficiency improvements. 
      Additionally, from time to time, we may come to the conclusion that a particular asset may provide greater returns to our shareholders after an extensive repositioning of the asset in the market.  In these instances, capital investment in a greater amount than typical for an asset may be required to achieve the desired repositioning.  These decisions will be made after a thorough analysis of the property, market conditions, and the potential for a positive return on investment that exceeds our investment hurdle rates. 
 ﻿
 Financing Strategy
 ﻿
 Our financing strategy is to seek to minimize the cost of our capital in order to maximize the returns generated for our shareholders.  We intend to finance our long-term growth with equity capital raises and debt financings that have staggered maturities.  From time to time, when purchasing hotel properties, we may issue limited partnership interests in our operating partnership to third parties as full or partial consideration to sellers.  Currently, our debt includes a revolving line of credit secured by certain hotels and mortgages secured by our hotel properties.  In the future we plan on using the revolving credit facility, term loans, equity issuances, and mortgage debt financings to fund future acquisitions as well as for property redevelopments, return on investment initiatives, and working capital requirements. 
 ﻿
 Since we are structured as an UPREIT, we may seek to issue limited partnership interest of our operating partnership for raising capital, or when acquiring hotel assets as full or partial consideration to sellers who may desire to take advantage of tax deferral on the sale of a hotel or participate in the income, and potential value appreciation, of our common stock.
 ﻿
 Business Partners
 ﻿
 Franchise Partners
 ﻿
 We believe that in order to achieve our mission we must partner with the right franchisors of quality brands in our target segments.  To this end, we have built strong relationships with many of who we believe are the leading franchisors of the strongest brands in the segments we target, including Hilton, Marriott/Starwood, IHG, and Hyatt.  The franchisors provide a variety of benefits and value which include national advertising, marketing programs to increase brand awareness, personnel training, and centralized reservation systems.  We are constantly monitoring and evaluating the performance of these franchisors and their respective brands so that, when necessary, we can adapt our franchise partner strategy to maximize returns to our shareholders.

﻿
 Under our franchise agreements, we are required to pay franchise fees generally between 3.3% and 5.5% of room revenue, plus additional fees for marketing, central reservation systems, and other franchisor programs and services that amount to between 2.5% and 6.0% of room revenue.  The franchise agreements typically have 10 to 25 year terms although certain agreements may be terminated by either party on certain anniversary dates specified in the agreements.  Further, each agreement provides for early termination fees in the event the agreement is terminated before the stated term.
 ﻿
 Our 18 hotels owned at December 31, 2017, including the hotel owned through the Atlanta JV, operate under the following national and independent brands.  Pursuant to our previously discussed strategy, we envision the composition of this brand portfolio to continue to change as we continue to transition the portfolio.

 Hotel Management Company Partners
 ﻿
 As a REIT, we are not permitted to directly operate any of our hotels.  We partner closely with some of who we believe are the leading hotel management companies in order to operate our hotels with the ultimate objective of improving same-store hotel performance throughout our portfolio.  Each management agreement provides for a set term and is subject to early termination upon the occurrence of defaults and certain other events.  As required under the REIT qualification rules, each manager must qualify as an “eligible independent contractor” during the term of the management agreement.

  Seasonality of Hotel Business
 ﻿
 Historically, as a result of the geographic areas in which we operate, the operations of our hotels have been seasonal in nature.  Generally, occupancy rates, revenue, and operating income have been greater in the second and third quarters of the calendar year than in the first and fourth quarters, with the exception of our hotels located in Florida, which experience peak demand in the first and fourth quarters of the year.  The results of our new investment platform hotels, because of their locations and chain scale, are less seasonal in nature than our legacy portfolio of assets.
 ﻿
 Competition
 ﻿
 The hotel industry is highly competitive.  Each of our hotels is located in a developed area that includes other hotel properties.  The number of competitive hotel properties in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on revenue, occupancy, and the average daily room rate of our hotels or of hotel properties acquired in the future, and thus our financial results.
 ﻿
 We may compete for investment opportunities with entities that have substantially greater financial resources than us.  These entities generally may be able to accept more risk than we can prudently manage. Competition in general may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities for us and increase the bargaining power of property owners seeking to sell.  
 ﻿
 Tax Status
 ﻿
 The Company qualifies and intends to continue to qualify as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), as amended.  In general, under such Code provisions, a trust which has made the required election and, in the taxable year, meets certain requirements and distributes to its shareholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent of the income currently distributed to shareholders.  If we fail to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates and generally will be unable to re-elect REIT status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT, unless we satisfy certain relief provisions.  Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income.  Taxable income from non-REIT activities managed through the TRS, which is taxed as a C-Corporation, is subject to federal, state, and local income taxes.  
 ﻿
 Employees
 ﻿
 At December 31, 2017, the Company had 14 employees.  The staff at our hotels are employed by our third-party hotel managers.
