Item 1. Business
Overview 
We are a leading provider of cloud-based e-commerce fulfillment and marketing solutions that integrate supply, demand and delivery for large retailers and consumer brands, manufacturers and distributors (collectively, "suppliers"). Our end-to-end solutions are provided through the CommerceHub software platform, a hub that streamlines integration and enables more efficient transactions among our retailer and supplier customers and their other trading partners, while also enabling them to access the online marketplaces, search engines, social and product advertising and other digital marketing channels (collectively, "demand channels") where consumers browse and buy. Our solutions also help our customers integrate with the third-party logistics ("3PL") providers, including fulfillment and delivery providers, that take purchased products to the consumer’s doorstep. 
Over 10,000 customers and trading partners have access to our platform every day to conduct business with each other, including processing orders and invoices, exchanging product information and other electronic documents and tracking their customers’ buying experience from order through fulfillment and delivery. We estimate that, in 2016, our customers used CommerceHub to enable the fulfillment of goods worth approximately $13.4 billion in gross merchandise value ("GMV"), an increase of over 15% from $11.6 billion of GMV in 2015. As described in more detail below under "—Our Revenue," the majority of our revenue is variable and tied to usage fees that are based on the volume of transactions our customers process through our platform, with the minority coming from recurring subscription fees in addition to set-up and professional services fees.
Collectively, our customers and the other trading partners on our platform comprise a vibrant network of retailers, brands and other suppliers, demand channels and other trading partners that constitute a critical mass of many of the largest and most influential companies in North American e-commerce. This critical mass has helped us achieve a meaningful network effect, attracting new supplier customers to our large network of retailers and demand channels, and attracting new retailer and demand channel customers to our network of thousands of suppliers, enabling us to grow our business with a comparatively low cost of customer acquisition.
CommerceHub was founded because retailers have, since the beginning of e-commerce, faced significant financial and operational difficulties in providing their customers with the large assortment of products for sale online that consumers expect and increasingly demand. Buying larger assortments of products from suppliers and storing them in inventory requires significant capital investment. Similarly, operating warehouses equipped with the capabilities needed to receive and prepare orders for shipment is complex and expensive. CommerceHub helps to solve these problems by helping retailers leverage the "virtual inventory" of thousands of suppliers through a platform where retailers and suppliers can easily connect for product information sharing and order processing, and through which suppliers can process and ship customer orders on the retailers' behalf, with the retailers' branding and delivery speed promises, all while the retailer remains in control of the fulfillment process. In addition, by connecting with our large network of retailers and demand channels, suppliers are able to unlock new sources of demand for their products.
In the quickly evolving world of e-commerce, consumers have embraced online marketplaces, and they continue to increase their purchases on these online marketplaces, such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart Marketplace, Jet.com and others. This shift is driving substantially increased consumer expectations—shoppers now expect to find any product at any time, on any device, and to have it delivered to their doorsteps with fast and free or nearly-free shipping. We continue to enhance the CommerceHub software platform and introduce new features and solutions that help position our retailer and supplier customers for success as e-commerce continues to evolve.
Our solutions unite supply, demand and delivery and provide our customers with a single platform to source and market the products consumers desire and to have those products delivered more rapidly to the consumers' doorsteps. Specifically, we provide our customers with the following solutions, which are described in more detail below under "—Our Solutions and Capabilities":
Supply Solutions. Our "Supply Solutions" enable retailers and online marketplaces to expand their product offerings, without the economic and logistical limitations and risks typically associated with buying, storing and shipping physical inventory, by leveraging our network of almost 10,000 drop-ship-capable suppliers and other marketplace sellers that receive orders from demand channels and ship products directly to consumers.
Demand Solutions. Our "Demand Solutions" give retailers and suppliers greater access to consumer demand through access and product listing management capabilities for some of the largest and most important sales channels in North America, including major retailers, online marketplaces, such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart Marketplace and Jet.com, and other demand channels, including social and product advertising.

Delivery Solutions. Our "Delivery Solutions" facilitate rapid, cost-efficient, on-time delivery with greater control of, and visibility into, the consumer experience through more efficient use of 3PL providers, including national, regional, local and specialty delivery providers. For example, our SmartShipping solution enables retailers to automatically adjust carrier service levels to meet consumer delivery promise dates in the most cost-effective manner available based on the location of the inventory and the consumer. To help reduce delivery times, our network of 3PL partners helps retailers and other sellers distribute inventory to strategic locations that are closer to a wider distribution of their customers, enabling them to meet their customers' delivery expectations while reducing the delivery costs associated with doing so.
We seek to grow our business by:

• | continuing to grow overall usage by our existing customers, including the GMV and number of orders processed through our platform;


• | expanding the number of retailer-to-supplier connections within our existing customer base;


• | strategically partnering with our large retailer customers to increase the share of their total e-commerce volume that is enabled by CommerceHub’s solutions;


• | leveraging our expansive trading partner network to attract new suppliers and provide them with access to untapped demand from our many retailer and online marketplace customers, and to attract new retailer and online marketplace customers and connect them with our thousands of supplier customers;


• | enabling our existing customers to more easily sell their products through newly emerging e-commerce channels, such as social networks and mobile platforms;


• | expanding our offerings and customer base to new geographic markets outside of the United States and Canada;


• | partnering with selected existing and prospective customers, including consumer brands, that may be relatively new to direct-to-consumer selling, and helping them develop their e-commerce capabilities through our Supply, Demand and Delivery Solutions; and


• | continuing to develop, cross-sell and up-sell new e-commerce solutions and features that help our customers capture a larger share of the growing e-commerce market.

Our Role as Strategic Partner
CommerceHub is generally viewed as a "mission critical" partner to our retailer and supplier customers. Our solutions address some of the most important issues facing online sellers today. Retailers and brands that sell direct-to-consumer face a challenging market environment characterized by flat-to-declining retail store sales, more demanding consumer expectations in terms of product availability and delivery, and the proliferation of emerging search and social e-commerce channels to convert sales. CommerceHub's platform and solutions enable our customers to meet these market challenges and more efficiently grow their online sales as a percentage of their overall business.
We have a long history of successfully helping our customers reduce the overall complexity of their trading partner relationships to help grow their revenue through e-commerce. In addition, our solutions help our customers grow their online sales by facilitating more rapid fulfillment of orders and enabling them to capture more consumer demand through online marketplaces, social and product advertising and other demand channels. Many of our customers use our Supply Solutions to enable a large percentage of their overall online sales. Our Demand Solutions provide our customers with a valuable means for tapping into direct-to-consumer demand, and our Delivery Solutions help our customers to ensure a positive consumer experience. We believe that this combination of "supply" (enabling the fulfillment of consumer orders through a network of suppliers), "demand" (connecting suppliers and retailers to consumer demand by facilitating access to demand channels) and "delivery" (facilitating rapid, cost-efficient, on-time delivery to consumers) is unique in our industry and provides us with a compelling platform to continue to successfully grow our business.
Because our solutions play a critical role in helping our customers manage a complex array of business relationships in a highly competitive retail environment, we have benefited from strong loyalty and enduring, long-term relationships with our customers. In addition, we believe we are becoming an increasingly strategic partner to our overall set of trading partner customers as we become increasingly integrated into their systems and go-to-market efforts, as the amount of business conducted through our platform increases, and as more retailers and suppliers connect centrally into the CommerceHub platform.
Further enhancing our platform are value-added capabilities that we continue to develop, many of which are based on feedback we receive from our customers about challenges they face in their e-commerce businesses. For example, the following capabilities solve unique issues related to virtual inventory fulfillment, including:

• | managing high drop-ship order volumes with multiple parties: each retailer order must be managed with at least one third-party supplier that fulfills the order on the seller's behalf, which is more complex than traditional direct fulfillment, and this complexity increases exponentially when scaled across large retailer transaction volumes;

2


• | retail branding requirements: retailers frequently desire that the multi-party drop-ship fulfillment process be invisible to the consumer, which requires that third-party suppliers include retailer-branded packing slips and other materials in shipments to consumers;


• | insight, analytics and proactive error resolution: retailers must monitor and track a high volume of drop-ship orders and identify shipments that are at risk of missing the consumer's delivery promise date; and


• | third-party logistics: our ability to integrate with 3PL providers enables retailers and suppliers to locate inventory closer to broad distributions of consumers, helping them to increase delivery speeds and reduce delivery costs.

Our Industry 
E-commerce has grown significantly over the last several years as consumers have increasingly shifted their retail purchases from traditional "brick-and-mortar" stores to online stores and marketplaces. This growth has been attributable to a number of factors, including:

• | the availability of a broader selection of merchandise online;


• | consumer convenience and ease of use;


• | more competitive and transparent pricing;


• | increased functionality and reliability of e-commerce websites;


• | the emergence of mobile-connected devices and specialized websites;


• | the proliferation of online distribution channels; and


• | the reduction in "brick-and-mortar" locations for many retailers.

As a result of these factors, consumers today have more options to discover, research and purchase products online. Although these e-commerce growth drivers create significant opportunity for retailers and brands, they also create additional complexities and challenges. Retailers and brands seeking new avenues to expand their online sales must manage product data, transactions and delivery promises across hundreds of highly fragmented online channels with different requirements for conducting business, varying data attributes, evolving business models and competitive pressure to increase the pace of innovation.
In addition to the shift toward e-commerce retailing, the organic growth of the economy and consumer spending provide an additional tailwind. In this environment, well-run brick-and-mortar retailers have increasingly focused on optimizing the interplay between their physical and online storefronts. This "omni-channel" approach allows customers to shop and interact between channels in a more fluid manner. For example, shoppers can buy a product online but pick it up in-store, retailers can fulfill online orders through in-store delivery by using their stores as warehouses, and shoppers can return a product purchased online to an in-store location. An omni-channel strategy enables a retailer to position its physical storefront not as a liability, but rather as part of a strategy to provide consumers with a more consistent, convenient and effortless retail experience, regardless of how they choose to engage the retailer. As a result of their success, we believe that omni-channel strategies now represent a more significant component of all retailers' revenue mix.
Growth in e-commerce spending has consistently outpaced overall growth in retail sales, a trend that is expected to continue. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Commerce, e-commerce spending in the U.S. has grown at a compound annual rate of approximately 15% since 2010, exceeding $390 billion in 2016 when it amounted to approximately 8.1% of all retail sales. During the same period, total non-inflation adjusted retail sales, offline and online, grew at a compound annual rate of approximately 4.0%. 
E-commerce Fulfillment Industry Background
The e-commerce fulfillment industry enables thousands of retailers around the world to transact and grow their relationships with tens of thousands of suppliers. Additional participants in this market include third-party logistics providers, parcel carriers and other delivery companies, fulfillment and warehousing providers and sourcing companies. Supply chain management involves communicating data about the goods themselves, data related to the exchange of goods among these trading partners, and information about the many thousands of companies who are members of the supply chain community. At virtually every stage of the supply chain, there are inefficient, labor-intensive processes between trading partners with administrative and communication requirements, such as the exchange of product information between retailers and suppliers for the purpose of listing products for sale and verifying the status of goods before shipment, while in transit and upon delivery, to ensure that consumers receive the products they ordered by the date promised. Mistakes made during these processes negatively impact trading partners and their businesses, either through penalties that counter-parties impose, or through poor consumer experiences that discourage future purchases. E-commerce fulfillment solutions must address trading partners' needs for integration, collaboration, connectivity, visibility and data analytics to improve the speed, accuracy and efficiency with which goods are ordered and supplied.
The industry initially focused on electronically connecting retailers and suppliers over the Internet to avoid costly and error-prone manual, paper and fax-based communication processes. The next evolution included automating and streamlining these fulfillment transactions between retailers, suppliers and others in the supply chain, ensuring orders were placed accurately 
3

and quickly and that goods were delivered on time and in accordance with the retailer's requirements. As familiarity and acceptance of cloud-based services continues to accelerate, we believe that e-commerce participants, both large and small, will continue to turn to cloud-based solutions such as ours for their supply chain integration needs.
Traditional Solutions
Traditional e-commerce fulfillment solutions that are implemented using on-premise licensed software tend to focus primarily on fulfillment automation within a single facility and among a small network of trading partners. On-premise software provides connectivity between only one organization and its trading partners and typically requires significant time and technical expertise to configure, deploy and maintain, and to accommodate new trading partners added to the network. On-premise software licensors primarily link retailers and suppliers through the Electronic Data Interchange, or EDI, protocol that enables the structured electronic transmission of data between organizations. Because of set-up and maintenance costs, technical complexity and a growing volume of requirements from retailers, the traditional software model is not well-suited for many retailers and suppliers, especially where the network includes small and medium-sized suppliers with disparate systems and smaller information technology budgets.
Additionally, the traditional approach to supply chain automation involves a system architecture made up of many point-to-point connections between retailers and their suppliers. These multiple connections are inherently error-prone and can be difficult to adapt to changing requirements and market circumstances. For instance, if there is a broad trend in the market that many members of a retailing segment would like to adopt, a supplier would be faced with a series of enhancements, on a one-by-one basis, to the collection of connections they have with each of their retailers. Lacking flexibility and adaptability, traditional approaches do not have the architectural capabilities necessary for retailers and suppliers to maximize the opportunities presented by the rapid evolution of market trends.
Expansion of Product Assortments
While online retailing has removed the shelf-space constraints placed on retailers wanting to offer a large product assortment to consumers, it has not removed the physical and operational constraints of storing products in inventory and providing the capability to quickly ship products to consumers when they are ordered. In fact, the ability to offer massive numbers of products for sale online has put more pressure on retailers to invest in additional warehouse and distribution operations and to increase financial capital investments to purchase and maintain larger inventories of goods for sale. As an alternative to expensive infrastructure investment, retailers looking to increase the number of products they offer often turn to third-party fulfillment mechanisms, specifically drop-ship fulfillment, to offer a wider array of product assortments through virtual inventory, without the need for expanding distribution center capacity or increasing financial investment in inventory. With drop-shipping, a retailer or online marketplace seller is able to take a consumer's order and provide it to a supplier that then delivers the product directly to the consumer. The consumer perceives that the product was received directly from the retailer, even though the retailer never touched the ordered item.
Retailers impose their own specifications on their trading partners for electronically communicating their supply chain information. These specifications set the standards for transmitting and acknowledging invoices, inventory reporting, purchase orders and shipping notices. Suppliers that transact with multiple retailers need to accommodate different specifications unique to each retailer, which often vary based on a retailer's size, industry and technological capabilities. Suppliers that fail to comply with a retail partner's specifications risk errors with processing orders and compliance fines. Recurring performance issues may cause a retailer to discontinue its relationship with a supplier. As a result, suppliers are increasingly seeking out solutions to help them manage these challenges and improve their service levels with the retailers they supply.
Before retailers can list suppliers' products on their websites, they must first exchange data related to the supplier's products. Additionally, the retailer must transform the supplier-provided product data into a format that the retailer's online storefront supports and then must enhance the data in a way that makes the product appear more compelling to consumers. This enhancement includes rewriting product titles and descriptions, creating additional data attributes that describe the products and manipulating product images to conform to the retailer's standards. All of this work falls under the responsibility of individual retailer and supplier employees, who frequently rely on general purpose software and tools, such as email and spreadsheets, to accomplish these tasks, resulting in labor-intensive and error-prone processes with no activity tracking or management capabilities. The inefficiency of this process directly impacts a retailer's financial performance by increasing the amount of time and resources required to list products for sale online, or by reducing the number of products a retailer is able to carry online due to capacity constraints resulting from the manual tasks. A similar exercise takes place in the context of an online marketplace, where sellers must list products for sale and describe them in a manner that conforms to the marketplace's requirements.
Driving Demand
E-commerce is a large and global market that continues to expand as retailers and suppliers increase their online sales. However, it is also an increasingly complex and fragmented market due to the hundreds of channels available to retailers and suppliers and the rapid pace of change and innovation across those channels. Historically, a retailer or supplier might have 
4

simply established an online storefront and used a basic paid search program to drive traffic to its website. Today, in order to gain consumers' attention in a more crowded and competitive online marketplace, many retailers and an increasing number of suppliers sell their merchandise through an omni-channel strategy where each channel has its own rules, requirements and specifications. In addition, retailers and suppliers often seek to sell their products in multiple countries, each with its own local consumer preferences and behaviors.
The fragmentation and increasing complexity of e-commerce channels are placing greater demands on retailers and suppliers that seek to grow their online sales. These retailers and suppliers need omni-channel solutions that enable them to integrate their product offerings and inventory across multiple online channels. Traditional solutions, however, typically suffer from several limitations. In-house solutions are often costly, slow to implement and difficult to keep current. External solutions are often too narrowly tailored or aimed at helping retailers and manufacturers manage a single online channel or single category of channels rather than multiple platforms in a unified approach.
Delivering Products
From the consumer's perspective, an e-commerce transaction is not complete until the ordered products arrive at their doorstep. There is room for error in even the simplest fulfillment process where a retailer is operating a single distribution facility with a small inventory of products. The complexity of having a large network of third-party drop-ship suppliers and third-party fulfillment providers significantly increases the management complexity and likelihood of error. Instead of managing a single distribution facility, a retailer must ensure that hundreds, and potentially thousands, of third-party suppliers are shipping the correct product to the correct consumer address and that the product will arrive at the consumer's doorstep by the date the retailer promised. Every e-commerce order must be split into its component "line items" and transmitted to the relevant supplier, which must then select the appropriate carrier service level to meet the delivery promise date. Without management of the process across suppliers, the retailer risks uncontrolled costs as each supplier makes its own shipping decisions and then charges back to the retailer the cost of delivery. However, the consequences of poor supplier network performance are even more significant, as the consumer will blame the retailer for any fulfillment problems caused by the third-party supplier or fulfillment provider, thus damaging the customer's perception of the retailer's brand.
Our Solutions and Capabilities 
Our solutions help retailers, consumer brands, manufacturers, distributors and other market participants reduce the complexity of selling products through online sales channels, including sourcing through multiple suppliers, selling on emerging online sales channels and delivering products to consumers. Beyond the cloud-based software required to build and operate successful e-commerce strategies, we provide our solutions to our customers together with highly targeted services that help them rapidly adopt and maximize the utility of our solutions. By combining our software with value-added services, we enable easier adoption of the most effective strategies and tactics for product merchandising, online marketing and product delivery.
Our solutions include:
Supply Solutions: Assortment Expansion through Drop-Ship Fulfillment.    The core CommerceHub solution enables our retailer customers to communicate electronically with their drop-ship suppliers through a single, integrated connection. Through this "virtual inventory" solution, retailers are able to link their order management systems, or OMS, to each supplier's system to exchange order processing data in compliant formats, allowing for better order and inventory coordination. By using our platform, retailers are able to communicate orders to their suppliers, view data indicating the inventory quantity each supplier has available, receive updates regarding the shipment of orders, view reports that describe each supplier's fulfillment performance and receive notifications when exceptions in the fulfillment process occur. Suppliers are able to receive and manage orders from multiple retailers through a web-based application (or a system-to-system connection for high-volume suppliers) and print retailer-branded packing slips for inclusion in shipments to consumers, all while complying with each retailer's exacting requirements without needing to understand the retailer's underlying technical protocols. Retailers using our assortment expansion solution are able to compete more effectively in the market through the operation, at scale, of various delivery strategies, including drop-shipping, ship-to-store, in-store special orders and optimized delivery.
Our assortment expansion solutions include the following capabilities:

• | Distributed Inventory Management—Our inventory management capability allows retailers to receive aggregated and geographically identified inventory data feeds from a large network of suppliers. Instead of manually receiving and processing individual inventory feeds separately for each of their suppliers, our inventory management capability aggregates disparate inventory data files and provides the resulting output to the retailer in a transformed file format that can be imported directly into the retailer's inventory management software to provide an updated view of the products available for sale from its suppliers and to avoid listing out-of-stock products as available for sale. Including geographic location information in the inventory data feed enables

5

retailers to select more efficient and cost-effective delivery methods, facilitating product shipment from warehouses that are closer to the delivery destination. 

• | Compliance Management—Our compliance management capability tracks supplier delivery performance, which is then aggregated and presented to the retailer in the form of performance reports and supplier "scorecards." These scorecards provide a snapshot of each supplier's fulfillment performance, helping our retailer customers better manage and assess the performance of their supplier network. Retailers can also use this enhanced visibility to identify trends and address systemic issues across their supplier network to improve the consumer experience by increasing the pace and accuracy of order fulfilment. This capability also benefits suppliers by helping them improve performance and increase their volumes with retailers.


• | Returns Management—Our returns management capability helps retailers manage the process of accepting returns from consumers.


• | LTL and Special Order Management—Our "Less-Than-Truckload" ("LTL") shipping and special order capabilities provide detailed visibility and management tools to facilitate the fulfillment of complex orders that require the coordination of several parties, including third-party delivery agents and installers.


• | Product Content Collection, Management and Syndication—Our product content capabilities enable retailers to automate the process of communicating their product content specifications to suppliers and enable suppliers to more efficiently upload their product catalog into CommerceHub's cloud-based environment in a format that is consistent with the retailer's requirements, thereby reducing the time and effort required for retailers to list new products for sale. Through our cloud-based software, the retailer is able to efficiently collect and manipulate product content so that it meets the retailer's specifications and then export the compliant content to its website to expedite the process of adding products to their assortment.

Demand Solutions: Consumer Demand Generation.    Our demand solutions allow sellers to upload their entire product catalog to our platform and then transform and syndicate that product catalog to a wide array of e-commerce demand channels to facilitate consumer demand generation. In contrast to competing solutions, our platform acts as the single source for a seller's entire product offering with the capability to transform product data into a format that is tailored to each demand channel's unique requirements. Instead of the time-consuming process of managing point-to-point integrations with online demand channels, sellers can upload their catalog once and then create content rules that transform and map the product data in a way that is optimized for each channel.
Our demand solutions facilitate multiple revenue-enhancing strategies for retailers and consumer brands and include the following capabilities:

• | Cross-Channel Optimization for Online Marketplaces—Our channel optimization capabilities provide the ability for retailers and brands to sell through an array of online marketplaces, such as Amazon, eBay, Walmart Marketplace and Jet.com, while maintaining compliance with each marketplace's technical requirements. Sellers list the products they have for sale and provide price and inventory updates to the marketplace on an ongoing basis. When consumers buy products, our cloud-based software tracks the orders from the marketplaces to the seller for fulfillment.


• | Cross-Channel Optimization for Digital Advertising—Our channel optimization capabilities for digital advertising manage the listing and configuration of product advertisements on a variety of different e-commerce marketing channels, including Google and social networks such as Facebook and Pinterest. Leveraging the data provided by the catalog capability of our demand solutions, the digital advertising capability enables sellers to optimize performance on supported e-commerce marketing channels by simplifying the process of managing a large number of online advertisement campaigns per channel. A seller that wants to create and manage hundreds of online advertisement campaigns on Google can significantly reduce their workload through one process, managed through our software, which uses content rules to replicate campaign configuration across hundreds of campaigns.

Delivery Solutions: Enhanced Delivery Experience.    Our solutions for enhanced delivery experience help retailers and suppliers improve the efficiency of their consumer delivery networks through the application of algorithms that optimize shipping decisions and more effectively allocate physical product inventory across fulfillment locations.
Our solutions for enhanced delivery experience include the following capabilities:

• | Shipping Optimization—Our shipping optimization capability allows retailers to use efficient algorithms to make shipping decisions that help our retailer customers reduce costs and delivery times and meet consumer promise dates. For example, retailers can use our solutions to automatically downgrade a shipment from the two-day

6

priority service level to the more cost-effective ground service level if shipment via ground will meet the consumer's delivery promise date. Alternatively, a retailer can upgrade the service level of shipments that are at risk of arriving to the consumer late, based on the geographic location of the consumer, the supplier shipping the product and the date by which the consumer was promised delivery. 

• | Integrated Third-Party Logistics Providers—Our integrated 3PL capability allows retailers and suppliers to partner and place physical inventory with 3PL providers that provide access to warehouses located closer to a broader distribution of consumers. The integrated 3PL providers are then able to act as suppliers to the retailer (or supplier) and ship products to consumers that are located near the 3PL providers' facilities, which reduces delivery costs and increases delivery speeds.

Our Revenue
The majority of our revenue is variable and tied to usage fees that are based on the volume of transactions our customers process through our platform. The remaining portion of our revenue comes from recurring subscription fees as well as set-up and professional services fees.
Usage revenue accounted for 69% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and is derived primarily from fees charged to retailers and suppliers for their use of our platform to conduct business with their trading partners. Currently, these usage fees are predominantly driven by the volume of customer orders that are processed through our platform using our Supply Solutions. Usage revenue also consists of fees for activity related to inventory management and third-party communication and fees related to the volume of online sales our customers achieve on certain demand channels.
Subscription revenue accounted for 25% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. A customer's recurring subscription fee is fixed based on several factors, including, but not limited to, the number and type of trading partners (e.g., online retailers) that a customer is connected to through our platform, the number and type of demand channels (e.g., marketplaces, digital advertising channels and social networks) a customer accesses through our platform, the adoption of certain available feature upgrades that further enhance the functionality of our platform, and, for certain customers, the amount of annual order volume achieved through our platform. Total recurring subscription revenue grows as new customers join the platform, connect and create relationships with other trading partners and adopt new features and upgrades.
Set-up and professional services accounted for 6% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 and is derived from services we provide to new and existing customers, including highly targeted services that are focused on helping our customers quickly adopt our solutions and maximize their utility.
Our revenue is currently generated primarily from the United States and Canada. For financial information related to the geographic areas in which we do business, see Note 2 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in either of the years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015. However, our revenue model is primarily based on retailer and supplier program relationships whereby many revenue-generating supplier transactions conducted through our platform may be attributable to a single retailer ("Total Program Revenue"). There were two customers with Total Program Revenue that accounted for more than 10% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016, and there was one such customer in the year ended December 31, 2015. Furthermore, there were six customers with Total Program Revenue that accounted for more than 5% of our total revenue in the year ended December 31, 2016.
Seasonality
The e-commerce marketplace is affected by the same seasonality as the traditional brick-and-mortar marketplace, and many of our customers typically realize a significant portion of their sales in the fourth quarter of each calendar year. Although our customers do not all experience the same seasonal variation, and some customers may have seasonal peaks that occur in periods other than the fourth quarter, the seasonality of our customers' businesses impacts our financial results and may become more concentrated as we continue to expand our solutions to more customers. If our customer base changes to include more customers that experience more concentrated seasonal variation, our revenue may fluctuate significantly among quarters. Historically, the percentage of our annual revenue has been relatively uniform over the first three quarters of the year with approximately 33% to 34% of our annual revenue being generated in the fourth quarter.
Regulatory Matters 
General
Various laws and regulations in the United States and foreign countries apply, both directly and indirectly, to our online commerce business, including laws and regulations regarding privacy, online commerce and communications, taxation, intellectual property and the provision of goods and services through the Internet. U.S. and foreign laws and regulations are subject to the actions of a range of governing and legislative bodies and to the interpretations of a range of courts, making their application to our business uncertain and subject to change.
7

Data Privacy and Security
We are subject to laws governing the collection, use, retention, security and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers. The enactment, interpretation and application of user data protection and privacy laws are in a state of flux, and the interpretation and application of such laws may vary from country to country. For example, on December 15, 2015, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union (the "Council") reached agreement on a new General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") that gives consumers additional rights and imposes additional restrictions and penalties on companies for illegal collection and misuse of personal information. The European Parliament and the Council adopted the GDPR in April 2016, and it is scheduled to take effect in May 2018. Further, on October 6, 2015, the Court of Justice of the European Union ("EU") invalidated the "Safe Harbor Framework," which had allowed companies to collect and process personal data in EU nations for use in the United States. In early 2016, EU and U.S. authorities reached agreement on a new data transfer framework called the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which became fully operational on August 1, 2016. However, the validity of Privacy Shield framework has been challenged in EU courts, and the long-term viability of the Privacy Shield remains uncertain. Finally, on January 10, 2017, the European Commission proposed new regulations regarding privacy and electronic communications, including additional regulation of the Internet tracking tools known as “cookies.”
     In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has released a privacy policy framework and principles and has called for federal legislation to require organizations that suffer a breach of security related to personal information to provide notice of such breach. In the absence of federal legislation, most states and the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico have adopted laws requiring notification to users when there is a security breach affecting personal data. Complying with differing national and state requirements may cause our business to incur substantial costs. In addition, online commerce businesses such as ours have publicly available privacy policies and practices regarding the collection, use and disclosure of user data. A failure to adequately disclose all relevant company data collection and usage practices in such privacy policies, or to comply with such privacy policies or with the regulatory requirements of federal, state or foreign privacy laws, could result in proceedings or actions by governmental agencies or others (such as class action litigation), which could adversely affect our business. Technical violations of certain privacy laws can result in significant penalties, including statutory penalties. In 2012, the Federal Communications Commission (the "FCC") amended its regulations under the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (the "TCPA"), which could subject our business to increased liability for certain telephonic communications with customers, including but not limited to text messages to mobile phones. Under the TCPA, plaintiffs may seek recovery for actual monetary loss or statutory damages of $500 per violation, whichever is greater, and courts may treble such damage awards for willful or knowing violations. Data collection, privacy and security continue to be significant and growing public concerns. Congress and individual states and foreign legislative bodies may consider additional online privacy legislation.
Online Commerce
Our business also must comply with other federal, state and foreign laws, rules and regulations regarding online communications and commerce to the extent applicable to our business. For example, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act prohibits web sites directed to children under the age of 13 from collecting personally identifiable information online from such children without parental consent and imposes a number of operational requirements. Certain email activities are subject to the Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act of 2003, commonly known as the "CAN-SPAM" Act. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates the sending of unsolicited commercial email by requiring the email sender, among other things, to comply with specific disclosure requirements and to provide an "opt-out" mechanism for recipients. Both of these laws include statutory penalties for non-compliance. The Digital Millennium Copyright Act limits, but does not eliminate, liability for listing or linking to third-party websites that may include content that infringes on copyrights or other rights so long as our business complies with the statutory requirements. Various U.S. states also have adopted laws regulating certain aspects of Internet communications, websites, marketing and online commerce. On February 24, 2016, President Obama signed legislation that permanently extends the moratorium on state and local taxes on Internet access and commerce. The EU has enacted a variety of Directives (separately implemented by each EU member state via local legislation) and Regulations (directly applicable to all EU member states) relating to online commerce, including Directive 2000/31/EC on Electronic Commerce, Directive 2011/83/EU on Consumer Rights, and the GDPR.
Additional Internet-related laws, rules and regulations may be adopted in the future on issues such as emerging commerce technologies and marketing approaches, Internet access, cross-border online transactions, defamatory speech, copyright infringement, pricing and characteristics and quality of products and services. Such additional laws or regulations may slow the growth of e-commerce services and the Internet, which could in turn cause a decline in the demand for our customers' online commerce business, and increase our cost (or our customers' cost) of doing business or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Moreover, the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, personal privacy and taxation to commercial online services and the Internet is uncertain and could expose our business to substantial liability.

In 2015, the FCC adopted rules in its open Internet proceeding that could restrict the ability of broadband providers to block or otherwise disadvantage our business. Among other things, the open Internet (or "net neutrality") rules prohibit Internet service providers from: (1) blocking access to, or impairing or degrading, legal content, applications, services or non-harmful devices; and (2) favoring selected Internet traffic. On June 14, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit denied petitions for review filed by several broadband providers challenging the new open Internet rules, but the rules remain subject to additional appeals. Congress or the FCC may seek to modify or repeal open Internet rules in the future.
Proposed Changes in Law and Regulation
The regulation of Internet services and access, privacy, data protection, e-commerce and related matters is subject to the political process, has been in constant flux over the past decade and is expected to remain in flux. Further material changes in the law and regulatory requirements must be anticipated, and there can be no assurance that our business will not be adversely affected by future legislation, regulation or deregulation.
Intellectual Property 
We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology, our software code, our performance data and our brand. Certain of our intellectual property rights have been acquired through third-party licenses and agreements. We protect our intellectual property by relying on confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions, as well as on international, national, state and common law rights. In addition, we enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with employees and contractors and confidentiality agreements with other third parties. We protect our brands through trademark registration of our core brands, maintenance of our trademark portfolio, contractual trademark rights protection and reliance on common law trademark rights. We also register copyrights and domain names as necessary.
Research and Development
For financial information related to our research and development activities, see the discussion of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 included in Item 7, "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" and see our consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) and the related notes included in Item 8, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."
Competition 
We compete primarily with other SaaS providers servicing the e-commerce industry. However, the competitive dynamics of our market are unpredictable because it is fragmented and rapidly evolving. Due to the nature of our business and the variety of products we offer, we do not believe there is any particular competitor or small group of competitors that compete with our business as a whole. Rather, our competitors vary by our solutions and offerings. Our Supply Solutions also face competition from in-house developed solutions used by retailers that choose to build and maintain their own proprietary integrations to suppliers and online channels, using a combination of order management, custom written software and value-added networks.
We believe that there are several factors unique to our business that differentiate our solutions in the competitive marketplace, including:

• | the network effect of our existing connections and relationships with a diverse group of leading online retailers, suppliers, 3PL providers and other trading partners;


• | the fulfillment management capabilities of our Supply Solutions that enable retailers to operate large scale drop-ship fulfillment programs with a high degree of consumer satisfaction;


• | our history of long-term relationships with a blue-chip retailer customer base and our deep experience successfully serving and contributing to the growth of large retailers, which engenders trust in our capabilities as prospective retailers and suppliers consider engaging our services;


• | the breadth of our platform's existing integrations and support for a wide variety of online demand generation channels, including retailers and marketplaces;


• | our focus on data-quality software and services to structure product data in an optimized format for each online channel;


• | a history of establishing and maintaining reliable integration connections with our trading partners;


• | a proven, scalable technology with easy-to-use and accessible software and services;


• | our brand recognition and reputation in the markets in which we operate; and


• | the reliability and performance of our cloud-based software.

Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 345 full-time and part-time employees, substantially all of whom are located in the United States. None of our employees were represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that our employee relations are good.
Corporate History 
Our Company was founded in 1997 in Albany, New York by our President and Chief Executive Officer, Francis Poore, and our Chief Technology Officer, Richard Jones. It was acquired by an affiliate of Liberty Interactive Corporation, our former parent company ("Liberty"), in 2006 and became a subsidiary of Liberty in 2010.
During November 2015, the board of directors of Liberty authorized a plan to distribute shares of our Company to holders of its Liberty Ventures common stock (the "Spin-Off"). CommerceHub, Inc. was a newly formed Delaware corporation that, pursuant to an internal restructuring, effective July 21, 2016, became the parent company of Commerce Technologies, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company that, as a result of the restructuring, is the successor to Commerce Technologies, Inc. ("CTI"), the entity through which CommerceHub transacted prior to the Spin-Off. Following the completion of the Spin-Off on July 22, 2016, CommerceHub now operates as a stand-alone publicly traded company and neither Liberty nor CommerceHub has any stock ownership, beneficial or otherwise, in the other. Our Series A and Series C common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market on July 25, 2016 under the symbols "CHUBA" and "CHUBK," respectively, and our Series B common stock began trading in the market for unlisted securities (the "OTC Markets") on July 25, 2016 under the symbol “CHUBB.”
Our headquarters and principal executive offices are located at ZEN Building, 201 Fuller Road, 6th Floor, Albany, New York, 12203, and our telephone number is (518) 810-0700.
