ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
We were incorporated in the State of Delaware as Duane Street Corp. on November 17, 2011. Our original business, prior to the Contribution (as defined below), was discontinued. 
 
On January 28, 2014, we consummated a contribution transaction (the "Contribution") with CÜR Media, LLC (formerly Raditaz, LLC), a limited liability company organized in the State of Connecticut on February 15, 2008, pursuant to a Contribution Agreement by and among the Company, CÜR Media, LLC, and the holders of a majority of CÜR Media, LLC's limited liability company membership interests (the "Contribution Agreement"). In connection with the Contribution, and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Contribution Agreement, all outstanding securities of CÜR Media, LLC were exchanged for securities of the Company. 
 
As a result of the Contribution, CÜR Media, LLC became our wholly owned subsidiary, and we adopted the business of CÜR Media, LLC, which was to develop and commercialize a streaming music application for listening on mobile devices and the web (the “Music Streaming Business”), as our sole line of business.
 
On January 31, 2014, we changed our name to CÜR Media, Inc., a name that more accurately represents our new business focus. In connection with the name change, we changed our OTC trading symbol to "CURM."
 
In addition, on January 31, 2014, we increased our number of authorized shares to 310,000,000 shares, consisting of (i) 300,000,000 shares of common stock par value $0.0001 per share (“Common Stock”), and (ii) 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Preferred Stock”).
 
Further, on January 31, 2014, our board of directors (“Board of Directors) authorized a 1.26953123-for-1 forward split of our Common Stock, in the form of a dividend, pursuant to which each holder of our Common Stock as of the record date received 1.19260815 additional shares of Common Stock for each one share owned.
 
In early 2016, the Company entered into agreements ("Music Label Agreements") with three music labels ("Music Labels"), pursuant to which the Company was provided limited, non-exclusive licenses to digitally distribute certain sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with the Company’s CÜR-branded Internet music service, CÜR Music (“CÜR Music”), the music streaming product we are developing, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. However, we defaulted on the Music Label Agreements as a result of our failure to pay advances due to the Music Labels pursuant to such agreements, and two of the Music Label Agreements were subsequently terminated.
 
On February 16, 2016, we effected a 1-for-13 Reverse Stock Split of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. Share and per share numbers in this report relating to our Common Stock have been retrospectively adjusted to give effect to this Reverse Stock Split, unless otherwise stated. 
 
As of August 2016, we terminated all of our employees and ceased significant operations, other than capital raising activities intended to continue our Music Streaming Business. These capital-raising activities were led by our Founder and then-sole director, Thomas Brophy.

On July 19, 2017, we received a “Wells Notice” from the staff (the “Staff”) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). The Wells Notice provides notification to the Company that the Staff has made a preliminary determination to recommend that the SEC institute administrative proceedings against the Company pursuant to Sections 12(j) and 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), based solely upon our failure to comply with our reporting obligations under Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. Sections 12(j) grants the SEC the right, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, to revoke the registration of a security. Section 12(k) grants the SEC the right to suspend trading in a security.
 
In accordance with SEC rules, on August 25, 2017, we made a written submission to the SEC in response to the Wells Notice, in which, among other things, we conveyed the Company’s present intention to file the delinquent reports and become current with our SEC filing requirements and, as such, set forth the reasons why the proposed enforcement action should not be filed. While no assurances can be made, we believe that, as a result of making these filings, the SEC will have no further reason to institute the proposed administrative proceedings, or, if instituted, to continue such proceedings. However, there can be no assurance that the SEC will not bring an enforcement action against the Company, which could result in a trading suspension of our Common Stock and the de-registration of the Company’s securities under the Exchange Act. With this filing, we have filed all delinquent reports and are up to date with our SEC filing requirements.
 
On September 11, 2017, we entered into a term sheet (the “Term Sheet”) with CUR Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Holdings”) pursuant to which the Company and Holdings agreed to consummate either a Merger (as defined below) or an Asset Transfer (as defined below), under certain circumstances. Pursuant to the Term Sheet, in the event the Company receives notification from the SEC that it will not institute the proposed administrative proceedings, or, if instituted, will discontinue such proceedings (“SEC Clearance”), Holdings will, subject to any required shareholder approval, merge with and into the Company, with the Company continuing as the surviving entity (the “Merger”); provided, however, that the boards of directors of the Company and Holdings may mutually agree to proceed with the Merger prior to receipt of SEC Clearance. If, however, the SEC commences the proposed administrative proceedings against the Company, and such proceedings result in the revocation of the registration of our Common Stock under the Exchange Act (“SEC Revocation”), the Company and Holdings will, subject to any required shareholder approval, enter into an asset purchase and sale transaction, pursuant to which Holdings will acquire all of the intellectual property and other assets and liabilities constituting our Music Streaming Business (the “Asset Transfer” and, together with the Merger, a “Combination Transaction”); provided, however, that the board of directors of the Company and Holdings may mutually agree to proceed with the Asset Transfer any time commencing on the ninety-first (91st) day after the effective date of the Term Sheet, as disclosed below.
 
In anticipation of the Combination Transaction (defined above), on November 16, 2017, Holdings consummated an initial closing (the “Initial Closing”) of its private placement offering (the “Preferred Stock Unit Offering”), to certain “accredited investors” (each, a “Unit Purchaser” and, collectively, the “Unit Purchasers”), intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D and/or Regulation S promulgated thereunder, of a minimum of $6,000,000 (the “Minimum Amount”) of units of securities of Holdings (each, a “Preferred Stock Unit” and, collectively, the “Preferred Stock Units”), at a purchase price of $5.15 per Preferred Stock Unit, with each Preferred Stock Unit consisting of (a) one (1) share of Series A convertible preferred stock of Holdings (each, a “Unit Share” and collectively, the “Unit Shares”), and (b) a 5-year warrant (each, a “Unit Warrant” and collectively, the “Unit Warrants”) to purchase 6.5087 shares of common stock of Holdings, at an exercise price of $1.00 per each full share.
 
In connection with the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, Holdings issued 1,195,033 Preferred Stock Units to the Unit Purchasers, consisting of 1,195,033 Unit Shares and 7,778,119 Unit Warrants, in consideration for gross proceeds of $6,154,362 from the Preferred Stock Unit Offering.
 
In connection with the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, a U.S. broker-dealer registered with FINRA, engaged on a non-exclusive basis as placement agent for the Preferred Stock Unit Offering (the “Placement Agent”), received a cash commission of $115,436, and warrants (“Placement Agent Warrants”) to purchase (a) 22,415 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of Holdings, with a term of five (5) years and an exercise price of $5.15 per share, and (b) 145,893 shares of common stock of Holdings, with a term of five (5) years and an exercise price of $1.00 per share.

Simultaneously with the closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, Holdings consummated a private placement offering (the “$2.5 Million Note Offering” and, together with the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, the “Holdings Offerings”), to one “accredited investor” (the “New Note Purchaser”), intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder, of (a) a 12% senior secured promissory note of Holdings, in the principal amount of $2,500,000 (the “New Note”), with a term of twelve (12) months, at a purchase price of 100% of the face value amount of the New Note, and (b) 10-year warrants (the “New Note Warrants”) to purchase 1,000,000 shares of common stock of Holdings, at an exercise price per share of $0.0001.
 
In connection with the closing of the $2.5 Million Note Offering, the Placement Agent received a cash commission of $250,000, and warrants (“Second Placement Agent Warrants”) to purchase 383,800 shares of common stock of Holdings, with a term of five (5) years and an exercise price of $0.0001 per share.
 
The net proceeds from the Holdings Offerings, in the aggregate amount of $6,932,288 (after deducting fees and expenses related to the Holdings Offerings in the aggregate amount of $722,074 (including placement agent fees, legal fees and expenses and fees payable to the escrow agent)) are to be used to pay the required Label Advances (as defined below) to the Music Labels sufficient to allow Holdings and/or the Company to proceed with soliciting subscriptions for CÜR Music, and to extend a line of credit to the Company (the “Post-Closing Line of Credit Note”), for up to the full amount of the aggregate net proceeds from the Holdings Offerings (1) to enable the Company to pay outstanding accounts payable, employee deferred compensation, and monthly payments due by the Company under the New Note, and (2) for working capital and general corporate purposes. Management feels it can enter into structured settlements with vendors and streaming services. While there is a process for requesting and approving drawdowns, it is not formally documented, approval is on a case by case basis and the terms and associated interest on the Post-Closing Line of Credit Note is to be determined, and will be reflected in the definitive documentation for the transaction. 
 
In addition, simultaneously with the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, the holders (the “Secured Noteholders”) of all of the Company’s existing 12% senior secured convertible promissory notes, in the aggregate principal amount of $2,515,000, with accrued and unpaid interest in the aggregate of $561,203 (each, a “Secured Note” and, collectively, the “Secured Notes”), assigned, conveyed, transferred to Holdings all of the Secured Noteholders’ right, title, interest and obligations in, to and under the Secured Notes, and all claims, suits, causes of action and any other rights thereunder, in exchange for units (each, a “Secured Note Conversion Unit” and, collectively, the “Secured Note Conversion Units”) of securities of Holdings, at an exchange rate of $2.00 of principal and interest due under the Secured Notes per unit, in an transaction intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act, pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) and/or Rule 506 of Regulation D promulgated thereunder (the “Secured Note Assignment Transaction”). Each Secured Note Conversion Unit consisted of (a) one (1) share of common stock of Holdings (each, a “Secured Note Conversion Share” and, collectively, the “Secured Note Conversion Shares”), and (b) a 5-year warrant (each, a “Secured Note Conversion Warrant” and, collectively, the “Secured Note Conversion Warrants”) to purchase one (1) share of common stock of Holdings for every share of common stock of Holdings received upon exchange, at an exercise price per share equal to $1.00. Upon completion of the transaction, CÜR Media is now required to pay Holdings.
 
The Secured Note Assignment Transaction did not alter the obligation of the Company under the original Secured Notes.
 
In connection with the Secured Note Assignment Transaction, (a) Holdings issued 1,538,102 Secured Note Conversion Units, consisting of 1,538,102 Secured Note Conversion Shares, and 1,538,102 Secured Note Conversion Warrants, and (b) Holdings became the sole payee under the Secured Notes.
 
In connection with the Secured Note Assignment Transaction, the Placement Agent, received warrants (“Third Placement Agent Warrants”) to purchase (a) 86,377 shares of common stock of Holdings, with a term of five (5) years and an exercise price of $2.00 per share, and (b) 86,377 shares of common stock of Holdings, with a term of five (5) years and an exercise price of $1.00 per share.

Prior to the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, and as a condition thereto, Holdings renegotiated the content licensing agreements (“New Music Label Agreements”). Upon consummation of the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, Holdings paid advances due to the Music Labels under the New Music Label Agreements. 
 
The Company joined one of the New Music Label Agreements, while the other New Music Label Agreements provide Holdings with the right to sublicense its rights under such agreement to the Company. The New Music Label Agreements enable the Company to digitally distribute sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with our Internet music service, CÜR Music. The New Music Label Agreements released the Company of prior obligations under the original Music Label Agreements. At the current time, the Company does not have a contract with Holdings which requires payment for sublicenses and access to the sound recordings and related materials.
 
On November 16, 2017, the board of directors of Holdings increased the number of members constituting the board of directors from one (1) to three (3). The board of directors of Holdings then appointed Thomas Brophy, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Interim Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and a member of our Board of Directors, and Edward P. Swyer, a member of our Board of Directors, as members of the board of directors of Holdings.
 
Immediately following the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, Holdings issued one (1) share of its Series B voting preferred stock (“Series B Preferred Stock”) to William F. Duker, the President and Treasurer of Holdings, and a member of the board of directors of Holdings. Pursuant to the Certificate of Designation of Series B Voting Preferred stock of Holdings (the “Series B Certificate of Designation”), Mr. Duker, the holder of the Series B Preferred Stock, has the right (a) to elect the number of directors on the board of directors of Holdings constituting the majority, and (b) to approve any merger (including the Merger), asset sale (including the Asset Transfer), or other fundamental transaction to be effected by Holdings.
 
As mentioned above, if the Company receives SEC Clearance (or, at the discretion of the board of directors of the Company and Holdings, as described above), the Company and Holdings will consummate the Merger. The Company and Holdings anticipate that the Merger, if consummated, will qualify as a tax-free reorganization under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code. The Company and Holdings also anticipate that, if the Merger is consummated:
 


· | the stockholders of Holdings will receive, in exchange for all of their issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Holdings (including all issued and outstanding shares of preferred stock of Holdings), shares of the Company’s capital stock (including shares of Preferred Stock of the Company), at an exchange rate of 1-for-1, with appropriate adjustments and, otherwise, on their original terms and conditions; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | outstanding warrants to purchase shares of common stock of Holdings will be exchanged for warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock, at the same ratio at which shares of outstanding capital stock of Holdings are exchanged for shares of the Company’s capital stock, with appropriate adjustments and, otherwise, on their original terms and conditions; 
· | the principal and any accrued and unpaid interest due under the Company’s existing 12% unsecured convertible promissory notes (the “Unsecured Notes”) will convert into units of the Company’s securities, at a conversion price of $2.00 of principal and interest due under said note per unit, each consisting of (a) one (1) share of the Company’s Common Stock, and (b) a 5-year warrant to purchase one (1) share of the Company’s Common Stock for every share of the Company’s Common Stock received upon conversion, at an exercise price equal to $1.00 per share;
· | the Standard Holdings Note will be assigned and transferred to the Company, and the Company will become the payee under such note;

· | the Line of Credit Note, the Secured Notes, and the Post-Closing Line of Credit Note will be forgiven and canceled by Holdings;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the Company will assume the obligations under the $2,500,000 New Note; and 
· | the Company will assume the New Music Label Agreements with the Music Labels, if possible. 

 
As mentioned above, if there is an SEC Revocation of the Company’s Common Stock under the Exchange Act (or, at the discretion of the boards of directors of the Company and Holdings, as described above), the Company and Holdings will consummate the Asset Transfer. The Company and Holdings anticipate that, if the Asset Transfer is consummated:
 


· | the Company’s stockholders will receive, in exchange for all of the assets and liabilities constituting the Company’s Music Streaming Business, shares of capital stock of Holdings, at a rate of 1-for-1 of equivalent classes of preferred and common stock, with appropriate adjustments and, otherwise, on their original terms and conditions; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | outstanding warrants and stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock will be exchanged for warrants and stock options to purchase shares of common stock of Holdings, at the same ratio at which shares of the Company’s outstanding capital stock are exchanged for shares of capital stock of Holdings, with appropriate adjustments and, otherwise, on their original terms and conditions; 
· | if necessary, the board of directors of Holdings will adopt an Equity Incentive Plan (the “Holdings EIP”) with such number of shares available under the Holdings EIP that equals 15% of the fully diluted capitalization of Holdings after giving effect to the Asset Transfer, covering outstanding stock options to purchase shares of the Company’s Common Stock, and for the future issuance, at the discretion of the board of directors of Holdings, of incentive awards to officers, key employees, consultants and directors;
· | the principal and any accrued and unpaid interest due under the Company’s existing Unsecured Notes will convert into units of securities of Holdings, at a conversion price of $2.00 per unit, each unit consisting of (a) one (1) share of common stock of Holdings, and (b) a 5-year warrant to purchase one (1) share of common stock of Holdings for every share of common stock of Holdings received upon conversion, at an exercise price equal to $1.00 per share; 
· | the Standard Holdings Note will remain payable to Holdings; 
· | the Line of Credit Note, the Secured Notes, and the Post-Closing Line of Credit Note will be forgiven and canceled by Holdings as partial consideration for the transfer to Holdings of the assets and liabilities constituting the Company’s Music Streaming Business; 
· | Holdings will remain responsible for the obligations under the $2,500,000 New Note; and 
· | any sublicenses under the relevant New Music Label Agreements with the Music Labels will terminate. 

 
Simultaneously with the closing of the Holdings Offerings, shareholders representing at least fifty-one percent (51%) of the voting capital stock of each of the Company and Holdings, and of the Unit Purchasers in the Preferred Stock Unit Offering and Secured Noteholders in the Secured Note Assignment transaction, entered into voting agreements, pursuant to which they agreed to vote in favor of the Combination Transaction, as applicable.
 
The Company and Holdings have two common members on their boards of directors. However, they are two separate and distinct entities with two completely different sets of officers running their day-to-day affairs, separate corporate offices where their books and records are separately kept, and very different shareholder bases. Further, while Holdings has agreed to extend a line of credit to the Company for up to the full amount of the aggregate net proceeds from the Holdings Offerings, drawdowns against the line of credit must be requested by the Company and approved by Holdings. Requests may be approved or rejected by Holdings on a case-by-case basis.

Following the closing of the Holdings Offerings, we appointed Thomas Brophy as President and Chief Executive Officer, John Egazarian as Head of Product, Chief Operating Officer, Michael Betts as Chief Technology Officer, and Kelly Sardo as Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, and have hired five other full-time employees. We have restarted our business operations and expect to launch CÜR Music in the second or third quarter of 2018.
 
Our Business
 
CÜR Music, our CÜR-branded Internet music service, to be comprised of three progressively priced and increasingly functional tiers, will provide a paid subscription internet radio service offering listeners streaming music on the web and mobile devices. CÜR Music began as Raditaz, a free internet radio product, which was launched in 2012, and had iPhone and Android applications in addition to a website at www.raditaz.com. We took the Raditaz iPhone and Android applications, and our website, offline to focus our resources on the development of CÜR Music. As of the date of this Annual Report, we had devoted substantially all of our efforts to product development, raising capital and building our technology infrastructure. We expect to launch CÜR Music in the second or third quarter of 2018.
Our Service
 
CÜR Music is intended to be a new social streaming music experience that combines the listening experience of free internet radio products with an on-demand listening experience for listening on mobile devices and the web. CÜR Music will target consumers who are seeking a more comprehensive music streaming service than current free, ad-supported music streaming products. Upon launching, two subscription levels will be offered for a monthly cost to the consumer of starting at $1.99 for the first subscription level and $4.99 for the second subscription level. A full on-demand product is being developed and will be available post launch.
 
As designed, the CÜR Music product includes a hybrid model that includes many features that free, ad-supported internet radio products provide, without interruptive advertising, and with a limited on-demand offering. The limited on-demand offering is a CÜR8, eight songs chosen by the user for them to use on an on-demand basis. In addition, CÜR Music includes functionality that enables consumers to curate their playlists with photos and short personal videos and to share music with their friends. The product includes social features that allow users to follow and be followed by other users, view activity and listen to other users' limited on-demand CÜR8s.
 
Our primary business is CÜR Music, a music service that will give listeners access to millions of songs that can be listened to using CÜR Music's algorithmic internet radio stations, CÜR Music's genre and theme-based stations, and through CÜR Music's on-demand listening features. In addition to the ability to stream music, subscribers will be able to personalize their playlists, buy music downloads, share songs with friends and add photos and short personal videos to songs in their playlists and to songs in the sharing process. 
 
Our business plan also includes a second revenue stream of personalized advertising, which we do not intend to interrupt a music stream, but targets a user's listening habits. We believe the advertising will be in the form of display ads, email and/or text messages. We intend to integrate personalized advertising into certain aspects of the CÜR Music product when we achieve a reasonable level of scale.
 
Our business plan further includes a third revenue stream from the sale of music, concert tickets and merchandise through our music streaming service, tailored to each listeners taste based on prior listening trends. We plan to begin to sell concert tickets and merchandise at a later date after the launch of CÜR Music. 
 
In addition, our business plan includes distributing CÜR Music's music streaming service through Apple's iTunes App Store to iOS devices, Google's Google Play Store to Android devices and the internet among other distribution channels and platforms. At launch, we plan to have an iPhone application, an iPad application, an Android application and a website.

We plan to source our music from MusicNet, Inc. d/b/a Media Net Digital, Inc. We will use Amazon web services, and services from other technology providers, to support certain of the technological needs of the business. 
 
In early 2016, the Company had entered into Music Label Agreements with certain Music Labels, pursuant to which the Company was provided limited, non-exclusive licenses to digitally distribute certain sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with CÜR Music, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. 
 
The Company was not able to make the initial payments required under the agreements when due on January 31, 2016. As a result, our Music Label Agreements with Sony Music Entertainment (“SME”) and UMG Recordings, Inc. (“UMG”) were terminated as a result of our failure to pay SME and UMG the advances due pursuant to such agreements, respectively. The Company also defaulted on its Music Label Agreement with Warner Music, Inc. (“WMG”) as a result of its failure to pay WMG the advance due pursuant to such agreement. WMG did not initiate termination of their agreement. 
 
Prior to the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, and as a condition thereto, Holdings renegotiated the content licensing agreements (“New Music Label Agreements”). Upon consummation of the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, Holdings paid the Label Advances to the Music Labels pursuant to the New Music Label Agreements. We joined one of the New Music Label Agreements with one of the Music Labels, while the other New Music Label Agreements provide Holdings with the right to sublicense its rights under such agreement to the Company. The New Music Label Agreements enable Holdings and/or the Company to digitally distribute sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with our Internet music service, CÜR Music. The Company and Holdings are required to pay certain minimum content fees over the term of the Content Agreements with Content Providers as follows: $15.1 million in the first year of the agreements, $24.5 million in the second year of the agreements, and $18.4 million in the third year of the agreements. The New Music Label Agreements released the Company of prior obligations under the original Music Label Agreements. At the current time, the Company does not have a contract with Holdings which requires payment for sublicenses and access to the sound recordings and related materials.
 
Now that the New Music Label Agreements are in place, we plan to have a team of software engineers, led by our management, working on enhancing the technology platform, as well as the iOS and Android applications and the CÜR Music website. We are currently fine-tuning the user interface and user experience of CÜR Music's iPhone, iPad and Android applications, our website, and our backend systems, and will continue to do so through launch. We plan to submit CÜR Music's iOS app and CÜR Music's Android app for approval by the iTunes App Store and the Google Play Store, respectively. We plan on developing the marketing timeline for marketing the launch of CÜR Music, which will include paid media, public relations, social media, event sponsorships and marketing through influencers. Success of those strategies will determine the amount of marketing spending allocated to each of these marketing strategies.
 
Not including non-cash expenses, we have spent approximately $22.9 million on research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative costs to complete the development of the CÜR Music, in the time period since the Contribution in January 2014 and through the date of this filing. Of the total $22.9 million, approximately $16.3 million is related to research and development and approximately $6.6 million is related to general and administrative costs. In addition to the aforementioned costs, we expect to pay approximately $3 million dollars as prepayments in connection with the agreements that we have with the major music labels, independent labels and publishers.
 
Source and Content 
 
On July 1, 2014 the Company entered into a data license and service agreement (the “Data License and Services Agreement”) with Rovi Data Solutions, Inc. and Veveo, Inc. (collectively, “Rovi”), acquiring the limited, non-exclusive, non- transferable right to use, display, communicate, reproduce and transmit data owned or controlled by Rovi. On September 8 and September 18, 2014, a first amendment and second amendment to the Data License and Service Agreement, respectively, were executed which expanded the original license to include custom development of search and voice capabilities. The Data License and Service Agreement remained in effect through and including March 14, 2017. The Company has the option to extend the term of this agreement for additional one-year periods. During the term of the Data License Agreement and as consideration for the grant of rights and license of Rovi’s data, the Company agreed to pay Rovi a monthly minimum charge during the development period, which is the period where data will be used for internal, non-public, non-commercial uses. The Company agreed to pay a minimum per month during the first initial term, subsequent to launch date until March 14, 2016. For each subsequent term, consideration paid was dependent on the number of subscribers to CUR Music. As of September 27, 2016, the Company’s Data License and Services Agreement with Rovi terminated as a result of the Company’s failure to pay Rovi past due balances for the services provided under the Agreement. As of December 31, 2017, the Company has not made any payments to Rovi however has accrued for balances due. The Company has not received a notice of default from Rovi.

With the Holdings Offerings complete, Holdings contracted with Gracenote, Inc. (“Gracenote”) for the services previously provided by Rovi to the Company. 
 
We also entered into an agreement (the "MediaNet Service Agreement") with MusicNet, Inc. d/b/a MediaNet Digital, Inc. ("MediaNet") on November 10, 2014, from which we were to source our music. Pursuant to the agreement, MediaNet was to provide the Company a catalog of sound recordings and metadata that would enable and provide for the delivery of sound recordings to end users of the Company's CÜR Music application. The MediaNet Service Agreement was to remain in effect for a period of three years following the effective date of November 7, 2014. The MediaNet Service Agreement was to automatically renew for successive one-year terms unless terminated by MediaNet or the Company. Pursuant to the MediaNet Service Agreement, the Company was to pay a set-up fee to MediaNet prior to launch. In addition, the Company agreed to pay MediaNet a monthly technology licensing fee during the initial term, a monthly usage fee, and will pay for any additional professional services and technical assistance or customization. The Company is in default under the MediaNet Service Agreement with MediaNet as a result of the Company’s failure to pay MediaNet past due balances for the services they provided under the MediaNet Service Agreement. The unpaid monthly fees have been accrued by the Company. To date, the Company has not received a notice of default from MediaNet. The Company intends to cure the default and/or enter into a new contract with MediaNet now that it is adequately funded. 
 
We entered into an agreement (“Master Subscription Agreement”) with Zuora, Inc. ("Zuora") on July 31, 2014. Pursuant to the Master Subscription Agreement with Zuora, we planned to use Zuora's technology platform to administer the subscription process related to credit card billing and collection. In accordance with the Master Subscription Agreement, Zuora was to provide the Company a non-exclusive, non-transferable worldwide limited license to use Zuora's online integrated subscription management, billing, and data analysis services. The initial order form covered the implementation and development period ending October 31, 2014. In addition, the Company agreed to an initial 36-month service term, subsequent to implementation through October 31, 2017. On October 12, 2016, the Company received a notice of default from Zuora, confirming that the Company was in default under its Master Subscription Agreement with Zuora as a result of its failure to pay Zuora past due balances for the services they provided under the Master Subscription Agreement. On July 31, 2017, the Company and Zuora signed a new order form (“New Order Form”) under the Master Subscription Agreement, providing for the full settlement and release of the parties from all obligations under the old order form, dated July 31, 2014, in consideration for entering into the New Order Form. Upon execution of the New Order Form, the Company paid Zuora $125,000 and accrued $25,000 as of December 31, 2017 for the first year of the three-year agreement for Zuora to provide subscription services to the Company.
 
We plan to use Amazon web services, and services from other technology providers, to support certain of the technological needs of the business.

General
 
As previously reported, the Company had entered into agreements (“Music Label Agreements”) with certain music labels (“Music Labels”), pursuant to which the Company has been provided limited, non-exclusive licenses to digitally distribute certain sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with the Company’s CÜR-branded Internet music service, CÜR Music, to be composed of three progressively priced and increasingly functional tiers, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. The Company had also entered into agreements (“Publishing Agreements”) with certain music publishing companies (“Music Publishers”) either directly or through a third party, pursuant to which the Company had been provided the non-exclusive right and license to use certain musical works owned, controlled and/or administered by the Music Publishers in connection with CÜR Music, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. The Music Label Agreements and Publishing Agreements may be collectively referred to herein as the “Content Agreements,” and the Music Labels and Music Publishers may be collectively referred to herein as the “Content Providers.”

The Company was not able to make initial payments when due under the Music Label Agreements. As a result, our Music Label Agreements with SME and UMG were terminated as a result of our failure to pay SME and UMG the advances due pursuant to such agreements, respectively. The Company also defaulted on its Music Label Agreement with WMG as a result of its failure to pay WMG the advance due pursuant to such agreement. WMG did not initiate termination of their agreement.
 
Prior to the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, and as a condition thereto, Holdings entered directly into the New Music Label Agreements with the Music Labels. Upon consummation of the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, Holdings paid the Label Advances to the Music Labels in the aggregate amount of $2,500,000. The Company joined one of the New Music Label Agreements, while the other New Music Label Agreements provide CÜR Holdings with the right to sublicense its rights under such agreement to the Company. The New Music Label Agreements enable Holdings and/or the Company to digitally distribute sound recordings and related materials owned or controlled by the Music Labels in connection with our Internet music service, CÜR Music. The New Music Agreements released the Company of prior obligations under the original Music Label Agreements. At the current time, the Company does not have a contract with Holdings which requires payment for sublicenses and access to the sound recordings and related materials.
 
The Company had previously entered into agreements ("Publishing Agreements") with certain music publishing companies ("Music Publishers"), pursuant to which the Company was provided the non-exclusive right and license to use certain musical works owned, controlled and/or administered by the Music Publishers (the "Publisher Materials") in connection with CÜR Music, within the United States and its territories, commonwealths, and possessions. The Company is currently in default of the Publishing Agreements and intends to enter into new agreements prior to the launch of CÜR Music. 
 
We intend to enter into content licensing agreements with certain independent labels prior to the launch of CÜR Music. We plan to negotiate and execute other independent label content licensing agreements subsequent to the launch of CÜR Music. We also intend to enter into content licensing agreements with music publishers and performance rights organizations. When we enter into these content license agreements with these labels, publishers and performance rights organizations, our platform is expected to provide end users access to millions of sound recordings.
 
The Company and Holdings are required to pay certain minimum content fees over the term of the Content Agreements with Content Providers as follows: $15.1 million in the first year of the agreements, $24.5 million in the second year of the agreements, and $18.4 million in the third year of the agreements. Upon consummation of the Initial Closing of the Preferred Stock Unit Offering, Holdings paid the Label Advances to the Music Labels in the aggregate amount of $2,500,000. We expect to bring CÜR Music to market in the second or third quarter of 2018 and begin to generate subscription revenue. However, we need to raise a substantial amount of capital to fully implement our business plan, market CÜR Music, for additional content license costs, and for general working capital. 
 
Marketing
 
We plan to bring a transformative music service to market by focusing intently on Millennials and creating a brand that is more personal and accessible than any other music service in the marketplace. Our marketing plan includes paid media, distribution arrangements, social media and event marketing.

Competition for Listeners 
 
We will face competition from larger and more established media service providers. We must compete for the time and attention of listeners with more established companies offering similar services. We will compete on the basis of a number of factors, including quality of experience, relevance, acceptance and diversity of content, ease of use, price, accessibility, perceptions of ad load, brand awareness and reputation. We also will compete for listeners on the basis of our presence and visibility as compared with other providers that deliver content through the internet, mobile devices and consumer products. Many of our current and potential future competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories and larger marketing budgets, as well as substantially greater financial, technical and other resources. For additional details on risks related to competition for listeners, please refer to the section entitled "Risk Factors" below.
 
Our competitors include:
 
 
· | Other Radio Providers. We expect to compete for listeners with broadcast radio providers, including terrestrial radio providers such as iHeart Radio (formerly Clear Channel) and CBS and satellite radio providers such as Sirius XM among others. Many broadcast radio companies own large numbers of radio stations or other media properties. Many terrestrial radio stations have begun broadcasting digital signals, which provide high quality audio transmission. In addition, unlike participants in the emerging internet radio market, terrestrial and satellite radio providers, as aggregate entities of their subsidiary providers, generally enjoy larger established audiences and longer operating histories. Broadcast and satellite radio companies enjoy a significant cost advantage because we believe they pay a much lower percentage of revenue for transmissions of sound recordings.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Internet Radio Providers. We also will compete directly with emerging non-interactive online radio providers such as Pandora, Spotify, Apple’s Apple Music, iHeart Radio, Slacker Personal Radio and CBS's Last.fm. We could face additional competition if known incumbents in the digital media space choose to enter the internet radio market. 
· | Other Audio Entertainment Providers. We will face competition from providers of interactive on-demand audio content and pre-recorded entertainment, such as Spotify, Apple's Apple Music and iTunes Music Store, Napster, Google Play, Tidal and Amazon, among others that allow listeners to select the audio content that they stream or purchase. This interactive on-demand content is accessible in automobiles and homes, using portable players, mobile phones and other wireless devices. The audio entertainment marketplace continues to rapidly evolve, providing our listeners with a growing number of alternatives and new media platforms. 
· | Other Forms of Media. We will compete for the time and attention of our listeners with providers of other forms of in-home and mobile entertainment. To the extent existing or potential listeners choose to watch cable television, stream video from on-demand services such as Netflix, Hulu, VEVO or YouTube, or play interactive video games on their home-entertainment system, computer or mobile phone, rather than listen to the CÜR Music service, these content services pose a competitive threat. 

   We believe our competitive advantages will include:
 
 
· | Our product will not contain interruptive advertising. This feature will be attractive for all music listeners that do not want their music constantly interrupted with audio "ads."
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | Our product enables users to share songs and integrate their music with photos and personal video. 
· | Our product is a hybrid music streaming service that offers internet radio style listening capability with an on-demand component that includes an 8-song musical selfie - the CÜR8.
· | Our product features a unique, user interface and experience with our "buttonless player".

Competition for Advertisers 
 
We intend to generate a portion of our revenue from advertising on our website and mobile applications. We will be in competition for potential advertisers with other content providers for a share of our advertising customers' overall marketing budgets. We anticipate having to compete on the basis of a number of factors, including perceived return on investment, effectiveness and relevance of our advertising products, pricing structure and ability to deliver large volumes or precise types of ads to targeted demographics. We believe that our ability to deliver targeted and relevant ads across a wide range of platforms allows us to compete favorably on the basis of these factors and justify a long-term profitable pricing structure. However, the market for online and mobile advertising solutions is intensely competitive and rapidly changing, and with the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. For additional details on risks related to competition, please refer to the section entitled "Risk Factors" below. 
 
Terrestrial broadcast and to a lesser extent satellite radio are significant sources of competition for advertising dollars. These radio providers deliver ads across platforms that are more familiar to traditional advertisers than the internet might be. Advertisers may be reluctant to migrate advertising dollars to our internet-based platform. Additionally, we expect to compete for advertising dollars with other traditional media companies in television and print, such as ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC, cable television channel providers, national newspapers such as The New York Times and the Wall Street Journal and some regional newspapers. These traditional outlets present us with a number of competitive challenges in attracting advertisers, including large established audiences, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition and a growing presence on the internet.
 
Government Regulation
 
As a company that intends to conduct business on the internet, we will be subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations relating to consumer protection, information security, data protection and privacy, among other things. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the area of information security and data protection, the laws in several states require companies to implement specific information security controls to protect certain types of information. Likewise, all but a few states have laws in place requiring companies to notify users if there is a security breach that compromises certain categories of their information. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws may subject us to significant liabilities. 
 
We are also subject to federal and state laws regarding privacy of listener data. Once we launch the CÜR Music product, we will adopt a privacy policy, which will describe our practices concerning the use, transmission and disclosure of listener information and will be posted on our website. Any failure to comply with our posted privacy policy or privacy-related laws and regulations could result in proceedings against us by governmental authorities or others, which could harm our business. Further, any failure by us to adequately protect the privacy or security of our listeners' information could result in a loss of confidence in our service among existing and potential listeners, and ultimately, in a loss of listeners and advertising customers, which could adversely affect our business. 
 
Intellectual Property 
 
Our success depends upon our ability to protect our technologies and intellectual property. To accomplish this, we rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, trademarks, contractual restrictions, technological measures and other methods. We entered into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants and business partners, and we control access to and distribution of our proprietary information. 
 
We have registered the internet domain name www.curmusic.com for our website, as well as various other domain names. We have registered trademarks for "Raditaz," "Tunevision" and "CÜR."

Research and Development
 
Prior to launch, we are devoting substantially all of our financial and business focus to enhance the product, raise capital, negotiate content licensing arrangements and build our technology infrastructure. 
 
Research and development expenses were approximately $6.6 million since inception through the year ended December 31, 2017, comprised primarily of employee wages and professional services associated with the CÜR Music application development of the user interface, user experience, back-end technology on all platforms, iOS, Android and Web. Research and Development also include the costs of content while in development and Beta.
 
Employees 
 
On August 16, 2016, we had laid off all of our employees and ceased significant operations, other than capital raising activities intended to continue our Music Streaming Business. We hired an Investor Relations Analyst on January 8, 2017, but terminated his employment as of August 17, 2017. We recently appointed Thomas Brophy as President and Chief Executive Officer, John Egazarian as Head of Product, Chief Operating Officer, Michael Betts as Chief Technology Officer, and Kelly Sardo as Chief Financial Officer, Secretary and Treasurer, and have hired nine other full-time employees. As a result, as of the date hereof, we have thirteen full-time regular employees. None of our employees were or are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Generally, we considered our relations with our employees to be good. However, the Company has not yet paid its employees for work rendered during the first three quarters of 2016. Other than the 2016 accrued payroll, no other periods have been unpaid and accrued. It is the Company's intention to pay the accrued payroll as soon as practicable. Certain of the Company’s former employees have filed claims against the Company for payment of unpaid wages totaling $50,000 which remain outstanding. In addition, the Company has agreed to settlements on employee claims totaling $237,343 which also remain outstanding. The Company expects to pay these claims and settlements as soon as practicable. 
Reports to Security Holders
 
We file annual, quarterly and current reports and other information with the SEC. You may read and copy any reports, statement or other information that we file with the SEC at the SEC's public reference room at 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20549.
