Item 1. Business.
Preliminary Note
 
As of October, 2015, (the first quarter of fiscal 2016), we laid off all of our employees, and ceased compensating our officers, and suspended substantially all of our operations due to lack of funds. The description below related to our historical business. If we do not receive substantial financing, we will need to completely shut down our operations.
Corporate History and Structure
 
We were incorporated in Delaware in September 1997 for the purpose of acquiring Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Canadian corporation formed in November 1995 to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and development and other activities. Our acquisition of Generex Pharmaceuticals was completed in October 1997 in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of Generex Pharmaceuticals exchanged their shares for shares of our common stock.
 
In January 1998, we participated in a "reverse acquisition" with Green Mt. P. S., Inc., an inactive Idaho corporation formed in 1983. As a result of this transaction, our shareholders (the former shareholders of Generex Pharmaceuticals) acquired a majority (approximately 90%) of the outstanding capital stock of Green Mt., we became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Green Mt., Green Mt. changed its corporate name to Generex Biotechnology Corporation ("Generex Idaho"), and we changed our corporate name to GB Delaware, Inc. Because the reverse acquisition resulted in our shareholders becoming the majority holders of Generex Idaho, we were treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes. Thus, our historical financial statements, which essentially represented the historical financial statements of Generex Pharmaceuticals, were deemed to be the historical financial statements of Generex Idaho.
 
In April 1999, we completed a reorganization in which we merged with Generex Idaho. In this transaction, all outstanding shares of Generex Idaho were converted into our shares, Generex Idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity, and we changed our corporate name back to "Generex Biotechnology Corporation." This reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting.
 
Subsidiaries
 
Following our reorganization in 1999, Generex Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is incorporated in Ontario, Canada, remained as our wholly-owned subsidiary. All of our Canadian operations are performed by Generex Pharmaceuticals. Generex Pharmaceuticals is the 100% owner of 1097346 Ontario Inc., which is also incorporated in Ontario, Canada. In August 2003, we acquired Antigen Express, Inc., a Delaware incorporated company. Antigen is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant, infectious, autoimmune and allergic diseases. Antigen also does business under the names Generex Oncology and Generex Infectious Diseases.
 
We formed Generex (Bermuda), Inc., which is organized in Bermuda, in January 2001 in connection with a joint venture with Elan International Services, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Elan Corporation, plc, to pursue the application of certain of our and Elan's drug delivery technologies, including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products. In December 2004, we and Elan agreed to terminate the joint venture. Under the termination agreement, we retained all of our intellectual property rights and obtained full ownership of Generex (Bermuda). Generex (Bermuda) does not currently conduct any business activities. We have additional subsidiaries incorporated in the U.S. and Canada which are dormant and do not carry on any business activities.
 
Overview of Business
 
We are engaged primarily in the research and development of drug delivery systems and technologies. Our primary focus at the present time is our proprietary technology for the administration of formulations of large molecule drugs to the oral (buccal) cavity using a hand-held aerosol applicator. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Antigen, we have expanded our focus to include immunomedicines incorporating proprietary vaccine formulations.
 
We believe that our buccal delivery technology is a platform technology that has application to many large molecule drugs and provides a convenient, non-invasive, accurate and cost-effective way to administer such drugs. We have identified several large molecule drugs as possible candidates for development, including estrogen, heparin, monoclonal antibodies, human growth hormone and fertility hormones, but to date have focused our development efforts primarily on one pharmaceutical product, Generex Oral-lyn™, an insulin formulation administered as a fine spray into the oral cavity using our proprietary hand-held aerosol spray applicator known as RapidMist™.

Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Antigen, concentrates on developing proprietary vaccine formulations that work by stimulating the immune system to either attack offending agents (i.e., cancer cells, bacteria, and viruses) or to stop attacking benign elements (i.e., self proteins and allergens). Our immunomedicine products are based on two platform technologies and are in the early stages of development. We continue clinical development of Antigen’s synthetic peptide vaccines designed to stimulate a potent and specific immune response against tumors expressing the HER-2/neu oncogene for patients with HER-2/neu positive breast cancer in a Phase II clinical trial and patients with prostate cancer and against avian influenza in two Phase I clinical trials. We also initiated an additional Phase I clinical trial in patients with either breast or ovarian cancer.  The synthetic vaccine technology has certain advantages for pandemic or potentially pandemic viruses, such as the H5N1 avian and H1N1 swine flu.  In addition to developing vaccines for pandemic influenza viruses, we have vaccine development efforts underway for seasonal influenza virus, HIV, HPV, melanoma, ovarian cancer, allergy and Type I diabetes mellitus. We have established collaborations with clinical investigators at academic centers to advance these technologies.
 
To date, we have received regulatory approval in Ecuador, India (subject to regulatory approval of a 2012 in-country study), Lebanon and Algeria for the commercial marketing and sale of Generex Oral-lyn™. We have previously submitted regulatory dossiers for Generex Oral-lyn™ in a number of other countries, including Bangladesh, Kenya, Jordan and Armenia. While we believe these countries will ultimately approve our product for commercial sale, we do not anticipate recognizing revenues in any of these jurisdictions in the next twelve months. No dossier related activities or product shipments have taken place during fiscal 2014 or 2015, nor are any expected to these countries during the remainder of calendar year 2015. In March 2008, we initiated Phase III clinical trials for this product in the U.S. with the first patient screening for such trials at a clinical study site in Texas in April 2008. Approximately 450 patients were enrolled at approximately 70 clinical sites around the world, including sites in the United States, Canada, Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, Russia, Ukraine and Ecuador. The final subjects completed the trial in August 2011. After appropriate validation, the data from approximately 450 patients was tabulated, reviewed and analyzed. Those results from the Phase III trial along with a comprehensive review and supplemental analyses of approximately 40 prior Oral-lyn clinical studies were compiled and submitted to the FDA in late December 2011 in a comprehensive package including a composite metanalysis of all safety data. . We do not currently plan to expend significant resources on additional clinical trials of Oral-lyn™ until after such time that we secure sufficient additional financing. However, we have initiated a project with the University Health Network of the University of Toronto, and the University of Guelph, Ontario to enhance the formulation of Generex Oral-lyn™ in order to reduce the number of puffs required for prandial use. Early results in an animal study have been encouraging and we expect to release the final results in the third quarter of 2015.
 
In November 2008 we, together with our marketing partner Shreya Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd., officially launched Generex Oral-lyn™ in India under marketing name of Oral Recosulin™. Each package of Oral Recosulin™ contains two canisters of our product along with one actuator. The product received regulatory price approval in India in January 2009. Per the requirements of the regulatory approval in India, an in-country clinical study must be completed in India with Oral Recosulin™ before commercial sales can commence. The field portion of the study was completed in the third calendar quarter of 2012.  Shreya has advised Generex that the dossier was submitted in December of 2012 to the Drugs Controller General (India) (DCGI), Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Generex has provided additional, detailed scientific data to support the Shreya submission. We have not recognized any revenues from the sale of Generex Oral-lyn™ in India through fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 and do not expect any revenues to be recognized in India in the next twelve months.
 
In December 2008, we, together with our marketing partner Benta S.A., received an approval to market Generex Oral-lyn™ in Lebanon. The official product launch in Lebanon took place in May 2009. In May 2009, the Algerian health authorities granted us permission to import and sell Generex Oral-lyn™ for the treatment of diabetes in Algeria. The official product launch in Algeria took place in October 2009. To date, we have not recognized any revenue from the sales of Generex Oral-lyn™ in Algeria and very minimal revenues in Lebanon. We do not anticipate any revenues to be recognized from these jurisdictions in the next twelve months.
 
We face competition from other providers of alternate forms of insulin. Some of our most significant competitors, Pfizer, Eli Lilly, and Novo Nordisk, have discontinued development and/or sale of their inhalable forms of insulin. MannKind introduced a new pulmonary insulin which was approved by the FDA in 2014, and MannKind subsequently partnered with sanofi-aventis to market the product under the tradename of Afrezza.
 
Generex Oral-lyn™ is not an inhaled insulin; rather, it is a buccally absorbed formulation with no pulmonary deposition. We believe that our buccal delivery technology offers several advantages, including the ease of use, portability, avoidance of pulmonary inhalation and safety profile. Furthermore, insulin administered through the Generex Oral-lyn™ RapidMist™ technology is absorbed directly into the blood stream and not only acts rapidly, but returns to baseline quickly, thereby minimizing the chance of developing hypoglycemia.
 
Large pharmaceutical companies, such as Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Novartis, Inc., MedImmune Inc. (a subsidiary of Astra-Zeneca, Inc.) and others, also compete against us in the oncology, immunomedicine and vaccine markets. These companies have competing experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, as well as manufacturing and marketing approved products. As such, they are also considered significant competitors in these fields of pharmaceutical products and therapies. There are also many smaller companies which are pursuing similar technologies in these fields who are considered to be competitors of Generex.

We are a development stage company with a limited history of operations, and do not expect sufficient revenues to support our operation in the immediately foreseeable future. To date, we have not been profitable and our accumulated net loss available to shareholders was $375,704,372 at July 31, 2016. As of July 31, 2016, our current cash position is not sufficient to meet our working capital needs for the next twelve months. To continue operations, we will require additional funds to support our working capital requirements and any development activities, or will need to suspend operations. Management is seeking various alternatives to ensure that we can meet some of our operating cash flow requirements through financing activities, such as private placement of our common stock, preferred stock offerings and offerings of debt and convertible debt instruments as well as through merger or acquisition opportunities. In addition, management is actively seeking strategic alternatives, including strategic investments and divestitures. We have sold non-essential real estate assets which were classified as Assets Held for Investment to augment our cash position. We cannot provide any assurance that we will obtain the required funding. Our inability to obtain required funding in the near future or our inability to obtain funding on favorable terms will have a material adverse effect on our operations and our strategic development plan for future growth. If we cannot successfully raise additional capital and implement our strategic development plan, our liquidity, financial condition and business prospects will be materially and adversely affected and we may have to cease operations.
 
We operate in only one segment: the research and development of drug delivery systems and technologies for metabolic and immunological diseases.
 
Our Business Strategy
 
Our business model focuses on the research and development of diabetes, oncology and infectious diseases drugs.  This business model leverages the expertise of our management team, scientific advisory board and the history of our company. Our goal is to develop next generation drugs for diabetes, oncology and infectious disease by leveraging our buccal delivery technology to administer large and small molecule drugs, including insulin, and proprietary vaccine formulations based upon two Antigen platform technologies to provide innovative biopharmaceutical products that offer the potential for superior efficacy and safety over existing products.  To achieve these goals, the key elements of our strategy include:

• | Completing any additional studies or clinical trials of Generex Oral-lyn™, which may be required in order to obtain regulatory approval in major and other jurisdictions; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Enhancing the formulation for Generex Oral-lyn™ to increase effectiveness and to improve the potential for new financing for additional clinical trials. 
• | Developing a proprietary portfolio of products for the treatment of diabetes through strategic partnerships licensing and acquisitions; 


• | A keystone of Generex’s strategy, announced at the annual meeting of stockholders in June 2011 is the proposed spin-out of Antigen Express as a separate company from Generex. Management believes that this action would allow Antigen to establish value for its immunotherapeutic vaccine technologies separate from the Generex buccal drug delivery platform technologies. The spin-out would be accomplished by the issuance of one or more dividends of Antigen Express stock to Generex stockholders; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Completing the ongoing Phase II clinical trials of Antigen’s synthetic peptide vaccines designed to stimulate a potent and specific immune response against tumors expressing the HER-2/neu oncogene for patients with HER-2/neu positive breast cancer, conducting a Phase II prostate cancer trial and a Phase I trial in patients with breast or ovarian cancer; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Conducting further clinical trials of Antigen’s synthetic peptide vaccines against avian (H5N1) influenza and initiating clinical trial of such vaccines against swine (H1N1) influenza; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Exploring other applications for our RapidMist platform buccal technology; morphine, LWH, fentanyl (all of which have undergone Phase I clinical studies), as well as cell therapy for late stage diabetes. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Buccal Delivery Technology and Products
 
Our buccal delivery technology involves the preparation of proprietary formulations in which an active pharmaceutical agent is placed in a solution with a combination of absorption enhancers and other excipients classified “generally recognized as safe” ("GRAS") by the United States Food and Drug Administration (the "FDA") when used in accordance with specified quantities and other limitations. The resulting formulations are aerosolized with a pharmaceutical grade chemical propellant and are administered to patients using our proprietary RapidMist™ brand metered dose inhaler. The device is a small, lightweight, hand-held, easy-to-use aerosol applicator comprised of a container for the formulation, a metered dose valve, an actuator and dust cap. Using the device, patients self-administer the formulations by spraying them into the mouth. The device contains multiple applications, the number being dependent, among other things, on the concentration of the formulation. Absorption of the pharmaceutical agent occurs in the buccal cavity, principally through the inner cheek walls. In clinical studies of our flagship oral insulin product Generex Oral-lyn™, insulin absorption in the buccal cavity has been shown to be efficacious and safe.

Buccal Insulin Product – Generex Oral-Lyn™
 
Insulin is a hormone that is naturally secreted by the pancreas to regulate the level of glucose, a type of sugar, in the bloodstream. The term “diabetes” refers to a group of disorders that are characterized by the inability of the body to properly regulate blood glucose levels. When glucose is abundant, it is converted into fat and stored for use when food is not available. When glucose is not available from food, these fats are broken down into free fatty acids that stimulate glucose production. Insulin acts by stimulating the use of glucose as fuel and by inhibiting the production of glucose. In a healthy individual, a balance is maintained between insulin secretion and glucose metabolism.
 
There are two major types of diabetes. Type 1 diabetes (juvenile onset diabetes or insulin dependent diabetes) refers to the condition where the pancreas produces little or no insulin. Type 1 diabetes accounts for 5-10 percent of diabetes cases. It often occurs in children and young adults. Type 1 diabetics must take daily insulin injections, typically three to five times per day, to regulate blood glucose levels. Generex Oral-lyn™ provides a needle-free means of delivering insulin for these patients.
 
In Type 2 diabetes (adult onset or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), the body does not produce enough insulin, or cannot properly use the insulin produced. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and accounts for 90-95 percent of diabetes cases. In addition to insulin therapy, Type 2 diabetics may take oral drugs that stimulate the production of insulin by the pancreas or that help the body to more effectively use insulin. Generex Oral-lyn™ provides a simple means of delivering needed insulin to this major cohort of individuals.
 
Studies in diabetes have identified a condition closely related to and preceding diabetes, called impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). People with IGT do not usually meet the criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. They have normal fasting glucose levels but two hours after a meal their blood glucose level is far above normal. With the increase use of glucose tolerance tests the number of people diagnosed with this pre-diabetic condition is expanding exponentially. Per the 2013 Diabetes Atlas Update, published by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), approximately 40 million people in the United States and more than 316 million people world-wide suffer from IGT. Generex Oral-lyn™ is an ideal solution to providing meal-time insulin to the millions of IGT sufferers. This therapeutic area is currently being investigated.
 
If not treated, diabetes can lead to blindness, kidney disease, nerve disease, amputations, heart disease and stroke. Each year, between 12,000 and 24,000 people suffer vision impairment or complete blindness because of diabetes. Diabetes is also the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (kidney failure), accounting for about 40 percent of new cases.
 
In addition, about 60-70 percent of people with diabetes have mild to severe forms of diabetic nerve damage, which, in severe forms, can lead to lower limb amputations. Diabetics are also two to four times more likely to have heart disease, which is present in 75 percent of diabetes-related deaths, and are two to four times more likely to suffer a stroke.
 
There is no known cure for diabetes. The IDF estimates that there are currently approximately 382 million diabetics worldwide per their 2013 Diabetes Atlas Update and is expected to affect over 592 million people by the year 2035. There are estimated to be over 37 million people suffering from diabetes in North America alone and diabetes is the second largest cause of death by disease in North America.
 
A substantial number of large molecule drugs (i.e., drugs composed of molecules with a high molecular weight and fairly complex and large spatial orientation) have been approved for sale in the United States or are presently undergoing clinical trials as part of the process to obtain such approval, including various proteins, peptides, monoclonal antibodies, hormones and vaccines. Unlike small molecule drugs, which generally can be administered by various methods, large molecule drugs historically have been administered predominately by injection. The principal reasons for this have been the vulnerability of large molecule drugs to digestion and the relatively large size of the molecule itself, which makes absorption into the blood stream through the skin inefficient or ineffective. The RapidMist technology provides a recognized and proved drug delivery system for the delivery of large molecules directly into the blood stream with the attendant advantages.
 
In May 2005, we received approval from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health for the commercial marketing and sale of Generex Oral-lyn™ for treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. We have successfully completed the delivery and installation of a turnkey Generex Oral-lyn™ production operation at the facilities of PharmaBrand in Quito, Ecuador. The first commercial production run of Generex Oral-lyn™ in Ecuador was completed in May, 2006. While Ecuador production capability may be sufficient to meet the needs of South America, it is believed to be insufficient for worldwide production for future commercial sales and clinical trials.
 
On the basis of the test results in Ecuador and other pre-clinical data, we made an IND submission to Health Canada (Canada's equivalent to the FDA) in July 1998, and received permission from the Canadian regulators to proceed with clinical trials in September 1998. We filed an Investigational New Drug application with the FDA in October 1998, and received FDA approval to proceed with human trials in November 1998.

We began our clinical trial programs in Canada and the United States in January 1999. Between January 1999 and September 2000, we conducted clinical trials of our insulin formulation involving approximately 200 subjects with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and healthy volunteers. The study protocols in most trials involved administration of two different doses of our insulin formulation following either a liquid Sustacal meal or a standard meal challenge. The objective of these studies was to evaluate our insulin formulation's efficacy in controlling post-prandial (meal related) glucose levels. These trials demonstrated that our insulin formulation controlled post-prandial hyperglycemia in a manner comparable to injected insulin. In April 2003, a Phase II-B clinical trial protocol was approved in Canada. In September 2006, a Clinical Trial Application relating to our Generex Oral-lyn™ protocol for late-stage trials was approved by Health Canada. The FDA’s review period for the protocol lapsed without objection in July 2007.
 
In late April 2008, we initiated Phase III clinical trials in North America for Generex Oral-lyn™ with the first subject screening in Texas. Other clinical sites participating in the study were located in the United States (Texas, Maryland, Minnesota and California), Canada (Alberta), European Union (Romania, Poland and Bulgaria), Eastern Europe (Russia and Ukraine),) and Ecuador. Approximately 450 subjects were enrolled in the program at approximately 70 clinical sites around the world. The Phase III protocol called for a six-month trial with a six-month follow-up with the primary objective to compare the efficacy of Generex Oral-lyn™ and the RapidMist™ Diabetes Management System with that of standard regular injectable human insulin therapy as measured by HbA1c, in patients with Type-1 diabetes mellitus. The final subjects completed the trial in August 2011. After appropriate validation, the data from approximately 450 patients was tabulated, reviewed and analyzed. Those results from the Phase III trial along with a comprehensive review and supplemental analyses of approximately 40 prior Oral-lyn clinical studies were compiled and submitted to the FDA in late December 2011 in a comprehensive package including a composite metanalysis of all safety data. We do not currently plan to expend significant resources on additional clinical trials of Oral-lyn™ until after such time that we secure additional financing. However we have undertaken a formulation enhancement project with the University Health Network at the University of Toronto and the University of Guelph, Ontario to increase the amount of insulin reaching the blood stream. Preliminary results from an animal study are encouraging,
 
In the past, we engaged a global clinical research organization to provide many study related site services, including initiation, communication with sites, project management and documentation; a global central lab service company to arrange for the logistics of kits and blood samples shipment and testing; an Internet-based clinical electronic data management company to assist us with global data entry, project management and data storage/processing of the Phase III clinical trial and regulatory processes. In the past, we have contracted with third-party manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of the RapidMist™ components, the insulin, and the raw material excipients required for the production of clinical trial batches of Generex Oral-lyn™.
 
As described above, we have obtained regulatory approval for the commercial marketing and sale of Generex Oral-lyn™ in Ecuador, India (subject to regulatory approval of a 2012 in-country study), Lebanon and Algeria.
 
Other Potential Buccal Products

We have currently ongoing discussions regarding possible research collaborations with various pharmaceutical companies concerning use of our large molecule drug delivery technology with other compounds Memorandums of Understanding have been signed with two companies for the testing of RapidMist technology with both Leuprolide and medical marijuana and clinical work is expected to commence in the latter half of 2015.
Immunomedicine Technology and Products 
 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary Antigen Express is developing proprietary vaccine formulations based upon two platform technologies that were discovered by its founder, the Ii-Key hybrid peptides and Ii-Suppression. These technologies are applicable for either antigen-specific immune stimulation or suppression, depending upon the dosing and formulation of its products. Using active stimulation, we are focusing on major diseases such as breast, prostate and ovarian cancer, melanoma, influenza (including H5N1 avian and H1N1 swine flu) and HIV. Autoimmune diseases such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis are the focus of our antigen-specific immune suppression work.
 
Antigen’s immunotherapeutic vaccine was in Phase II clinical trials for patients with HER-2/neu positive breast cancer when we had financial resources. The trial is being conducted with the United States Military Cancer Institute's (USMCI) Clinical Trials Group and will examine the rate of relapse in patients with node-positive or high-risk node-negative breast cancer after two years. The study is randomized and will compare patients treated with AE37 plus the adjuvant GM-CSF versus GM-CSF alone. The Phase II trial follows a Phase I trial that demonstrated safety, tolerability, and immune stimulation of the AE37 vaccine in breast cancer patients. 
 
Based on positive results in trials of the AE37 vaccine in breast cancer patients, we entered into an agreement in August 2006 with the Euroclinic, a private center in Athens, Greece, to commence clinical trials with the same compound as an immunotherapeutic vaccine for prostate cancer. A Phase I trial involving 29 patients was completed in August 2009, which similarly showed safety, tolerability and induction of a specific immune response. Agreements, as well as a protocol, are in place for initiation of a Phase II clinical trial once additional funding is available.

The same technology used to enhance immunogenicity is being applied in the development of a synthetic peptide vaccine for H5N1 avian influenza and the 2009 H1N1 swine flu. In April 2007, a Phase I clinical trial of Antigen’s proprietary peptides derived from the hemagglutinin protein of the H5N1 avian influenza virus was initiated in healthy volunteers in the Lebanese-Canadian Hospital in Beirut, Lebanon. We have completed the first portion of the Phase I trial. Modified peptide vaccines for avian influenza offer several advantages over traditional egg-based or cell-culture based vaccines. Modified peptide vaccines can be manufactured by an entirely synthetic process which reduces cost and increases both the speed and quantity of vaccine relative to egg- or cell-culture based vaccines. Another advantage is that the peptides are derived from regions of the virus that are similar enough in all H5N1 and H1N1 virus strains such that they would not have to be newly designed for the specific strain to emerge in a pandemic.
 
A Physician’s Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for the Phase I and Phase II trials in patients with stage II HER-2/neu positive breast cancer has been filed with the FDA. The Phase I trial was completed at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., and the Phase II trial were taking place before our resources were exhausted. A Physician’s Investigational New Drug application for a Phase I trial in patients with breast or ovarian cancer also has been filed with the FDA and this Phase I trial is being conducted in Dallas, Texas at the Mary Crowley Cancer Center. Applications were filed and approvals obtained for a Phase I prostate cancer trial using AE37 in Athens, Greece from the Hellenic Organization of Drugs, and this Phase I trial was completed in August 2009. The Ministry of Health in Lebanon gave approval for Phase I trial of our experimental H5N1 prophylactic vaccine in Beirut, Lebanon following submission of an application. All other immunomedicine products are in the pre-clinical stage of development.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our research and development activities and the manufacturing and marketing of our pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States, Health Canada in Canada and comparable designated regulatory authorities in other countries. Among other things, extensive regulations require us to satisfy numerous conditions before we can bring products to market. While these regulations apply to all competitors in our industry, having a technology that is unique and novel extends the requisite review period by the various divisions within the FDA and other regulators. Also, other companies in our industry are not limited primarily to products which still need to be approved by government regulators, as we are now.
 
If requisite regulatory approvals are not obtained and maintained, our business will be substantially harmed. In many cases, we expect that extant and prospective development partners will participate in the regulatory approval process. The following discussion summarizes the principal features of food and drug regulation in the United States and other countries as they affect our business.
 
United States
 
All aspects of our research, development and foreseeable commercial activities relating to pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States. United States federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of pharmaceutical products. The regulatory approval process, including clinical trials, usually takes several years and requires the expenditure of substantial resources. If regulatory approval of a product is granted, the approval may include significant limitations on the uses for which the product may be marketed.
 
The steps required before a pharmaceutical product may be marketed in the United States include:
 

• | Conducting appropriate pre-clinical laboratory evaluations, including animal studies, in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) requirements, to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product, and to characterize and document the product’s chemistry, manufacturing controls, formulation and stability; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Submitting the results of these evaluations and tests to the FDA, along with manufacturing information, analytical data, and protocols for clinical studies, in an IND Application, and receiving approval from the FDA that the clinical studies proposed under the IND are allowed to proceed; 
• | Obtaining approval of Institutional Review Boards (“IRBs”) to administer the product to humans in clinical studies; conducting adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in compliance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) requirements that establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the intended use; 
• | Developing manufacturing processes which conform to the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, as confirmed by FDA inspection; 
• | Submitting to the FDA the results of pre-clinical studies, clinical studies, and adequate data on chemistry, manufacturing and control information to ensure reproducible product quality batch after batch, in an NDA or Biologics License Application (“BLA”); and 
• | Obtaining FDA approval of the NDA, including inspection and approval of the product manufacturing facility as compliant with cGMP requirements, prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the pharmaceutical agent.

Quality and pre-clinical tests and studies include: laboratory evaluation of Drug Substance and Drug Product chemistry, formulation/manufacturing, and stability profiling, as well as a large number of animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of each product. Typically, the pre-clinical studies consist of the following:
 
Pharmacology
 

• | Primary and Secondary Pharmacodynamics 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety Pharmacology 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Pharmacodynamics 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Pharmacokinetics (“PK”)
 

• | Single and Multiple Dose Kinetics 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tissue Distribution 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Metabolism
--+-----------


• | PK Drug Interactions 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other PK studies 
--+----------------------------------------------------------

Toxicology
 

• | Single and Multiple Dose Toxicity 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Genotoxicity
--+-------------


• | Carcinogenicity
--+----------------


• | Reproduction Toxicity 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | Other Toxicity 
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 
The results of the quality and pre-clinical tests/studies, in addition to any non-clinical pharmacology, are submitted to the FDA along with the initial clinical study protocol (see descriptive of process below) as part of the initial IND and are reviewed by the FDA before the commencement of human clinical trials. Unless the FDA objects to it, the IND becomes effective 30 days following its receipt by the FDA. The FDA reviews all protocols, protocol amendments, adverse event reports, study reports, and annual reports in connection with a new pharmacological product.
 
The IND for our oral insulin formulation became effective in November 1998. Amendments are also subsequently filed as new Clinical Studies and their corresponding Study Protocols are proposed. In July 2007, we received a no objection clearance to initiate our Phase III study protocol for our oral insulin product. The Physician’s Investigational New Drug Application for the Phase 1 and Phase II trial of AE37, Antigen’s synthetic peptide vaccine designed to stimulate a potent and specific immune response against tumors expressing the HER-2/neu oncogene, in patients with stage II HER-2/neu positive breast cancer became effective in March 2006. 
 
Clinical trials involve the administration of a new drug to humans under the supervision of qualified investigators. The protocols for the trials must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Also, each clinical trial must be approved and conducted under the auspices of an IRB, which considers, among other things, ethical factors, the safety of human subjects, and the possible liability of the institution conducting the clinical trials.
 
Clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases (Phase I, Phase II, and Phase III), but the phases may overlap. Phase I clinical trials test the drug on healthy human subjects for safety and other aspects, but usually not effectiveness. Phase II clinical trials are conducted in a limited patient population to gather evidence about the efficacy of the drug for specific purposes, to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosages, and to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks. When a compound has shown evidence of efficacy and acceptable safety in Phase II evaluations, Phase III clinical trials are undertaken to evaluate and confirm clinical efficacy and to test for safety in an expanded patient population at clinical trial sites in different geographical locations.  The FDA and other regulatory authorities require that the safety and efficacy of therapeutic product candidates be supported through at least two adequate and well-controlled Phase III clinical trials (known as “Pivotal Trials”).  The successful completion of Phase III clinical trials is a mandatory step in the approval process for the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of products.
 
In the United States, the results of quality, pre-clinical studies and clinical trials, if successful, are submitted to the FDA in an NDA to seek approval to market and commercialize the drug product for a specified use. The NDA is far more specific than the IND and must also include proposed labeling and detailed technical sections based on the data collected. The FDA is governed by the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) regarding response time to the application, which is generally 12 months (and shorter for a priority application). It may deny a NDA if it believes that applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. The FDA also may require additional clarifications on the existing application or even additional testing for safety and efficacy of the drug. We cannot be sure that any of our proposed products will receive FDA approval. The multi-tiered approval process means that our products could fail to advance to subsequent steps without the requisite data, studies, and FDA approval along the way. Even if approved by the FDA, our products and the facilities used to manufacture our products will remain subject to review and periodic inspection by the FDA.

To supply drug products for use in the United States, foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities must be registered with, and approved by, the FDA. Manufacturing facilities must also comply with the FDA's cGMPs, and such facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA. Products manufactured outside the United States are inspected by regulatory authorities in those countries under agreements with the FDA.  To comply with cGMPs, manufacturers must expend substantial funds, time and effort in the area of production and quality control.  The FDA stringently applies its regulatory standards for manufacturing. Discovery of previously unknown problems with respect to a product, manufacturer or facility may result in consequences with commercial significance. These include restrictions on the product, manufacturer or facility, suspensions of regulatory approvals, operating restrictions, delays in obtaining new product approvals, withdrawals of the product from the market, product recalls, fines, injunctions and criminal prosecution.
 
One final hurdle that is closely associated with the cGMP inspections is the pre-approval inspection that the FDA carries out prior to the issuance of a marketing license. FDA inspectors combine cGMP compliance with a review of research and development documents that were used in the formal NDA. A close inspection of historic data is reviewed to confirm data and to demonstrate that a company has carried out the activities as presented in the NDA. This is generally a long inspection and requires a team of individuals from the company to “host” the FDA inspector(s).
 
Foreign Countries
 
Before we are permitted to market any of our products outside of the United States, those products will be subject to regulatory approval by foreign government agencies similar to the FDA.  These requirements vary widely from country to country. Generally, however, no action can be taken to market any drug product in a country until an appropriate application has been submitted by a sponsor and approved by the regulatory authorities in that country. Again, similar to the FDA, each country will mandate a specific financial consideration for the Marketing Application dossiers being submitted. Although an important consideration, FDA approval does not assure approval by other regulatory authorities. The current approval process varies from country to country, and the time spent in gaining approval varies from that required for FDA approval. The Canadian regulatory process is substantially similar to that of the United States. To date, we have received the following foreign regulatory approval for our product candidates:

• | We obtained regulatory approval to begin clinical trials of our oral insulin formulation in Canada in November 1998. In April 2003, we received approval of an Oral-lyn™ Phase II-B clinical trial protocol in Canada. In September 2006 Health Canada approved our Clinical Trial Application in respect of our proposed Generex Oral-lyn™ protocol for late-stage trials. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We obtained regulatory approval in Canada to begin clinical trials of our buccal morphine product in March 2002 and our fentanyl product in October 2002. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In May 2005, we received approval from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Public Health for the commercial marketing and sale of Generex Oral-lyn™ for treatment of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. To date we have not recognized any revenue from the sale of Generex Oral-lyn™ in Ecuador and we are not currently expending any resources to further commercialization in this country.

• | In November 2007, we obtained approval for the importation and commercial marketing and sale in India of Generex Oral-lyn™ under the marketing name of Oral Recosulin™ from the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO), Directorate General of Health Services, Government of India, which is responsible for authorizing marketing approval of all new pharmaceutical products in India. Per the requirements of the approval, an in-country clinical study must be completed in India with Oral Recosulin™ before commercial sales can commence. The field portion of the study was completed in the third calendar quarter of 2012. Shreya has advised Generex that the dossier was submitted in December of 2012 to the Drugs Controller General (India) (DCGI), Central Drugs Standard Control Organization, Director General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. Generex has provided additional, detailed scientific data to support the Shreya submission. • Applications were filed and approvals obtained in May 2007 for a Phase I prostate cancer trial using AE37 in Athens, Greece from the Hellenic Organization of Drugs. This Phase I trial was completed in August 2009. 


• | The Ministry of Health in Lebanon gave approval for the Phase I trial of our experimental H5N1 prophylactic vaccine in Beirut, Lebanon following submission of an application. In December 2008, we, together with our marketing partner Benta SA., received an approval to market Generex Oral-lyn™ in Lebanon. The official product launch in Lebanon took place in May 2009. We are not currently expending any resources to further commercialization in this country. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In May 2009, the Algerian health authorities granted us permission to import and sell Generex Oral-lyn™ for the treatment of diabetes in Algeria. To date we have not recognized any revenue from the sale of Generex Oral-lyn™ in Algeria and we are not currently expending any resources to further commercialization in this country.

Marketing and Distribution
 
Our strategy is to market our products through collaborative arrangements with companies that have well-established pharmaceutical marketing and distribution capabilities, including expertise in the regulatory approval processes in their respective jurisdictions.
 
We have entered into licensing and distribution agreements with a number of multinational distributors to assist us with the process of gaining regulatory approval for the registration and subsequent marketing, distribution, and sale of Generex Oral-lyn™ in countries throughout the world, including:
 

• | Shreya Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd. for India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Myanmar; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Adcock Ingram Limited and Adcock Ingram Healthcare (Pty) Ltd. for South Africa, Lesotho, Swaziland, Botswana; Namibia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe; 
• | E&V Alca Distribution Corp. for Albania, Montenegro, and Kosovo; 
• | SciGen, Ltd. for China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam; 
• | Pharmaris Perus S.A.C. for Peru; 


• | MediPharma SA for Argentina; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | PMG S.A. for Chile; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dong Sung Pharm. Co. Ltd. for South Korea; and 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Benta S.A. for Lebanon. 

 
Under these licensing and distribution agreements excluding the one with Dong Sung Pharm Co., we will not receive an upfront license fee, but the distributor will bear any and all costs associated with the procurement of governmental approvals for the sale of Generex Oral-Lyn™, including any clinical and regulatory costs. We possess the worldwide marketing rights to our oral insulin product. We do not currently plan to expend significant resources on additional clinical trials or to further the commercialization of Generex Oral-lyn™ until after such time that we secure additional financing.
 
Manufacturing
 
In December 2000, we completed a pilot manufacturing facility for Generex Oral-lyn™ in Toronto, Canada in the same commercial complex in which our laboratories were located. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2006, we initiated a scale-up commercial production run of several thousand canisters of Generex Oral-lyn™ at this facility. In July 2012, we sold the property which housed the manufacturing and laboratory facility. We would engage contract manufacturers in order to manufacture any product in significant quantities for any future commercial sales and clinical trials.
 
In March 2006, we successfully completed the delivery and installation of a turnkey Generex Oral-lyn™ filling operation at the facilities of PharmaBrand, in Quito, Ecuador for the purposes of commercial supply and sales in Ecuador and potentially other countries. We do not currently have a manufacturing agreement with PharmaBrand and are not currently manufacturing product at this facility.
 
In anticipation of undertaking late-stage clinical trials of Generex Oral-lyn™ in Canada, we entered into an agreement with Cardinal Health PTS, LLC, now known as Catalent Pharma Solutions (Catalent), in June 2006, pursuant to which Catalent manufactured clinical trial batches of Generex Oral-lyn™. Pursuant to pre-extant supply arrangements, our third-party suppliers had been manufacturing the quantities of the RapidMist™ brand metered dose inhaler components (valves, canisters, actuators, and dust caps), the insulin, and the formulary excipients that were required for the Catalent production. In addition, our Regulatory Affairs, Quality Control and R&D personnel have worked with Catalent to prepare and validate the Catalent production processes. We are not currently manufacturing product under this agreement and we expect that any agreements regarding the manufacturing of Generex Oral-lyn™ for any future trials or commercial sales will need to be renegotiated at such time.
 
Our subsidiary Antigen leases office space in Worcester, Massachusetts, which is sufficient for its present needs.
 
Raw Material Supplies
 
The excipients used in our formulation are available from numerous sources in sufficient quantities for clinical purposes, and we believe that they will be available in sufficient quantities for commercial purposes when required, although we have not yet attempted to secure a guaranteed commercial supply of any such products. Components suitable for our RapidMist™ brand metered dose inhaler are available from a limited number of potential suppliers, as is the chemical propellant used in the device. The components which now comprise the device are expected to be used in the commercial version of our insulin product in countries where the product has been approved. We do not currently have supply arrangements for commercial quantities with manufacturers for the components and the propellant that we presently use in our RapidMist™ brand metered dose. Reputable and reliable suppliers for these components exist and we believes that we can enter into arrangements for commercial supply with these suppliers when we are ready to commence commercial production.

Insulin is available worldwide from multiple sources. We do not currently have any agreements for the long-term supply of insulin, but we expect that we will be readily able to negotiate such an agreement before further clinical trials or commercial sales commence.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We hold a number of patents in the United States and foreign countries covering our buccal and other delivery technologies. We also have developed brand names and trademarks for products in appropriate areas. We consider the overall protection of our patent, trademark and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and acts to protect these rights from infringement.
 
Patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceutical products. Protection for individual products or technologies extends for varying periods, in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries. The protection afforded, which may also vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country.
 
We currently have five issued U.S. patents and one pending U.S. patent applications pertaining to various aspects of drug delivery technology, including oral administration of macromolecular formulations (such as insulin) as well as pain relief medications such as morphine and fentanyl. We currently hold eleven issued Canadian patents and one pending Canadian patent applications also relating to various aspects of drug delivery technology. We also hold eleven issued patents and one pending patent applications covering our drug delivery technology in jurisdictions other than the U.S. and Canada, including Brazil, Argentina, Israel, Australia and Europe.
 
The expiration dates of the U.S. issued patents range from 2016 to 2022. The expiration dates of the patents issued in Canada range from 2015 to 2021. The expiration dates of the patents issued in other jurisdictions range from 2015 to 2028.
 
Our subsidiary Antigen Express currently holds nine issued U.S. patents and twenty-two other foreign patents.  There are also four pending patent applications worldwide concerning technology for modulating the immune system via activation of antigen-specific helper T lymphocytes. Dr. Robert Humphreys, a retired officer of Antigen, is the listed inventor or co-inventor on many of these patents and patent applications.
 
The expiration dates of the Antigen U.S. issued patents range from 2016 to 2031.  The expiration dates of the patents issued in other jurisdictions range from 2017 to 2023.
 
We possess the worldwide manufacturing and marketing rights to our oral insulin product.
 
Our long-term success will substantially depend upon our ability to obtain patent protection for our technology and our ability to protect our technology from infringement, misappropriation, discovery and duplication. We cannot be sure that any of our pending patent applications will be granted, or that any patents which we own or obtain in the future will fully protect our position. Our patent rights and the patent rights of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in general, are highly uncertain and include complex legal and factual issues. We believe that our existing technology and the patents which we hold or for which we have applied do not infringe anyone else's patent rights. We believe our patent rights will provide meaningful protection against others duplicating our proprietary technologies. We cannot be sure of this, however, because of the complexity of the legal and scientific issues that could arise in litigation over these issues. See the discussion under the caption “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the heading “Legal Proceedings” in this annual report on Form 10-K.
 
We also rely on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information. We seek to protect this information, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and collaborators.
 
Competition
 
We expect that products based upon our buccal delivery technology and any other products that we may develop will compete directly with products developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, universities, government agencies and public and private research organizations.
 
Products developed by our competitors may use a different active pharmaceutical agent or treatment to treat the same medical condition or indication as our product or may provide for the delivery of substantially the same active pharmaceutical ingredient as our products using different methods of administration. For example, a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are engaged in various stages of research, development and testing of alternatives to insulin therapy for the treatment of diabetes, as well as new methods of delivering insulin. These methods, including nasal, transdermal, needle-free (high pressure) injection and pulmonary, may ultimately successfully deliver insulin to diabetic patients. Some biotechnology companies also have developed different technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens. Some of our competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific research and product development capabilities, as well as financial, marketing and human resources, than we do.

Where the same or substantially the same active ingredient is available using alternative delivery means or the same or substantially the same result is achievable with a different treatment or technology, we expect that competition among products will be based, among other things, on product safety, efficacy, ease of use, availability, price, marketing and distribution. When different active pharmaceutical ingredients are involved, these same competitive factors will apply to both the active agent and the delivery method.
 
We consider other drug delivery and biotechnology companies to be direct competitors for the cooperation and support of major drug and biotechnology companies that own or market proprietary pharmaceutical compounds and technologies, as well as for the ultimate patient market. Of primary concern to us are the competitor companies that are known to be developing delivery systems for insulin and other pharmaceutical agents that we have identified as product candidates and technologies to enhance the presentation of peptide antigens.
 
Large pharmaceutical companies, such as Merck & Co., Inc., GlaxoSmithKline PLC, Novartis, Inc., MedImmune Inc. (a subsidiary of Astra-Zeneca, Inc.) and others, also compete in the oncology, immunomedicine and vaccine markets. These companies have greater experience and expertise in securing government contracts and grants to support research and development efforts, conducting testing and clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals to market products, as well as manufacturing and marketing approved products. As such, they are also considered significant competitors in these fields of pharmaceutical products and therapies. There are also many smaller companies which are pursuing similar technologies in these fields and are considered to be competitors of Generex.
 
The following descriptions of our competitors and their products were obtained from their filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, information available on their web sites and industry research reports.
 
Buccal Insulin Product
 

• | MannKind Corporation’s product candidates include AFREZZA®, a mealtime insulin therapy being studied for use in adult patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is a drug-device combination product which administers insulin through inhalation to the lungs. MannKind submitted an NDA to the FDA requesting approval to market AFREZZA® in May 2009. In January 2011, MannKind announced that it had received a complete response letter from the FDA for AFREZZA®. In August 2011, MannKind announced that it has confirmed with the FDA the design of the two additional Phase III studies which are required for AFREZZA®. In August 2013, MannKind announced positive late-stage data on its inhaled insulin AFREZZA® from the two additional Phase III studies on Type 1 and Type 2diabetes and has resubmitted a new drug application to the FDA in October 2013 seeking approval for the marketing of AFREZZA®. MannKind received FDA approval in June 2014 and the product is now commercially available in the United States. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Amylin Pharmaceuticals, Inc. received FDA approval in January 2012 for Bydureon, an extended-release injectable formulation, which is the first once-a-week therapy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. 
• | There are several companies that are working on developing products which involve the oral delivery of analogs of insulin. Oramed Pharmaceuticals is developing an orally ingestible insulin capsule which is currently in Phase II clinical trials. Biocon Limited has developed IN-105, a tablet for the oral delivery of insulin, which is currently in phase II trials. Diabetology has developed Capsulin IR, an insulin capsule which is currently in Phase II clinical trials. Access Pharmaceuticals has developed Cobalamin, an oral insulin which is currently in pre-clinical trials. Dance Pharmaceuticals is developing an inhaled insulin product based on Aerogen’s proprietary OnQ Aerosol Generator technology. 

 
There are also a number of companies developing alternative means of delivering insulin in the form of oral pills, transdermal patches, and intranasal methods, which are at early stages of development. In addition to other delivery systems for insulin, there are numerous products, such as sulfonylureas (Amaryl®and Glynase®), biguanides (branded and generic metformin products), thiazolidinediones (Avandia®and Actos®), glucagon-like peptide 1 (Byetta®and Victoza®), and dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitors (Januvia® and Onglyza™), which have been approved for use in the treatment of Type 2 diabetics in substitution of, or in addition to, insulin therapy. These products may also be considered to compete with insulin products.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to the companies listed above, there are a number of companies which are pursuing cancer treatments using immunotherapy technologies which have products in various clinical trial stages.  Some of these companies are Argos Therapeutics Inc., Celldex Therapeutics Inc., Northwest Therapeutics Inc., Immatics Biotechnology GmbH, Immunocellular Therapeutics Ltd., TVAX Biomedical Inc. and Newlink Genetics Corporation.  These companies can also be considered to be competitors.
 
Environmental Compliance
 
Our research and development activities have involved the controlled use of hazardous materials and chemicals. We believe that our procedures for handling and disposing of these materials comply with all applicable government regulations. However, we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. If an accident occurred, we could be held liable for damages, and these damages could severely impact our financial condition. We are also subject to many environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, particularly those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens, and the handling of hazardous biological materials. Violations and the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could adversely affect us. However, we do not believe that compliance with applicable environmental laws will have a material effect on us in the foreseeable future.

Research and Development Expenditures
 
A substantial portion of our activities to date have been in research and development. We expended $407,382 in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016 and $1,185,384 in the fiscal year ended July 31, 2015 on research and development. Research and development activities decreased in 2016 from 2015, as we have not initiated any new trials after the completion of the global Phase III clinical trial of our oral insulin product due to lack of available funding. We have not conducted any material research and development since October, 2015 due to lack of funds.
Financial Information About Geographic Areas
 
The regions in which we had identifiable assets and revenues and the amounts of such identifiable assets and revenues for each of the last three fiscal years are presented in Note 13 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report on Form 10-K. Identifiable assets are those that can be directly associated with a geographic area.
Employees
 
At July 31, 2016, we had no employees. All of our previous employees have been laid off due to our inability to pay. We engage consultants from time to time to assist with financial recordkeeping and other tasks.
 
We will continue to need qualified scientific personnel and personnel with experience in clinical testing and government regulation. We may have difficulty in obtaining qualified scientific and technical personnel as there is strong competition for such personnel from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and research institutions. Our business could be materially harmed if we are unable to recruit and retain qualified scientific, administrative and executive personnel to support our expanding activities, or if one or more members of our limited scientific and management staff were unable or unwilling to continue their association with us. We have fixed-term agreements with only certain members of our key management and scientific staff, Mark Fletcher, President and CEO of Generex, and Eric von Hofe, President of Antigen.
 
We use non-employee consultants to assist us in formulating research and development strategy, in preparing regulatory submissions, and in developing protocols for clinical trials,. We also use non-employee consultants to assist us in business development. These consultants and advisors usually have the right to terminate their relationship with us on short notice. Loss of some of these key advisors could interrupt or delay development of one or more of our products or otherwise adversely affect our business plans.
