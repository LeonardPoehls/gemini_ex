The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to locate a suitable acquisition or merger candidate. The Company is not currently engaged in any business activities that provide cash flow.
 
In January 1996, the Company acquired from Consolidated Beverage Corporation, the right to become the exclusive distributor (“Pabst Distribution Rights”) for certain beer and malt liquor products (“Pabst Products”) manufactured by Pabst Brewing Company (“Pabst”).

Inclusive with the acquisition came the following national brands: Colt 45, Old Milwaukee, Schaefer, Schlitz, Champale, Schmidts, Stroh, Piels, McSorleys and also an extensive list of various imports.
 
As of September 15, 2005, the Company, entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Oak Beverages, Inc., a New York corporation (“Oak”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell, and Oak agreed to purchase (the “Asset Sale”), the Company’s exclusive distribution rights for the Pabst brands, Pittsburgh brands and Ballantine brands (the “Assets”). The Asset Purchase Agreement contained customary representations and warranties, conditions to closing (including shareholder and brewer approval and the distribution by the Company of an Information Statement on Schedule 14C (the “Information Statement”) to its stockholders), and termination and indemnification provisions.

The Company and Oak also entered into a Sub-Distribution Agreement dated as of September 15, 2005 (the “Sub-Distribution Agreement”), pursuant to which Oak became a Company sub-distributor of certain Pabst beers and malt beverages (the “Products”). The Sub-Distribution Agreement became effective when the Company filed an Information Statement on Schedule 14C with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under the terms of the Sub-Distribution Agreement, Oak had the right to distribute the Products to customers located in Brooklyn, Queens, Staten Island, Manhattan and the Bronx (the “Territory”), and in exchange for such rights, Oak was required to pay Pabst directly for its Product purchases and, during the first 45 days following the effective date of the Agreement (the “45- Day Period”), Oak was required to pay to Capital the following amounts for Products received by Oak: (x) $.50 for each case of Products and (y) $2.00 for each barrel of Products. The purchase price paid by Oak to Capital in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement was reduced by an amount equal to the sum of: (i) $.25 for each case of Products purchased by Oak and sold by Oak to customers in the Territory, plus (ii) $.50 for each case of Products purchased by Oak but not sold to such customers, plus (iii) $1.00 for each barrel of Products purchased by Oak and sold by Oak to customers in the Territory, plus (iv) $2.00 for each barrel of Products purchased by Oak but not sold to such customers, all determined during the 45-Day Period.
 
Prior to the closing of the transaction, the Asset Purchase Agreement and sale of Assets to Oak were approved unanimously by the Company’s Board of Directors and the terms of the transaction were submitted for stockholder approval. As permitted by Delaware law and the Company’s Certificate of Incorporation, the Company received a written consent from the majority Approving Stockholders of the Company approving the Asset Purchase Agreement and the related Asset Sale. An Information Statement was furnished for the purposes of informing stockholders, in the manner required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, of the Asset Sale before it was consummated.
 
As of December 16, 2005, the Company closed the sale of the Assets to Oak, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Asset Purchase Agreement. The purchase price paid by Oak for the Assets was Nine Million Three Hundred Thousand Dollars ($9,300,000.00), of which One Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($1,500,000.00), was deposited with an escrow agent, pursuant to the terms of an escrow agreement, dated December 16, 2005 (the “Escrow Agreement”), for at least 18 months for post closing indemnification claims which may be asserted by Oak (the “Escrow”). A substantial amount of the proceeds from the transaction were used by the Company to repay outstanding indebtedness and for working capital purposes.
 
As of April 13, 2018, the Company does not have any ongoing operations and is not currently engaged in any business activities that provide cash flow. The Company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, is a “shell company,” defined as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations. The Company will continue to incur claims, liabilities and expenses.
 
Strategy
 
The Company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to locate a suitable acquisition or merger candidate. The Company is not currently engaged in any business activities that provide cash flow.
 
Structure of the Company
 
The Company does not have any ongoing operations for the payment of its liabilities. As of the date hereof, the Company, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, is a “shell company,” defined as a company with no or nominal assets (other than cash) and no or nominal operations.
 
We will continue to incur claims, liabilities and expenses, which will reduce the realizable value of our remaining assets and the amount potentially available for distribution to stockholders. Claims, liabilities and expenses from operations (such as salaries, directors’ and officers’ insurance, payroll and taxes, legal, accounting and consulting fees and miscellaneous office expenses) will continue to be incurred subsequent to the Asset Sale. These expenses will have to be satisfied from our remaining assets and, therefore, will reduce the net realizable value of those assets.
 
The Company intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as we are subject to those requirements. We have an obligation to continue to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, even though compliance with such reporting requirements is economically burdensome.
 
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2010, the only remaining employee was Carmine Stella, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.
