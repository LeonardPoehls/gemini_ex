ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
Our Company
 Business Overview
 We are one of the world’s largest providers of sand-based proppant solutions and for nearly 40 years have been a pioneer in the development of high performance proppants used by Exploration & Production (“E&P”) companies to enhance the productivity of their oil and gas wells.  Additionally, for more than 120 years, we and our predecessor companies have provided high quality sand-based products, strong technical leadership and applications knowledge to end users in the I&R markets.
 As one of the industry leaders, our asset base at December 31, 2017 included 893.4 million tons of proven and probable mineral reserves, which we believe is one of the largest reserve bases in the industry.  As of March 2018, we have eleven sand processing facilities, ten of which are active, with 17.5 million tons of annual sand processing capacity.  We recently restarted our Wexford, Michigan sand processing facility to accommodate increased customer demand.  At this time, all of our remaining sand processing facilities are open with the exception of Hager Bay, Wisconsin.  In July 2017, we entered into a 40-year lease agreement for approximately 3,250 acres of sand reserves in Kermit, Texas (“Kermit” or “West Texas”) to serve demand for proppant in the Permian basin.  Facilities on this property are under construction and expected to be commissioned during the second quarter of 2018 with the capacity to produce 3.0 million tons of sand annually.  We also have nine coating facilities (six of which are active) with in excess of 2.0 million tons of annual coating capacity.  
 As one of the nation’s longest continuously operating mining organizations, we have developed a strong commitment to environmental stewardship and to the three pillars of Sustainable Development:  People, Planet and Prosperity.  Our strong commitment to safety is reflected in the health and safety of our employees and is illustrated by our achieving a consistently low recordable incident rate among our similarly sized industrial sand competitors as well as one of the lowest rates for all those reporting in the Industrial Mining Association of North America.  Since 2012, our employees have demonstrated our commitment to our communities by donating over 73,000 hours of company-paid volunteer hours, as well as significant personal volunteer hours, into the communities in which we live and operate.  We are focused on environmental stewardship, and 28 of our facilities now generate zero waste to landfills.  Additionally, we executed upon annual initiatives to reduce our carbon emissions and have planted nearly 540,000 trees since 2012 in order to offset our remaining Tier I and Tier 2 emissions.  We believe adhering to sustainable development principles is not only the right thing to do, but also results in a higher level of engagement and commitment from our employees, better relationships with our communities and, as a result, a stronger base from which to pursue profitable growth over the long-term.  Abiding by these guiding principles, our corporate motto is “Do Good.  Do Well.”
 Over a period of nearly 40 years, Fairmount Santrol has built a vertically integrated operation that combines mining, sand processing, resin manufacturing and coating operations with a broad logistics network and state-of-the-art research and development capabilities.  Our ability to integrate and leverage our asset base to provide comprehensive proppant solutions has allowed us to become a long-term, trusted partner to our customers.
 We are capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North America’s major oil and gas producing basins and also have the flexibility to ship our product via barge, marine terminals and trucks to reach our customers as needed.  We operate an integrated logistics platform consisting of 44 proppant distribution terminals and a fleet of approximately 10,569 railcars, which includes 1,723 customer railcars, considering car returns that took place throughout the year and subleases.  Our unit train capabilities include four production facilities and twelve in-basin terminals, which reduce freight costs and improve cycle times for our railcar fleet.  In order to better align our logistics network with customer demand and to reduce costs, we discontinued activity at four transloading terminals in 2017.
 Our operations are organized into two segments based on the primary end markets we serve: (i) Proppant Solutions and (ii) Industrial & Recreational Products.  Our Proppant Solutions segment predominantly provides sand-based proppants for use in hydraulic fracturing operations throughout the U.S. and Canada, Argentina, Mexico, China, and northern Europe.  Our I&R segment provides raw, coated, and custom blended sands to the foundry, building products, glass, turf and landscape and filtration industries primarily in North America.  We believe our two market segments are complementary.  Our ability to sell to a wide range of customers across multiple end markets allows us 
 6


to maximize the recovery of our reserve base within our mining operations and to reduce the cyclicality of our earnings.
 In 2017, our Proppant Solutions segment sold 10.3 million tons of proppant with revenues of $834.7 million (87% of total company revenues) and gross profit of $244.0 million.  This represents an increase of 60%, 101%, and 821%, respectively, from 2016.  Proppants represented approximately 78% and 86% of total company revenues for 2016 and 2015, respectively.  For 2017, our I&R segment had sales volume of 2.5 million tons, flat to 2016, with revenues of $125.0 million and gross profit of $56.0 million, which represents an increase of 5% and 15%, respectively, from 2016.

The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in or considered to be a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 Proposed Merger with Unimin Corporation
 On December 11, 2017, we entered into a merger agreement with Unimin and certain other parties with respect to the proposed combination of the businesses of Unimin and Fairmount Santrol.  The merger agreement provides that, upon the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions contained in the agreement, a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin will be merged with and into Fairmount Santrol, with Fairmount Santrol surviving such merger and becoming a direct wholly owned subsidiary of Unimin (the “Merger”).  In accordance with the terms of the Merger agreement (“Merger Agreement”), Fairmount Santrol stockholders in the aggregate (including holders of certain Fairmount Santrol equity awards) will receive $170 million in cash and 35% of the common stock of Unimin, with SCR-Sibelco NV (“Sibelco”), the existing parent company of Unimin, owning the remaining 65%.  The Merger is subject to, among other things, approval by Fairmount Santrol’s stockholders, listing of Unimin’s common stock on the NYSE, and certain regulatory approvals.  Upon completion of the Merger, Fairmount Santrol would delist and no longer trade on the NYSE.  The transaction is expected to close in mid-2018, subject to satisfaction of the closing conditions.
 The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights and we may be required to pay Unimin a termination fee of $52 million.
 In 2017, we incurred $8.3 million in expenses associated with the Merger.

INDUSTRY
 Overview
 The silica sand industry consists of businesses that are involved in the mining, processing, and sale of silica sand and silica sand-based products.  Monocrystalline silica, also referred to as “silica,” “industrial sand and gravel,” “silica sand,” and “quartz sand,” is a term applied to sands and gravels containing a high percentage of silica (also known as silicon dioxide or SiO2) in the form of quartz.  
 The low relative cost and special properties of monocrystalline silica — chemistry, purity, grain size, color, inertness, hardness, and resistance to high temperatures — make it critical to a variety of industries and end-use markets, including the production of molds and cores for metal castings, glass production, and the manufacturing of building products.  In particular, monocrystalline silica is a key input in the hydraulic fracturing techniques used in the development of oil and gas resource basins.
 Frac Sand Extraction, Processing, and Distribution
 Raw frac sand is a naturally occurring mineral that is mined and processed.  While the specific extraction method utilized depends primarily on the geologic conditions, most raw frac sand is mined using conventional open-pit extraction methods.  The composition, depth, and chemical purity of the sand also dictate the processing method and equipment utilized.  After extraction, raw frac sand is washed with water to remove fine impurities such as clay and organic particles, with additional procedures used when contaminants are not easily removable.  The final steps in the production process involve the drying and screening of the raw frac sand according to mesh size.
 Most frac sand is shipped in bulk from the processing facility to customers by truck, rail or barge.  Because transportation costs may represent a significant portion of the overall delivered product cost, shipping in large quantities, particularly when shipping over long distances, provides a significant cost advantage to the suppliers, which highlights the importance of rail or barge access for low cost delivery.  As a result, facility location and logistics capabilities are an important consideration for suppliers and customers.  In addition, we believe that, over time, the largest proppant customers would prefer to consolidate their purchases across a smaller group of suppliers with robust logistics capabilities and a broad offering of high performance proppants.
 Oil and Gas Proppant Market
 Advances in oil and gas extraction techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, have allowed for significantly greater extraction of oil and gas trapped within shale formations.  The hydraulic fracturing process consists of pumping fluids down a well at pressures sufficient to create fractures in the targeted hydrocarbon-bearing rock formation in order to increase the flow rate of hydrocarbons from the well.  A granular material, called proppant, is suspended and transported in the fluid and fills the fracture, “propping” it open once high-pressure pumping stops.  The proppant-filled fracture creates a conductive channel through which the hydrocarbons can flow more freely from the formation into the wellbore and then to the surface.  Proppants therefore perform the vital function of promoting the flow, or conductivity, of hydrocarbons over a well’s productive life.  In fracturing a well, operators select a proppant that is transportable into the fracture, is compatible with frac and wellbore fluids, permits acceptable cleanup of frac fluids and can resist proppant flowback.  In addition, the proppant must be resistant to crushing under the earth’s closure stress and reservoir temperature.
 There are three primary types of proppant that are utilized in the hydraulic fracturing process: raw frac sand, coated sand and manufactured ceramic beads.  Customers choose among these proppant types based on the geology of the reservoir, expected well pressures, proppant flowback concerns, and product cost.  Given the price differences between the various proppant products and well-specific considerations, E&P companies are continually evaluating the optimal mix of lower-cost, lower-conductivity frac sand and higher-cost, higher-conductivity coated sand and ceramics in order to best address the geology of the well and to maximize well productivity and economic returns.

Proppant Industry Demand Trends
 Over the past decade, E&P companies increasingly focused on exploiting the vast hydrocarbon reserves contained in North America’s oil and gas reservoirs.  Using advanced techniques, such as horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, North American production of oil and gas has grown rapidly as the development of horizontal drilling technologies has evolved.  More recently, E&P and oil field service companies have refined their well designs and hydraulic fracturing techniques to achieve more efficient production.  These changes in techniques have increased the demand for proppants, by increasing the amount of proppant used per frac stage (“proppant intensity”) associated with finer grades of proppant.  
 This focus on efficiency and profitability led to new development techniques, such as increased use of pad drilling which resulted in a greater number of wells drilled per rig, and incorporated longer lateral lengths and shorter intervals between frac stages, which resulted in more fracturing stages per well.  In addition, the amount of proppant used per stage increased dramatically, compounding the increase in total demand for proppant.
 As a result of these trends, North American demand for all proppants increased rapidly over the past ten years.  This growth was fueled by the continued increase in both wells drilled and proppant used per well.  Individual wells were being completed with as much as 25,000 tons of proppant.  This represented a significant increase in the usage of proppant per well over just a few years ago and was driven by improved recovery rates for E&P companies at higher levels of proppant intensity with greater demand for finer grades of sand.
 In response to improving hydrocarbon prices, oil and gas operators steadily began increasing rig counts in the third quarter of 2016 and this trend continued through the end of 2017.  According to Baker Hughes rig count data, United States horizontal land rig counts have grown to an average of 740 rigs during 2017 from an average of 400 rigs in 2016.  During 2017, horizontal land rigs in the United States ranged from a low point of 534 rigs in the first quarter to over 800 in the fourth quarter 2017.  This significant rise in horizontal rig counts has resulted in increased drilling activity and demand for proppants throughout the year.  The well design trend of using more proppant per lateral foot and longer horizontal laterals continued in 2017 and further contributed to demand for proppants.  
 Proppant Industry Supply Trends
 To keep pace with rapidly growing demand, the available supply of proppant increased in 2017 through the reactivation of idled facilities, the building of new facilities, and capacity expansions at existing facilities.  During 2017, a number of new facilities were announced in West Texas in response to increasing demand for proppant in the Permian basins.  These facilities are expected to result in lower delivered cost within the Permian basin due to the facilities’ closer geographical proximity to well sites relative to other sources of supply.  The majority of these West Texas facilities are expected to be commissioned in 2018.  
Our Proppant Products
 We a broad suite of proppant products designed to address nearly all well environments and related down-hole challenges faced by our customers.  Our proppant products include Northern White sand, meeting the most common API-specified proppant categories, as well as regional and local sands in Voca, Texas; Kermit, Texas; and Wexford, Michigan.  Revenue in our Proppant solutions business spans these categories of raw sand and includes our value-added products of resin-coated proppants and Propel SSP®.  All revenues in our Proppant Solutions segment are derived from these products in each of 2017, 2016, and 2015.  
 Northern White Frac Sand.  Our Northern White frac sand is mined from deposits located in our Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri, and Minnesota facilities.  These reserves are generally characterized by high purity, significant roundness and sphericity, and low turbidity.  All of our Northern White raw sand proppant products meet the standards set by the API.
 API-Spec Brown Frac Sand.  Our API-spec brown sand reserves are located in Texas and marketed under the name Texas Gold® frac sand.  Our Texas Gold® frac sand has lower crush resistance than our Northern White frac sand, but it is an effective solution for low pressure wells.  These reserves are in close proximity to major oil and gas 
 9


producing basins in Texas, including the Eagle Ford Shale and the Permian Basin, which provides them with a significant transportation cost advantage relative to API-spec frac sand sourced from more distant locations.
 Value-Added Proppants.  We coat a portion of our API-spec produced sand with resin to enhance its performance as a proppant using proprietary resin formulations and coating technologies.  Our value-added proppants are generally used in higher temperature and higher pressure well environments and are marketed to end users who require increased conductivity in higher pressure wells, high crush resistance, and/or enhanced flow back control in order to enhance the productivity of their wells.
 Our coated sand products are sold as both tempered (or pre-cured) and curable (or bonding) products.  Curable coated sand bonds down hole as the formation heat causes neighboring coated sand grains to polymerize with one another locking proppant into place.  This prevents proppant from flowing back out of the fracture when the oil or natural gas well commences production.  For certain resin products, the resin’s chemical properties are triggered by the introduction of an activator into the frac fluid.  We formulate, manufacture, and sell activators, which work with the specific chemistry of our resins.  Tempered products do not require activation because they are not intended to bond, rather bring additional strength to the proppant.
 We manufacture proprietary coatings designed to address the evolving needs of our customers, and have continued to invest in our research and development and technical marketing capabilities to maximize the sales of our coated products.  We also coat ceramic product purchased from third-party suppliers.  This product is marketed as HyperProp® proppants and has the strength characteristics of ceramic and the flowback performance characteristics of coated sand.
 Proprietary Performance Products
 Propel SSP®.  Our patented Propel SSP® product utilizes a polymer coating applied to a proppant substrate.  Upon contact with water, the coating hydrates and swells rapidly to create a hydrogel around the proppant substrate.  The hydrogel layer, which is primarily water, is attached to the proppant particle and provides a nearly threefold increase in the hydrostatic radius of the proppant.  Test results indicate that the lower specific gravity allows greater volumes of proppant and/or coarser mesh sizes coated with the Propel SSP® product to be carried deep into the fracture, which in turn allow more hydrocarbons to escape into the wellbore.  As a result, field trials have shown a variety of benefits, including increased production, decreased use of fluids, and reduced pumping time.  
 In 2017, we introduced Propel SSP® 350, which expands the ability to place proppant with Propel SSP® technology by significantly extending the range of water compatibility from freshwater to ultra-high salinity produced water.  This extension allows oil and gas operators to reuse their produced water, thus reducing water management logistics and associated costs.
 Our Product Delivery
 We have established an oil and gas logistics network that we believe is highly responsive to our customers’ needs.  One of the most important purchasing criteria of our proppant customers is our ability to deliver the products our customers demand at their desired time and location.  We believe we have one of the industry’s largest distribution footprints with 44 active oil and gas distribution terminals.  We also have a railcar fleet of approximately 10,569 railcars as of December 31, 2017, providing us the flexibility for delivering product to our locations in-basin when customers require it.  We believe we are one of the few proppant producers capable of Class I railroad deliveries to each of North America’s major oil and gas-producing basins.  In 2017, we shipped approximately 74% of our North American proppant volume through our terminal network.  
 The ability to ship proppant through unit trains (a train in which all cars carry the same commodity and are not split up or stored en route) is becoming increasingly important in order to cost-effectively provide the large quantities of product required by evolving well completion methods.  We have unit train capabilities at four of our production facilities and twelve of our destination terminals and shipped over 545 unit trains of product in 2017.  The production unit train capability allows our customers that prefer to purchase the product FOB plant to efficiently ship the proppant to their own facilities.

I&R Industry Trends
 Demand in the I&R end markets is relatively stable and is primarily influenced by key macroeconomic drivers such as housing starts, light vehicle sales, repair and remodel activity, and industrial production.  The recent economic recovery has increased demand in the foundry, building products, and glassmaking end markets.  The primary end markets served by our I&R segment are foundry, building products, sports and recreation, glassmaking, and filtration.  All revenues in our I&R segment are derived from the following products in each of 2017, 2016, and 2015.  In 2017, we focused our sales efforts in higher margin, value-added product which contributed to higher sales and profitability growth on an annual basis over prior year levels.
Our I&R Products
 Foundry.  We currently supply the foundry industry with multiple grades of high purity, round, angular, and sub-angular sands for molding and core-making applications, with products sold primarily in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Japan, and China.  Foundry sands are characterized by high purity, round and sub-angular sands precisely screened to perform under a variety of metal casting conditions.  These factors dictate the refractory level and physical characteristics of the mold and core, which have a significant effect on the quality of the castings produced in the foundry.  Our resin binders provide the necessary bonding of molds and cores in casting applications and are designed to improve overall productivity and environment conditions in the workplace.
 Our extensive production experience and technical knowledge of the foundry industry have driven several industry advances.  For example, we have developed our Signature Series™ of low smoke, low odor coated sands that provide lower overall emissions while providing a safer and more favorable work environment.  Our expertise with coated sands enables us to provide coated sand for molds and cores where exceptional dimensional accuracy and surface finish are required.  An example is TruCoat™, which has been engineered to dramatically lower in-plant smoke, odor, and emissions as well as deliver superior performance making TruCoat™ one of the most environmentally sound products on the market.
 We believe we were the first sand operator to blend sands, which has proven extremely successful for specialty iron and aluminum applications.  As foundries continue to utilize higher cost binders to improve the quality of their castings, minimize the use of binders which also reduces overall environmental impact, the industry continues to demand higher quality sands to realize the value of these binders.  Our chemists and technicians support these applications with customized products that minimize binder usage, resulting in lower costs to foundries and higher prices for our products.
 Glass.  We provide a wide variety of high purity, low iron silica sands to the glass market.  The glass industry uses industrial sand consumption for the production of windows, electronic display screens, photovoltaic panels, glass bottles, and other glass products.
 Building Products.  Various grades and types of our sands are used for roofing shingles, asphalt, industrial flooring ballast sand, bridge decking, pipe lining, and tank underlayment.  We also work with our customers to blend minerals and chemicals to create colored flooring aggregates, concrete countertops, grout and plaster, including the newly-introduced Accel™ dust-preventing polymeric paver sand.
 Sports and Recreation.  We are a leading supplier of various turf and landscape infill products to contractors, municipalities, nurseries, and mass merchandisers.  Our turf-related products are used in multiple major sporting facilities, including First Energy Stadium and Progressive Field in Cleveland, Ohio, PNC Park in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Notre Dame Stadium in Notre Dame, Indiana, and ADPRO Sports Training Center Fieldhouse in Orchard Park, New York.  In addition, we are a significant supplier of bunker sand, top dressing sands, and all-purpose sands to golf courses and landscape contractors throughout North America.  Our sands are also supplied to horse tracks and training facilities.  We also provide colored sand to a variety of major retailers for use as play sand and arts and crafts.
 Filtration.  We provide high-quality industrial sands and gravels in a wide variety of water and wastewater filtration applications.  Over the past several years, we increased our focus on the filtration market.  Our full range of products are monitored with an active statistical process control program to ensure compliance with all government and 
 11


customer specifications, including the American Water Works and National Sanitation Foundation standards.  Due to our efforts, we have emerged as a leader in sand and gravel products for private, public, and institutional water filtration systems.
 Raw Materials
 Our products are dependent on the availability of certain raw materials, including natural gas or propane, resins and additives, bagging supplies, and other raw materials.  These are readily available from a variety of sources and we are not dependent on any one supplier of raw materials.  
Our Customers
 Since our inception, we have remained focused on developing and sustaining a loyal, diversified customer base.  Currently, we maintain long-term contracts with many of the largest North American oilfield service companies.  We believe the strength of our customer base is driven by our collaborative approach to product innovation and development, reputation for high-quality products, and extensive logistics network.  Certain of our top customer relationships date back over 30 years.  We have over 75 customers for our oil and gas proppants and over 830 customers across all our end markets.  In the year ended December 31, 2017, three customers exceeded 10% of revenues.  These customers collectively accounted for 45% of revenues in 2017.  In the year ended December 31, 2016, two customers exceeded 10% of revenues.  These customers collectively accounted for 42% of revenues in 2016.
 We primarily sell products under supply agreements with terms that vary by contract.  Certain of the agreements require the customer to purchase a specified percentage of its proppant requirements from us.  Other agreements require the customer to purchase a minimum volume of proppant from us.  These minimum volume contracts typically include a “take-or-pay” or “take-or-penalty” provision which triggers certain penalties if the purchased volume does not meet the required minimums.  Specific custom orders are generally filled upon request, and backlog is not a material factor.
 Research and Development and Technical Innovation
 We have a history of partnering with our customers to develop innovative solutions to enhance the effectiveness of well completions, from conventional shallow wells to the most complex, multi-stage, horizontal wells.  The nature of our vertically integrated model allows us to participate in each phase of proppant manufacturing and delivery and provides us a unique perspective into the current and future needs of our customers.  Our technical sales team works closely with market participants to demonstrate the value proposition our proppants offer and stimulate market demand using data indicating enhanced hydrocarbon recoveries.

The table below summarizes some of our most significant product innovations:
 
 
Innovation | Year | Result 
------------------------------+------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Propel SSP® 350 Products | 2017 | Accomplishes the same results as the original SSP technology when faced with brackish, sea, or produced water 
CoolSet® Proppants | 2014 | Eliminates need for an activator for well temperatures as low as 100°F 
TrueSet™ Proppants | 2016 | Provides effective flowback control and enhanced production, ideal for downhole temperatures between 150-300°F, does not require an activator, compatible with standard frac fluids and break technologies
PowerProp® Proppants | 2010 | Technology that delivers strength and performance characteristics similar to a light-weight ceramic (patent-pending) 
Bio-based Binder System | 2010 | Technology for use in metal casting industry (patent-pending) 
Bio-Balls® Ball Sealers | 2006 | Water soluble ball sealers that are environmentally safe and do not require retrieval after treatment 
Encapsulated Curable Proppant | 1997 | High performance value-added products used in flow-back control 
Dual Coat Technology | 1995 | Dual coat curable coated sand for enhanced conductivity and flowback control 

 
During 2017, 2016, and 2015, we spent $5.3 million, $3.7 million, and $5.0 million, respectively, on research and development.
 Along with continued commercial growth of Propel SSP® products, additional trial programs were initiated by oil and gas operators in 2017.  Propel SSP® products are being evaluated to improve operational efficiency and well productivity.  With Propel SSP®, the performance properties of the underlying proppant are maintained while optimal proppant volume and/or coarser mesh sizes are carried deep into the fractures, in turn allowing more hydrocarbons to flow into the wellbore.  Extensive field tests have shown the benefits of Propel SSP® products, including increased production, reduced fluid and chemical usage, and reduced pumping time.  Propel SSP® 350 products accomplish the same results, while allowing customers to use brackish water or reuse produced water.  Water reuse reduces the full-cycle water management cost and impact on local communities.
 Competition
 There are numerous large and small producers in all sand producing regions of the United States with whom we compete.  Our main competitors in the raw frac sand market include Badger Mining Corporation, CARBO Ceramics, Inc., Emerge Energy Services LP, Hi-Crush Partners LP, Preferred Sands LLC, Smart Sand Inc., Unimin Corporation, and U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc.  Many new entrants to the raw frac sand market compete on an FOB-plant basis and lack comparable transportation infrastructure to meet customer demands in-basin.  Our main competitors in the value-added proppant market include Atlas Resin Proppants LLC, Momentive Performance Materials Inc., Unimin Corporation, Preferred Sands LLC, and U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc.  The most important factors on which we compete in both markets are product quality, performance, sand and proppant characteristics, transportation capabilities, proximity of supply to well site, reliability of supply, and price.  Our largest competitors across both markets are U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc., Unimin Corporation, and Badger Mining Corporation (which owns Atlas Resin Proppants LLC).  We believe we are uniquely positioned to utilize our scale of raw sand production to supply high-quality substrate for coated products and leverage our transportation infrastructure for reliable delivery in-basin.
 Due to increased demand for sand based proppants, there has been an increase in the number of frac sand producers.  Moreover, as a result of this increased demand, existing frac sand producers have added to or expanded their frac sand production capacity, thereby increasing competition.  Demand for sand-based proppants is closely linked to proppant consumption patterns for the completion of oil and natural gas wells in North America.  These consumption patterns in a particular basin are influenced by numerous factors, including the price of hydrocarbons, the drilling rig count, and hydraulic fracturing activity levels, including the number of stages completed and the amount of proppant used per stage.  Further, these consumption patterns are also influenced by the location, quality, 
 13


selling price and availability of sand-based proppants and other types of proppants such as ceramic proppant.  Selling prices for sand-based proppants vary by basin and are determined based on supply and demand dynamics within each basin.
 As a result of increasing global supply of oil, the demand for proppant decreased from the end of 2014 and through the latter half of 2016, resulting in proppant oversupply and downward pressure on proppant selling prices.  This caused some proppant producers to exit the market and others, including us, to adjust operations and minimize costs.  From the end of 2016 through 2017, the price of oil has increased and the United States horizontal land rig counts have increased leading to significant improvement in proppant demand and pricing.
 Competitors in the I&R markets include some of our larger proppant competitors such as Unimin Corporation and U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc. but also typically include smaller, local or regional producers of sand and gravel.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2017, we employed a workforce of 989 employees.  We believe our culture of “People, Planet and Prosperity” has enabled us to achieve a long-tenured workforce and good relations with our workforce.
 We maintain an active dialogue with employees and provide salaried and hourly employees a comprehensive benefits package including medical, life, and accident insurance, incentive bonus programs, a 401(k) plan with an employer match and discretionary employer contribution, as well as educational assistance.  Certain employees are also eligible for stock-based compensation programs that are designed to encourage long-term performance aligned with Company objectives.
 As of December 31, 2017, approximately 155 of our domestic employees are parties to collective bargaining contracts.  We believe we have strong relationships with and maintain an active dialogue with union representatives.  We have historically been able to successfully extend and renegotiate collective bargaining agreements as they expire.
 Seasonality
 Our business is affected to some extent by seasonal fluctuations in weather that impact our production levels and our customers’ business needs.  For example, our proppant sales levels are lower in the first and fourth quarters due to lower market demand as adverse weather tends to slow oil and gas operations to varying degrees depending on the severity of the weather.  Our inability to mine and process frac sand year round at our surface mines in northern states results in a seasonal build-up of inventory as we excavate excess sand to build a stockpile that will feed our drying facilities during the winter months.  Additionally, in the second and third quarters, we sell more sand to our customers in the I&R end markets due to the seasonal rise in demand driven by more favorable weather conditions.
Intellectual Property
 Our intellectual property consists primarily of patents, trade secrets, know-how, trademarks, including our name Fairmount Santrol™ and products, including, but not limited to PowerProp®, Propel SSP®, HyperProp®, and CoolSet®.  We hold numerous U.S. and foreign-granted patents that are still in force as well as many U.S. and foreign patent applications that are still pending.  We own patents in most of our major, differentiated proppant product lines.  We have not granted any third-party rights with respect to our patents.  The majority of our patents have an expiration date after 2025.  In early 2016, we received a patent on certain of the Propel SSP® proppant technology and have additional patents pending.  With respect to trade secrets and know-how, our extensive experience with a variety of different products enables us to offer our customers a wide range of proppants for their particular application.
