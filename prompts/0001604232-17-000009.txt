Marriott Renaissance Izmir Hotel
 
On August 30, 2016, the Company entered into Securities Purchase Agreements (“SPAs”) with Najibi Investment Trading FZC, G7 Entertainment Incorporated, SOHA Investment & Partners, and Royaltun General Trading L.L.C. (the “Investors”). These SPAs were entered into in connection with the acquisition of 50% of the stock of Par-San Turizm Anonim Sirketi (“Par-San”), which owns the Marriott Renaissance Izmir Hotel in Izmir, Turkey (the “Marriott”). The Investors are related parties to our Chief Executive Officer and Director, Abbas Salih, as a result of Mr. Salih’s ownership interest in and/or control of the Investors.
 
Pursuant to the SPAs, we issued convertible debentures (“Debentures”) equal to 50% of the difference between $65 million minus the approximately $23,731,064 million debt owed to T.C. Ziraat Bankasi A.S. (the “Ziraat Bank Debt”). In exchange for these Debentures, the Investors sold and transferred their 50% ownership in Par-San to the Company. In addition, the Company issued a Debenture in the amount of $23,731,064 to Najibi Investment Trading FZC in exchange for Najibi Investment Trading FZC agreeing to pay the Ziraat Bank Debt in full.
 
On October 14, 2016, the Company and the Investors entered into a Securities Exchange Agreement whereby they agreed to cancel the original SPAs and the Debentures and enter into new SPAs (the “New SPAs”) for the issuance of new, amended Debentures (the “New Debentures”) in the principal amount of $47,400,000.
 
Under the New SPAs, the Company and the Investors agreed that the closing of the purchase of 50% of Par-San (the “Closing”) will occur upon the delivery of certain documents and the occurrence of other events, the most important of which are:
 
·                     Payment in full of the Ziraat Bank Debt and written confirmation thereof
 ·                     Release of all liens on the Marriott hotel
 ·                     Transfer of 50% of the stock of Par-San to the Company
 ·                     Payment of $3,000,000 to the Company for working capital
 
If the Ziraat Bank Debt is not satisfied within a reasonable amount of time, as determined by the Company, the Company can cancel the New SPAs.
 
In preparation for Closing, the Company has executed the New Debentures; however, they are not binding obligations of the Company until all closing conditions are satisfied or waived by the Company.
 
The Company is working diligently toward Closing and intends to close the above transactions as soon as possible.
 
Any funding that maybe required to complete the Marriott hotel transaction has not yet been fully secured, there can be no assurances the transaction will proceed and SIII management cautions investors of this risk.
 

Competition
 We are a development stage company engaged in the acquisition of a prospective real estate property. As we currently do not own an interest in any real estate property, we compete with other companies for both the acquisition of prospective properties and the financing necessary to develop such properties.
We conduct our business in an environment that is highly competitive and unpredictable. In seeking out prospective properties, we have encountered intense competition in all aspects of our proposed business as we compete directly with other development stage companies as well as established international companies. Many of our competitors are national or international companies with far greater resources, capital and access to information than us. Accordingly, these competitors may be able to spend greater amounts on the acquisition of prospective properties and on the development of such properties. In addition, they may be able to afford greater expertise in the development real estate properties. This competition could result in our competitors having real estate properties of greater quality and attracting prospective investors to finance the development of such properties on more favorable terms. As a result of this competition, we may become involved in an acquisition with more risk or obtain financing on less favorable terms.
 Compliance with Government Regulation 
 We will not know the government regulations and the cost of compliance with such regulations with which we must comply until such time as we acquire an interest in a particular real estate property. If we are successful in acquiring a property interest, we will be required to comply with the regulations of governmental authorities and agencies applicable to the federal, state or provincial and local jurisdictions where the property is located. Development of real estate properties may require prior approval from applicable governmental regulatory agencies. There can be no assurance that such approvals will be obtained.
 If our activities should advance to the point where we engage in real estate development operations, we could become subject to environmental regulations promulgated by federal, state or provincial, and local government agencies as applicable. Environmental legislation provides for restrictions and prohibitions on real estate development which could result in environmental liability. A breach or violation of such legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties. In addition, certain types of operations require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments. Environmental assessments are increasingly imposing higher standards, greater enforcement, fines and penalties for non-compliance. Environmental assessments of proposed projects carry a heightened degree of responsibility for companies, directors, officers and employees. The cost of compliance in respect of environmental regulation has the potential to reduce the profitability of any future revenues that our company may generate.
 Employees
 The Company currently does not have any employees. All business activities and services are provided by the Company’s directors or consultants.
