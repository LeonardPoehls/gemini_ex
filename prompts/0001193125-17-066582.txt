Overview 
 We are a clinical stage drug development company advancing targeted therapeutics for the treatment of patients with cancer. We are an ambitious oncology-focused company, oriented towards achieving the successful registration and commercialization of our product candidates. We have a world-class management team with a proven track record of success in oncology drug development and we are advancing an emerging pipeline of next generation therapies that target the DNA Damage Response (DDR) network. 
 Our lead product candidate, SRA737, is a highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1). Chk1 is a key cell cycle checkpoint and central regulator of the DDR network, a system of cellular pathways that monitor, detect and repair DNA damage. In cancer cells, replication stress induced by oncogenic drivers (e.g., MYC and RAS) combined with loss of function in tumor suppressors (e.g., TP53 and ATM) results in persistent DNA damage and genomic instability. Targeted inhibition of the remaining components of the DDR network, such as by SRA737, may be synthetically lethal to cancer cells and have utility as a monotherapy in a range of tumor indications. 
 Chk1 is also believed to facilitate tumor cell resistance to chemotherapy or radiation-induced DNA damage and, as such, the combination of SRA737 with these standards-of-care may provide synergistic anti-tumor activity, consistent with findings in preclinical oncology models. Importantly, the oral bioavailability of SRA737 may afford greater dosing flexibility for both monotherapy and combination therapy settings than is possible with intravenously administered agents. 
 We are pursuing an innovative development plan for SRA737, which is currently being evaluated in two Phase 1 clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer. The first trial is intended to evaluate SRA737s potential to induce synthetic lethality as monotherapy, while the second trial is intended to explore SRA737s potentiating effects in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapy. We successfully transferred sponsorship of these two trials in January 2017 and subsequently submitted protocol amendments intended to enhance both of these studies. In particular, we plan to focus enrollment on pre-selected patients predicted to most likely derive benefit from SRA737 treatment based on the genetics of their tumors. A preliminary update of the SRA737 clinical trials is anticipated to be available approximately by the end of 2017. 
 Concurrently, we are conducting preclinical research evaluating SRA737 in combination with other DDR-targeted agents, including poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, as well as with immuno-oncology therapeutics, that may guide a potential next wave of clinical development for our asset, possibly further broadening its therapeutic utility. 
 We are also advancing SRA141, a potent, selective and orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of cell division cycle 7 kinase (Cdc7) undergoing preclinical development. Cdc7 is a key regulator of both DNA replication and the DDR network, making it a compelling emerging target for the potential treatment of a broad range of tumor types. 
 Sierra Oncology retains the global commercialization rights to both SRA737 and SRA141. 
 Our Strategy 
 Key elements of our business strategy are to: 
 

 | Enhance and Expedite the Clinical Development of SRA737. We plan to advance our lead product candidate, SRA737, for the treatment of a broad range of cancers, initially focusing on indications

where we believe SRA737 has the best potential for demonstrating anti-tumor activity and where there is a significant unmet medical need. The two Phase 1 clinical trials for SRA737 currently underway in the U.K. are designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of SRA737 both as monotherapy and in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapy. We intend to modify these trials to include an evaluation of efficacy in prospectively-selected subjects with genetically defined tumors, with the objective of enriching these studies for patients predicted to be more likely to derive benefit from SRA737. These studies are designed to help assess potential patient selection strategies for further clinical development.

 | Pursue a Multi-Faceted Development Strategy for SRA737 and SRA141 Across Many Oncology Indications. We intend to expand the commercial market opportunities for SRA737 and SRA141 by exploring their potential as treatments for a wide variety of cancer indications, as monotherapy and in combination with other therapeutic agents, including chemotherapy, DDR-targeted agents and immuno-oncology agents. The DDR network in general, and Chk1 and Cdc7 specifically, have been implicated as biologically-relevant across a wide variety of solid tumors, including colorectal, bladder, head and neck, lung, ovarian, pancreatic and prostate, which could provide multiple development opportunities for both SRA737 and SRA141.

 | Maximize the Global Commercial Value of our Product Candidates. As we further develop our product candidates, we plan to build a commercial infrastructure with the capability to directly market our products, once approved, to oncologists in North America and possibly other major geographies that are core to our commercial strategy. We plan to enter into collaborations for the marketing and commercialization of our products in additional geographies at an appropriate time. We also plan to invest in scaling our manufacturing capacity to support our global commercial strategy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Broaden our Proprietary Pipeline by Acquiring Product Candidates. We plan to opportunistically acquire additional oncology product candidates through in-licensing or other strategic opportunities in order to expand our pipeline and leverage the full potential of our development capabilities. We intend to evaluate and consider acquiring additional oncology product candidates that are currently in clinical testing or could be advanced into human clinical trials within 18 months, with an emphasis on assets that potentially could be complementary to our other product candidates when administered in combination.

 Background on DDR and its Role in Cancer 
 Cancer is a leading cause of death in the developed world and the second leading cause of death in the United States, with 596,000 deaths and 1.7 million new cases estimated to occur in the United States in 2016, according to the American Cancer Society (ACS). The International Agency for Research on Cancer projects that in 2030, 21.7 million people will be diagnosed with cancer and 13 million will die of cancer in that year worldwide. 
 The most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery, radiation and drug therapy. A cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination of these methods. Surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective for patients in whom the disease is localized. Physicians generally use systemic drug therapies in situations where the cancer has spread beyond the primary site or cannot otherwise be treated through surgery or radiation. The goal of drug therapy is to kill cancer cells or to damage cellular components required for the rapid growth and survival of cancer cells. In many cases, drug therapy entails the administration of several different drugs in combination. Over the past several decades, drug therapy has evolved from non-specific drugs that kill both healthy and cancerous cells, to drugs that target specific molecular pathways to selectively kill only cancer cells. While heightened vigilance, new diagnostic tests, combination regimens and targeted therapies have resulted in improvements in overall survival for some cancer patients, we believe that there is still a necessity for continued innovation in the treatment of cancer. 
 Our genomic DNA is continuously subject to damage due to external factors, such as chemicals, radiation and viruses, or internal factors, such as replication stress and reactive oxygen species generated during cellular 
 
3 
 
 metabolism. Our cells have developed a highly coordinated array of mechanisms to resolve DNA damage and maintain genomic integrity, collectively known as the DDR network. Seminal discoveries related to the DDR network have contributed to the discovery of potential new treatments for cancer. 
 The genes that underlie the DDR network itself are often mutated in malignant cells, further contributing to genomic instability. Genomic instability, the accumulation of DNA damage and functional genomic alterations, is a key hallmark of cancer. The genomic instability and mutational capacity of tumors provides them with a selective advantage over normal cells by enabling continual proliferation and survival, as well as by engendering adaptive mechanisms for developing resistance to chemotherapy and other standards-of-care. Tumor cells accommodate genomic instability resulting from the genetic mutation of certain DDR and cell cycle genes through an enhanced dependency on the remaining components of the DDR network in order to support their replication and viability. 
 An emerging therapeutic strategy to treat tumors is to target these remaining vital components of the cell cycle and DDR network, such as Chk1 and Cdc7, either alone or in combination with DNA-damaging chemotherapy or radiation, in order to induce irreparable DNA damage, causing a catastrophic replicative process ultimately resulting in cell death. In contrast, non-transformed cells have redundant cell cycle checkpoints and multiple complementary DNA repair pathways, which should render them less sensitive to these agents. This strategy has been likened to striking at the Achilles Heel of cancer, and therapeutic strategies increasingly are focusing on targeting the DDR network to exploit this intrinsic weakness of tumors. 
 A number of agents affecting components of the DDR network have either been approved or are currently in late-stage clinical trials, including small molecule PARP inhibitors for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer harboring mutations in the BRCA genes. We believe data from these programs support the broader potential for therapeutic intervention by targeting the DDR network. PARP inhibitors work in part by inhibiting the PARP enzyme from orchestrating the repair of single strand breaks in DNA. Our DDR program is oriented to expanding beyond the scope of PARP inhibitors by focusing on impeding the repair of DNA double strand breaks, the most deleterious form of DNA damage, as well as by striking at targets that control DNA replication and cell cycle progression. 
 Chk1  A Central Regulator of the DNA Damage Response Network 
 Chk1 is a serine-threonine kinase which acts as a central regulator of the DDR network that detects and repairs DNA damage. Chk1 regulates multiple cell-cycle phases, temporarily inhibiting the progression of cell replication and division in order for DNA repair processes to be undertaken. In addition, Chk1 directly activates several important proteins involved in the repair of damaged DNA. 
 Malignant cells tolerate substantially greater levels of genomic instability than would be acceptable in healthy cells. Despite accumulating considerable DNA damage due to replicative stress or defects in DNA repair machinery, cancer cells survive and replicate via an over-reliance on select components of the DDR network, including Chk1. Consistent with this observation, inhibition of Chk1 has been shown to be synthetically lethal to cancer cells harboring functional genetic alterations in genes such as MYC, RAS, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53. This provides an opportunity to treat cancers with high replication stress and genomic instability with Chk1 inhibitor therapy. 
 Certain standard chemotherapeutic drugs (such as gemcitabine, cisplatin, docetaxel and topotecan) and radiotherapy also induce DNA damage in order to kill cancer cells. We believe considerable preclinical evidence supports the potential for synergy between these standard therapies and Chk1 inhibitors in combination.

Our Lead Product Candidate  SRA737, a Potent, Highly Selective, Orally Bioavailable Chk1 Inhibitor 
 Overview 
 SRA737 is a potent, highly selective, orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of Chk1. The agent was developed through collaboration between The Institute of Cancer Research Cancer Therapeutics Unit, Sareum Ltd and Cancer Research Technology Ltd. SRA737 was licensed to us in September 2016 and we transferred sponsorship of the ongoing SRA737 clinical trials to the company in January 2017. 
 A body of preclinical experimental data supports the exploration of SRA737 as a single agent and in combination with DNA damaging agents, particularly in certain subjects with genetically defined tumors exhibiting high levels of genomic instability or harboring certain genetic mutations, particularly those associated with high levels of replication stress (such as MYC, RAS, ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2 and TP53). 
 SRA737 is being investigated in two Phase 1 clinical trials that were initiated in June 2016 in the U.K. under a clinical trial application (CTA). The current design of these clinical trials is as follows: 
 

 | A multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion trial evaluating SRA737 as a monotherapy in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The objectives of the monotherapy trial include assessing the safety profile of SRA737, determining the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) with one or more schedules of administration of SRA737, and to propose a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of SRA737.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study evaluating SRA737 in combination with DNA-targeting chemotherapies (gemcitabine plus cisplatin or gemcitabine alone) in subjects with advanced solid tumors. The objectives of this trial include assessing the safety profile of SRA737 administered in combination with chemotherapies, determining the MTD of SRA737 administered in combination with gemcitabine ± cisplatin, and to propose a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule of SRA737 in combination with gemcitabine ± cisplatin.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 With the formal transfer of clinical trial sponsorship completed in January 2017, we subsequently submitted protocol amendments intended to enhance both of these studies, including to pre-select patients predicted to most likely derive benefit from SRA737 treatment. A preliminary update from the SRA737 clinical trials is anticipated to be available approximately by the end of 2017. 
 Potential SRA737 Monotherapy Trial Enhancements 
 We intend to enhance the monotherapy clinical trial currently underway by modifying the clinical trial design. The goal of this amendment is to pre-select patients predicted to most likely derive benefit from SRA737 treatment. Specifically, we intend to amend the monotherapy clinical trial protocol in order to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of SRA737 in subjects with tumors identified to have genetic aberrations hypothesized to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. Additionally, we intend to modify the trial to assess SRA737s clinical activity across a number of cancer indications that harbor these genetic mutations in order to determine potential patient selection strategies for further clinical development. 
 Following the successful approval and activation of the planned protocol amendment, we intend to employ an algorithm based on genetic selection in order to guide patient selection. The algorithm is intended to define patient enrollment where the subjects tumor has a confirmed minimum of two different types of genetic abnormalities. These could include tumors with a deleterious mutation in a key tumor suppressor gene, such as TP53, and at least one of the following: 
 

 | a loss of function or deleterious mutation in the DNA damage response pathway such as ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, or another gene in the DNA damage response pathway implicated in Chk1 pathway sensitivity;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
5 
 

 | a genetic indicator of replicative stress, defined as gain of function or amplification of CHEK1 or ATR or other related gene; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a gain of function mutation or amplification of an oncogenic driver such as MYC, RAS, or another gene implicated in Chk1 pathway sensitivity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Cancers that are predicted to have a high prevalence of genetic aberrations hypothesized to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition are planned to be evaluated in the amended clinical trial within tissue-specific expansion cohorts. These include, for example, cohorts of subjects with: 
 

 | previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | platinum-resistant ovarian cancer;
--+-----------------------------------


 | metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer;
--+-------------------------------------------------


 | advanced non-small cell lung cancer; and
--+-----------------------------------------


 | head and neck squamous cell carcinoma.
--+---------------------------------------

Potential SRA737 Combination Trial Enhancements 
 The current objectives of the combination trial include establishing the safety profile of SRA737 administered in combination with gemcitabine ± cisplatin, determining the MTD of SRA737 and defining a recommended Phase 2 dose of SRA737 when given in combination with chemotherapy. The current trial is designed to also assess the clinical activity of SRA737 in combination with chemotherapy in expansion cohorts once the MTD is established. 
 We intend to enhance the combination clinical trial currently underway by modifying the clinical trial design in order to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of SRA737 in genetically selected subjects with tumors identified to have genetic aberrations hypothesized to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition. We intend to employ a similar genetic selection algorithm to that defined in the monotherapy protocol. Specifically, we plan to enroll subjects with bladder cancer and pancreatic cancer into genetically selected dose expansion cohorts, as (i) bladder cancer and pancreatic cancer are predicted to have a high prevalence of genetic aberrations hypothesized to confer sensitivity to Chk1 inhibition and (ii) gemcitabine is often an important component of the standard of care treatment for these indications. The goal of this amendment is to pre-select patients predicted to most likely derive benefit from SRA737 treatment. In addition, bladder cancer and pancreatic cancer are indications in which the possible potentiating effect of SRA737 on gemcitabines clinical activity might be informative with respect to further clinical development. 
Additional SRA737 Trials and Development Activities 
 In order to obtain regulatory approval and potentially commercialize SRA737, we will need to complete the clinical trials described above and then conduct Phase 2 and possibly Phase 3 registration-oriented clinical trials in well-defined, tissue-specific, or possibly genetically-specific, patient populations in order to thoroughly and robustly evaluate the safety and efficacy of SRA737. 
 We anticipate including U.S. clinical trial sites in the subsequent development of SRA737. Before initiating our Phase 2 and possible Phase 3 clinical trials, we intend to submit an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
 If the efficacy data obtained in some or all of the subsequent Phase 2 clinical trials are highly compelling, we plan to discuss accelerated registration paths and other regulatory designations with regulatory agencies. In order to obtain marketing approval to commercialize SRA737, a new drug application (NDA) must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA in the United States, and a marketing authorization application must be submitted to 
 
6 
 
 and approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Moreover, when a diagnostic device, such as a device used to identify subsets of patients with a genetic alteration who may derive meaningful benefit from a product, is essential to the safe and effective use of a therapeutic product, the FDA and other regulatory authorities generally require that the companion diagnostic be approved before or concurrent with approval of the therapeutic product and before the therapeutic product can be commercialized. Commensurate with global regulatory submissions, we will need to validate processes at large scale manufacturing facilities in advance of pre-approval inspections, marketing authorizations and product launch. 
 A number of other agents affecting components of the DDR network have either been approved or are currently in late-stage clinical trials, including small molecule PARP inhibitors for the treatment of advanced BRCA mutated ovarian cancer. We are currently conducting preclinical research evaluating SRA737 in combination with other DDR agents, including PARP inhibitors, that may guide a potential next wave of clinical development for our asset, possibly further broadening its therapeutic utility. 
 We are also currently conducting preclinical research evaluating SRA737 in combination with immuno-oncology agents in order to assess anticipated synergies between these two drug classes, the results of which will guide potential additional clinical development for SRA737. 
 The amount and timing of our expenditures on these clinical trials will depend upon numerous factors, including their ongoing status and results. Although it is difficult to predict additional capital requirements, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to allow us to achieve clinical data read-outs from the dose expansion stages of our current trials underway. 
 We anticipate that we will need additional funding to complete any future Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trials. 
 Subject to approval by regulatory authorities and ethics and scientific review bodies, we anticipate amending the monotherapy and combination therapy Phase 1 trials in the second quarter of 2017. We anticipate providing a public update on these trials approximately by the end of 2017, and to report interim data from these trials at a medical conference in 2018. During 2017, we also anticipate reporting preclinical results guiding potential clinical opportunities for our Chk1 inhibitor with PARP inhibitors or immuno-oncology agents, which could lead to the commencement of potential combination clinical trials in 2018. 
 Our Second Product Candidate  SRA141, a Highly Selective, Orally Available Cdc7 Inhibitor 
 Cdc7 is a serine-threonine kinase which acts as an essential regulator of both DNA replication and the DDR network. Over-expression of Cdc7 and its partner proteins is correlated with unfavorable clinical outcomes and poor survival in a broad range of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. In preclinical studies, inhibition of Cdc7 has been shown to cause cancer cell death in a p53-independent manner, and to induce tumor stasis or regression in a variety of in vivo cancer models. 
 SRA141 is a highly selective, orally available small molecule inhibitor of Cdc7. SRA141 was licensed to us in May 2016 from Carna Biosciences, Inc., Kobe, Japan. 
 Status of Our Preclinical Development Program for SRA141 
 We are pursuing a robust program of preclinical studies with SRA141 to evaluate tumor responses and dosing regimens across a variety of indications in order to inform our clinical development plans and possible patient selection strategies. Preclinical data and published literature suggest a variety of solid tumors and hematological malignancies with potential for response to Cdc7 inhibitors. The potential of SRA141 to synergize with other targeted agents and DDR inhibitors (including SRA737) is also being explored in preclinical models. A genetically defined patient selection strategy focusing on drivers of Cdc7 inhibitor sensitivity may help facilitate clinical trial execution. We expect clinical studies for SRA141 will begin by the end of 2017 in the United States after we submit an IND to the FDA.

License Agreements 
 CRT Pioneer Fund LP License Agreement 
 In September 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with CRT Pioneer Fund LP (CPF) for worldwide rights, know-how and materials to develop SRA737, a small molecule inhibitor targeting Chk1, a promising therapeutic target to treat cancer. Pursuant to the agreement, we made a one-time upfront payment of $7.0 million to CPF in October 2016 and paid $2.0 million to CPF in January 2017 for the successful transfer of two ongoing Phase I clinical trials. Additional milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $319.5 million may become payable to CPF upon the achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestones. In addition, we are required to pay CPF, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered high single-digit to low double-digit royalties on the net sales of any product successfully developed until the later of (i) the date when such licensed product is no longer covered by a valid patent claim within the licensed intellectual property, (ii) the expiration of any data, marketing or other statutory exclusivity rights covering the licensed product, or (iii) a specified period after the first commercial sale of the licensed product. Such royalties will be reduced on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis under certain conditions, including if certain generic competition exists in such country, or if we are required to pay royalties to third parties in order to develop or commercialize the licensed product. 
 The license agreement will expire on the date of expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to CPF. Either party may terminate the license agreement if the other party materially breaches the license agreement, subject to certain cure provisions, and CPF may terminate the license agreement in certain limited circumstances as described in the license agreement. The license agreement may also be terminated at any time by us upon 90 days prior written notice to CPF. 
 Carna Biosciences, Inc. License Agreement 
 In May 2016, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Carna Biosciences, Inc. (Carna) for worldwide rights to develop and commercialize SRA141, a small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting Cdc7. In exchange for this exclusive right, we paid Carna an upfront payment of $0.9 million in June 2016. We will be required to pay Carna milestone payments of up to an aggregate of $270.0 million upon achievement of certain developmental, regulatory and commercial milestone events. In addition, for product candidates defined under the license agreement, we are required to pay Carna on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, tiered single-digit royalties on net sales. 
 The license agreement will expire on the date of expiration of our obligation to pay royalties to Carna. Following the expiration of the license agreement, we will obtain a fully paid-up, non-exclusive license to develop and commercialize products relating to the licensed intellectual property worldwide for any use. Carna may terminate the license agreement if we materially breach the agreement, subject to certain cure provisions. The license agreement may also be terminated at any time by us upon 30 days prior written notice to Carna. 
 Research and Development 
 Since commencing operations, we have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to research and development activities, including clinical development. We incurred research and development expenses of $33.9 million, $26.4 million and $19.1 million, during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance SRA737 and SRA141. 
Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary or intellectual property protection for SRA737, SRA141 and future product candidates, to operate without infringing on the proprietary 
 
8 
 
 rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary or intellectual property rights. Our strategy is to seek to protect our proprietary position and intellectual property position by, among other methods, filing patent applications related to our proprietary technology and product candidates in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position. 
 We have exclusively licensed CPFs rights to patents owned by Cancer Research Technology (CRT), a subsidiary of Cancer Research UK (CRUK) directed to compositions of matter and methods of use related to SRA737 and other Chk1 inhibitors. As of December 31, 2016, these rights included one (1) pending U.S. patent application comprising claims directed to compositions of SRA737 and methods of using SRA737 for the treatment of cancer indications as a single agent, or in combination with a DNA damaging agent. Any patents issuing from this U.S. utility application are expected to expire in 2033, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2016, these rights also included four (4) issued foreign patents and thirteen (13) pending foreign patent applications in thirteen (13) foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, Europe and Japan comprising claims directed to compositions of SRA737 and methods of using SRA737 for the treatment of cancer indications as a single agent, or in combination with a DNA damaging agent. These foreign patents, and any patents issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2033, absent any adjustments or extensions. We have filed and will continue to file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of SRA737 as they develop. 
 We have exclusively licensed from Carna patent applications directed to the SRA141 composition of matter, alone or in combination with an M-phase inhibitor and methods of use for the combination. As of December 31, 2016, we were the exclusive licensee of one (1) U.S. patent, expiring in 2032, absent any adjustments or extensions, and one (1) pending U.S. patent application, both comprising composition of matter claims directed to SRA141. Any patents issuing from this U.S. utility application are expected to expire in 2032, absent any adjustments or extensions. As of December 31, 2016, this exclusively-licensed portfolio included four (4) issued foreign patents and seven (7) pending foreign patent applications in seven (7) foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, Europe, India, Japan, Korea and Mexico comprising composition of matter claims directed to SRA141. The foreign patents, and any patents issuing from these pending foreign patent applications, are expected to expire in 2032, absent any adjustments or extensions. Additionally, as of December 31, 2016, this portfolio also included one (1) pending U.S. patent application, and two (2) pending foreign patent applications in Europe and Japan comprising composition of matter claims directed to a combination of SRA141 and an M-phase inhibitor and methods of use for the combination for treating cancer. Any patents issuing from these applications are expected to expire in 2035, absent any adjustments or extensions. We have filed and will continue to file patent applications directed to the composition of matter and methods of use related to various aspects of SRA141 as they develop. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product candidate and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. 
 As with other oncology companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. However, patent applications that we may file or license from third 
 
9 
 
 parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents. Our issued patents and any issued patents that we may receive in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before SRA737, SRA141 or any of our product candidates can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent. 
 In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our scientific advisors and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. The confidentiality agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of agreements or clauses requiring invention assignment, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with a third party. 
 Competition 
 The oncology industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. While we believe that our technology, knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies that are available for the indication or indications for which they are approved and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 To our knowledge, there are no approved drugs that specifically target Chk1 on the market, but there are a number of competitors in clinical development, at a similar stage of development or more advanced than us. Genentech, Inc. is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of an oral Chk1 inhibitor in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphoma. Esperas Pharma is conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of an oral Chk1 inhibitor as monotherapy and in combination with gemcitabine in patients with advanced or metastatic cancer. Eli Lilly and Company is developing an intravenous Chk1/Chk2 inhibitor in several clinical settings, the most advanced of which are in Phase 2 clinical trials. There are also preclinical programs focused on developing Chk1 inhibitors. If SRA737 is approved, it will compete with existing therapies and currently marketed drugs for the indication or indications for which it is approved. 
 Additionally, to our knowledge, there are no approved drugs that specifically target Cdc7. Takeda Pharmaceutical Company is currently conducting a Phase 1 clinical trial of a Cdc7 inhibitor in Japan and Eli Lilly and Company has a preclinical program focused on developing a Cdc7 inhibitor. Other companies may be conducting preclinical studies of Cdc7 inhibitors as well. If SRA141 is approved, it will compete with existing therapies for the indication or indications for which it is approved. 
 Many of the companies against which we are competing, or against which we may compete in the future, have significantly greater financial and other resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the oncology industry may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be 
 
10 
 
 significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or that may be necessary for, our programs. 
 Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any drugs that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or foreign regulatory approval for their product candidates more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. In addition, our ability to compete may be affected in many cases by insurers or other third-party payors seeking to encourage the use of generic drugs. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not have any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of SRA737, SRA141 and other potential product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if our product candidates receive marketing approval. 
 We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply. We believe that our manufacturers have sufficient capacity to meet our current demand and, in the event they fail to meet our demand, adequate alternative sources for such materials exist. However, there is a risk that if supplies are interrupted or result in poor yield or quality, it would materially harm our business. We will continue to evaluate product demand requirements and qualify alternate sources for SRA737 and SRA141 on an as-needed basis. 
 Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations are required to comply with current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) regulations, which are regulatory requirements for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans. 
 Government Regulation 
 FDA Approval Process 
 In the United States, pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act) and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. 
 Pharmaceutical product development for a new product or certain changes to an approved product in the United States typically involves preclinical laboratory and animal tests, the submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical testing may commence, and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the drug for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. Satisfaction of FDA pre-market approval requirements typically takes many years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product or disease. 
 Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, formulation and toxicity, as well as animal trials to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. The conduct of the preclinical 
 
11 
 
 tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including good laboratory practices. The results of preclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical trial protocol. Long-term preclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
 A 30-day waiting period after the submission of each IND is required prior to the commencement of clinical testing in humans. If the FDA has neither commented on nor questioned the IND within this 30-day period, the clinical trial proposed in the IND may begin. 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified investigator. Clinical trials must be conducted (i) in compliance with federal regulations; (ii) in compliance with good clinical practice (GCP), an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors; and (iii) under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol involving testing on U.S. patients and subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. 
 The FDA may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of a clinical trial at any time, or impose other sanctions, if it believes that the clinical trial either is not being conducted in accordance with FDA requirements or presents an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. The trial protocol and informed consent information for patients in clinical trials must also be submitted to an institutional review board (IRB) for approval. An IRB may also require the clinical trial at the site to be halted, either temporarily or permanently, for failure to comply with the IRBs requirements, or may impose other conditions. 
 Clinical trials to support NDAs for marketing approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. In Phase 1, the initial introduction of the drug into patients, the drug is typically tested to assess endpoints such as metabolism, pharmacokinetics, pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to determine the effectiveness of the drug for a particular tissue-specific, or possibly genetically-specific patient population, dosage tolerance and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks. If a compound demonstrates evidence of effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in Phase 2 evaluations, Phase 3 trials are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, to permit FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 or Phase 2 trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the trial is a large multicenter trial demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and confirmation of the result in a second trial would be practically or ethically impossible. 
 After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the United States. The NDA must include the results of all preclinical, clinical and other testing and a compilation of data relating to the products pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The cost of preparing and submitting an NDA is substantial. The submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a substantial application user fee, and the applicant under an approved NDA is also subject to annual product and establishment user fees. These fees are typically increased annually. 
 The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agencys threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once 
 
12 
 
 the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs. Most such applications for standard review drug products are reviewed within ten to twelve months; most applications for priority review drugs are reviewed in six to eight months. Priority review can be applied to drugs that the FDA determines offer major advances in treatment, or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. For biologics, priority review is further limited only for drugs intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease relative to the currently approved products. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. 
 The FDA may also refer applications for novel drug products, or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy, to an advisory committeetypically a panel that includes clinicians and other expertsfor review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured. FDA will not approve the product unless compliance with cGMPs is satisfactory and the NDA contains data that provide substantial evidence that the drug is safe and effective in the indication studied. 
 After FDA evaluates the NDA and the manufacturing facilities, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDAs satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. 
 An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS) to help ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. REMS can include medication guides, communication plans for healthcare professionals and elements to assure safe use (ETASU). ETASU can include, but are not limited to, special training or certification for prescribing or dispensing, dispensing only under certain circumstances, special monitoring and the use of patient registries. The requirement for REMS can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drugs safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing. 
 Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement before the change can be implemented. An NDA supplement for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing NDA supplements as it does in reviewing NDAs. 
 FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics 
 If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of a therapeutic product, then the FDA generally will require approval or clearance of the diagnostic at the same time that FDA approves the therapeutic product. The FDA has generally required in vitro companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who will respond to cancer treatment to obtain a pre-market approval, or PMA, for that diagnostic simultaneously with approval of the drug. The review of these in vitro companion diagnostics in conjunction with the review of our cancer treatments involves coordination of review by the FDAs Center for Drug Evaluation and Research and by the FDAs Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 
 
13 
 
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. It involves a rigorous premarket review during which the applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the devices safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee, which exceeds $258,000 for most PMAs. In addition, PMAs for devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results when the same sample is tested multiple times by multiple users at multiple laboratories. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturers facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance requirements. 
 PMA approval is not guaranteed, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a not approvable determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay or prevent approval. If the FDAs evaluation of the PMA application is favorable, the FDA typically issues an approvable letter requiring the applicants agreement to specific conditions, such as changes in labeling, or specific additional information, such as submission of final labeling, in order to secure final approval of the PMA. If the FDA concludes that the applicable criteria have been met, the FDA will issue a PMA for the approved indications, which can be more limited than those originally sought by the applicant. The PMA can include post-approval conditions that the FDA believes necessary to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution. 
 After a device is placed on the market, it remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved. Device manufacturers must also establish registration and device listings with the FDA. A medical device manufacturers manufacturing processes and those of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging and shipping of medical devices. Domestic facility records and manufacturing processes are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA. The FDA also may inspect foreign facilities that export products to the United States. 
 Pediatric Information 
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), NDAs or supplements to NDAs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the drug is safe and effective. The FDA may grant full or partial waivers, or deferrals, for submission of data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) provides NDA holders a six-month extension of any exclusivitypatent or non-patentfor a drug if certain conditions are met. Conditions for exclusivity include the FDAs determination that information relating to the use of a new drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits in that population, FDA making a written request for pediatric studies, and the applicant agreeing to perform, and reporting on, the requested studies within the statutory timeframe. Applications under the BPCA are treated as priority applications, with all of the benefits that designation confers. 
Fast Track Designation and Accelerated Approval 
 FDA is required to facilitate the development, and expedite the review, of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast track program, the 
 
14 
 
 sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the drug candidate. FDA must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsors request. Under the fast track program and FDAs accelerated approval regulations, FDA may approve a drug for a serious or life-threatening illness that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. 
 In clinical trials, a surrogate endpoint is a measurement of laboratory or clinical signs of a disease or condition that substitutes for a direct measurement of how a patient feels, functions or survives. Surrogate endpoints can often be measured more easily or more rapidly than clinical endpoints. A drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post-marketing compliance requirements, including the completion of Phase 4 or post-approval clinical trials to confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint. Failure to conduct required post-approval studies, or confirm a clinical benefit during post-marketing studies, will allow FDA to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis. All promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by FDA. 
 In addition to other benefits such as the ability to use surrogate endpoints and engage in more frequent interactions with FDA, FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track drugs NDA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides, and FDA approves, a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, FDAs time period goal for reviewing an application does not begin until the last section of the NDA is submitted. Additionally, the fast track designation may be withdrawn by FDA if FDA believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information 
 Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, trial sites and investigators, and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to discuss the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed in certain circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Once an NDA is approved, a product will be subject to certain post-approval requirements. For instance, FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. 
 AE reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, known as Phase 4 testing, REMS and surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or the FDA may place conditions on an approval that could restrict the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging and labeling procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after approval. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to 
 
15 
 
 assess compliance with cGMPs. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with cGMPs. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals or request product recalls if a company fails to comply with regulatory standards, if it encounters problems following initial marketing, or if previously unrecognized problems are subsequently discovered. 
 The Hatch-Waxman Act 
 Orange Book Listing 
 In seeking approval for a drug through an NDA, applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent whose claims cover the applicants product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDAs Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic competitors in support of approval of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA). An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown through bioequivalence testing to be therapeutically equivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, pre-clinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug, and can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. 
 The ANDA applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the FDAs Orange Book. Specifically, the applicant must certify that (i) the required patent information has not been filed; (ii) the listed patent has expired; (iii) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (iv) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA label does not contain (or carve out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired. A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved products listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit, or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant. 
 The ANDA application also will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired. 
 Exclusivity 
 Upon NDA approval of a new chemical entity or NCE, which is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been approved by FDA in any other NDA, that drug receives five years of marketing exclusivity during which FDA cannot receive any ANDA seeking approval of a generic version of that drug. Certain changes to a drug, such as the addition of a new indication to the package insert, are associated with a three-year period of exclusivity during which FDA cannot approval an ANDA for a generic drug that includes the change. An ANDA may be submitted one year before NCE exclusivity expires if a Paragraph IV certification is filed. If there is no listed patent in the Orange Book, there may not be a Paragraph IV certification, and, thus, no ANDA may be filed before the expiration of the exclusivity period. 
 
16 
 
Patent Term Extension 
 After NDA approval, owners of relevant drug patents may apply for up to a five-year patent extension. The allowable patent term extension is calculated as half of the drugs testing phase (the time between IND application and NDA submission) and all of the review phase (the time between NDA submission and approval up to a maximum of five years). The time can be shortened if FDA determines that the applicant did not pursue approval with due diligence. The total patent term after the extension may not exceed 14 years. For patents that might expire during the application phase, the patent owner may request an interim patent extension. An interim patent extension increases the patent term by one year and may be renewed up to four times. For each interim patent extension granted, the post-approval patent extension is reduced by one year. The director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office must determine that approval of the drug covered by the patent for which a patent extension is being sought is likely. Interim patent extensions are not available for a drug for which an NDA has not been submitted. 
Anti-Kickback, False Claims Laws 
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, several other types of state and federal laws have been applied to restrict certain general business and marketing practices in the pharmaceutical industry in recent years. These laws include anti-kickback statutes, false claims statutes and other statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federally financed healthcare programs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (PPACA) amended the intent element of the federal statute so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to commit a violation. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Violations of the anti-kickback statute are punishable by imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. 
 Federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid. This includes claims made to programs where the federal government reimburses, such as Medicaid, as well as programs where the federal government is a direct purchaser, such as when it purchases off the Federal Supply Schedule. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly inflating drug prices they report to pricing services, which in turn were used by the government to set Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates, and for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. In addition, certain marketing practices, including off-label promotion, may also violate false claims laws. Additionally, PPACA amended the federal Anti-Kickback Statute such that a violation of that statute can serve as a basis for liability under the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. 
 Other federal statutes pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse include the civil monetary penalties statute, which prohibits the offer or payment of remuneration to a Medicaid or Medicare beneficiary that the offerer or payor knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary to order a receive a reimbursable item or service from a particular supplier, and the additional federal criminal statutes created by the Health Insurance Portability 
 
17 
 
 and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which prohibits knowingly and willfully executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises any money or property owned by or under the control of any healthcare benefit program in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. 
 Other Federal and State Regulatory Requirements 
 Pursuant to PPACA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has issued a final rule that requires manufacturers of prescription drugs to collect and report information on certain payments or transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. The first reports were due in 2014 and must be submitted on an annual basis. The reported data were posted in searchable form on a public website on September 30, 2014, and will be posted on an annual basis. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties. 
 In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report certain expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products and to report gifts and payments to individual physicians in these states. Other states prohibit various other marketing-related activities. Still other states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs or marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Compliance with these laws is difficult and time consuming, and companies that do not comply with these state laws face civil penalties. 
 We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act (HITECH), and their respective implementing regulations, including the Final Omnibus Rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements on certain types of people and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAAs security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect. 
 If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, contractual damages, reputation harm, and diminished profits or future earnings, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 Also, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that our internal control policies and procedures will protect us from reckless or negligent acts committed by our employees, future distributors, partners, collaborators or agents. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could result in fines, penalties or prosecution and have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. Sales of pharmaceutical products depend significantly on the availability of third-party coverage and reimbursement. Third-party payors include government health administrative authorities, 
 
18 
 
 managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Although we currently believe that third-party payors will provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, these third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services. In addition, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products. We may need to conduct expensive clinical studies to demonstrate the comparative cost-effectiveness of our products. The product candidates that we develop may not be considered cost-effective. It is time consuming and expensive for us to seek coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Moreover, a payors decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive and profitable basis. 
 The marketability of any product candidates for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we or our collaborators receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. 
 By way of example, in March 2010, the PPACA was signed into law, which intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Among the provisions of the PPACA of importance to our potential drug candidates are: 
 

 | an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | an increase in the statutory minimum rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to 23.1% and 13.0% of the average manufacturer price for branded and generic drugs, respectively;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 50% point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for a manufacturers outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | extension of a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability to cover drugs dispensed to individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | expansion of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to additional individuals and by adding new mandatory eligibility categories for certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturers Medicaid rebate liability;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
19

 There have been judicial and Congressional challenges and amendments to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future, including the potential repeal of all or part of PPACA. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, starting in 2013, which will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our product candidates, if approved, and, accordingly, our financial operations. 
 We expect that the PPACA, as well as other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future, may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and lower reimbursement, and in additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government-funded programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our drugs. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products to the extent we choose to develop or sell any products outside of the United States. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country. 
 In the European Union (EU), member states require both regulatory clearances by the national competent authority and a favorable ethics committee opinion prior to the commencement of a clinical trial. Under the EU regulatory systems, marketing authorization applications may be submitted under either a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. We would be subject to the centralized process. Under the centralized procedure, pharmaceutical companies submit a single marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency. Once granted by the European Commission, a centralized marketing authorization is valid in all EU member states, as well as the EEA countries Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. By law, a company can only start to market a medicine once it has received a marketing authorization. 
 European Regulation of Clinical Trials and Grant of Marketing Authorization 
 Pharmaceutical products in the EU are subject to regulation under comprehensive legislation enacted by the European Commission in the European Medicines Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended. This directive is binding on all Member States together with ancillary legislation governing research. 
Clinical Trial Authorization 
 Clinical trials are regulated under European Council Directive 2001/20/EC (Clinical Trials Directive) on the implementation of GCP in the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products for human use. The Clinical Trials 
 
20 
 
 Directive requires the sponsor of an investigational medicinal product to obtain a clinical trial authorization (CTA), much like an IND in the United States, from the national competent authority of an EU Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. The application for CTA must satisfy detailed requirements for the protection of trial subjects including requirements relating to consent and specific rules for minors and adults unable to consent by reason of incapacity. The CTA application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the Council Directive and corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance, including the European Commission Communication 2010/C 82/01. A clinical trial may only be commenced after an Ethics Committee has given its approval. 
 A sponsor of a clinical trial must also follow certain procedures, including entering specified relevant information in the European trial database, EudraCT. In addition, Member States require that the manufacture and/or importation of investigational medicinal products be authorized. Sponsors of investigational medicinal products must ensure compliance with, among other things, GCP and good manufacturing practice (GMP) as well as requirements pertaining to safety reporting. 
 In April 2014, Regulation EU No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted to replace the Clinical Trials Directive. The Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify the current rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance. For instance, there will be a streamlined application procedure via a single entry pointan EU portal and database. Although the implementation date was originally intended to be the middle of 2016, as of January 2017, the Clinical Trials Regulation has yet to be implemented. Until such time as it is implemented, all clinical trials performed in the EU are required to be conducted in accordance with the Clinical Trials Directive. While the Clinical Trials Directive will be repealed on the day the Clinical Trials Regulation is implemented, the Clinical Trials Directive will apply three years from that date to CTA applications submitted prior to implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation. 
 Procedural Routes for Marketing Authorization 
 The European system for authorization of medicinal products for human use offers several routes: the centralized procedure, the decentralized procedure, and the mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU Member States as well as the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain categories of investigational products, including human products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer, AIDS, diabetes and neurodegenerative illness; orphan medicinal products; and medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes. Applications for marketing authorization for such medicines must be submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is generally responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. 
 The decentralized and mutual recognition procedures are applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products and are both based on the principle of recognition of a marketing authorization by one or more Member States. The decentralized procedure is available for applicants who wish to market a product in various EU Member States where such product has not received marketing approval in any EU Member State before. In this procedure, an application for marketing authorization is submitted simultaneously in several Member States, one of them being chosen as the Reference Member State. At the end of the procedure, national marketing authorizations are granted in the Reference and in the concerned Member States. The mutual recognition procedure is used when a medicinal product has already received a marketing authorization in one Member State and is compulsory to be marketed in a Member State other than that in which they were first authorized. Any national marketing authorization granted by an EU Member States national authority can be used to support an application for its mutual recognition by other Member States.

Standard for Approval of a Marketing Authorization 
 The objective of the EMA is the comprehensive evaluation of benefit/risk profile of a new medicinal product going through the centralized procedure. This evaluation involves showing that the product has significant efficacy and safety, together with a satisfactory plan for risk management post-marketing. The CHMP is the EMAs expert committee responsible for human medicinal products. The CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial review of EU-wide marketing authorization applications and for assessing modifications or extensions (variations) to an existing marketing authorization. It also considers the recommendations of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee on the safety of medicines on the market and when necessary, recommends to the European Commission changes to a medicines marketing authorization, or its suspension or withdrawal from the market. The marketing authorization application is similar to the NDA in the United States. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document (CTD), which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and non-clinical and clinical trial information. The main scientific principle used by the CHMP in the evaluation of medicinal products is the benefit/risk ratio based on quality, efficacy, safety, and risk management considerations. The CHMP assesses whether the data it reviews comply with the ICH-harmonized Good Practices published for GCP, GMP and good laboratory practice (GLP). The CHMP also considers whether studies concluding efficacy and safety of products have sufficient statistical power. 
 Other Regulatory Issues 
 An exemption to the rule requiring marketing authorization permits Member States of the EU to make a product available for compassionate use to patients with a chronically or seriously debilitating disease or whose disease is considered life threatening, such as cancer, and who cannot be treated satisfactorily by an authorized medicinal product. The medicinal product concerned must be undergoing clinical trials or the subject of application for marketing authorization. 
 Quality of the medicinal products in question is governed by the GMP Directive. This lays down the principles and guidelines of GMP for both marketed medicinal products and investigational products in clinical trials. The Directive obliges manufacturers to comply with GMP for an effective pharmaceutical quality assurance, quality control, systems for recording and reviewing complaints and a system for prompt recall of products in the distribution network. With regards to postmarketing safety of newly authorized products, the EMA is responsible for coordinating the Member States ongoing evaluation of benefit risk, supervision and pharmacovigilance of medicinal products. 
 The pharmacovigilance legislation imposes a duty on Member States to collect information on the risks of products with regards to patients or public health. That information must refer to adverse events arising from the use of the medicinal product within the terms of the marketing authorization as well as use outside the authorized indication and use associated with occupational exposure. 
 There is a similar obligation on the marketing authorization holder (MAH) to operate a robust pharmacovigilance system equivalent to that of the relevant Member State. The MAH must evaluate all safety and effectiveness information scientifically, consider the options for risk minimization and take appropriate measures as necessary. As part of the pharmacovigilance system, the MAH must have permanently and continuously an appropriately qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance, maintain a pharmacovigilance master file, operate a risk management system for each medicinal product, monitor the outcome of risk minimization measures contained in the risk management program and continually update the risk management system and monitor the pharmacovigilance system to determine whether there are new risks or changes to the risk-benefit profile of the product(s). 
 Two recent developments have been introduced which further expand the European regulatory framework: the Falsified Medicines Directive and the Pharmacovigilance Directive. The Falsified Medicines Directive obliges manufacturers of medicinal products to audit their suppliers of active substances to ensure compliance with 
 
22 
 
 GMP. It also introduces a new obligation on product manufacturers to inform the competent authority (e.g. MHRA) and the marketing authorization holder if they become aware that these products may be falsified, whether they are being distributed through the legitimate supply chain or by illegal means. The Pharmacovigilance Directive obliges marketing authorization holders to monitor the safety of authorized products and detect any change in their risk-benefit profile.
