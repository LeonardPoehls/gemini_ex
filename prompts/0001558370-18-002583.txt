 ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
 General
 We are the leading specialty retailer of men’s tailored clothing and the largest men’s formalwear provider in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada and help men dress for work and special occasions. We serve our customers through an expansive omni-channel network that includes over 1,400 locations in the U.S. and Canada as well as our branded e-commerce websites at www.menswearhouse.com, www.josbank.com, and www.josephabboud.com.    Our Brands and Products
 Our U.S. retail stores are operated under the Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank, Joseph Abboud and K&G brand names and are operated in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our Canadian stores are operated under the Moores brand name and operate in 10 Canadian provinces. As of February 3, 2018, the Company operated 1,477 stores throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico and Canada.  In addition, at February 3, 2018, we operated 38 retail dry cleaning, laundry and heirlooming facilities through MW Cleaners in Texas. These operations comprise our retail segment.  On February 28, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to divest our MW Cleaners business for approximately $18.0 million, subject to certain adjustments, and the transaction closed on March 3, 2018.  
 We also own and operate a factory located in New Bedford, Massachusetts that manufactures quality U.S. made tailored clothing primarily under the Joseph Abboud and Reserve labels consisting of designer suits (including custom suits), tuxedos, sport coats and slacks that we sell in our Men’s Wearhouse or Jos. A. Bank stores as well as our Joseph Abboud flagship store and via our e-commerce websites.  We also sell Joseph Abboud branded tailored clothing in our Moores stores, which is produced by a third party in Canada.
 Additionally, we operate an international corporate apparel business with operations in both the United Kingdom (“UK”) and the U.S. Our UK-based business is the largest provider of corporate apparel in the UK under the Dimensions, Alexandra and Yaffy brands.  In the U.S., our corporate apparel business operates under the Twin Hill brand name.  Our corporate apparel business provides corporate clothing uniforms and workwear to workforces through multiple channels including managed corporate accounts, catalogs and the internet at www.dimensions.co.uk, www.alexandra.co.uk, and www.twinhill.com.

 Retail Segment
 Overview
 In our retail segment, we offer our products and services primarily through our retail brands—Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank, Moores, Joseph Abboud, and K&G—and the internet at www.menswearhouse.com, www.josbank.com, and www.josephabboud.com. Men’s Wearhouse, Moores and K&G each operate as a house of brands carrying a wide selection of exclusive and non‑exclusive merchandise brands. Jos. A. Bank is a branded house where substantially all merchandise is sold under the exclusive Jos. A. Bank label. Joseph Abboud is our premium brand which is sold under various labels at Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores and in our Joseph Abboud flagship store in New York.  
 MW Cleaners is also included in the retail segment as these operations have not had a significant effect on our revenues or expenses. 
 In June 2015, we entered into an agreement with Macy’s, Inc. to operate men’s tuxedo rental shops inside Macy’s department stores. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, we reached an agreement with Macy’s to wind down these operations.  All 170 tuxedo shops within Macy’s closed in the second quarter of 2017.

 Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux and Moores
 Men’s Wearhouse and Moores target the male consumer (18 to 65 years old) by providing superior, personalized customer service and offering a broad selection of exclusive and non‑exclusive merchandise brands at regular and sale prices that we believe are competitive with specialty retailers and traditional department stores. Our merchandise includes suits, suit separates, sport coats, slacks, formalwear, business casual, denim, sportswear, outerwear, dress shirts, shoes and accessories in classic, modern and slim fits and in a wide range of sizes including a selection of “Big and Tall” product.
 Although basic styles comprise our core offerings, each season’s merchandise reflects current fit, fabric style and color trends. The inventory mix at our Men’s Wearhouse and Moores stores includes business, formalwear, business casual and casual merchandise designed to meet the demand of our customers. The broad merchandise selection creates increased sales opportunities by permitting a customer to purchase substantially all of his wardrobe and accessory requirements at our retail apparel stores. Based on our experience, we believe that the depth of selection of our merchandise offerings provides us with an advantage over our competitors.
 During fiscal 2016, we introduced a new collection of custom apparel consisting of suits, sport coats, slacks, shirts, tuxedos and vests, which are personalized to each customer’s specifications. In fiscal 2017, we experienced a significant increase in sales for custom clothing and believe it is a key growth initiative going forward.  See “Business Strategy” for additional information on the performance of custom clothing and other strategic initiatives for 2018 and beyond.
 We also offer a full selection of special occasion offerings including tuxedo and suit rental product (collectively, “rental product”). We believe our rental product broadens our customer base by drawing first‑time and younger customers into our stores.  During fiscal 2017, we experienced an increase in the consumer’s preference to purchase suits or formalwear for their special occasion needs instead of renting product.  We believe this trend is favorable for our business as customers who purchase rather than rent tend to have a higher lifetime value for our business.  Regardless of whether our customer chooses to purchase or rent their special occasion clothing, we believe we are well-positioned to meet our customers’ special occasion needs.
 At February 3, 2018, we operated 718 Men’s Wearhouse retail apparel stores in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. These stores are referred to as “Men’s Wearhouse stores” or “full line stores” that offer a full selection of retail merchandise and rental product. Men’s Wearhouse stores are primarily located in regional strip and specialty retail shopping centers or in freestanding buildings as we believe that men prefer direct and easy store access that enables our customers to park near the entrance of the store.
 At February 3, 2018, we also operated another 51 stores in 23 states branded as Men’s Wearhouse and Tux. These stores are referred to as “rental stores” and offer a full selection of rental product and a limited selection of retail merchandise, and are located primarily in regional malls and lifestyle centers.  Since 2013, we have closed 197 Men’s Wearhouse and Tux stores, consistent with our strategy and as we continued to experience a consumer driven shift of rental revenues to our full line stores located in close proximity to the rental stores.
 At February 3, 2018, we operated 126 Moores retail apparel stores in 10 Canadian provinces. Moores stores are primarily located in regional strip and specialty retail shopping centers.
 Jos. A. Bank
 Jos. A. Bank targets the male consumer (25 to 65 years old) emphasizing superior service, high quality tailored business and formal attire, substantially all of which is Jos. A. Bank branded product including our Reserve and 1905 labels. Jos. A. Bank merchandise consists of suits, suit separates, sport coats, slacks, formalwear, business casual, denim, sportswear, outerwear, dress shirts, shoes and accessories in primarily classic styles and in a wide range of sizes including a selection of “Big and Tall” product. Although the target gender and age of the Jos. A. Bank customer are similar to Men’s Wearhouse, we believe the Jos. A. Bank customer and the Men’s Wearhouse customer are distinct and, based on information from our loyalty programs, we believe that there is minimal overlap between the Jos. A. Bank customer and the Men’s Wearhouse customer.  
 Our merchandising strategy is focused on classic styling with attention to detail in quality materials and workmanship. Based on our experience, we believe that the depth of selection of our merchandise offerings provides us with an advantage over our competitors.  
 During fiscal 2016, we also introduced custom apparel at Jos. A. Bank consisting of suits, sport coats, slacks, shirts, tuxedos and vests, which are personalized to each customer’s specifications.  Similar to Men’s Wearhouse and Moores, we experienced a significant increase in sales for custom clothing and believe it is a key aspect of our business strategy.

 We also offer a full selection of special occasion rental product at Jos. A. Bank and believe our rental product offering provides the opportunity to broaden our customer base by drawing first‑time and younger customers into our stores.  As is the case at Men’s Wearhouse, we believe Jos. A. Bank is well-positioned to meet its customers’ special occasion needs, through retail clothing offerings, rental product or custom offerings.
 At February 3, 2018, we operated 491 Jos. A. Bank retail apparel stores in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Jos. A. Bank stores are primarily located in specialty retail centers. In addition, as of February 3, 2018, there are 14 franchise stores. 
 K&G
 K&G stores offer a more value‑oriented superstore approach that we believe appeals to the more price‑sensitive customer in the apparel market. K&G offers first‑quality, current‑season apparel and accessories comparable in quality to that of traditional department stores, at prices we believe are typically up to 60% below the regular prices charged by such stores. K&G’s merchandising strategy emphasizes broad assortments across all major categories of both men’s and women’s career and casual apparel in a wide range of sizes including “Big and Tall” and “Women’s plus sizes” as well as tailored clothing, dress furnishings, sportswear, accessories, shoes and children’s apparel. This merchandise selection, which includes exclusive and non‑exclusive merchandise brands, positions K&G to attract a wide range of customers in each of its markets.
 At February 3, 2018, we operated 90 K&G stores in 27 states, 86 of which offer women’s career apparel, sportswear, accessories, shoes and children’s apparel. K&G stores are “destination” stores located primarily in second generation strip shopping centers that are easily accessible from major highways and thoroughfares.
 Business Strategy
 Our plan for positioning Tailored Brands for long-term sustainable growth includes our strategy to tailor our products and services to our customers’ lifestyles.  In the near term, this plan includes:
· | Expanding our portfolio of exclusive offerings, particularly custom clothing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Increasing new customer acquisition and enhancing existing customer loyalty through brand-building marketing that educates consumers about our superior product and service experience; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Enhancing our omni‑channel capabilities.
--+-----------------------------------------

  Expanding Our Portfolio of Exclusive Offerings, Particularly Custom Clothing
 We believe that expanding the number of exclusive offerings that we carry will increase our sales and profitability. In particular, we believe our ability to make custom clothing, particularly custom suits, as easy and affordable to buy as “off-the-rack” tailored clothing represents an opportunity to grow our market share in men’s apparel. 
 In fiscal 2017, our custom clothing business more than doubled versus the prior year to over $100 million, or approximately 4% of retail clothing product net sales.  Our custom clothing offerings are available at all Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores locations with two price points: an entry-level offering and a premium offering.  Our custom clothing offering is designed to personalize both the clothing and the shopping experience and to foster a long-term relationship with our customers.  Our research shows that men who buy custom suits from us are more satisfied with their purchase, shop more frequently and spend more in a year than off-the-rack customers.  
 In 2018, we plan to accelerate the growth of our custom clothing business by increasing our advertising spending to more broadly promote our custom clothing offerings as well as improving our in-store presentation of our custom clothing offerings.
 We believe we have superior competitive advantages with respect to custom clothing because we have: 1) a convenient U.S. and Canada store footprint staffed by expert wardrobe consultants and tailors; 2) supply chain advantages with our owned factory that manufactures our premium custom clothing in the U.S. and strong relationships and scale advantages with foreign manufacturers for our entry level custom clothing; and 3) unique design capabilities creating exclusive brands and products for our customers.

 In addition to custom clothing, we plan to continue to focus on growth through product innovation.  This includes performance fabrics such as our Kenneth Cole AWEAR-TECH offerings available at Men’s Wearhouse and Moores stores and our Jos. A. Bank TravelTech offering.  We also plan to continue to develop brands that will resonate with millennial customers, such as our 1905 line at Jos. A. Bank and socially responsible brands including our “Awearness Kenneth Cole” at Men’s Wearhouse and Moores.  A contribution from all “Awearness Kenneth Cole” products sold goes toward helping veterans transition back into the workforce. 
 Increasing New Customer Acquisition and Enhancing Existing Customer Loyalty    During fiscal 2017, we delivered positive comparable sales for our retail brands as a whole, with Men’s Wearhouse comparable sales improving throughout the year and turning positive in our fourth quarter, and Jos. A. Bank reporting positive mid-single-digit comparable sales for the year.  
 We believe our strategy to engage more customers across all channels and to drive customer traffic helped us deliver improvement in comparable sales and we plan to build on these strategies.  For example, in 2018, we plan to continue to shift our marketing strategies to emphasize the reasons why men should shop with us.  We also expect to continue to dedicate a greater share of our marketing mix to digital channels to expand our marketing reach.  In addition, we plan to strengthen our company reputation for social responsibility and grow brand affinity through our National Suit Drive, Canadian Suit Drive, merchandise donations and social cause campaigns that resonate with our target customers including those that support our veterans and certain cancer prevention efforts.  
 We will continue to focus on our in-store experience to promote a more engaged, personalized shopping experience that features our wardrobe consultants who help men create their personal style.  We intend to build customer loyalty by gaining a greater understanding of our customer’s needs, helping him meet those needs, and giving him confidence in the way he looks. We have formalized a customer satisfaction measurement and feedback loop at the store level that elevates and standardizes the customer experience and focuses our stores on building long-term relationships with our customers.
 We also expect to promote our loyalty programs to encourage new members and entice existing members to shop with us more frequently. Through our loyalty programs, we reward our loyal customers and are able to leverage the data our customers share with us to deliver a relevant and engaging experience that considers their lifestyles and preferences.  
 Enhancing Our Omni‑channel Capabilities
 We plan to drive growth by providing an online sales experience that combines the advantages of our physical stores with an information-rich online shopping experience via our mobile-friendly websites and mobile applications. We are channel agnostic and want our customers to be able to shop whenever, wherever and however they choose across all channels in a seamless, connected way.  As a result, we are focused on improving our omni-channel strategies, as described in more detail below, to provide our customers with more options to make their shopping experience easy. 
 Our current omni-channel capabilities include ‘virtualized inventory’ that enables our customers to order items through our websites when not available at the store. We can also ship online purchases from our stores to further enhance our customer’s online shopping experience and reduce delivery times. In 2016, we expanded our distribution center in Houston, Texas, to facilitate our ability to achieve delivery within two business days for most U.S. and Canada orders for Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank. 
 In 2017, we made significant progress advancing our e-Commerce capabilities, including refining product recommendations and introducing a new guided shopping experience called “Look Finder”.  These enhancements have increased both conversion rates and average order values. 
 In 2018, we intend to continue to build on delivering personalized, high-tech, high-touch service online.  We also expect to continue to make investments in technologies, business processes and personnel to deepen our customer relationships, enhance the customer journey and increase our share of their closet.
 Customer Service and Marketing
 Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank, Joseph Abboud and Moores sales personnel are trained as consultants to provide customers with assistance and advice on their apparel needs, including product style, color coordination, fabric choice and garment fit. Wardrobe consultants are encouraged to offer guidance to the customer at each stage of the decision‑making process, making every effort to earn the customer’s confidence and to create a professional relationship that will continue beyond the initial visit.

 K&G stores are designed to allow customers to select and purchase apparel by themselves. For example, each merchandise category is clearly marked and organized by size, and suits are specifically tagged as a means of further assisting customers to easily select their styles and sizes. K&G employees are also available to assist customers with merchandise selection, including correct sizing.
 Substantially all of our retail apparel stores offer tailoring services to facilitate timely alterations at a reasonable cost to customers. In addition, we utilize our regional tailor shops, which receive merchandise from stores to perform tailoring services and return the merchandise to the selling store for customer pickup.
 We offer our “Perfect Fit” loyalty program to our Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux and Moores customers. In October 2015, we launched the “Bank Account” loyalty program for Jos. A. Bank customers, which offers the same benefits and operates in the same manner as the “Perfect Fit” loyalty program. Under the loyalty programs, customers receive points for purchases. Points are generally equivalent to dollars spent on a one‑for‑one basis, excluding any sales tax dollars. Upon reaching 500 points, customers are issued a $50 rewards certificate that they may use to make purchases at our stores or online. All customers who register for our loyalty programs are eligible to participate and earn points for purchases. We believe that the loyalty programs facilitate our ability to cultivate long‑term relationships with our customers.
 Our advertising strategy primarily consists of television, email, online (including social media), mobile, direct mail, telemarketing and bridal shows. In fiscal 2017, we updated our advertising messaging, placing more emphasis on our product offerings and the customer experience, including our wardrobe consultants and tailoring services, and less emphasis on promotional messaging. We also plan to continue to dedicate a greater share of our marketing mix to digital channels to target a broader customer segment.  We believe our updated advertising strategy is the most effective means of both attracting and reaching potential new customers as well as reinforcing the positive attributes of our various brands with our existing customer base. In addition, for Jos. A. Bank, we periodically distribute a catalog to communicate the Jos. A. Bank image, to provide customers with fashion guidance in coordinating outfits and to generate traffic in all of Jos. A. Bank’s sales channels.
 Purchasing and Distribution
 For the Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores brands and, to a lesser extent, our K&G brand, our vertical direct sourcing model with third‑party manufacturers covers design, product development, manufacturing, testing, quality control, and all necessary logistics required to get merchandise from the factory to the sales floor. We purchase merchandise and rental product from a broad base of manufacturers and do not believe that the loss of any manufacturer would cause a significant negative impact to us. We have no material long‑term merchandise manufacturing contracts and typically transact business on a purchase order‑by‑purchase order basis either directly with manufacturers and fabric mills or with trading companies. We have developed long‑term and reliable relationships with most of our direct manufacturers and fabric mills, which we believe provides stability, quality and price leverage. We also have a subsidiary in Hong Kong to facilitate our sourcing efforts for our products. Furthermore, we work with trading companies that support our relationships with manufacturers for our direct-sourced merchandise and contract agent offices that provide administrative functions on our behalf. The agent offices provide all quality control inspections and ensure that our operating procedures manuals are adhered to by our manufacturers.    We are committed to social responsibility and environmental stewardship and have long supported the work of international agencies and organizations that seek to implement internationally recognized standards for labor practices.  We have developed and implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct that sets forth the compliance requirements that all suppliers must meet to do business with us. Our risk management department oversees our factory compliance efforts, and we also use the services of an outside audit company to conduct regular audits of factories we use.  We strive to work collaboratively with our clothing factories to positively influence them to embed compliance into their daily operations.  We also maintain standards and guidelines related to human trafficking and slavery and our managers with direct responsibility for supply chain management have attended training, particularly with respect to mitigating these risks within the supply chain.  For additional information regarding our commitment to improving factory working conditions, please review our 2017 Sustainability Report, which is available at ir.tailoredbrands.com.
 In fiscal 2017, our retail brands sourced approximately 66% of direct sourced merchandise from Asia (39% from China) while 11% was sourced in the U.S. (primarily from our U.S. factory), 6% was sourced in Mexico and 17% was sourced in other regions. Substantially all of our foreign purchases are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. 
 In 2016, to optimize our shipping and freight costs for our Men’s Wearhouse and Jos. A. Bank brands, we began the process of transitioning to a regional distribution center approach to leverage the geographic locations of our main distribution centers in Texas and Maryland, as well as the hub facilities described below.  In early 2017, we commenced with our regional distribution center strategy.  Merchandise received into these regional distribution centers is either placed in back‑stock or allocated to a store for shipping. In the majority of our larger markets, we also have separate hub distribution facilities or space within certain stores used as redistribution facilities for their respective areas. Merchandise for Moores is distributed to the stores from our distribution center in Montreal, Quebec. The majority of merchandise for our K&G stores is direct shipped by suppliers to the stores with the remainder of K&G merchandise being managed via a third‑party logistics firm.

 Our rental product is located in our Houston, Texas distribution center and in six additional distribution facilities located in the U.S. (five) and Canada (one). The six additional distribution facilities also receive limited quantities of retail product, primarily formalwear accessories, that is sold in our Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank and Moores stores.
 All retail merchandise and new rental product transported from suppliers to our distribution facilities is done so via common carrier or on a dedicated fleet of long‑haul vehicles. This dedicated fleet is also used to transport product from our distribution centers to the hub facilities and a fleet of leased or owned smaller vehicles is used to transport product from the hub facilities to our stores within a given geographic region.
 Competition
 We compete against a broad spectrum of other men’s clothing stores. Our primary competitors include traditional department stores, other specialty men’s clothing stores, online retailers, online formalwear rental providers, off‑price retailers, manufacturer‑owned and independently‑owned outlet stores, independently-owned formalwear rental stores, and all of their respective e-commerce channels. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the men’s apparel market are merchandise assortment, quality, value, garment fit, merchandise presentation, store location and customer service, including on‑site tailoring.
 We believe that our merchandise offerings, including exclusive brands and custom clothing, and emphasis on customer service distinguish us from other retailers. Certain of our competitors (principally department stores) may be larger and may have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have and therefore may have certain competitive advantages.
 Corporate Apparel 
 Overview
 Our international corporate apparel business operates under the Dimensions, Alexandra and Yaffy brands primarily in the UK and Europe, and Twin Hill in the U.S., and provides corporate clothing uniforms and workwear to workforces. We offer our corporate apparel clothing products through multiple channels including managed corporate accounts, catalogs and the internet at www.dimensions.co.uk, www.alexandra.co.uk, and www.twinhill.com. We offer a wide variety of customer branded apparel such as shirts, blouses, trousers, skirts and suits as well as a wide range of other products from aprons to safety vests to high visibility police outerwear. With respect to our managed contracts, we generally provide complete management of our customers’ corporate clothing programs. Customer Service and Marketing
 Our customer base includes companies and organizations in the airline, retail grocery, retail, banking, quick service restaurants, car rental, distribution, travel and leisure, postal, security, healthcare and public sectors. Sector characteristics and economics tend to impact the corporate wear requirements of our individual customers. For example, retail customers typically have high staff turnover levels resulting in large replenishment volumes and significant seasonal demand, while banking customers generally have lower turnover and replenishment requirements but refresh or rebrand uniforms more frequently. 
 Our managed contract customers are generally organizations with larger numbers of uniform-wearing employees or those that use uniforms as a form of brand identity. We have long established relationships with many of the UK’s top employers and we currently maintain approximately 30 managed accounts with an average account size greater than 15,000 wearers. 
 Under our managed contracts, we take responsibility for dressing our customers’ employees and are the exclusive supplier of corporate wear to many of our customers. Because of the nature of the managed contract model, we ensure that we are fully involved in all of our customers’ uniform requirements, from daily replenishment requirements to longer term rebranding plans and wider corporate wear strategy. As a result, our relationship and level of interaction with our customers is generally far deeper and more embedded than conventional customer‑supplier relationships.
 Managed contracts are generally awarded through a request for proposal or tender process for multi‑year contracts. Our teams continually monitor market opportunities to obtain access to such contracts. Regular contact with corporate wear buyers is supplemented with mail campaigns, attendance at trade fairs and trade magazine advertisements. From time to time, we provide each managed contract customer with a specific account manager who often works one or two days a week on‑site at our larger customers’ offices. In addition to maintaining customer requirements, the account manager is also responsible for suggesting and implementing ways of improving the customer’s corporate wear process.

 Our catalogs are distributed electronically, via mail and by sales representatives to current and potential customers. The catalogs offer a full range of our products and offer further branding or embellishment of most products ordered. Catalog orders can be placed via phone, mail, fax or direct contact with our sales representatives and, in the U.S., via client‑specific websites. Our UK e‑commerce platforms also allow online ordering via our websites and provide 24‑hour functionality, with a full list of our products and their details. Our typical catalog customers are small to medium sized organizations with a relatively smaller number of employees or organizations where brand differentiation is not imperative.  In addition, we regularly develop dedicated websites for our corporate clients for use by their employees in ordering their company specific corporate wear.
 Merchandising
 In our corporate apparel business, we work with our customers to create custom apparel programs designed to support and enhance their respective brands. Our comprehensive apparel collections, including basic apparel categories such as shirts, blouses, trousers, skirts and suits as well as a wide range of other products from aprons to safety vests to high visibility police outerwear, feature designs with sizes and fits that meet the performance needs of our customers’ employees and utilize the latest technology in long‑wearing fabrications. Career wear, casual wear and workwear make up an increasingly significant portion of the product mix as service industry customers continue to grow.
 Under our managed contracts, our customers work with our in‑house design and technical teams to design and develop uniforms or other corporate wear that creates strong brand identity. We utilize our management information and garment tracking system to highlight trends, identify issues and provide benchmark data for the customer at all levels from individual wearer to enterprise‑wide. This system also allows us to identify potential cost savings and develop solutions on behalf of our customers and to respond quickly to trends or other changing needs.
 With respect to our UK catalog and internet operations, customers can design an off‑the‑rack program that provides custom alterations and embroidery on any of our standard, ready‑to‑wear clothing. We work with such customers to create a distinctive, branded program that may include the addition of a company logo or other custom trim.
 Purchasing and Distribution
 All corporate apparel garment production is outsourced to third‑party manufacturers, including fabric mills, through our direct sourcing programs. We have developed long‑term relationships with most of our direct manufacturers and fabric mills, which we believe provides stability, quality and reliability. We do not have any material long‑term contracts with our manufacturers and we do not believe that the loss of any manufacturer would significantly impact us. We work with contract agent offices that support our relationships with our direct source suppliers and provide administrative functions on our behalf.  In addition, the agent offices assist with quality control inspections and ensure that our manufacturers adhere to our operating procedures manuals.  Also, we operate a dedicated liaison office in Bangladesh to perform these functions.
 During 2017, approximately 65% of our corporate wear product purchases was sourced in Asia (primarily China, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Indonesia) while approximately 35% was sourced from Europe and other regions. Our foreign purchases from Asia are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, while our purchases from Europe and other regions are negotiated and paid for in British pounds or Euros.
 As a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative (“ETI”) since 2007, our UK-based supply chain operations have adopted the internationally recognized ETI Base Code of labor practice as part of their efforts to improve working conditions and uphold human rights in an environmentally friendly workplace for the benefit of manufacturers.  In addition our UK operations have written and published on their website their Modern Slavery Statement in accordance with the UK’s Modern Slavery Act of 2015.  
 To oversee compliance with our Supplier Code of Conduct, we use internal resources as well as third party companies to audit the factories producing our garments. We strive to work collaboratively with clothing factories to positively influence them to embed compliance into their daily operations.
 Corporate apparel merchandise is received into our distribution facilities located in Long Eaton and Glasgow for the UK operations and Houston, Texas and Bakersfield, California for U.S. operations. Customer orders are dispatched to the customer or individual wearers employed by the customer via common carrier or pursuant to other arrangements specified by the customer.
 Competition
 Our UK corporate apparel group provides workwear and uniforms to more UK employees than any of our corporate apparel competitors, which consist mostly of smaller, niche providers or companies that focus more on catalog business. The U.S. corporate wear market is more fragmented with several U.S. competitors being larger and having more resources than Twin Hill. We believe that the competitive factors in the corporate wear market are merchandise assortment, quality, price, lead times, customer service and delivery capabilities. We believe that our proven capability in the provision of corporate apparel programs to businesses and organizations of all sizes alongside our catalog and internet operations position us well with our existing customers and should enable us to continue to gain new catalog accounts and managed contracts.

 Seasonality
 Our sales and net earnings are subject to seasonal fluctuations and may vary by brand. Our rental product revenues are heavily concentrated in the second and third quarters (prom and wedding season) while the fourth quarter is the seasonal low point.  With respect to corporate apparel sales and operating results, seasonal fluctuations are not significant but the acquisition of new customers or existing customer decisions to rebrand or revise their corporate wear programs can cause significant variations in period results. Because of these fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year. Trademarks and Service Marks
 We are the owner in the U.S. and selected other countries of the numerous trademarks and service marks we use including, without limitation, MEN’S WEARHOUSE, MW MEN’S WEARHOUSE (and design), JOS. A. BANK, and JOSEPH ABBOUD and of U.S. and foreign registrations for such marks.  Our rights in the MEN’S WEARHOUSE, JOS. A. BANK, JOSEPH ABBOUD, and other marks and their respective variations are a significant part of our business, as the marks have become well known through our use of the marks in connection with our retail and formalwear rental services and products (both in store and online) and our advertising campaigns.  We are also the owner of various other trademarks and service marks, and corresponding trademark registrations in the U.S., Canada and abroad under which our stores and corporate apparel business operate or which are used to label the products we sell or rent. We intend to maintain and protect our marks and the related registrations.
 We also license the JOSEPH ABBOUD brand to certain third parties for limited products in the U.S. and Canada, and for a broader range of products in select countries abroad.
 We are the licensee for certain designer labels on various products such as men’s suits, men’s formalwear or men’s shirts. We generally pay a royalty for the use of the label, based on cost for the relevant product or a percentage of related sales. We monitor the performance of these licensed labels compared to their cost and may elect to selectively terminate any license, as provided in the particular agreement. 
 Employees
 At February 3, 2018, we had approximately 21,000 employees, consisting of approximately 18,600 in the U.S. and 2,400 in foreign countries, of which approximately 15,400 were full‑time employees. Seasonality affects the number of part‑time employees as well as the number of hours worked by full‑time and part‑time personnel.
 At February 3, 2018, approximately 660 of our employees at the factory located in New Bedford, Massachusetts are members of Unite Here, a New England based labor union. The current union contract expires in April 2019.  At February 3, 2018, approximately 25 of our employees at our distribution center located in Quebec, Canada are members of Service Employees Union, Local 800. The current union contract expires in April 2018.
 Also, approximately 230 employees working in the Jos. A. Bank Hampstead, Maryland tailoring overflow shop and distribution centers are represented by the Mid‑Atlantic Regional Joint Board, Local 806. The current union contract expires in February 2020. Lastly, approximately 100 Jos. A. Bank sales associates in New York City and four surrounding New York counties are represented by Local 340, New York New Jersey Regional Joint Board, Workers United.  Our most recent collective bargaining agreement covering these employees expires in April 2020.
 We believe our relationship with our union and non-union employees is good and we have no reason to believe that we will experience any interruption in our business upon the expiration of these collective bargaining agreements.  At Tailored Brands, we strive every day to create a safe and inclusive workplace and work to create a culture that fosters the needs of our diverse employee family.
