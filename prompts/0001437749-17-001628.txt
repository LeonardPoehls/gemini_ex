Significant Events
 
The filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended January 25, 2016 (“Fiscal 2016”) and the future filing of Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended May 16, 2016, August 8, 2016 and October 31, 2016 have been delayed as a result of the voluntary filing for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United Bankruptcy Code as described below under the heading “Chapter 11 Reorganization” and the Company’s lack of financial resources to address the regulatory requirements. We expect to file these Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for such periods on or about February 3, 2017.
Chapter 11 Reorganization
 
On September 28, 2011, the Company filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (“Bankruptcy Code”) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Arizona (the “Bankruptcy Court”), in the proceeding titled In re: Star Buffet, Inc., Case No.2:11-bk-27518-GBN (the “Chapter 11 Case”). The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Summit Family Restaurants Inc. (“Summit”), also filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 on September 29, 2011 in the Bankruptcy Court, in the proceeding titled In re: Summit Family Restaurants Inc., Case No. 2:11-bk-27713-GBN. The cases for Star Buffet, Inc. and Summit Family Restaurants Inc. (collectively the “Debtors”) were consolidated and jointly administered. None of the Company’s other subsidiaries were included in the bankruptcy filings. The Debtors continued to operate their businesses as “debtors-in-possession” under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.  Under the Bankruptcy Code, certain claims against the Debtors that were in existence prior to the filing of the bankruptcy petition were stayed during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Reorganization.  
 
On December 17, 2012, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation Order”) confirming the Company’s plan of reorganization (the “Plan”), which provided for the payment in full of all approved claims. A copy of the Confirmation Order and the Plan as confirmed are attached as Exhibits 2.1 and 2.2, to the Company’s Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 20, 2012. The Plan became effective on January 17, 2013 and the Company emerged from bankruptcy. The payment obligations under the Plan were estimated to be in excess of $10 million.  The Plan provided for these obligations to be discharged from operating income derived from the restaurants operated by its affiliates, an exit loan of $300,000 from Suzanne H. Wheaton, the wife of CEO Robert E. Wheaton, and proceeds from sale of certain restaurant properties.

As of January 25, 2016, the Company has reduced its liabilities subject to compromise to zero and booked the remaining creditor claim As Other Long-Term Liabilities except for the current portion. On October 14, 2016, the Company settled the final unsecured creditor claim for $900,000. On December 7, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court entered into a Final Decree and Order Closing the Bankruptcy Case of Star Buffet, Inc.
 
Overview
 
Star Buffet, Inc. was incorporated on July 28, 1997 as a Delaware corporation to operate as a multi-concept restaurant holding company. At January 25, 2016 it owned and operated 21 full-service restaurants. The Company as of January 23, 2017 owns and operates 24 full-service restaurants located throughout the United States. During the Fiscal 2016, the Company also had three closed restaurants, one closed for remodeling and repositioning, one leased to a third-party operator and one used as a warehouse. The Company’s restaurants operate under trade names including 4B’s, JB’s, Casa Bonita and BuddyFreddys. The Company's restaurants are located in Arkansas, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. The Company has an executive and accounting office in Scottsdale, Arizona and an accounting office in Salt Lake City, Utah. 
Recent Developments
 
The Company continues to evaluate the local geographic markets in which it operates and individual restaurant units for trends and changes in operating metrics. The Company may rebrand restaurants where management believes that the local market remains desirable but that the existing brand is not performing well. The Company continues to explore the expansion of its non-buffet brands as those recently have generally performed better. Our management believes the Company will generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support its operations and, together with the proceeds from the sale of certain of its properties, to pay its scheduled debt repayments. 
 
On April 18, 2016 the Company purchased property in Missoula, Montana. The Company opened a 4B’s restaurant on November 23, 2016 on the property.
 
On May 3, 2016 the Company opened a Whistle Junction restaurant in Keystone, South Dakota. This seasonal restaurant was closed on October 2, 2016. The Company intends to reopen next May.
 
On May 16, 2016 the Company opened a Finnegan’s Restaurant in Kalispell, Montana which is operated by our 4B’s brand.
 
On August 22, 2016 the Company opened a 4B’s Restaurant in Billings, Montana. 
 
On November 9, 2016, the Robert E. Wheaton and Suzanne H. Wheaton personally guaranteed loan for $450,000 to finance the Missoula remodel was funded.
 
On December 7, 2016 the Company received the Final Decree from the bankruptcy court closing the bankruptcy case.
 
Business Strategy
 
The Company’s business strategy is to operate a broadly diversified portfolio of well-established, family-oriented restaurants throughout the southeastern and western United States. The Company believes that a broad, diversified business base combined with a low field and corporate overhead cost structure can result in consistently positive cash flows.
Segment and Related Reporting
 
All of the brands the Company operates are in the U.S. within the full-service dining industry and provide similar products to similar customers and therefore, are considered to be one segment for reporting purposes. The brands also possess similar economic characteristics, resulting in similar long-term expected financial performance characteristics. Sales to external customers are derived principally from food and beverage sales. We do not rely on any major customers as a source of sales. We believe we meet the criteria for aggregating our operating segments into a single reporting segment.

Growth Strategy
 
The Company has indicated that it plans moderate growth based primarily through acquisitions or re-opening existing closed stores. The Company supplements its program of acquisitions with the purchase of restaurant properties that can be converted to the Company’s existing brands and minority investments in, or strategic alliances with, other restaurant chains. 

● | Acquisitions. The Company believes that a number of acquisition opportunities exist in restaurant segments that include buffets, cafeterias, family dining and steakhouses. The Company believes that many restaurants in these segments are privately owned and may be available for acquisition particularly when the owners decide to retire. Other restaurants may become available for purchase when corporate owners decide to convert from a company store to a franchisor business model or when a company is faced with a financial reorganization.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Restaurant Conversions. In recent years, a number of chains in the family dining and budget steakhouse segments of the restaurant industry have experienced operational difficulties and declining performance. The Company believes that these difficulties are the result of increasing competition from national casual dining and steakhouse chains which offer superior product quality and service at competitive prices. Many of these restaurants and steakhouses occupy desirable locations that the Company believes can be acquired and converted to one of its concepts at lower prices or leased at lower rates when compared to the cost of new construction.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Minority Investments and Strategic Alliances. The Company intends to seek minority investments in, or strategic alliances with, other restaurant chains. The Company believes that these investments can provide an attractive opportunity for the Company and may facilitate the acquisition of restaurants at a later date.

Competition
 
The Company competes on the basis of the quality and value of food products offered, price, service, location, ambiance and overall dining experience. The Company’s competitors include a large and diverse group of restaurant chains and individually owned restaurants. The number of restaurants with operations similar to those of the Company has grown considerably in recent years. As the Company and its principal competitors expand operations in various geographic areas, competition can be expected to increase. 
Government Regulation
 
The restaurant industry is subject to extensive federal, state, local and international laws and regulations. The development and operation of restaurants depend to a significant extent on the selection and acquisition of suitable sites, which are subject to building, zoning, land use, environmental, traffic and other regulations and requirements. We are subject to licensing and regulation by state and local authorities relating to health, sanitation, safety and fire standards and the sale of alcoholic beverages. We are subject to laws and regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, including regulations regarding product safety, nutritional content and menu labeling. We are subject to federal and state laws governing minimum wages, unionization and other labor issues. These include the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 and requirements concerning overtime, paid or family leave, tip credits, working conditions and safety standards. They also include the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which requires among other things the preparation of Form I-9 to verify that employees are authorized to accept employment in the United States. Future changes to U.S. immigration laws may result in increased costs of compliance in the solicitation, hiring, and ongoing employment of employees, and correspondingly increase our operating costs. We are also reviewing the potential impacts of new laws associated with health care passed by various state and local governments. 
 
We also are subject to federal and state laws which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation. New or changing laws and regulations relating to union organizing rights and activities may impact our operations at the restaurant level and increase our labor costs.
 
We are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge, emission and disposal of hazardous materials. There also has been increasing focus by United States governmental authorities on other environmental matters, such as climate change, the reduction of greenhouse gases and water consumption. This increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating a yet to be specified array of environmental matters, such as the emission of greenhouse gases, where “cap and trade” initiatives could effectively impose a tax on carbon emissions. Legislative, regulatory or other efforts to combat climate change or other environmental concerns could result in future increases in the cost of raw materials, taxes, transportation and utilities, which could decrease our operating profits and necessitate future investments in facilities and equipment.
 
We are subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of governments and industry groups worldwide have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers, financial information (including credit card numbers), and health information. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly, and any failure or perceived failure to comply with those laws or any breach of our systems could harm our reputation or lead to litigation, which could adversely affect our financial condition.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company's business is moderately seasonal in nature. For the majority of the Company’s restaurants, the highest volume periods are in the Company’s first and second fiscal quarters.
Employees
 
As of January 23, 2017 the Company employed approximately 793 persons, of whom approximately 788 were restaurant employees. Restaurant employees include salaried management and both full-time and part-time workers paid on an hourly basis. No Company employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes that its relations with its employees are generally good.
