Overview
 
Nevada Gold & Casinos, Inc., a Nevada corporation (the “Company,” “we” or “us”), was formed in 1977 and, since 1994, has been primarily a gaming company involved in financing, developing, owning and operating gaming properties and projects.
 
Our current gaming facility operations are located in the United States of America (the “U.S.”), specifically in the states of Nevada, Washington and South Dakota.
 
We operate a portfolio of nine mini-casinos in Washington State (“Washington”) which include restaurants, bars and approximately 120 table games. We acquired these operations in three separate transactions between 2009 and 2011. In 2012, we acquired all of the shares of A.G. Trucano, Son and Grandsons, Inc. (“South Dakota”), a slot machine route operation in Deadwood, South Dakota currently consisting of approximately 658 slot machines in 16 locations. In December 2015, we acquired Club Fortune Casino in Henderson, Nevada. It has approximately 475 slot machines, seven table games and a poker room, two bars, an entertainment lounge, a William Hill sports book, a café, a snack bar, and a gift shop.
 
We sold the Colorado Grande Casino in 2012 for $3.1 million and have a note receivable from the buyer with a balance of $0.4 million as of April 30, 2017.
 
We have three business segments and Corporate: Washington, South Dakota, and Nevada. For a summary of financial information concerning these segments, please refer to the information provided in Segment Reporting footnote in our consolidated financial statements.
 
Objective and Strategies
 
Our primary business objective is to increase returns to shareholders through appreciation in the value of our common shares. To achieve this objective, we intend to grow our assets and our earnings by following three business strategies:

- | enhancing the return from, and the value of, the gaming properties in which we own interests;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | acquiring or developing additional gaming properties; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------


- | assisting in finding financing, developing and/or managing of, or providing consulting services to, gaming projects and operating properties.

Current Casino Operations
 
Washington
 
On May 12, 2009, we acquired three mini-casinos in the state of Washington for $15.75 million. The transaction was funded with available cash and $4.0 million note issued to the sellers. The three mini-casinos are Crazy Moose Casino in Pasco, Coyote Bob's Casino in Kennewick, and Crazy Moose Casino in Mountlake Terrace. We believe that Crazy Moose Casino in Mountlake Terrace attracts customers from the greater Seattle area whereas Crazy Moose Casino in Pasco and Coyote Bob’s Casino, located in the southeast region of Washington State, attract customers from Walla Walla, southeastern Washington and northeastern Oregon.
 
On July 23, 2010, we acquired six additional mini-casinos and a related administrative center, for $11.07 million, which was funded with $6.0 million in cash and $5.07 million financed by the prior owner’s senior debt holder. These locations were acquired through bankruptcy proceedings. The six mini-casinos are Silver Dollar Casinos in SeaTac, Renton, and Bothell, Golden Nugget Casino in Tukwila (which was subsequently sold in 2015), Club Hollywood Casino in Shoreline, and Royal Casino in Everett. The properties are located in the Seattle area, and we believe that these casinos attract customers from the greater Seattle area and western Washington.
 
On July 18, 2011, we acquired the Red Dragon in Mountlake Terrace, Washington for $1.25 million. This transaction was financed with $400,000 in cash, $500,000 in our common stock and $350,000 in two promissory notes payable to the seller. We believe that this location attracts customers from the Seattle area and western Washington.
 
With these three acquisitions we have become the largest operator of mini-casinos in the state of Washington with nine such facilities, which represents approximately 18% of the state's active mini-casinos. Each location includes a full service restaurant, a bar and a maximum of 15 table games. In addition to Player Banked Poker, the table games offered include Pai Gow poker, Baccarat, Spanish 21, Blackjack-Double Action, Ultimate Hold’em, Player’s Edge, Three and Four Card Poker and High Card Flush. New games are frequently introduced and traditional “pull tabs” are also allowed. Our combined Washington operations provide approximately 120 table games and employ approximately 1,050 people.

We own the land and building at Crazy Moose in Pasco, and Coyote Bob’s in Kennewick. Our other seven locations are operated in leased facilities.
 
South Dakota
 
On January 27, 2012, we completed the acquisition of all shares of A.G. Trucano, Son & Grandsons, Inc. for $5.1 million. The transaction was financed by $3.2 million in cash, $25,000 in our common stock, and $1.9 million in three promissory notes payable to the sellers.
 
The South Dakota operations consist of a slot machine route operator that has been in business since the legalization of gaming in South Dakota in 1989. As of April 30, 2017, we operate approximately 658 slot machines in approximately 16 locations in Deadwood, South Dakota, which represents about 20% of the total number of slot machines in that market. Deadwood is a town of 1,300 residents located in Black Hills, in the southwest corner of South Dakota. Deadwood attracts over a million visitors each year and is a one hour drive from Mount Rushmore and 40-minute drive from Rapid City, South Dakota. Initiated in 1989, Deadwood was the third jurisdiction in the United States to host legalized gambling. Our South Dakota operations employ approximately 26 people.
 
Club Fortune Casino
 
In December 2015, we acquired Club Fortune Casino in Henderson, Nevada. It has approximately 475 slot machines, seven table games and a poker room, two bars, an entertainment lounge, a William Hill sports book, a café, a snack bar, and a gift shop. Henderson’s population is approximately 278,000 and is part of the Las Vegas metropolitan area. The purchase price for the acquisition, exclusive of working capital, was $14,159,623 and 1,190,476 shares of common stock of the Company for a total purchase price of $16,362,004. The acquisition was financed pursuant to an expansion of the Company’s existing Credit Agreement with Mutual of Omaha Bank. Club Fortune employs approximately 196 people.
Colorado Land
 
Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Gold Mountain Development, LLC, we owned approximately 268 acres of undeveloped land in the vicinity of Black Hawk and Central City, Colorado. On April 8, 2013, we signed a one year option agreement, with two one year extensions to sell the land for an initial sale price of $1.1 million plus $118 per day after April 8, 2013. On April 22, 2016, we executed an amendment to the option agreement for the sale of the vacant land for a purchase price of $750,000. In connection with the transaction, we recorded a non-cash impairment of $350,000 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. We received a $75,000 down payment, which is included in other long-term liabilities on our balance sheet, and financed the balance at 5% interest only, with interest payable monthly, and a balloon payment of $675,000 due April 30, 2019. The transaction was accounted for under the deposit method, recording the down payment as a liability and deferring the recognition of the sale until the buyer’s investment is at least 20% of the initial purchase price.
Colorado Grande Casino – Cripple Creek, Colorado
 
On May 25, 2012, we sold substantially all assets, including any rights in the Colorado Grande name and gaming-related liabilities, of the Colorado Grande Casino to G Investments, LLC (“GI”). Under the terms of the agreement, the buyer agreed to pay us $3.1 million, of which $800,000 was paid in cash and $2.3 million will be paid through a five year, 6% interest rate promissory note (the “GI Note”). Please see Note 4 of our consolidated financial statements.
Previous Projects
 
On an annual basis, we review each of our notes receivable to evaluate whether collection is still probable. In our analysis, we review the economic feasibility and the current financial, legislative and development status of the project. If our analysis indicates that the project is no longer economically feasible, the note receivable will be written down to its estimated fair value.
Buena Vista Rancheria of Me-Wuk Indians; Ione, Amador County, California
 
We have a note receivable for $4.6 million from B. V. Oro, LLC from the 2008 sale of our 40% interest in Buena Vista Development Company, LLC. The receivable was fully reserved in 2012.

In 2004, we advanced $3.2 million to Big City Capital, LLC for the development of gaming/entertainment projects. The receivable was fully reserved as of 2012 and $1.6 million was written off in 2017.
Regulation and Licensing
 
Washington
 
The gaming legislation in Washington State is codified in chapter 9.46 of the Revised Code of Washington (“RCW”) which stipulates the Washington State Gambling Commission (the “WA Gambling Commission”) to be the regulator of gambling activities in this state.  The WA Gambling Commission enforces its authority through an extensive set of rules and regulations promulgated in Title 230 of the Washington Administrative Code.  The state of Washington allows certain gambling activities, such as amusement games, bingo, raffles, punch boards, pull-tabs, card-rooms, and public card games.  In order to be considered legal, these activities must be operated by either non-profit organizations or by commercial food and drink establishments.  Some activities may be operated solely by non-profit organizations, such as raffles.  Some traditional casino games, such as craps, roulette and keno, are prohibited.  House-banked card-rooms have been authorized in Washington State since 1997 and, under current law, each establishment is allowed to have up to 15 tables offering games, such as Blackjack, Ultimate Texas Hold’em, Three Card Poker, Four Card Poker, Spanish Poker, Baccarat, Texas Shootout, Spanish 21, Pai Gow Poker, and others.  The law allows both player-sponsored and house-banked card-rooms.  The Washington Gambling Commission allows a maximum $300 table game wager for house-banked card-rooms. In addition, these establishments are allowed to be open 24 hours per day, seven days per week. 
 
To operate our nine “mini-casinos” in Washington State, each of them is required to maintain a Public Card-room and Punch Board/Pull-Tab Commercial Stimulant license.  These licenses are renewable annually, subject to continued compliance with applicable gaming regulations.  In addition, the WA Gambling Commission requires, prior to the licenses being issued, each substantial interest holder in the licensees (including our officers, directors and owners of 5% percent or more of any class of our stock) to submit to the WA Gambling Commission certain disclosure forms and be subject to background investigations.  The failure or inability of our “mini-casinos” to maintain their respective licenses would have a material adverse effect on our operations.
 
Revised Code of Washington (“RCW”) 9.46.110 allows local governments (including cities, counties and towns) to prohibit any or all gambling activities for which licenses are required as well as tax such activities.  The maximum tax limitations imposed by law include 20% of gross receipts for public card-room games and either 5% of gross receipts or 10% of net receipt (as chosen by a local authority) for pull-tabs activities.  The current gaming tax rate for public card-room games in the cities of Pasco, Mountlake Terrace, Kennewick, SeaTac, Renton, Tukwila and Shoreline, as well as in Snohomish County, is 10% of table games gross receipts. The current gaming tax rate for pull-tabs in the city of Kennewick is 10% of pull-tabs net receipts, while in the cities of Pasco, Mountlake Terrace, SeaTac, Renton, Tukwila and Shoreline, as well as in Snohomish County, the tax rate is 5% of pull-tabs gross receipts.  In addition, Washington State charges a business and occupational tax in the amount of 1.63% of all gaming activities’ net receipts in order to promote responsible gaming. 
 
South Dakota
 
Gaming in South Dakota began in November 1989 and is presently authorized within the city of Deadwood. The gaming legislation is codified in Chapter 42-7B of the South Dakota Codified Laws as well as Article 20:18 of the South Dakota Legislature Administrative Rules (collectively, the “SD Regulations”) and is regulated by the South Dakota Commission on Gaming (the “SD Gaming Commission”). The SD Regulations allow gambling activities to be conducted at bars and taverns, including slot machines and limited card games, such as Blackjack and Poker and beginning in July 2015, Roulette, Craps and Keno. The SD Regulations limit each licensed location to have a maximum of 30 slot machines. The current tax rate is 9% of the adjusted gross gaming revenues in addition to an annual fee of $2,000 for each licensed gaming device located in a licensed location. In order to operate our slot route business in this state, we are required to hold Operator and Route Operator licenses issued by the SD Gaming Commission.
 
The SD Regulations require that every officer and director, as well as any stockholder holding 5% or greater ownership in a company involved with the conduct of gaming in the state to be a person of good moral character and must submit to a full background investigation conducted by the SD Gaming Commission. Our gaming licenses may be suspended or revoked for any cause which may have prevented their issuance, or for violation by us, or any of our officers, directors, agents, members or employees, of the SD Regulations or for conviction of a crime of moral turpitude or a felony. In addition to the revocation or suspension or in lieu of revocation or suspension, the SD Gaming Commission may impose a reprimand or a monetary penalty.
 
Nevada
 
 On November 19, 2015, the Nevada Gaming Commission approved the Company’s application for a non-restricted gaming license in conjunction with the acquisition of Club Fortune Casino.

The ownership and operation of gaming establishments in Nevada are subject to the Nevada Gaming Control Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder (collectively, the “NGCA”). A finding of suitability is comparable to licensing and it requires submission of detailed personal and financial information followed by a thorough investigation. A finding of unsuitability with respect to any officer, director, employee, associate, lender or beneficial owner of a licensee or applicant may jeopardize an already issued license or applicant’s license application. Licenses may be conditioned upon termination of any relationship with unsuitable persons.
 
Although any beneficial holder of our voting securities, regardless of the number of shares owned, may be required to file an application for a finding of suitability, the general rule provides that beneficial owners of more than 10% of any class of our voting securities must apply to the NV Gaming Authorities for a finding of suitability. Under certain circumstances, an “institutional investor” (as defined in the NGCA) who acquires more than 10% but not more than 25% of any class of our voting securities, may apply to the NV Gaming Authorities for a waiver of such finding of suitability if such institutional investor holds the voting securities for investment purposes only. An institutional investor that has obtained a waiver may, in certain circumstances, own up to 29% of the voting securities of a registered company for a limited period of time and maintain the waiver. Any person who fails or refuses to apply for a finding of suitability or a license within 30 days after being ordered to do so by the NV Gaming Authorities, or who refuses or fails to pay the investigative costs in connection with investigation of its application, may be found unsuitable. The same restrictions apply to a record owner if the record owner, after request, fails to identify the beneficial owner. Any shareholder found unsuitable and who holds, directly or indirectly, any beneficial ownership of our common stock beyond such period of time as may be prescribed by the NV Gaming Authorities may be guilty of a criminal offense. We would be subject to disciplinary action if, after receipt of notice that a person is unsuitable, we:
 

• | pay such a person any dividend or interest upon any of our voting securities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | allow such a person to exercise, directly or indirectly, any voting right conferred through securities held by that person;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | pay remuneration in any form to such a person for services rendered or otherwise; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fail to pursue all lawful efforts to require such unsuitable person to relinquish his or her voting securities including, if necessary, the immediate purchase of the voting securities for cash at fair market value.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Corporations registered with the NV Gaming Commission may not make a public offering of any securities without the prior approval of the NV Gaming Authorities if the securities or the proceeds therefrom are intended to be used to construct, acquire, or finance gaming facilities in Nevada, or to retire or extend obligations incurred for those purposes or for similar purposes. An approval, if given, does not constitute a finding, recommendation, or approval by the NV Gaming Authorities as to the accuracy or adequacy of the prospectus or the investment merits of the securities, and any representation to the contrary is unlawful.
 
Because we are involved in gaming activities outside Nevada, we are required to deposit with the NV Gaming Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $10,000 to pay for the expenses of investigation by the NV Gaming Board of our participation in gaming in other jurisdictions. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the NV Gaming Commission. Upon our registration and finding of suitability, we are also required to comply with certain other requirements imposed by the NGCA, including reporting requirements.
 
The laws, regulations and supervisory procedures of the Nevada gaming authorities are based upon declarations of public policy which are concerned with, among other things:
 

● | the character of persons having any direct or indirect involvement with gaming to prevent unsavory or unsuitable persons from having a direct or indirect involvement with gaming at any time or in any capacity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | establishment and application of responsible accounting practices and procedures;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | maintenance of effective control over the financial practices and financial stability of licensees, including procedures for internal controls and the safeguarding of assets and revenues;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | recordkeeping and reporting to the Nevada gaming authorities;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | fair operation of games; and
--+-----------------------------

-


● | the raising of revenues through taxation and licensing fees.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------

 
Any person who is licensed, required to be licensed, registered, required to be registered, or who is under common control with those persons, collectively, “licensees,” and who proposes to become involved in a gaming venture outside of Nevada, is required to deposit with the Nevada Gaming Control Board, and thereafter maintain, a revolving fund in the amount of $0.03 million to pay the expenses of investigation by the Nevada Gaming Control Board of the licensee’s participation in foreign gaming. We comply with this requirement. The revolving fund is subject to increase or decrease at the discretion of the Nevada Gaming Commission. Licensees are required to comply with the reporting requirements imposed by the Nevada Gaming Control Act. A licensee is also subject to disciplinary action by the Nevada Gaming Commission if it:
 

● | knowingly violates any laws of the foreign jurisdiction pertaining to the foreign gaming operation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fails to conduct the foreign gaming operation in accordance with the standards of honesty and integrity required of Nevada gaming operations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | engages in any activity or enters into any association that is unsuitable because it poses an unreasonable threat to the control of gaming in Nevada, reflects or tends to reflect, discredit or disrepute upon the State of Nevada or gaming in Nevada, or is contrary to the gaming policies of Nevada;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | engages in activities or enters into associations that are harmful to the State of Nevada or its ability to collect gaming taxes and fees; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | employs, contracts with or associates with a person in the foreign operation who has been denied a license or a finding of suitability in Nevada on the ground of unsuitability.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have adopted a compliance plan and appointed a compliance committee which currently consists of Company directors and officers, in accordance with Nevada Gaming Commission requirements. Our compliance committee meets quarterly and is responsible for implementing and monitoring our compliance with Nevada regulatory matters. This committee will also review information and reports regarding the suitability of potential key employees or other parties who may be involved in material transactions or relationships with us.
 
General Gaming Regulations in Other Jurisdictions

If we become involved in gaming operations in any other jurisdictions, such gaming operations will subject us and certain of our officers, directors, key employees, stockholders and other affiliates to strict legal and regulatory requirements, including mandatory licensing and approval requirements, suitability requirements, and ongoing regulatory oversight with respect to such gaming operations. There can be no assurance that we will obtain all of the necessary licenses, approvals and findings of suitability or that our officers, directors, key employees, other affiliates and certain other stockholders will satisfy the suitability requirements in one or more jurisdictions, or that such licenses, approvals and findings of suitability, if obtained, will not be revoked, limited, suspended or not renewed in the future.
 
Failure by us to obtain, or the loss or suspension of, any necessary licenses, approval or findings of suitability would prevent us from conducting gaming operations in such jurisdiction and possibly in other jurisdictions.
 
Employees
 
As of April 30, 2017, we employed approximately 1,280 people.
