For information relating to amounts spent on research and development, see Note 19 - Research and Development in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules in Part IV of this annual report on Form 10-K. 
Manufacturing and Supply Chain
We subcontract the manufacture of a majority of the hardware sub-assemblies and certain components for our high-end products and custom-engineered systems, including integrated circuits, printed circuit boards, storage enclosures, connectors, cables and power supplies, on a sole or limited source basis to third-party suppliers. We use contract manufacturers to assemble certain components. Our manufacturing strategy currently centers on build-to-order systems, focusing on obtaining competitive 
7

assembly and component costs while concentrating our resources on the final assembly, test and quality assurance stages to ensure a positive customer experience. This strategy allows us to avoid the large capital commitment and overhead associated with establishing full-scale manufacturing facilities, helps us to maintain the flexibility to adopt new technologies as they become available without the risk of equipment obsolescence, provides near real-time configuration changes to exploit faster and/or less expensive technologies and provides a higher level of large scale system quality. Our manufacturing personnel are located in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. 
Our systems designed for the supercomputer market segment and our custom-engineered solutions incorporate components that are available from single or limited sources, often containing our design input or proprietary designs. Such components include integrated circuits, interconnect systems and certain memory devices. Prior to development of a particular product, components are typically competitively bid to a short list of technology partners. The technology partner that provides the highest value solution for the component is often awarded the contract for the life of the component. Once we have engaged a technology partner, changing our product designs to utilize another supplier’s standard or custom components can be a costly and time-consuming process. We also have sole or limited sources for less critical components, such as peripherals, power supplies, cooling and chassis hardware. We obtain key processor components from Intel, NVIDIA and other vendors from time to time for our Cray XC and cluster systems. We have a license for the Aries interconnect chip from Intel which we purchase through Broadcom Corporation (formerly Avago) that contracts with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company for the manufacture of the application specific integrated circuit (ASIC). Our procurements from these vendors are primarily through purchase orders. We have chosen to deal with sole sources in specific cases due to the availability of specific technologies, economic advantages and other factors. Reliance on single or limited source vendors involves several risks, including the possibility of shortages of key components, long lead times, reduced control over delivery schedules, design or persistent quality issues and changes in direction by vendors. We have been adversely affected by delays in obtaining qualified competitive components previously.

Competition
The broad HPC market is very competitive. Many of our competitors are established, well-known companies in the HPC market, including IBM, HPE, Lenovo, Dell/EMC, Huawei, NEC, Hitachi, Fujitsu and Atos-Bull. We also compete with systems builders and resellers of systems that are constructed from commodity components using processors manufactured by Intel, NVIDIA, AMD and others. IBM, Intel, NEC and Fujitsu also build systems leveraging their own processors. In addition, certain Chinese companies are investing significantly in HPC and are becoming more aggressive and competitive in the HPC global arena. Our competitors include the previously named companies as well as smaller companies that assemble systems from commercially available commodity products. The Cray CS500 and CS-Storm supercomputing cluster products are designed to help us better address this market by providing flexible HPC alternatives with competitive pricing. To the extent that IBM and other processor suppliers develop processors or networks with greater capabilities or at lower cost than the processors we use from Intel and NVIDIA, our systems may be at a competitive disadvantage to systems utilizing such other processors.
We compete primarily on the basis of product performance, scalability, breadth of features, price/performance, total cost of ownership, quality, reliability, upgradability, service and support, corporate reputation, brand image and account relationships. Our market approach here is more focused than many of our competitors, with the Cray XC Series designed with high levels of integration to meet the exacting needs of this performance and scalability driven market. We work to offer systems that provide greater performance on the largest, most difficult computational problems and superior price-performance on many important 
9

applications in the high-end of the supercomputer market segment. Our highly-integrated systems often offer superior total cost of ownership advantages as they typically use less electric power, require less cooling and occupy less space than lower bandwidth cluster systems.
The market for our Cray CS product line is very competitive. The majority of competition is from Lenovo, HPE, Huawei, Dell/EMC, Atos-Bull and Fujitsu, all of which offer open-standards cluster solutions to address the growth in the supercomputing market. We compete primarily on the basis of price-performance, open-standards architecture, flexible configurations, energy-efficiency, reliability, scalability, corporate reputation and account relationships. Our market approach is to offer cluster solutions that better address large and complex computational problems, a superior integration, support and relationship experience.
The competitive landscape in the big data market is quite varied, with competition from vendors offering integrated solutions, such as Oracle, commodity cluster systems with either open source or proprietary data analytics software, and traditional business intelligence vendors such as Teradata, Oracle, IBM and SAP. The analytics market for pattern recognition and knowledge discovery using graph databases is still nascent and fragmented as no dominant applications have yet emerged, with the result that custom and open source software approaches such as Hadoop and Spark are often used. However, customers with large, mission-critical graph problems have discovered that commodity approaches do not scale or deliver results in an acceptable timeframe, and have recognized the advantages of specialized solutions. We introduced the Cray Urika-XC and Urika-GX offerings - which compete primarily on the basis of performance, scalability, integration and total cost of ownership - as an alternative for users of big data and analytics. The AI market is nascent and rapidly evolving. Competition will include cloud infrastructure companies, systems and subsystems developed by processor vendors, start-up companies and our traditional system competitors.
Our storage products compete with a number of manufacturers and integrators of parallel storage solutions, including IBM with its Spectrum Scale parallel file system, as well as solutions from Data Direct Networks, Lenovo, NetApp, Dell EMC and other storage companies. The parallel storage and file system market is currently fragmented with a number of competing providers in the HPC marketplace. We believe that our strong storage products, along with our extensive experience and excellent reputation as an HPC systems vendor, compete effectively against our competition, especially when the prospective target market overlaps with our HPC systems target market.
