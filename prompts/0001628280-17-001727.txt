Overview
We are a science-driven biopharmaceutical company that is committed to developing innovative therapeutics in the areas of osteoporosis, oncology and endocrine diseases. Our lead investigational product candidate, abaloparatide for subcutaneous injection, or abaloparatide-SC, has completed Phase 3 development for potential use in the treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. Our New Drug Application, or NDA, for abaloparatide-SC is under regulatory review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, with a Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, date of March 30, 2017. Our European Marketing Authorisation Application, or MAA, for abaloparatide-SC is under review by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. We intend to commercialize abaloparatide-SC in the United States ourselves and our experienced commercial leaders are rapidly expanding the breadth of our capabilities and sales organization with highly skilled and tenured individuals. 
Our clinical pipeline also includes an investigational abaloparatide transdermal patch, or abaloparatide-TD, for potential use in the treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. We are focused on completing the manufacturing scale-up, production, and other activities required for the initiation of a pivotal bioequivalence study for abaloparatide-TD. In addition, we are evaluating our investigational product candidate, RAD1901, a selective estrogen receptor down-regulator/degrader, or SERD, for potential use in the treatment of hormone-driven and/or hormone-resistant breast cancer, as well as for potential use in the treatment of vasomotor symptoms in postmenopausal women. We plan to complete our ongoing Phase 1 studies of RAD1901 in advanced metastatic breast cancer and our ongoing Phase 2b study of RAD1901 in postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms. In the first half of 2017, we plan to engage with regulatory agencies to gain alignment on defining the next steps for our RAD1901 breast cancer program, which would include the design of a Phase 2 trial. In the first half of 2017, we also expect to complete and report results from our ongoing Phase 2b vasomotor trial. Our clinical pipeline also includes our internally developed investigational product candidate, RAD140, a non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator, or SARM, under investigation for potential use in the treatment of breast cancer. In December 2016, we submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, to the FDA and expect to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 study of RAD140 in women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer in 2017.
Our Investigational Product Candidates
The success of our business is primarily dependent upon our ability to discover, develop and commercialize our current and future product candidates. The following table identifies the investigational product candidates in our current product portfolio, their potential indication and stage of development. We hold worldwide commercialization rights for all of these product candidates, excluding abaloparatide-SC, for which we hold worldwide commercialization rights, except for Japan.

Abaloparatide
Abaloparatide is an investigational therapy for the potential treatment of women with postmenopausal osteoporosis who are at an increased risk for a fracture. Abaloparatide is a novel synthetic peptide analog that engages the parathyroid hormone receptor, or PTH1 receptor, and was selected for clinical development based on its potential for favorable bone building activity. 
We believe that abaloparatide is the most advanced PTH analog in clinical development for the treatment of osteoporosis and that, subject to regulatory review and approval, it could have the potential to provide the following advantages over other current standard of care treatments for osteoporosis:

• | improved efficacy—greater bone build at key non-vertebral sites like the hip and wrist with lower vertebral and non-vertebral fracture risk;


• | earlier onset of building bone;


• | shorter treatment duration;


• | no refrigeration of multi-dose injection pen; and


• | less hypercalcemia.

We are developing two formulations of abaloparatide: abaloparatide-SC, an injectable subcutaneous formulation of abaloparatide, and abaloparatide-TD, a potential line extension of abaloparatide-SC in the form of a convenient, short-wear-time, transdermal patch.
Abaloparatide-SC

Abaloparatide-SC has completed Phase 3 development for potential use as a daily self-administered injection. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to abaloparatide-SC, except for Japan. In December 2014, we announced positive 18-month top-line data from our Phase 3 ACTIVE clinical trial of abaloparatide-SC. These results were published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, or JAMA, in August 2016. In June 2015, we announced the positive top-line data from the first six months of our 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial of abaloparatide-SC and the 25-month combined fracture data from the ACTIVE and ACTIVExtend clinical trials. These data were published in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings in February 2017. The combined 25-month fracture data from our Phase 3 clinical trial program for abaloparatide-SC formed the basis of our regulatory submissions in the United States and Europe. In November 2015, we submitted an MAA to the EMA, which was validated and is currently undergoing active regulatory assessment by the CHMP. We anticipate that the CHMP may adopt an opinion regarding the MAA in 2017. In March 2016, we submitted an NDA to the FDA, which has been accepted for filing by the FDA with a PDUFA date of March 30, 2017. We intend to enter into one or more collaborations for the potential commercialization of abaloparatide-SC prior to commercial launch. Subject to a favorable regulatory outcome, we anticipate the first commercial sales of abaloparatide-SC to take place in 2017. We intend to commercialize abaloparatide-SC in the United States ourselves and our experienced commercial leaders are rapidly expanding the breadth of our capabilities and sales organization with highly skilled and tenured individuals. We expect to report the top-line results from our recently completed 24-month ACTIVExtend trial in the second quarter of 2017.
Our Capabilities-Organization and Experience
In our evolution towards becoming a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, we are completing the build out of our sales and medical organizations. We are also continuing to strengthen our compliance program as part of our commitment to a strong culture of compliance and good corporate governance.
Our accomplished senior commercial leadership is currently completing the build out of our commercial organization, with capabilities across sales, marketing, reimbursement, and distribution, to support the potential commercialization of abaloparatide-SC in the United States. In 2016, we established our commercial organization with core teams organized around marketing, sales, market access and commercial operations functions. 
Our market access and sales teams will engage and support external customers. Our market access organization has hired an account team comprised of individuals with significant account experience with the large third-party payers and trade accounts that represent a substantial majority of all potential target patients. We also assembled a marketing team of seasoned professionals with substantial specialty pharmaceutical marketing, communications, professional education, patient education and advocacy expertise. Our sales organization has hired over 20 capable sales leaders with prior osteoporosis, managerial, specialty launch and injectable therapy experience. These sales leaders will manage a sales organization that will be comprised of more than 200 clinical sales and integrated delivery network specialists. We intend to complete the hiring of our U.S. sales force in the first quarter of 2017. Finally, we forged a comprehensive commercial operations team to support launch requirements. Our commercial operations leaders have substantial specialty launch experience in establishing hub and specialty pharmacy distribution networks, analytics and forecasting, market research, sales and market operations, and sales training. 
If approved, we intend to distribute abaloparatide-SC in the United States through a network of distributors and specialty pharmacies. Under this distribution model, both the distributors and specialty pharmacies would take physical delivery of product and the specialty pharmacies would dispense the product directly to patients. 
Our experienced senior medical leadership is completing the build out of our medical organization to provide cross-functional support to both internal partners and external stakeholders by providing expert scientific knowledge, educational material and scientific training programs. This dedicated and skilled organization is comprised of 40 professionals with extensive clinical and scientific experience within academic medical centers, clinical medical practice, research institutions, and other pharmaceutical organizations. 
Our medical team was organized with key functions, including medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, medical information, publications, and health economics outcomes research. Our medical affairs team includes physicians with relevant clinical and pharmaceutical experience in endocrinology and women’s health. The medical affairs team also includes scientists with extensive research experience in bone health who will provide clinical development support for current and future scientific research. Our team of medical sciences liaisons, or MSLs, will provide medical educational support to external stakeholders. The director and regional managers of our MSL team have comprehensive experience in the field of osteoporosis.

Under the leadership of our Chief Compliance Officer, we are continuing to strengthen our compliance program as part of our commitment to a strong culture of compliance and good corporate governance. We recently revised our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, or Code of Conduct, which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees and have incorporated elements of the updated Code of Conduct into formal compliance trainings which are required to be completed by all employees. In addition, our management and other personnel have devoted a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives, including establishing and maintaining effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and NASDAQ.
Abaloparatide-TD
We are also developing abaloparatide- TD, based on 3M’s patented Microstructured Transdermal System technology for potential use as a short wear-time transdermal patch. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to the abaloparatide-TD technology. We are developing abaloparatide-TD toward future global regulatory submissions to build upon the potential success of our investigational product candidate, abaloparatide-SC, if approved. We commenced a human replicative clinical evaluation of the optimized abaloparatide-TD patch in December 2015, with the goal of achieving comparability to abaloparatide-SC. In September 2016, we presented results from this evaluation, which showed that the pharmacokinetic profile of an optimized abaloparatide-TD patch with respect to time to peak concentration, or Tmax, half-life, or T1/2, and area under the curve, or AUC, was successfully modified to improve comparability to abaloparatide-SC. The results of this clinical evaluation will inform the design of a pivotal bioequivalence study that will be initiated following completion of activities related to manufacturing scale-up, production, and other activities required for the initiation of that study.
RAD1901
RAD1901 is a selective estrogen receptor down-regulator/degrader, or SERD, that at high doses is being evaluated for potential use as an oral non-steroidal treatment for hormone-driven and/or hormone-resistant, breast cancer. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to RAD1901. RAD1901 is currently being investigated in postmenopausal women with advanced estrogen receptor positive, or ER-positive, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative, or HER2-negative breast cancer, the most common form of the disease. Studies completed to date indicate that the compound has the potential for use as a single agent, or in combination with other therapies for the treatment of breast cancer. We believe that, subject to successful development, regulatory review and approval, RAD1901 could have the potential to offer the following advantages compared to current standard of care treatments for ER-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer:

• | ability to degrade estrogen receptor;


• | favorable efficacy and tolerability profile;


• | ability to effectively combine with other agents;


• | treatment of hormone-resistant breast cancers; and


• | once a day oral administration.

Phase 1 - Dose-Escalation Study
In December 2014, we commenced a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-part, dose-escalation study of RAD1901 in postmenopausal women with ER-positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in the United States to determine the recommended dose for a Phase 2 clinical trial and to make a preliminary evaluation of the potential anti-tumor effect of RAD1901. Part A of this Phase 1 study was designed to evaluate escalating doses of RAD1901. The Part B expansion cohort was initiated at 400 mg daily dosing in March 2016 to allow for an evaluation of additional safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy. The patients enrolled in this study are heavily pretreated ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patients who have received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy including fulvestrant and CDK4/6 inhibitors, and more than 50% of the patients had ESR1 mutations. 
In December 2016, we reported positive results from this ongoing Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study. These results show that RAD1901 was well-tolerated with the most commonly reported adverse events being low grade nausea and dyspepsia. The Part C tablet dosage form cohort was initiated thereafter and enrollment was completed in November 2016.
Phase 1 - FES-PET Study
In December 2015, we commenced a Phase 1 18-F fluoroestradiol positron emission tomography, or FES-PET, study in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the European Union which includes the use of FES-PET imaging to assess estrogen 
5

receptor occupancy in tumor lesions following RAD1901 treatment. We continue to enroll patients in the EU Phase I FES-PET study. 
In December 2016, we reported positive results from the ongoing Phase 1 FES-PET study. The first three enrolled patients dosed at the 400-mg cohort had a tumor FES-PET signal intensity reduction ranging from 79% to 91% at day 14 compared to baseline. The most commonly reported adverse events reported to date have been grade 1 and 2 nausea and dyspepsia. This study will enroll 5 additional patients in the 400 mg daily oral cohort, followed by 8 patients in the 200 mg daily oral cohort.
Phase 1 - Recent Progress
Across both ongoing Phase 1 studies, 3 out of the 21 patients with measurable disease according to RECIST criteria had confirmed partial responses by RECIST criteria as of the data cut-off date of October 7, 2016. The RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) criteria is a set of rules published by NCI, the National Cancer Institute of the United States, and other international research organizations that seeks to define when cancer patients improve, stay the same or worsen during treatments. Of all patients dosed at 400 mg, 10 patients remained on study drug as of cut-off date, including 7 patients in the ongoing U.S. Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study and 3 patients in the ongoing EU Phase 1 FES-PET study. As of October 7, 2016, 14 patients in the U.S. Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study remained on study drug for greater than or equal to 4 months and 5 patients remained on study drug for greater than or equal to 6 months. All 3 patients in the EU Phase 1 FES-PET study remained on study drug for greater than or equal to 4 months and 1 patient remained on study drug for more than 6 months.
To date, no dose limiting toxicities, or DLTs, have been reported across any of the studies in the RAD1901 program.
We plan to complete both of our ongoing RAD1901 Phase 1 breast cancer trials. In the first half of 2017, we intend to engage with regulatory agencies to gain alignment on defining the next steps for the program, which would include the design of a Phase 2 trial.
Collaborations
In July 2015, we announced that early but promising preclinical data showed that our investigational drug RAD1901, in combination with Pfizer’s palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase, or CDK 4/6 inhibitor, or Novartis’ everolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, was effective in shrinking tumors. In preclinical patient-derived xenograft breast cancer models with either wild type or mutant ESR1, treatment with RAD1901 resulted in marked tumor growth inhibition, and the combination of RAD1901 with either agent, palbociclib or everolimus, showed anti-tumor activity that was significantly greater than either agent alone. We believe that these preclinical data suggest that RAD1901 has the potential to overcome endocrine resistance, is well-tolerated, and has a profile that is well suited for use in combination therapy.
In July 2016, we entered into a preclinical collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited to evaluate the combination of RAD1901 with Takeda's investigational drug TAK-228, an oral mTORC 1/2 inhibitor in Phase 2b development for the treatment of breast, endometrial and renal cancer, with the goal of potentially exploring such combination in a clinical study. We and Takeda have each agreed to contribute resources and supply compound material necessary for studies to be conducted under the collaboration and will share third party out-of-pocket research and development expenses. Activities under this collaboration are ongoing. Upon completion, both parties will agree upon the appropriate communication of the results. 
In January 2016, we entered into a worldwide clinical collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining RAD1901 with Novartis’ investigational agent LEE011 (ribociclib), a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, and BYL719 (alpelisib), an investigational phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor.
Phase 2b - Vasomotor Symptoms Study
RAD1901 is also being evaluated at low doses for the potential relief of the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. We expect to report results from our Phase 2b clinical study of RAD1901 for the potential treatment of postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms in the first half of 2017.
RAD140
RAD140 is a nonsteroidal selective androgen receptor modulator, or SARM. The androgen receptor, or AR, is highly expressed in many ER-positive, ER-negative, and triple-negative receptor breast cancers. Due to its receptor and tissue selectivity, potent activity, oral bioavailability, and long half-life, we believe RAD140 could have clinical potential in the treatment of breast cancer. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to RAD140, which resulted from an internal discovery program.
6

In July 2016, we reported that RAD140 in preclinical xenograft models of breast cancer demonstrated potent tumor growth inhibition when administered alone or in combinations with CDK4/6 inhibitors. It is estimated that 77% of breast cancers show expression of the androgen receptor. Our data suggest that RAD140 activity at the androgen receptor stimulates up-regulation of a tumor suppression pathway. 
We submitted an IND to the FDA for RAD140 in December 2016. In 2017, we plan to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 study of RAD140 in women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading provider of therapeutics for osteoporosis, cancer and serious endocrine diseases. To achieve this goal, we plan to:

• | Obtain regulatory approval of abaloparatide-SC and establish sales and marketing capabilities to commercialize abaloparatide-SC in the United States. We have completed our Phase 3 clinical trial of abaloparatide-SC, or the ACTIVE trial, and recently completed our 24-month extension trial of abaloparatide-SC, or the ACTIVExtend trial, for potential use in the reduction of fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Our NDA for abaloparatide-SC in the United States is undergoing regulatory review by the FDA with a PDUFA date of March 30, 2017 and our MAA in the European Union for abaloparatide-SC is under review by the CHMP with an opinion anticipated in 2017. We are building a commercial organization to support the potential commercialization of abaloparatide-SC in the U.S. We intend to complete the hiring of our U.S. sales force in the first quarter of 2017. We expect to report the top-line results from our recently completed 24-month ACTIVExtend trial in the second quarter of 2017. 


• | Conduct additional clinical research towards additional indications for abaloparatide. We are continuing to evaluate other underserved osteoporosis patient populations that might benefit from abaloparatide therapy. We may engage in additional clinical research with the goal of achieving additional labeling to treat these populations.


• | Selectively pursue partnerships or collaborations to develop and/or commercialize our product candidates. We intend to enter into one or more partnerships or collaborations for the development or commercialization of our product candidates. We intend to enter into one or more collaborations for the potential commercialization of abaloparatide-SC prior to commercial launch. 


• | Extend the lifecycle of abaloparatide through the continued development of abaloparatide-TD. We are developing abaloparatide-TD as a short-wear-time transdermal patch and we anticipate, pending successful development and a favorable regulatory outcome, commercial launch approximately two to three years after the approval and first commercial sale of abaloparatide-SC, if approved. We are currently working on the manufacturing scale-up, production, and other activities required for the initiation of a pivotal bioequivalence study. If our clinical trials of abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-TD are successful, we expect to seek marketing approval of abaloparatide-TD as a line extension of abaloparatide-SC. 


• | Advance the development of RAD1901 for the treatment of breast cancer. During 2016, we continued to enroll patients in our ongoing Phase 1 studies of RAD1901 in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the United States and the European Union. Preliminary results from these studies suggest that RAD1901 may have a favorable safety and tolerability profile and potential anti-tumor effect. We plan to complete both of our ongoing RAD1901 Phase 1 breast cancer trials. In the first half of 2017, we intend to engage with regulatory agencies to gain alignment on defining the next steps for the program, which would include the design of a Phase 2 trial. 


• | Advance the development of RAD140 for the treatment of breast cancer. We submitted an IND to the FDA for RAD140 in December 2016. In 2017, we plan to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 study of RAD140 in women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer


• | Continue to expand our product portfolio. We plan to leverage our drug development expertise to discover and develop additional investigational product candidates focused on serious endocrine-related diseases and conditions. We may also consider opportunistically expanding our product portfolio through in-licensing, acquisitions or partnerships. 

Our Opportunity
Osteoporosis
Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by low bone mass and structural deterioration of bone tissue, which leads to greater fragility and an increase in fracture risk. All bones become more fragile and susceptible to fracture as the disease 
7

progresses. People tend to be unaware that their bones are getting weaker, and a person with osteoporosis can fracture a bone from even a minor fall. The debilitating effects of osteoporosis have substantial costs. Loss of mobility, admission to nursing homes and dependence on caregivers are all common consequences of osteoporosis. The prevalence of osteoporosis is growing and, per the National Osteoporosis Foundation, or NOF, is significantly under-recognized and under-treated in the population. While the aging of the population is a primary driver of an increase in cases, osteoporosis is also increasing from the use of drugs that induce bone loss, such as chronic use of glucocorticoids and aromatase inhibitors that are increasingly used for breast cancer and hormone therapies used for prostate cancer.
The NOF has estimated that 10 million people in the United States, composed of eight million women and two million men, already have osteoporosis, and another approximately 44 million have low bone mass placing them at increased risk for osteoporosis. In addition, the NOF has estimated that osteoporosis is responsible for more than two million fractures in the United States each year resulting in an estimated $19 billion in costs annually. The NOF expects that the number of fractures in the United States due to osteoporosis will rise to three million by 2025, resulting in an estimated $25.3 billion in costs each year. Worldwide, osteoporosis affects an estimated 200 million women according to the International Osteoporosis Foundation, or IOF, and causes more than 8.9 million fractures annually, which is equivalent to an osteoporotic fracture occurring approximately every three seconds. The IOF has estimated that 1.6 million hip fractures occur worldwide each year, and by 2050 this number could reach between 4.5 million and 6.3 million. The IOF estimates that in Europe alone, the annual cost of osteoporotic fractures could surpass €76 billion by 2050.
In 2016, total sales of branded osteoporosis drugs approximated $7.0 billion, worldwide, of which more than $4.0 billion was attributable to injectable therapies. There are two main types of osteoporosis drugs currently available in the United States, anti-resorptive agents and anabolic agents. Anti-resorptive agents act to prevent further bone loss by inhibiting the breakdown of bone, whereas anabolic agents stimulate bone formation to build new bone. 
We believe there is a large unmet need in the market for osteoporosis treatment because existing therapies have been reported to have shortcomings in efficacy, tolerability and convenience. For example, one current standard of care, bisphosphonates, which are anti-resorptive agents, have been associated with infrequent but serious adverse events, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical fractures, especially of long bones. These side effects, although uncommon, reportedly have created increasing concern with physicians and patients. We believe many physicians are seeking alternatives to bisphosphonates. Forteo/Forsteo® (teriparatide) marketed by Eli Lilly and Company, or Lilly, and Prolia® (denosumab) marketed by Amgen Inc., or Amgen, are the two primary alternatives to bisphosphonates that are approved for the treatment of osteoporosis. Prolia has also been associated with infrequent but serious adverse events, such as osteonecrosis of the jaw and atypical fractures. In 2016, Forteo/Forsteo had reported worldwide sales of approximately $1.5 billion, $0.8 billion in the United States and $0.7 billion outside of the United States, and Prolia had reported sales of approximately $1.6 billion, $1.0 billion in the United States and $0.6 billion outside of the United States. Forteo, a 34 amino acid recombinant peptide of human parathyroid hormone, is the only anabolic drug approved in the United States for the treatment of osteoporosis.
We believe there is a significant opportunity for anabolic agents that have the potential to provide early, extensive and durable effects on both Bone Mineral Density, or BMD, and fracture risk compared to other approve therapies, with the potential added advantages of convenience and safety. With the potential addition of new guidelines, expanding research, increased diagnosis effort, greater awareness of the long-term risk associated with osteoporotic fracture, and new, more effective therapies we believe osteoporosis treatment will expand and likewise our potential commercial opportunity.
Our Capabilities—Organization and Experience
In our evolution towards becoming a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company, we are completing the build out of our sales and medical organizations. We are also continuing to strengthen our compliance program as part of our commitment to a strong culture of compliance and good corporate governance.
Our accomplished senior commercial leadership is currently completing the build out of our commercial organization, with capabilities across sales, marketing, reimbursement, and distribution, to support the potential commercialization of abaloparatide-SC in the United States. In 2016, we established our commercial organization with core teams organized around marketing, sales, market access and commercial operations functions. 
Our market access and sales teams will engage and support external customers. Our market access organization has hired an account team comprised of individuals with significant account experience with the large third-party payers and trade accounts that represent a substantial majority of all potential target patients. We also assembled a marketing team of seasoned professionals with substantial specialty pharmaceutical marketing, communications, professional education, patient education and advocacy expertise. Our sales organization has hired over 20 capable sales leaders with prior osteoporosis, managerial, specialty launch and injectable therapy experience. These sales leaders will manage a sales organization that will be comprised of more than 200 clinical sales and integrated delivery network specialists. We intend to complete the hiring of our U.S. sales 
8

force in the first quarter of 2017. Finally, we forged a comprehensive commercial operations team to support launch requirements. Our commercial operations leaders have substantial specialty launch experience in establishing hub and specialty pharmacy distribution networks, analytics and forecasting, market research, sales and market operations, and sales training. 
If approved, we intend to distribute abaloparatide-SC in the United States through a network of distributors and specialty pharmacies. Under this distribution model, both the distributors and specialty pharmacies would take physical delivery of product and the specialty pharmacies would dispense the product directly to patients. 
Our experienced senior medical leadership is completing the build out of our medical organization to provide cross-functional support to both internal partners and external stakeholders by providing expert scientific knowledge, educational material and scientific training programs. This dedicated and skilled organization is comprised of 40 professionals with extensive clinical and scientific experience within academic medical centers, clinical medical practice, research institutions, and other pharmaceutical organizations. 
Our medical team was organized with key functions, including medical affairs, pharmacovigilance, medical information, publications, and health economics outcomes research. Our medical affairs team includes physicians with relevant clinical and pharmaceutical experience in endocrinology and women’s health. The medical affairs team also includes scientists with extensive research experience in bone health who will provide clinical development support for current and future scientific research. Our team of medical sciences liaisons, or MSLs, will provide medical educational support to external stakeholders. The director and regional managers of our MSL team have comprehensive experience in the field of osteoporosis. 
Under the leadership of our Chief Compliance Officer, we are continuing to strengthen our compliance program as part of our commitment to a strong culture of compliance and good corporate governance. We recently revised our Code of Conduct and Business Ethics, or Code of Conduct, which applies to all of our directors, officers and employees and have incorporated elements of the updated Code of Conduct into formal compliance trainings which are required to be completed by all employees. In addition, our management and other personnel have devoted a substantial amount of time to compliance initiatives, including establishing and maintaining effective disclosure and financial controls and corporate governance practices, as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and rules subsequently implemented by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and NASDAQ.
Our Investigational Drug—Abaloparatide
Abaloparatide is a novel synthetic peptide analog that engages the PTH1 receptor and was selected for clinical development based on its potential for favorable bone building activity. Parathyroid hormone, or PTH, analogs (like Forteo teriparatide) and parathyroid hormone-related protein, or PTHrP, represent a family of proteins and peptides that share regions of partial or complete amino acid sequence similarity. The first 34 amino acids of PTH analogs contain the binding site for engaging the PTH1 receptor. Abaloparatide is a unique 34 amino acid PTH analog that has 41% homology (i.e. amino acid similarity) to Forteo (teriparatide) and has 76% homology to the first 34 amino acids of PTHrP. Abaloparatide is manufactured using organic chemistry techniques to create the 34 amino acid peptide.
Abaloparatide was designed to have a unique mechanism of action with the goal of stimulating enhanced bone building activity including bone formation, increasing bone mineral density, restoring bone microarchitecture and augmenting bone strength. We believe that abaloparatide is the most advanced PTH analog in clinical development for the treatment of osteoporosis and that, subject to regulatory review and approval, it could have the potential to provide the following advantages over other current standard of care treatments for osteoporosis:

• | improved efficacy—greater bone build at hip and spine with lower vertebral and non-vertebral fracture risk;


• | earlier onset of building bone;


• | shorter treatment duration;


• | no refrigeration of multi-dose injection pen; and


• | less hypercalcemia.

We are developing two formulations of abaloparatide: abaloparatide-SC, an injectable subcutaneous formulation of abaloparatide, and abaloparatide-TD, a potential expansion of our abaloparatide-SC franchise in the form of a convenient, short-wear-time, transdermal patch. We acquired and maintain exclusive worldwide rights, excluding development and commercialization rights for Japan, to certain patents, data and technical information related to abaloparatide through a license agreement with an affiliate of Ipsen Pharma SAS, or Ipsen. We have worldwide commercialization rights for abaloparatide-TD, including in Japan.

We previously announced positive 18-month top-line data from our Phase 3 ACTIVE clinical trial and positive top-line data from the first six months of our recently completed 24-month ACTIVExtend clinical trial, which included a one-month transition period for patients in the abaloparatide-SC and placebo groups from the ACTIVE clinical trial. The combined 25-month fracture data from our Phase 3 clinical trial program for abaloparatide-SC formed the basis of our regulatory submissions in the United States and Europe. In November 2015, we submitted an MAA in Europe, which was validated in December 2015, and we submitted an NDA to the FDA, which was accepted with a PDUFA date of March 30, 2017. We intend to lead the commercialization of abaloparatide-SC in the United States and are currently completing the build out of our commercialization capabilities and organization with highly experienced individuals. We expect to report the top-line results from our recently completed 24-month ACTIVExtend trial in the second quarter of 2017.
We continue to report progress on the development of an optimized, short-wear-time transdermal patch that may be capable of demonstrating comparability to abaloparatide-SC injection. We commenced the clinical evaluation of the optimized abaloparatide-TD patch at the end of 2015, with the goal of achieving comparability to abaloparatide-SC. In September 2016, we presented results from this evaluation, which showed that the pharmacokinetic profile of an optimized abaloparatide-TD patch with respect to Tmax, T1/2, and AUC, was successfully modified so as to improve comparability to abaloparatide-SC. The results of this clinical evaluation will inform the design of a pivotal bioequivalence study that will be initiated following completion of activities related to manufacturing scale-up, production, and other activities required for the initiation of that study. If our clinical trials of abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-TD are successful, we expect to seek marketing approval of abaloparatide-TD as a potential expansion of our abaloparatide-SC franchise. We believe abaloparatide-TD could be submitted for regulatory approval based upon a demonstration of bioequivalence to abaloparatide-SC. Upon completion of clinical evaluation of the optimized abaloparatide-TD patch, we will meet with regulatory agencies to discuss the appropriate regulatory path for the abaloparatide-TD program. Any approval of abaloparatide-TD, and the timing of any such approval, is dependent upon the approval of abaloparatide-SC.
Abaloparatide-SC Phase 3 Clinical Trial
In 2014, we completed a multicenter, multinational, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of abaloparatide-SC, or the ACTIVE trial, in which 2,463 postmenopausal women aged 49 to 86 received daily doses of one of the following: 80 µg of abaloparatide, a matching placebo, or the approved dose of 20 µg of Forteo for 18 months.
On February 15, 2012, we received a letter from the FDA stating that, after internal consideration, it believes that a minimum of 24-month fracture data are necessary for approval of new products for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. We subsequently met with the FDA on March 21, 2012 to discuss satisfying the 24-month data request while preserving the 18-month primary endpoint. Based upon our discussion with the FDA, we believe that the 18-month primary endpoint will be acceptable, provided that our NDA includes the 24-month fracture data derived from a 6-month extension of the abaloparatide 80 µg and placebo groups in our Phase 3 study during which patients received an approved alendronate (generic Fosamax) therapy for osteoporosis management. Accordingly, patients from the abaloparatide-SC and placebo groups from our ACTIVE trial were eligible to continue in a 24-month extension study, or the ACTIVExtend trial, in which they received 70 mg once weekly of an approved alendronate therapy for osteoporosis management following completion of treatment in the ACTIVE trial and a one-month transition period during which they received no study treatments. We submitted our NDA for abaloparatide-SC with 25-month fracture data.
The ACTIVE trial was designed to evaluate as the primary endpoint whether abaloparatide-SC is superior to placebo for prevention of vertebral fracture. The top-line results of the 18-month ACTIVE trial showed that abaloparatide-SC met the primary endpoint with a statistically significant 86% reduction in new vertebral fractures versus placebo, and Forteo met the same endpoint with a statistically significant 80% reduction. On the secondary endpoints, as compared to placebo, abaloparatide achieved a statistically significant reduction of 43% in non-vertebral fracture; a statistically significant reduction of 43% in the clinical fracture; and a significant difference in the time to first incident of non-vertebral fracture and clinical fracture.
An exploratory analysis of the ACTIVE trial showed that, for major osteoporotic fractures, there was a statistically significant 70% reduction in major osteoporotic fractures for the abaloparatide treatment group versus placebo, and a statistically significant 55% reduction in major osteoporotic fractures for the abaloparatide-SC treatment group as compared to Forteo over the 18-month period.
The results from the first six months of the ACTIVExtend study showed that the group previously treated with abaloparatide-SC had no new vertebral fractures during the first six months of receiving alendronate. From the start of the ACTIVE trial, this group showed a statistically significant 87% reduction in new vertebral fractures, a 52% reduction in non-vertebral fractures, a 45% reduction in clinical fractures and a 58% reduction in major osteoporotic fractures over the 24-month period, as compared to placebo. The results also suggested that abaloparatide was generally safe and well tolerated when administered once daily, with reported adverse events similar between abaloparatide, placebo and Forteo groups.

Abaloparatide-TD Phase 2 Clinical Trial
In 2013, we completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 clinical trial of abaloparatide administered via a coated transdermal microarray delivery system, which results in pulsatile delivery of abaloparatide, in healthy postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. This study was conducted in nine centers in the United States, Denmark, Poland and Estonia. The primary objective of this study was to determine the clinical safety and efficacy of a pulsatile abaloparatide-TD patch as assessed by changes in BMD when compared to a transdermal placebo and abaloparatide-SC. The results showed that for each abaloparatide-TD dose there was a statistically significant mean percent increase from baseline in BMD at the lumbar spine, as compared to placebo. For the 100 µg and 150 µg abaloparatide-TD doses, there was also a statistically significant mean percent increase from baseline in BMD at the hip, as compared to placebo. The highest abaloparatide-TD dose of 150 µ g produced increases in BMD from baseline in the lumbar spine and total hip of +2.9% and +1.5%, respectively, compared to changes in the placebo group of +0.04% and –0.02%, respectively. In addition, there was a consistent dose effect seen with increasing doses of abaloparatide-TD, with a statistically significant dosing trend seen for changes in both spine and total hip BMD. Further, the overall tolerability and safety profile was acceptable; there were no clinically significant effects of anti-abaloparatide antibodies; and patient ratings of patch adhesion and local skin response to the transdermal patch technology were also acceptable.
Breast Cancer
According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and the most prevalent cancer in women, accounting for 16% of all female cancers. The major cause of death from breast cancer is metastases, most commonly to the bone, liver, lung and brain. Approximately 30% of early-stage breast cancer patients develop metastatic disease, and of those patients 90% relapse during the course of their treatment. About 5% of breast cancer patients have distant metastases at the time of diagnosis, and these patients have a five-year survival rate of only 25%, compared with a greater than 99% five-year survival rate for patients with only local disease at diagnosis. Importantly, even patients without metastases at diagnosis are at risk for developing metastases over time.
Approximately 70% of breast cancers express the ER and depend on estrogen signaling for growth and survival. Patients with ER-positive breast cancers are typically treated with endocrine therapies. There are three main classes of therapies for ER-positive tumors available: aromatase inhibitors, or AIs; selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs; and selective estrogen receptor degraders, or SERDs. AIs, which block the generation of estrogen, and SERMs, which selectively inhibit an ER's ability to bind estrogen, both block ER-dependent signaling but leave functional ERs present on breast cancer cells. For this reason, although AIs and SERMs are effective treatments for some breast cancers, some patients acquire resistance to them by developing the ability to signal through the ER in a ligand-independent manner. In contrast, SERDs are a class of endocrine therapies that directly induce ER degradation. Therefore, SERDs should have the potential to treat ER-dependent tumors without allowing ligand-independent resistance to develop, and to act on AI- and SERM-resistant ER-positive tumors.
Currently only one SERD, fulvestrant, is approved for the treatment of ER-positive metastatic breast cancer. We believe a significant opportunity exists for new oral therapies that do not allow ligand-independent resistance to develop and can more effectively treat ER-positive breast cancer.
Our Investigational Drug—RAD1901
RAD1901 is a SERD that at high doses has potential for use as a daily oral non-steroidal treatment for hormone-driven and/or hormone-resistant, breast cancer. RAD1901 is currently being investigated in postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer, the most common form of the disease. The compound has the potential for use as a single agent or in combination with other therapies to overcome endocrine resistance in breast cancer. RAD1901 selectively binds to and degrades the estrogen receptor. In preclinical models of ER-positive breast cancer, RAD1901 has shown potent anti-tumor activity and complete degradation of the ER and progesterone receptor, an ER-regulated gene. RAD1901 has shown good tissue selectivity in preclinical models and does not appear to stimulate the uterine endometrium, while it appears to protect against bone loss in an ovariectomy-induced osteopenia rat model. When RAD1901 was used in combination with other approved breast cancer agents such as everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, or palobciclib, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, greater tumor shrinkage in patient-derived xenograft (PDx) animal models was achieved than with the agents alone. In addition, RAD1901 has been shown to effectively inhibit tumor growth in PDx animal models that harbor ER mutations, a potential mechanism of endocrine therapy resistance. In our phase 1 MTD healthy volunteer study, FES-PET imaging was used to assess how much RAD1901 has engaged in the ER, RAD1901 showed suppression of the FES-PET signal to background levels after six days of dosing in a subset of patients.
Preclinical studies with RAD1901 have established the PK profile, including demonstration of good oral bioavailability. We believe that, subject to successful development, regulatory review and approval, RAD1901 could have the potential to offer the following advantages over other current standard of care treatments for ER-positive breast cancer:
11


• | ability to degrade estrogen receptor;


• | favorable efficacy and tolerability profile;


• | ability to effectively combine with other agents;


• | treatment of hormone-resistant breast cancers; and


• | once a day oral administration.

We exclusively licensed the worldwide rights to RAD1901 from Eisai Co. Ltd., or Eisai.
Phase 1 Studies—Breast Cancer
In December 2014, we commenced a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-part, dose-escalation study of RAD1901 in postmenopausal women with ER-positive and HER2-negative advanced breast cancer in the United States to determine the recommended dose for a Phase 2 clinical trial and to make a preliminary evaluation of the potential anti-tumor effect of RAD1901. Part A of this Phase 1 study is designed to evaluate escalating doses of RAD1901 (n=13). The Part B expansion cohort (n=20) was initiated at 400 mg daily dosing in March 2016 to allow for an evaluation of additional safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy. The patients enrolled in this study are heavily pretreated ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patients who have received a median of 3 prior lines of therapy. In December 2016, we reported positive results from the ongoing U.S. Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study that includes 2 patients with confirmed partial responses by RECIST criteria out of 19 patients with RECIST measurable disease. At the data cut-off date of October 7, 2016, 14 patients had remained on study drug for greater than or equal to 4 months, 5 patients for greater than or equal to 6 months, and 7 patients were continuing on study drug as of the cut-off date. The results suggested that RAD1901 was well-tolerated with the most commonly reported adverse events being low grade nausea and dyspepsia. A Part C tablet dosage form cohort (n=14) was initiated and enrollment completed in 2016.
In December 2015, we commenced a Phase 1 FES-PET study in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the European Union which includes the use of FES-PET imaging to assess estrogen receptor occupancy in tumor lesions following RAD1901 treatment. We continue to enroll patients in the EU Phase I FES-PET study. The first three enrolled patients dosed at the 400-mg cohort had a tumor FES-PET signal intensity reduction ranging from 79% to 91% at day 14 compared to baseline. In December 2016, we reported positive results from the ongoing EU Phase 1 FES-PET study including 1 patient with a confirmed partial response by RECIST criteria with all three enrolled patients remained on study drug with mean duration of treatment of 5.64 cycles as of the October 7, 2016 data cut-off date. Adverse events reported to date have been grade 1 and 2 and manageable. This study will enroll 5 additional patients in the 400-mg daily oral cohort followed by 8 patients in the 200-mg daily oral cohort.
Across both ongoing Phase 1 studies, 3 out of the 21 patients with RECIST measurable disease had confirmed partial responses by RECIST criteria as of the data cut-off date of October 7, 2016, including 2 out of 19 patients in the ongoing U.S. Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study and 1 out of 2 patients in the ongoing EU Phase 1 FES-PET study. Of all patients dosed at 400-mg in both Phase 1 studies, 10 patients remained on study drug as of the data cut-off date, including 7 patients in the ongoing U.S. Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study and 3 patients in the ongoing EU Phase 1 FES-PET study. As of October 7, 2016, 14 patients in the U.S. Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study remained on study drug for greater than or equal to 4 months and 5 patients remained on study drug for greater than or equal to 6 months. All 3 patients in the EU Phase 1 FES-PET study remained on study drug for greater than or equal to 4 months and 1 patient remained on study drug for more than 6 months.
In 2017, we plan to complete both of our ongoing RAD1901 Phase 1 breast cancer trials. In the first half of 2017, we intend to engage with regulatory agencies to gain alignment on defining the next steps for the program, which would include the design of a Phase 2 trial.
In July 2016, we entered into a preclinical collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited to evaluate the combination of RAD1901 with Takeda's investigational drug TAK-228, an oral mTORC 1/2 inhibitor in Phase 2b development for the treatment of breast, endometrial and renal cancer, with the goal of potentially exploring such combination in a clinical study. We and Takeda have each agreed to contribute resources and supply compound material necessary for studies to be conducted under the collaboration and will share third party out-of-pocket research and development expenses. Activities under this collaboration are ongoing. Upon completion, both parties will agree upon the appropriate communication of the results.
12

In January 2016, we entered into a worldwide clinical collaboration with Novartis Pharmaceuticals to evaluate the safety and efficacy of combining RAD1901, with investigational agent LEE011 (ribociclib), a CDK 4/6 inhibitor and BYL719 (alpelisib), an investigational phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor.
Preclinical Pharmacology of RAD1901
RAD1901 has been shown to bind with good selectivity to the ER alpha, or ERa, and to have both estrogen-like and estrogen antagonist effects in different tissues. RAD1901 has also been shown to have estrogen-like behavioral effects in an animal model of partner preference. In bone, RAD1901 protected against ovariectomy-induced bone loss. RAD1901 does not stimulate the endometrium, as shown in short- and long-term animal models, where changes in uterine weight, uterine epithelial thickness, and C3 gene expression are measured, all of which are sensitive indicators. In studies in which estrogen is used to stimulate the endometrium, RAD1901 antagonizes this estrogen-mediated stimulation of the endometrium. In cell culture, RAD1901 does not stimulate replication of breast cancer cells, and antagonizes the stimulating effects of estrogen on cell proliferation. Furthermore, in breast cancer cell lines a dose dependent down regulation of ERa is observed, a process we have shown to involve proteosomal-mediated degradation pathway. In a xenograft model of breast cancer, in which human breast cancer cells are implanted in mice and allowed to establish tumors in response to estrogen treatment, we observed that treatment with RAD1901 results in decreased tumor growth.
In July 2015, we announced that early but promising preclinical data show that our investigational drug RAD1901, in combination with Pfizer's palbociclib, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, or Novartis' everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor, was effective in shrinking tumors. In PDx animal breast cancer models with either wild type or mutant ESR1, treatment with RAD1901 resulted in marked tumor growth inhibition, and the combination of RAD1901 with either agent, palbociclib or everolimus, showed anti-tumor activity that was significantly greater than either agent alone.
Phase 2b - Vasomotor Symptoms Study
RAD1901 is also being evaluated at low doses for the potential relief of the frequency and severity of moderate to severe hot flashes in postmenopausal women with vasomotor symptoms. We expect to report results from our Phase 2b clinical study of RAD1901 for the potential treatment of postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms in the first half of 2017.
Our Investigational Drug—RAD140
RAD140 is a potent, orally bioavailable non-steroidal investigational SARM that resulted from an internal drug discovery program focused on the androgen receptor pathway, which is highly expressed in many ER-positive and ER-negative breast cancers. Due to its receptor and tissue selectivity, potent oral activity and long duration half-life, we-believe RAD140 could have clinical potential in the treatment of oncology and multiple conditions where androgen modulation may offer therapeutic benefit. We submitted an IND for RAD140 in December 2016. In 2017, we plan to initiate a first-in-human Phase 1 study of RAD140 in women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of any of our investigational product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. The active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, of abaloparatide is manufactured on a contract basis by Polypeptide Laboratories Holding (PPL) AB, or PPL, as successor-in-interest to Lonza Group Ltd., using a solid phase peptide synthesis assembly process, and purification by high pressure liquid chromatography. Abaloparatide-SC is supplied as a liquid in a multi-dose cartridge for use in a pen delivery device. The pen delivery device is manufactured by Ypsomed AG, or Ypsomed. The multi-dose cartridges and pen delivery device are filled, assembled and packaged by Vetter International GmbH, or Vetter. 
Abaloparatide-TD is manufactured by 3M Co. and 3M Innovative Properties Co., or together 3M, based on their patented microneedle technology to administer drugs through the skin, as an alternative to subcutaneous injection. The API for RAD1901 is manufactured for us on a contract basis by Patheon, Inc.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs. FDA cGMP requirements include those pertaining to record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations are required to manufacture our investigational product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice, or cGMP, conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of human pharmaceuticals that imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record keeping requirements on the manufacturing process and associated production and testing facilities.

As of December 31, 2016, we owned or co-owned 11 issued U.S. patents, as well as 18 pending U.S. patent applications, 5 pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications, 33 pending foreign patent applications in the European Patent Office and 14 other jurisdictions, and 32 granted foreign patents. As of December 31, 2016, we had licenses to 3 U.S. patents related to compositions and related uses thereof, as well as numerous foreign counterparts to many of these patents and patent applications. In 2016, five U.S. patents that we licensed from Ipsen expired. We own the federal trademark registration in the United States for Radius® in association with pharmaceuticals. In addition, we have received notices of allowance for trademarks on potential brand names for our product candidates in the U.S. and in other countries.
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our investigational product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will significantly depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology and inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Abaloparatide
We acquired and maintain exclusive worldwide rights, excluding development and commercialization rights for Japan, to certain patents, data and technical information related to abaloparatide through a license agreement with an affiliate of Ipsen. Composition of matter of abaloparatide was claimed in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 5,969,095), Europe, Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, South Korea, New Zealand, Poland, Russia, Singapore, Mexico, Hungary, and Taiwan. These patents and European Patent No. 0847278, which was included in the license from Ipsen and claimed the composition of matter of abaloparatide, expired in 2016. The subcutaneous formulation of abaloparatide for potential use in treating osteoporosis is covered by Patent No. 7,803,770 until the statutory term expires October 3, 2027, which we expect will be extended to March 26, 2028 (statutory term extended with 175 days of patent term adjustment due to delays in patent prosecution by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO) in the United States (not including any patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act). The intended therapeutic formulation for abaloparatide-SC is covered by Patent No. 8,148,333 until 2027 in the United States (not including any patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act). Related patents granted in Australia, China, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and Ukraine, and additional patent applications pending in Brazil, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, India, South Korea, and Norway, will have a patent expiration date of 2027, not taking into account extension under any applicable laws. A notice to grant the abaloparatide-SC osteoporosis treatment method has been received from the European Patent Office. When granted, this patent will have a normal expiry of October 3, 2027, not including any issued supplementary patent certificates, or SPC. Patent applications covering various aspects of abaloparatide for microneedle application have been granted in Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, and additional patent applications are currently pending in the United States, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Singapore, and Ukraine. The issued patents and any patents that might issue from the pending applications will have a statutory expiration date in 2032, not taking into account extension under any applicable laws. We have worldwide rights to commercialize abaloparatide-TD, including in Japan. 
RAD1901
We exclusively licensed the worldwide rights to RAD1901 from Eisai. U.S. Patent No. 7,612,114 (statutory term expires December 25, 2023 which we expect will be extended up to August 18, 2026 with 967 days of patent term adjustment not taking into account any Hatch-Waxman patent term extensions) covers RAD1901 as a composition of matter as well as the use of RAD1901 for treatment of estrogen-dependent osteoporosis or estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Corresponding patents issued in Australia, Canada, Japan, Poland, and Europe and pending in India will have a statutory expiration date in 2023, not taking into account extension under any applicable laws. Patent applications covering methods of using RAD1901 for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms are issued in the United States (U.S. Patent No. 8,933,130, statutory term expires June 22, 2027, which we expect will be extended up to October 19, 2031 with 1,580 days of patent term adjustment not taking into account any Hatch-Waxman patent term extensions), Canada and Europe; any issued patents will have a statutory expiration date in 2027. Patent applications covering a dosage form have been issued in Europe and are pending in the United States, Europe, Canada and Mexico, and any claims that issued or later issue from the pending applications will have a statutory expiration date in 2031.
RAD140
14

The composition of matter of, and methods of using, RAD140 are covered by U.S. Patent No. 8,067,448 (statutory term expires February 19, 2029, which we expect will be extended to September 25, 2029, with 218 days of patent term adjustment due to delays by the USPTO, not taking into account any Hatch Waxman patent term extensions) and U.S. Patent No. 8,268,872 (statutory term expires February 19, 2029 which we expect will be extended to September 25, 2029 with patent term adjustment, subject to a terminal disclaimer of Patent Nos. 8,067,448 and 8,455,525). Related patents have been granted in Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan and Mexico and additional patent applications are pending in Brazil and India. Any patents issued from these filings will have a statutory expiration date in 2029.
There can be no assurance that an issued patent will remain valid and enforceable in a court of law through the entire patent term. Should the validity of a patent be challenged, the legal process associated with defending the patent can be costly and time consuming. Issued patents can be subject to oppositions, interferences and other third-party challenges that can result in the revocation of the patent or that can limit patent claims such that patent coverage lacks sufficient breadth to protect subject matter that is commercially relevant. Competitors may be able to circumvent our patents. Development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products can be subject to substantial delays and it is possible that at the time of commercialization any patent covering the product has expired or will be in force for only a short period of time following commercialization. We cannot predict with any certainty if any third-party U.S. or foreign patent rights, or other proprietary rights, will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology. Nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third-parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our partners against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all our products in the United States and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our partners may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets on a continuing basis. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.
It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors who receive confidential information from us to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to these individuals during the course of the individual's relationship with us is to be kept confidential and is not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
Our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection, preserve trade secrets, prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others, both in the United States and other territories worldwide.
Competition
The development and commercialization of new products to treat the targeted indications of our investigational product candidates is highly competitive, and our products, if approved, will face considerable competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies, including Amgen, UCB S.A., Merck & Co, Novartis, Lilly, Pfizer, Roche, Asahi Kasei, Corium and Zosano, that currently market and/or are seeking to develop products for similar indications. Many of our competitors have substantially more resources than we do, including financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources. In addition, many of these companies have longer operating histories and more experience than us in preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory and global commercialization.
Abaloparatide
There are two main types of osteoporosis drugs currently available in the United States, anti-resorptive agents and anabolic agents. Anti-resorptive agents including bisphosphonates, estrogen, SERMs and Amgen's Prolia are the most common treatments for osteoporosis. Teriparatide, marketed by Lilly under the name Forteo/Forsteo, is the only anabolic drug approved in the United States and Europe for the treatment of osteoporosis. We are aware of companies pursuing development of biosimilar and/or generic versions of teriparatide through various regulatory pathways, including Pfenex, Inc. in the United States; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., currently under EU and U.S. regulatory review; and STADA Arzneimittel AG and Gedeon Richter, approved in the European Union (with launch not expected until expiration of the applicable patents covering teriparatide, or if earlier, invalidation of such patents in connection with currently pending patent litigation and/or challenges). 
15

Other organizations are also working to develop new therapies to treat osteoporosis. For example, Amgen and UCB are co-developing romosozumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of sclerostin, which is currently under review by the FDA with a PDUFA date of July 19, 2017.  
In addition, we are aware that Corium and Zosano are developing a transdermal form of PTH (1-34) that would compete with abaloparatide-TD.
RAD1901
RAD1901 for the treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancer will face competition from SERDs, CNS-penetrant anti-cancer agents and from chemotherapy derivatives. AstraZeneca's Faslodex is the only SERD currently approved in the United States for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In addition, there are other organizations working to develop new therapies to treat metastatic breast cancer, including Roche, which is developing two oral SERD's which are currently in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical development.
RAD1901 for the treatment of vasomotor systems will face competition from recently launched products including Pfizer's Duavee and Premarin, and Noven Therapeutic's Brisdelle®.
RAD140
RAD140 is being developed for women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer. While no SARMs are currently approved as therapeutics in the United States, there are select competitive molecules in development across a range of indications, including in oncology (GTx), hip fractures (Viking Therapeutics), and cachexia (GSK). 
We cannot assure you that any of our current investigational product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will be able to compete effectively against these, or any other competing therapeutics that may become available on the market.
Collaborations and License Agreements
3M
In June 2009, we entered into a Development and Clinical Supplies Agreement with 3M, or the 3M Agreement, under which 3M is responsible for the development of an abaloparatide-TD product and the manufacture of clinical and toxicology supplies of the abaloparatide-TD product for preclinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies on an exclusive basis during the term of the 3M Agreement. In December 2012, we entered into an amendment to 3M Agreement in which 3M agreed to develop and manufacture clinical and toxicology supplies for the Phase 3 abaloparatide-TD clinical study. In addition, 3M agreed that it will not use jointly owned intellectual property developed during and resulting from its work with us on abaloparatide-TD in relation to any other PTH or PTHrP analogue or derivative. We hold exclusive worldwide rights to this use of the 3M transdermal technology. The agreement provides for services through December 31, 2017, unless it is sooner terminated. Either party may terminate the agreement in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party. 
We pay 3M for services delivered pursuant to the agreement on a fee-for-service or a fee-for-deliverable basis as specified in the agreement. We have paid 3M approximately $19.3 million, in the aggregate, through December 31, 2016 with respect to services and deliverables delivered pursuant to the 3M Agreement.
Ipsen Pharma
In September 2005, we entered into a license agreement with Ipsen, as amended, or the License Agreement, under which we exclusively licensed certain Ipsen compound technology and related patents covering abaloparatide to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize certain compounds and related products in all countries, except Japan (where we do not hold abaloparatide-SC development and commercialization rights) and France (where our commercialization rights were subject to certain co-marketing and co-promotion rights exercisable by Ipsen, provided that certain conditions included in the License Agreement were met). We believe that Ipsen's co-marketing and co-promotion rights in France have permanently expired. Ipsen also granted us an exclusive right and license under the Ipsen compound technology and related patents to make and have made compounds or product in Japan. Ipsen further granted us an exclusive right and license under certain Ipsen formulation technology and related patents solely for purposes of enabling us to develop, manufacture and commercialize compounds and products covered by the compound technology license in all countries, except Japan and France (as discussed above). 
In consideration for the rights to abaloparatide and in recognition of certain milestones having been met to date, we have paid to Ipsen an aggregate amount of $4.3 million. The license agreement further requires us to make payments upon the achievement of certain future clinical and regulatory milestones. Total additional milestone payments that could be payable under the agreement are €32.0 million ($33.6 million). Should abaloparatide be approved and subsequently become commercialized, the agreement provides that we or our sublicensees would pay to Ipsen a fixed five percent royalty based on 
16

net sales of the product on a country-by-country basis until the later of the last to expire of the licensed patents or for a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed products in such country. The date of the last to expire of the abaloparatide patents licensed from or co-owned with Ipsen, barring any extension thereof, is expected to be March 26, 2028. In the event that we sublicense abaloparatide to a third party, the agreement provides that we would pay a percentage of certain payments received from such sublicensee (in lieu of milestone payments not achieved at the time of such sublicense). The applicable percentage is in the low double digit range. In addition, if we or our sublicensees commercialize a product that includes a compound discovered by us based on or derived from confidential Ipsen know-how, the agreement provides that we would pay to Ipsen a fixed low single digit royalty on net sales of such product on a country-by-country basis until the later of the last to expire of our patents that cover such product or for a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. 
The License Agreement expires on a country-by-country basis on the later of (1) the date the last remaining valid claim in the licensed patents expires in that country, or (2) a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed products in such country, unless it is sooner terminated in accordance with its terms.
The License Agreement may be terminated by us with prior notice to Ipsen. The License Agreement may be terminated by Ipsen upon notice to us with immediate effect, if we, in any country of the world, bring an action or proceeding to challenge any Ipsen patent. The License Agreement can also be terminated by Ipsen if we fail to use reasonable commercial efforts to develop the licensed product for sale and commercialization in those countries within the territory where it is commercially reasonable to do so as contemplated by the License Agreement, or fail to use reasonable commercial efforts to perform our obligations under the latest revised version of the development plan approved by the joint steering committee, or fail to use reasonable commercial efforts to launch and sell one licensed product in those countries within the territory where it is commercially reasonable to do so. Either party may also terminate the License Agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party. Ipsen may terminate the License Agreement if the License Agreement is assigned or sublicensed, if a third party acquires us, or if we acquire control over a PTH or a PTHrP compound that is in clinical development or is commercially available in the territory, and if following such assignment, sublicense, acquisition, or acquisition of control by us, such assignee, sublicensee, acquirer or we, fail to meet the timetable under the latest revised version of the development plan approved by the joint steering committee under the License Agreement.
Prior to executing the License Agreement for abaloparatide with Radius, Ipsen licensed the Japanese rights for abaloparatide to Teijin Limited, or Teijin, a Japanese pharmaceutical company. Teijin has completed a Phase 2 clinical study of abaloparatide in Japan for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.
We are currently in arbitration proceedings with Ipsen in connection with the License Agreement. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information.
Eisai
In June 2006, we exclusively licensed the worldwide rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize RAD1901 and related products from Eisai, or the Eisai Agreement. Our license with Eisai did not originally include rights for Japan, however, on March 9, 2015, we entered into an amendment to the Eisai Agreement in which Eisai granted us an exclusive right and license to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize RAD1901 in Japan, or the Eisai Amendment. Specifically, we licensed the patent application that subsequently issued as U.S. Patent No. 7,612,114 (statutory term expires December 25, 2023 which we expect will be extended to August 18, 2026 with 967 days of patent term adjustment due to delays by the USPTO), entitled "Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulator," the corresponding foreign patent applications and continuing patent applications. In consideration for the worldwide rights to RAD1901 and in recognition of certain milestones having been met to date, we have paid to Eisai an aggregate amount of $1.9 million. We have also agreed to pay Eisai additional fees of up to $22.3 million, payable upon the achievement of certain clinical and regulatory milestones.
Under the Eisai Agreement as amended, should a product covered by the licensed technology be commercialized, we will be obligated to pay to Eisai royalties in a variable mid-single digit range based on net sales of the product on a country-by-country basis. The royalty rate will be reduced, on a country-by-country basis, at such time as the last remaining valid claim in the licensed patents expires, lapses or is invalidated and the product is not covered by data protection clauses. In addition, the royalty rate will be reduced, on a country-by-country basis, if, in addition to the conditions specified in the previous sentence, lawful generic versions of such product account for more than a specified minimum percentage of the total sales of all products that contain the licensed compound during a calendar quarter. The latest licensed patent is expected to expire, barring any extension thereof, on August 18, 2026.
We were also granted the right to sublicense with prior written approval from Eisai. If we sublicense the licensed technology to a third party, we will be obligated to pay Eisai, in addition to the milestone fees referenced above, a fixed low 
17

double digit percentage of certain fees we receive from such sublicensee in addition to royalties in the low single digit range based on net sales of the sublicensee. 
The license agreement expires on a country-by-country basis on the later of (1) the date the last remaining valid claim in the licensed patents expires, lapses or is invalidated in that country, the product is not covered by data protection clauses, and the sales of lawful generic versions of the product account for more than a specified percentage of the total sales of all pharmaceutical products containing the licensed compound in that country, or (2) a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed products in such country, unless it is sooner terminated.
We can terminate the license agreement, with respect to the entire territory, with prior notice to Eisai if we reasonably determine that the medical/scientific, technical, regulatory or commercial profile of the licensed product does not justify continued development or marketing. 
Eisai can terminate the license agreement, on a country-by-country basis, at any time prior to the date on which we have submitted for either an NDA approval or EMA marketing approval with respect to a licensed product, upon prior written notice to us, if Eisai makes a good faith determination, in accordance with certain provisions specified in the agreement, that we have not used commercially reasonable efforts to develop the licensed product in the territory. Either party may also terminate the agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. Eisai may terminate the license agreement, with prior written notice, in the event of certain changes of control involving us, if Eisai reasonably determines that the entity assuming control of us is not able to perform under the license agreement with the same degree of skill and diligence that we would use. Eisai shall further have the right to terminate if the acquiring entity has any material and active litigations with Eisai, or is a hostile takeover bidder against us.
Supply and Manufacturing Agreements
In June 2016, we entered into a Supply Agreement with Ypsomed, or the Ypsomed Supply Agreement, pursuant to which Ypsomed agreed to supply commercial and clinical supplies of a disposable pen injection device customized for subcutaneous injection of abaloparatide, or the Device. We agreed to purchase a minimum number of Devices at prices per Device that decrease with an increase in quantity supplied. In addition, we agreed to make milestone payments for Ypsomed’s capital developments in connection with the initiation of the commercial supply of the Device and to pay a one-time capacity fee. All costs and payments under the Ypsomed Supply Agreement are delineated in Swiss Francs. 
The Ypsomed Supply Agreement has an initial term of three years from the earlier of the date of delivery of the first commercial batch of Devices after regulatory approval or June 1, 2017, after which, it automatically renews for two-year terms until terminated. We or Ypsomed may terminate the agreement at any time by providing notice to the other party 18 months prior to the end of the then-current term. The agreement may also be terminated by either party upon material breach of the agreement, due to a party’s bankruptcy, insolvency, or dissolution, or due to a change of control of either party under certain circumstances. We may terminate the agreement in the event that Ypsomed is unable to obtain regulatory or other approval for the manufacture and sale of Devices or if such approval is revoked. During the initial term of the agreement, we estimate that we will be obligated to make total minimum payments to Ypsomed of approximately CHF 3.9 million ($4.0 million) in the aggregate, including the milestone payments and one-time capacity fee.
In June 2016, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement, or the Vetter Supply Agreement, with Vetter Pharma International, GmbH, or Vetter, pursuant to which Vetter has agreed to formulate the finished abaloparatide-SC drug product containing the API of abaloparatide, to fill cartridges with the drug product, to assemble the pen delivery device, and to package and label the pen for commercial distribution. We agreed to purchase the cartridges and pens in specified batch sizes at a price per unit. For labeling and packaging services, we agreed to pay a per unit price dependent upon the number of pens loaded with cartridges that are labeled and packaged. These prices are subject to an annual price adjustment. The Vetter Supply Agreement has an initial term of five years, which began on January 1, 2016, after which, it automatically renews for two-year terms unless either party notifies the other party two years before the end of the then-current term that it does not intend to renew. 
Vetter may terminate the Vetter Supply Agreement effective upon written notice to us if we fail to maintain certain insurance required under the agreement, or breach provisions regarding ethical business practices, laws, and regulations. We may terminate the agreement effective upon written notice to Vetter if: (1) Vetter fails to obtain or maintain any material governmental licenses or approvals, (2) Vetter has breached provisions regarding ethical business practices, laws, and regulations, or (3) we fail to obtain certain regulatory approvals. Either party may terminate the agreement due to: (1) the other party’s bankruptcy or insolvency, (2) the other party’s uncured breach of the agreement, (3) a continuing force majeure event, or (4) a failure to reach mutual agreement on a change in the scope of work or services that Vetter reasonably believes it cannot perform because the change is in violation of applicable law.
18

In July 2016, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement, or the Manufacturing Agreement, with PPL, as successor-in-interest to Lonza, pursuant to which PPL has agreed to manufacture the commercial and clinical supplies of the API for abaloparatide. We agreed to purchase the API in batches at a price per gram in euros, subject to an annual increase by PPL. We are also required to purchase a minimum number of batches annually. The Manufacturing Agreement has an initial term of six years, after which, it automatically renews for three-year terms unless either party provides notice of non-renewal 24 months before the end of the then-current term. 
PPL may terminate the agreement for any reason upon 30-months’ notice. We may terminate the Manufacturing Agreement for any reason upon 24-months’ notice, if we fail to obtain regulatory marketing approval for abaloparatide upon 12-months’ notice to PPL, or if abaloparatide is withdrawn from the market upon 12-months’ notice to PPL. Either party may terminate the agreement for the other's uncured breach of the agreement due to a party’s bankruptcy, insolvency, or dissolution, or due to certain force majeure events.
Government Regulation
United States—FDA Process
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution and marketing, among other things, of our product candidates are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, imposition of clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecution. We expect abaloparatide, RAD1901 and RAD140 will each be subject to review by the FDA as a drug pursuant to the NDA process, and we currently only have active IND applications in relation to abaloparatide, RAD1901 and RAD140 in the United States.
Approval Process—None of our drugs may be marketed in the United States until the drug has received FDA approval of an NDA. The steps required to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include, among others:

• | preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA's Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually;


• | adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication to FDA's satisfaction;


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more clinical trial site(s) at which the drug was studied in a clinical trial(s) to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, regulations;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA based on a determination that the drug is safe and effective for the proposed indication(s).

Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND application will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND application. In such a case, the IND application sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be sure that submission of an IND application will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin.
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators. Clinical trials are conducted under GCP pursuant to protocols detailing the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as 
19

part of the IND application. Detailed information about many clinical trials must be submitted to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public disclosure on the government website ClinicalTrials.gov. 
Clinical trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the Phases may overlap. The study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, for each institution where the trials will be conducted, and each IRB must monitor the study until completion. Study subjects must provide informed consent and sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical testing also must satisfy the extensive GCP regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
Phase 1 usually involves the initial introduction of the investigational drug into people to evaluate its short-term safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, pharmacokinetics and pharmacologic actions, and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. Phase 1 studies are usually conducted in healthy individuals and are not intended to treat disease or illness. However, Phase 1b studies are conducted in healthy volunteers or in patients diagnosed with the disease or condition for which the study drug is intended, who present some biomarker, surrogate, or possibly clinical outcome that could be considered for "proof of concept." Proof of concept in a Phase 1b study typically confirms the hypothesis that the current prediction of biomarker, or outcome benefit is compatible with the mechanism of action.
Phase 2 usually involves trials in a limited patient population to: (1) evaluate dosage tolerance and appropriate dosage, (2) identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, and (3) evaluate preliminarily the efficacy of the drug for specific target indications. Several different doses of the drug may be looked at in Phase 2 to see which dose has the desired effects. Patients are monitored for side effects and for any improvement in their illness, symptoms, or both.
Phase 3 trials usually further evaluate clinical efficacy and test further for safety by using the drug in its planned commercial form in an expanded patient population. A Phase 3 trial usually compares how well the study drug works compared with an inactive placebo and/or another approved medication. One group of patients may receive the investigational new drug being tested, while another group of patients may receive the comparator drug (already approved drug for the disease being studied), or placebo. Phase 3 trials typically are relied upon as the primary basis for approval because they provide the safety and effectiveness information needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to create the physician labeling.
There can be no assurance that Phase 1, Phase 2 or Phase 3 testing will be completed successfully within any specified period of time, if at all. Furthermore, we or the FDA or an Institutional Review Board, or IRB, (with respect to a particular study site) may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
In addition, clinical trial sponsors are required to register and report results from certain applicable clinical trials for publication on www.clinicaltrials.gov. Until recently, disclosure of clinical trial results for unapproved drugs could be delayed until approval of the drug. The Department of Health and Human Services recently broadened these reporting requirements to also apply to unapproved drugs, regardless of whether FDA approval is or will be sought. The allowable delay period for submitting results for applicable clinical trials of unapproved drugs is one year after the primary completion date of the study, and potentially an additional two years beyond that after submission of a certification; in any event, not to exceed three years in total. Consequently, clinical trial information could be subject to posting even if a drug is not approved and does not make it to market.
Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more proposed indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Unless the applicant qualifies for an exemption, the filing of an NDA typically must be accompanied by a substantial payment to the FDA, referred to as a "user fee," which currently exceeds $2 million. The FDA reviews the application and may deem it to be inadequate, and companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee, but the Agency historically has tended to follow such recommendations.
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing drugs and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints. Generally, drugs that may be eligible for one or more of these programs are those intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs for those disease or conditions, and those that provide meaningful benefit over existing treatments. For example, a sponsor may be granted FDA 
20

designation of a drug candidate as a "breakthrough therapy" if the drug candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will take actions to help expedite the development and review of such drug. From time to time, we anticipate applying for such programs where we believe we meet the applicable FDA criteria. A company cannot be sure that any of its drugs will qualify for any of these programs, or even if a drug does qualify, that the review time will be reduced.
In addition to the existing programs described above, additional measures intended to expedite drug product development and review were also included in the 21st Century Cures Act, or Cures Act. The Cures Act, which was enacted in December 2016, includes provisions intended to enhance and accelerate the FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs. These provisions include (1) requirements that FDA establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy post-approval study requirements, (2) requirements that FDA issue guidance for purposes of assisting sponsors in incorporating complex adaptive and other novel trial designs into proposed clinical protocols and applications for new drugs, and (3) authorizing FDA to rely upon qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application with respect to a qualified indication for an already approved drug.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing and production and testing facilities are in compliance with cGMP regulations. If the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed acceptable by the FDA, it may issue an approval letter, and, if not, the agency may issue a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication(s). A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. Such a letter usually describes all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in an NDA that must be satisfactorily addressed before it can be approved. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also require, as a condition of NDA approval, post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug's safety or efficacy, or impose other conditions. Approval may also be contingent on a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, that limits the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling, development of adequate controls and specifications, or a commitment to conduct one or more post-marketing studies or clinical trials. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market.
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain additional approvals from the FDA. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any investigational product candidate will be approved on a timely basis, or at all.
Post-Approval Requirements—Often times, even after a drug has been approved by the FDA for sale, the FDA may require that certain post-approval requirements be satisfied, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. If such post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to, among other requirements: (1) report certain adverse reactions to the FDA within specific time frames, (2) comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products, (3) continue to have quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to cGMP regulations after approval, (4) make periodic reports to FDA about the approved product, and (5) comply with requirements regarding distribution of the drug product. The FDA periodically inspects the sponsor's records related to safety reporting, distribution and/or manufacturing facilities; this latter effort includes assessment of ongoing compliance with cGMP regulations. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. We have used and intend to continue to use third-party manufacturers to produce our products in clinical and commercial quantities, and future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, including recall or withdrawal of the product from the market, labeling changes, imposition of REMS, or the requirement to conduct additional studies.
Hatch-Waxman Act-Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of pioneer (brand name) drug products under section 505(j) of the FDCA. Section 505(j) provides for approval of an abbreviated new drug application, or 
21

ANDA, that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved drug (commonly known as the reference drug). In considering whether to approve such a generic drug product, the FDA requires that an ANDA applicant demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic drug product's active ingredient is the same as that of the reference product, that the proposed generic is bioequivalent to the reference product, that any impurities in the proposed product do not affect the product's safety or effectiveness, and that its manufacturing processes and methods ensure the consistent potency and purity of its proposed product. In addition to the ANDA pathway, the Hatch-Waxman Act also established an abbreviated approval pathway under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA for applications that contain full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness, but where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. Section 505(b)(2) permits approval of applications other than those for duplicate products and permits reliance for such approvals on literature or on FDA’s finding of safety or effectiveness for an approved drug product.
The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of data exclusivity for new chemical entities, or NCE, referred to as NCE exclusivity, which generally (except as discussed below) prevents the FDA from accepting ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications containing the protected active ingredient or active moiety for five years after initial approval of the NCE. A drug is a NCE if the FDA has not previously approved an NDA for another drug that contains the same active moiety, which FDA defines to mean the molecule or ion (excluding certain specified appended portions) responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. We believe abaloparatide qualifies as an NCE and thus expect to be eligible for five years of NCE exclusivity following any FDA approval of abaloparatide-SC. Under FDA’s “umbrella policy,” NCE exclusivity protects all drug products that contain the qualifying NCE, so if abaloparatide-TD is approved prior to the expiration to any NCE exclusivity granted to abaloparatide-SC, we would expect abaloparatide-TD to be protected by any remaining NCE exclusivity period.
The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of exclusivity for applications (including supplements) containing the results of new clinical investigations (other than bioavailability studies) essential to the FDA's approval of new versions or conditions of use of previously approved drug products, such as new indications, delivery mechanisms, dosage forms, strengths, or other conditions of use. For example, if abaloparatide-SC is approved for commercialization and we are successful in performing a clinical trial of abaloparatide-TD that provides a new basis for approval (a different delivery mechanism) and that FDA considers essential to approval of the drug, it is possible that we may become eligible for a three-year period of market exclusivity for approval of an NDA for abaloparatide-TD. Any such three-year exclusivity period would protect against the approval (but not the filing) of ANDAs and 505(b)(2) applications referencing abaloparatide-TD for the protected transdermal route of administration. Such exclusivity period for abaloparatide-TD would generally not, however, prohibit the FDA from accepting or approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) applications referencing only abaloparatide-SC or 505(b)(2) applications that reference abaloparatide-TD but that seek approval for a different route of administration or for a use other than for the indication that has been approved for abaloparatide-TD. 
The Hatch-Waxman Act requires NDA applicants and NDA holders to submit certain information about patents related to their drugs for listing in the FDA's list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book). ANDA and 505(b)(2) applicants generally must submit a certification or statement regarding each of the patents listed with the FDA for the reference product. A certification that a listed patent is invalid and/or will not be infringed by the marketing of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant's product is called a "Paragraph IV certification." If the sponsor of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application that references a drug with unexpired exclusivity provides a Paragraph IV certification for a patent for a reference product that is protected by NCE exclusivity, then the FDA may accept the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application beginning four years after approval of the reference product's NDA (rather than five years). If an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application containing a Paragraph IV certification is submitted to the FDA and accepted as a reviewable filing by the Agency, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant then must provide, within 20 days of FDA acceptance, notice to the NDA holder and patent owner stating that the application has been submitted and providing the factual and legal basis for the applicant's opinion that the patent is invalid and/or not infringed. The NDA holder or patent owner then may file suit against the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant for patent infringement. If this is done within 45 days of receiving notice of the Paragraph IV certification, a 30-month stay of the FDA's ability to approve the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is triggered. The 30-month stay begins on the date of receipt of the Paragraph IV notice and, in the case where an ANDA or 505(b)(2) application is submitted before a reference product's NCE exclusivity expires (i.e., four years after approval of the reference product), the 30-month period is extended to ensure that approval of the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application cannot be granted for 7 1/2 years after initial approval of the reference product. Nevertheless, the FDA may approve the proposed product before the expiration of the 30-month stay (or 7 1/2 year period) if a court finds the patent invalid and/or not infringed or if the court shortens the period because the parties have failed to cooperate in expediting the litigation.

European Union—EMA Process
In the European Union, medicinal products are authorized following a similar demanding process as that required in the United States and applications are based on the ICH Common Technical Document. In the European Economic Area, or EEA (comprised of 28 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), medicines can be authorized by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures.
Centralized procedure—Under the centralized procedure, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the EMA. The CHMP then carries out a scientific assessment of the application and issues an opinion as to whether or not the medicine should be marketed. Following the issuance of the CHMP's opinion, the European Commission decides whether or not to grant a marketing authorization valid across the EEA. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines derived from certain biotechnology processes, advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), medicines containing a new active substance and which are indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, or neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and officially designated orphan medicines. The centralized procedure is optional for applicants seeking marketing authorizations for medicines which contain a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization via the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health in the EEA. In November 2015, we submitted an MAA for abaloparatide-SC to the EMA under the centralized procedure. The MAA was validated in December 2015 and is currently undergoing regulatory review by the EMA.
National authorization procedures—There are also two other possible routes to authorize medicinal products in several countries, which are available for products that fall outside the scope of the centralized procedure:

• | Decentralized procedure. Using the decentralized procedure, an applicant may apply for simultaneous authorization in more than one EU country of a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized anywhere in the European Union and that does not fall within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. The applicant selects on of the countries in which it is seeking a marketing authorization to act as a Reference Member State. 


• | Mutual recognition procedure. In the mutual recognition procedure, a medicine is first authorized in one EU Member State (the Reference Member State), in accordance with the national procedures of that country. Thereafter, further marketing authorizations can be sought from other EU countries in a procedure whereby the countries concerned agree to recognize the validity of the original, national marketing authorization. 

Under both procedures, the Reference Member State submits its evaluation of the product to the other countries where national authorizations are being sought (Concerned Members States). The Concerned Member States review the evaluation and reach consensus as to whether or not to approve the application. If the application is successful, then each country issues its own national authorization for the product.
Decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the European Union are based upon national rules subject to the control of the Transparency Directive (Council Directive 89/105/EEC). The Transparency Directive defines a series of procedural requirements designed to verify that national pricing and reimbursement decisions do not create obstacles to the pharmaceutical trade within the EU's Internal Market. Subject to the control of the Transparency Directive, there is no binding policy at the EU level governing pricing and reimbursement, and the 28 EU Member States each have their own, often varying, approaches and policies such a price control, profit control, international price comparisons, and reference pricing. In many EU Member States, pricing negotiations must take place between the holder of the marketing authorization and the competent national authorities before the cost of the product can be funded within national healthcare schemes. The holder of the marketing authorization is usually required, in order to get support for reimbursement under national health schemes and, therefore, practical access to the market, to provide evidence demonstrating the cost-effectiveness or otherwise added value benefit of its product in comparison with directly and indirectly competing products, a procedure commonly referred to as a health technology assessment. 
We have reviewed our development program, proposed Phase 3 study design, and overall non-clinical and clinical data package and believe they support future regulatory approval of abaloparatide-SC in the European Union.
Good manufacturing practices—Like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the EU Member States and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacturing of pharmaceutical and biologic products. Prior to the CHMP adopting an opinion with respect to approvability of an application for marketing authorization, the EMA, acting upon the advice of the CHMP, may decide to coordinate an inspection of the proposed manufacturing site in order to verify the manufacturer's compliance with EU GMP principles and guidelines or to investigate a specific matter arising from the assessment of the application. If there is a material change in manufacturing equipment, 
23

location, or process, affecting the quality of the product, additional regulatory review and approval may be required from the relevant competent regulatory authority. Once we or our partners commercialize products, we will be required to comply with GMP, and product-specific requirements as set out in the terms of the marketing authorization enforced by, the European Commission, the EMA and the competent authorities of EU Member States following the grant of marketing authorization. Also like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the EU Member States and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If it is determined that the equipment, facilities, or processes used to manufacture our product do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, or enforcement actions and/or remedies against us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations or the withdrawal of our product from the market.
Data and Market Exclusivity—Similar to the United States, there is a process for approval of generic versions of innovator drug products in the European Union. Abridged applications for the authorization of generic versions of drugs authorized by EMA can be submitted to the EMA through the centralized procedure referencing the innovator's data and demonstrating bioequivalence to the reference product, among other things.
New medicinal products in the EU can receive eight years of data exclusivity coupled with two years of market exclusivity, and a potential one year extension of market exclusivity, if the marketing authorizations holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications that demonstrates "significant clinical benefit" in comparison with existing therapies. We expect to be eligible for at least ten years of exclusivity (8 years of data exclusivity + 2 years of market exclusivity) following any approval of abaloparatide-SC. At this time, we do not believe that there are orphan or pediatric applications for abaloparatide that would be likely to result in a grant of exclusivity or supplemental protection certificate in the European Union.
Abridged applications cannot rely on an innovator's data until after expiry of the 8-year data exclusivity term; applications for a generic product can be submitted after that 8th year, but the product cannot be marketed until the end of the market exclusivity term.
Other International Markets—Drug approval process
In some international markets (e.g., China or Japan), although data generated in U.S. or EU trials may be submitted in support of a marketing authorization application, additional clinical trials conducted in the host territory, or studying people of the ethnicity of the host territory, may be required prior to the filing or approval of marketing applications within the country.
Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and internationally, sales of products that we market in the future, and our ability to generate revenues on such sales, are dependent, in significant part, on the availability and level of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors such as state and federal governments, managed care providers and private insurance plans. Private insurers, such as health maintenance organizations and managed care providers, have implemented cost-cutting and reimbursement initiatives and likely will continue to do so in the future. These include establishing formularies that govern the drugs and biologics that will be offered and also the out-of-pocket obligations of member patients for such products. In addition, particularly in the United States and increasingly in other countries, we may be required to provide discounts and pay rebates to state and federal governments and agencies in connection with purchases of our products that are reimbursed by such entities. It is possible that future legislation in the United States and other jurisdictions could be enacted which could potentially impact the reimbursement rates for the products we are developing and may develop in the future and also could further impact the levels of discounts and rebates paid to federal and state government entities. Any legislation that impacts these areas could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products that, if successfully developed, we bring to market.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, or MMA, established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities to provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Parts A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each Part D prescription drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, although not necessarily all of the drugs within each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. We anticipate that a significant proportion of patients eligible for abaloparatide-SC will be Medicare beneficiaries and we expect that abaloparatide-SC, if approved, will be covered under Medicare Part D, although 
24

we cannot assure you that Part D prescription drug plan sponsors will cover abaloparatide-SC, or, if covered, at what tier or level.
Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, although the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payers often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Accordingly, any reduction in payment under Medicare may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payers.
We expect that there will continue to be a number of federal and state proposals to implement governmental pricing controls and limit the growth of healthcare costs, including the cost of prescription drugs. Currently, Medicare is prohibited from negotiating directly with pharmaceutical companies for drugs. However, the U.S. Congress may in the future consider legislation that would lift the ban on federal negotiations.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 provides funding for the federal government to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same illness. A plan for the research would be developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and the National Institutes of Health, and periodic reports on the status of the research and related expenditures would be made to the U.S. Congress. Although the results of the comparative effectiveness studies are not intended to mandate coverage policies for public or private payers, it is not clear whether research would have any effect on the sales of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved, if the product or the condition that it is intended to treat becomes the subject of a study. It is also possible that comparative effectiveness research demonstrating benefits of a competitor's product could adversely affect the sales of any of our products that is successfully developed and approved. If third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or the ACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, is expected to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA expands coverage for the uninsured while at the same time containing overall healthcare costs. Among other things, the ACA expands and increases industry rebates for drugs covered under Medicaid programs and make changes to the coverage requirements under the Medicare Part D program. In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. Any such legislative changes associated with healthcare reform, including the ACA, may have a significant impact on drug pricing, and could limit pricing flexibility or expand rebate liabilities of drug manufacturers.
On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation's automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, was enacted, which among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers.
Decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the European Union are based upon national rules subject to the control of the Transparency Directive, which aims to ensure the transparency of measures established by EU countries to control the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products. It defines a series of procedural requirements designed to verify that national pricing and reimbursement decisions do not create obstacles to the pharmaceutical trade within the EU's Internal Market. The competent authorities of each of the 28 EU Member States have adopted individual strategies regulating the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in their territory. These strategies often vary widely in nature, scope and application. However, a major element that they have in common is an increased move toward reduction in the reimbursement price of medicinal products, a reduction in the number and type of products selected for reimbursement, and an increased preference for generic products over innovative products. These efforts have mostly been executed through these countries' existing price-control methodologies, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). It is increasingly common in many EU Member States for Marketing Authorization Holders to be required, in order to get support for reimbursement under national health schemes and, therefore, access to the market, to demonstrate the cost effectiveness or otherwise added value benefit of their products as compared to products already subject to pricing and reimbursement in specific countries. In order for drugs to be evaluated positively under such criteria, pharmaceutical companies may need to re-examine, and consider 
25

altering, a number of traditional functions relating to the selection, study, and management of drugs, whether currently marketed, under development, or being evaluated as candidates for research and/or development.
Future legislation, including the current versions being considered at the federal and state level in the United States and at the national level in EU Member States, or regulatory actions implementing recent or future legislation may have a significant effect on our business. Our ability to successfully commercialize products depends in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available in the United States and worldwide from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Substantial uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products by third-party payors. In addition, negotiating prices with government authorities under current and proposed legislation can delay the commercialization of our product candidates.
Sales and Marketing
The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. Generally, a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the FDA following review and approval of an NDA. Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug's labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties, and often reflect a physician's belief that the off-label use is the best treatment for the patients. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments, but FDA regulations and enforcement policies do impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers' communications regarding off-label uses. In addition, the FDA also regulates communications about investigational drugs, including with respect to the pre-approval promotion of investigational drugs. Recent case law suggests that pharmaceutical companies may have a First Amendment right to provide truthful and non-misleading information about off-label uses of their products to physicians and others, but the scope of this right remains unclear. Accordingly, failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements may subject a company to adverse publicity, enforcement action by the FDA, corrective advertising, consent decrees and the full range of civil and criminal penalties available to the FDA.
We may also be subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare "fraud and abuse," including anti-kickback laws and false claims laws. Anti-kickback laws make it illegal for a prescription drug manufacturer to solicit, offer, receive, or pay any remuneration in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase or prescription of a particular drug. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations and very few court decisions addressing industry practices, it is possible that our practices might be challenged under anti-kickback or similar laws. Moreover, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA permits the government to assert that a claim that includes items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. False claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment, to third-party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed, or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products, if approved, may be subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees, including criminal sanctions against executive officers under the so-called "responsible corporate officer" doctrine, even in situations where the executive officer did not intend to violate the law and was unaware of any wrongdoing.
Given the significant penalties and fines that can be imposed on companies and individuals if convicted, allegations of such violations often result in settlements even if the company or individual being investigated admits no wrongdoing. Settlements often include significant civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and corporate integrity agreements. If the government were to allege or convict us or our executive officers of violating these laws, our business could be harmed. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring similar actions. The majority of states also have anti-kickback and false claims laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. Our activities could be subject to challenge for the reasons discussed above and due to the broad scope of these laws and the increasing attention being given to them by law enforcement authorities.
There has also been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The ACA, among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their 
26

immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for "knowing failures"), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers are required to submit reports to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. Many of these laws contain ambiguities as to what is required to comply with the laws. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our actions could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent state authorities.
Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of medicinal products in the EU and other countries. Laws (including those governing promotion, marketing and anti-kickback provisions), industry regulations and professional codes of conduct often are strictly enforced. Even in those countries where we are not directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our products, inappropriate activity by our international distribution partners can have adverse implications for us.
Other Laws and Regulatory Processes
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the United States, including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of the NASDAQ Global Market or any national securities exchange on which our capital stock may be traded. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, the SEC and other bodies that have jurisdiction over the form and content of our accounts, our consolidated financial statements and other public disclosure are constantly discussing and interpreting proposals and existing pronouncements designed to ensure that companies best display relevant and transparent information relating to their respective businesses.
Our international operations are subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, clinical research organizations, vendors or other agents.
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we employed 229 full-time employees and 8 part-time employees, 39 of whom held Ph.D. or M.D. degrees. 107 of our employees were engaged in research and development activities and 130 were engaged in support administration, including business development and finance. Of our 130 employees engaged in support administration, 69 are part of the organization we are building to support the potential commercialization of abaloparatide-SC in the United States. We use and intend to continue using CROs and other third parties to perform our clinical studies and manufacturing.
Corporate Information
We were incorporated in the state of Delaware on February 4, 2008 under the name MPM Acquisition Corp. In May 2011, we entered into a reverse merger transaction, or the Merger, with our predecessor, Radius Health, Inc., a Delaware corporation formed on October 3, 2003, or the Former Operating Company, pursuant to which the Former Operating Company became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. Immediately following the Merger, the Former Operating Company was merged with and into us and we assumed the business of the Former Operating Company and changed our name to Radius Health, Inc.
Legal Proceedings
In November 2016, we received notice that in October 2016, Ipsen had initiated arbitration proceedings against us in the International Chamber of Commerce’s International Court of Arbitration. Ipsen’s Request for Arbitration alleges that we breached various provisions of the License Agreement concerning abaloparatide, including with regard to Ipsen's right to co-promote abaloparatide in France and a license from us with respect to Japan. Ipsen seeks declaratory relief, compliance with the License Agreement, damages, costs and fees as a result of the purported breaches, and alleges the monetary value of these claims is approximately €50 million.
27

In January 2017, we submitted an Answer denying Ipsen’s claims and alleging counterclaims against Ipsen for breach of the License Agreement and other declaratory judgment. We asserted, among other things, that Ipsen's claimed rights to co-promote abaloparatide in France and to a license from us with respect to Japan have permanently expired, and that Ipsen has breached the License Agreement by, among other things, allowing certain patents to expire and by purporting to license to a third party certain manufacturing and other rights that we contend Ipsen exclusively licensed to us. We are seeking dismissal of Ipsen’s claims, as well as declaratory relief, compliance with the License Agreement, and other damages, costs and fees to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. 
In February 2017, Ipsen submitted a Reply denying our counterclaims and alleging that we are precluded from asserting them. Given that this matter is at a preliminary stage, we cannot predict or assess the likely outcome of these proceedings.
