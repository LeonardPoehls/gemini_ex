Item 1. Business. 
Organization 
 New York REIT, Inc. (the Company) was incorporated on October 6, 2009 as a Maryland corporation that qualified as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes (REIT) beginning with its taxable year ended December 31, 2010. On April 15, 2014, the Company listed its common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol NYRT. 
 The Company purchased its first property and commenced active operations in June 2010. As of December 31, 2017, the Company owned 14 properties, aggregating 1.7 million rentable square feet, with an average occupancy of 97.6%. The Companys portfolio primarily consists of office and retail properties, representing 76% and 10%, respectively, of rentable square feet as of December 31, 2017. The Company also owns a hotel and one stand alone parking garage. Properties other than office and retail spaces represent 14% of rentable square feet. 
 As of February 28, 2018, the Company has sold, or entered into firm contracts to sell, all of its properties except for the remaining 50.1% interest in Worldwide Plaza, the Viceroy Hotel and the 33 West 56th Street Garage. The Company currently expects the 33 West 56th Street Garage will be sold during the second quarter of 2018 and that the Viceroy Hotel will have a signed purchase and sale contract by the end of the second quarter of 2018, although there can be no assurance that either one of these events will take place in this time frame. Also as of February 28, 2018, the Company has combined debt outstanding of $57.2 million and the Company has paid aggregate cash liquidating distributions of $851.4 million, or $5.07 per share. 
 Substantially all of the Companys business is conducted through its operating partnership, New York Recovery Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the OP). The Companys only significant asset is the general partnership interests it owns in the OP and assets held by the Company for the use and benefit of the OP. 
 On August 22, 2016, the Companys Board of Directors (the Board) approved a plan of liquidation to sell in an orderly manner all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its OP and to liquidate and dissolve the Company and the OP (the Liquidation Plan), subject to stockholder approval. The Liquidation Plan was approved at a special meeting of stockholders on January 3, 2017. 
 The Company has no employees. Prior to March 8, 2017, the Company retained (i) New York Recovery Advisors, LLC (the Former Advisor) to manage its affairs on a day-to-day basis and (ii) New York Recovery Properties, LLC (the ARG Property Manager) to serve as the Companys property manager, except for properties where services were performed by a third party. The Former Advisor and ARG Property Manager are under common control with AR Global Investments, LLC (the successor business to AR Capital, LLC, AR Global), (the Sponsor). 
 On March 8, 2017, the Company transferred all advisory duties from the Former Advisor to Winthrop REIT Advisors, LLC (the Winthrop Advisor) and property management services with respect to properties managed by ARG Property Manager were transferred to Winthrop Management, L.P. (the Winthrop Property Manager). 
 Liquidation Plan 
 The Liquidation Plan, as amended by the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms of the Liquidation Plan, provides for an orderly sale of the Companys assets, payment of the Companys liabilities and other

DECEMBER 31, 2017 
 
 obligations and the winding down of operations and final dissolution of the Company. Under the Liquidation Plan, the Company is not permitted to make any new investments except for the exercise of its option (the WWP Option) to purchase additional equity interests in its WWP Holdings, LLC venture (WWP), which was exercised on June 1, 2017 and enter into the transaction relating to Worldwide Plaza pursuant to the Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with a purchaser, a joint venture between an affiliate of SL Green Realty Corp. (SLG) and a private equity fund sponsored by RXR Realty LLC, which closed on October 18, 2017 or to make protective acquisitions or advances with respect to its existing assets (see Note 6). The Company is permitted to satisfy any existing contractual obligations and fund required tenant improvements and capital expenditures at its real estate properties, including real estate properties owned by joint ventures in which the Company owns an interest. 
 The Liquidation Plan enables the Company to sell any and all of its assets without further approval of the stockholders and provides that liquidating distributions be made to the stockholders as determined by the Board. Pursuant to applicable REIT rules, the Company must complete the disposition of its assets by January 3, 2019, two years after the date the Liquidation Plan was approved by the stockholders, in order to deduct liquidating distributions as dividends. To the extent that all of the Companys assets are not sold by such date, the Company intends to satisfy the requirement by converting the Company to a limited liability company, which will require shareholder approval. 
 The dissolution process and the amount and timing of distributions to stockholders involves risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, it is not possible to predict the timing or aggregate amount which will be ultimately distributed to stockholders and no assurance can be given that the distributions will equal or exceed the estimate of net assets presented in the Consolidated Statement of Net Assets. 
 The Company expects to continue to qualify as a REIT throughout the liquidation until such time as any remaining assets, if any, are transferred into a liquidating entity. The Board shall use commercially reasonable efforts to continue to cause the Company to maintain its REIT status, provided however, the Board may elect to terminate the Companys status as a REIT if it determines that such termination would be in the best interest of the stockholders. 
 The Board may terminate the Liquidation Plan without stockholder approval only (i) if the Board approves the Company entering into an agreement involving the sale or other disposition of all or substantially all of the assets or common stock by merger, consolidation, share exchange, business combination, sale or other transaction involving the Company or (ii) if the Board determines, in exercise of its duties under Maryland law, after consultation with its advisor, which is Winthrop Advisor, and its financial advisor, if applicable, or other third party experts familiar with the market for Manhattan office properties, that an adverse change in the market for Manhattan office properties has occurred and reasonably would expect it to adversely affect continuing with the Liquidation Plan. Notwithstanding approval of the Liquidation Plan by the stockholders, the Board may amend the Liquidation Plan without further action by the stockholders to the extent permitted under the current law. 
 Sales Pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation 
 Subsequent to the adoption of the Plan of Liquidation, excluding the partial sale of Worldwide Plaza, the Company sold six properties for an aggregate purchase price of $1.325 billion during 2017 and five properties for an aggregate purchase price of $361.9 million to date in 2018. Also in 2017, the Company sold a 48.7% interest

 Indebtedness 
 As of December 31, 2017, we had combined debt of $215.5 million, including the POL Loans described below and $601.2 million of unconsolidated mortgage debt reflecting our pro rata share of Worldwide Plazas total mortgage debt of $1.2 billion, with a weighted average interest rate equal to 4.3% per annum and a weighted average term to maturity of 7.5 years. Approximately $197.2 million of this debt matures prior to January 3, 2019, the 24-month anniversary of stockholder approval of the Liquidation Plan. As a result of pay downs subsequent to year end, we had $57.2 million of combined debt, inclusive of $41.3 million outstanding under the POL Loan as of February 28, 2018. 
 On December 20, 2016, the Company, through indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of the OP, entered into a mortgage loan (the Mortgage Loan) in the aggregate amount of $500.0 million and a mezzanine loan in the aggregate amount of $260.0 million (the Mezzanine Loan and, together with the Mortgage Loan, the POL Loans). The POL Loans were initially secured directly, in the case of the mortgage loan, and indirectly in the case of the mezzanine loan, by our properties located in New York, New York at 245-249 West 17th Street, 333 West 34th Street, 216-218 West 18th Street, 50 Varick Street, 229 West 36th Street, 122 Greenwich Street, 350 West 42nd Street, 382-384 Bleecker Street, 350 Bleecker Street, 416-425 Washington Street, 33 West 56th Street and 120 West 57th Street (the POL Loan Properties). Each of the POL Loan Properties has a corresponding allocated loan amount which must be repaid upon the sale of the property in order to release the property as collateral for the POL Loans. Properties sold during 2017 and to date in 2018 have been released and are no longer collateral for the POL Loans. 
 On December 20, 2017, the POL Loans were extended through September 30, 2018 and the Mezzanine Loan balance of $91.6 million was repaid. The Company paid an extension fee of $0.4 million. At December 31, 2017 the Mortgage Loan has an outstanding principal amount of $176.2 million and requires monthly interest payments at a weighted average interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.50%. 
 Tax Status 
 We elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT under Sections 856 through 860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code), effective for our taxable year ended December 31, 2010. We believe 
 
9 


 NEW YORK REIT, INC. 
 FORM 10-K
DECEMBER 31, 2017 
 
 that, commencing with such taxable year, we have been organized and operated in a manner so that we qualify for taxation as a REIT under the Code. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner during our liquidation process, but no assurance can be given that we will operate in a manner so as to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. Despite having adopted the Liquidation Plan, in order to continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT we must, among other things, continue to distribute annually at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net income as calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP)) determined without regard for the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, and must comply with a number of other organizational and operational requirements until we have completely liquidated. If we continue to qualify for taxation as a REIT, we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income that we distribute to our stockholders. Even if we qualify for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and properties as well as federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income. 
Competition 
 The New York City real estate market is highly competitive and there are many competing properties in the New York MSA. With respect to the assets that we own, we compete for tenants based on a number of factors that include location, rental rates, security, suitability of the propertys design to prospective tenants needs and the manner in which the property is operated and marketed. Many competitors have substantially greater marketing budgets and financial resources than we do which could limit our success when we compete with them directly. Competition could have a material effect on our occupancy levels, rental rates and on property operating expenses. We also may compete with other entities advised or sponsored by affiliates of the Winthrop Advisor for tenants. 
 Subsequent to the adoption of the Liquidation Plan we have competition from other properties located in the New York City real estate market both from an operations perspective and with respect to the disposition of our assets. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business and our net assets in liquidation. 
 Regulations 
 Our investments are subject to various federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including, among other things, zoning regulations, land use controls, environmental controls relating to air and water quality, noise pollution and indirect environmental impacts such as increased motor vehicle activity. We believe that we have all permits and approvals necessary under current law to operate our investments. 
Environmental 
 As an owner of real estate, we are subject to various environmental laws of federal, state and local governments. Compliance with existing laws has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, and management does not believe it will have such an impact in the future. However, we cannot predict the impact of unforeseen environmental contingencies or new or changed laws or regulations on properties in which we hold an interest. 
Employees 
 We have no employees. The employees of the Winthrop Advisor and their affiliates perform a full range of real estate services for us, including property management, accounting, asset management and investor relations services.
